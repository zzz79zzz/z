These survivors are experiencing the normal issues of aging, which may be compounded by the long-term effects of having had cancer and cancer therapy. Long-term survivors are at risk for a CRC recurrence (which is less common after the first five years following treatment), a new primary CRC, other cancers, and both short-term and long-term adverse effects of treatment. Additional issues for cancer survivors relate to psychological, reproductive, genetic, social, and employment concerns.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the approach to the long-term adult survivor of CRC during the phase of care that follows the completion of active treatment. A general overview of cancer survivorship and a more detailed discussion of post-treatment surveillance for CRC recurrence following treatment is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16613.html" rel="external">"Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2563742"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO CANCER SURVIVORSHIP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The transition from active treatment to post-treatment care is critical to long-term health. A committee established by the Institute of Medicine to examine the range of medical and psychosocial issues faced by cancer survivors recommended the following components of survivorship care [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16613.html" rel="external">"Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers", section on 'General issues'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Surveillance for cancer recurrence or second cancers; assessment of medical and psychosocial late effects</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prevention of recurrent and new cancers and of other late effects</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of medical and psychosocial late effects and intervention for consequences of cancer and its treatment, for example: medical problems such as bowel problems and sexual dysfunction; symptoms, including pain and fatigue; psychological distress experienced by cancer survivors and their caregivers; and concerns related to employment, insurance, and disability</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coordination between specialists and primary care providers to ensure that all of the survivor's health needs are met</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H889430"><span class="h2">Definitions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are varying definitions and phases of cancer survivorship. The National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] and the National Cancer Institute define a person as a cancer survivor from the moment of a cancer diagnosis through the balance of his or her life. Others have defined phases or "seasons" of survival in cancer patients, including the acute stage (diagnosis and treatment), extended stage (remission and/or maintenance, with a main focus on surveillance for disease recurrence), and permanent stage (long-term survival or "cure," with a focus on long-term risks of treatment and prevention of subsequent diseases) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. For the purpose of this overview, we define a CRC survivor as an individual who has completed treatment (ie, surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy) and who is without evidence of disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H617978414"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CRC SURVIVORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Over one million people are living with a history of CRC in the United States alone, and this population continues to increase. CRC survivors account for 1.4 million (8 percent) of the 18 million cancer survivors living in the United States as of January 2022 [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Cancer is largely a disease of older adults, and the majority of cancer survivors in the United States (approximately 67 percent) are over the age of 65 [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. As a result, CRC survivorship often occurs in a background of comorbid illness [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Further details on the epidemiology of colorectal cancer are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2606.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17400954"><span class="h1">TREATMENT, PROGNOSIS, AND NATURAL HISTORY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15753839"><span class="h2">Overview of treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among newly diagnosed CRCs in the United States, approximately 34 percent of cases are localized at diagnosis, and an additional 37 percent are locoregional (node positive) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The 70 to 80 percent of patients with locoregional CRC at diagnosis are eligible for curative-intent surgery [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. In addition, a minority of the 20 percent of patients who present with metastatic disease may be eligible for curative-intent surgery; this is most likely in those with a limited number of isolated liver or lung metastases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115954.html" rel="external">"Hepatic resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis", section on 'Patient selection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2796.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology", section on 'Colorectal cancer'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15754038"><span class="h3">Colon cancer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment for stage I  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) disease is surgical resection alone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2507.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of primary colon cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Following curative intent surgery, three to six months of adjuvant chemotherapy is a standard approach for patients with node-positive (stage III  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)) colon cancer. The intent of adjuvant chemotherapy is eradication of micrometastases, which decreases disease recurrence and increases cure rates. An oxaliplatin-containing regimen provides a greater degree of benefit than does a fluoropyrimidine-only regimen, at least in non-older-adult patients, and this has become a standard approach. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2471.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2508.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected colon cancer in older adult patients", section on 'Oxaliplatin-based regimens'</a>.)</p><p>The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy are less certain for patients with node-negative (stage II) tumors. Nevertheless, it is often recommended to patients with higher-risk stage II disease (T4 primary lesion, or two or more of the following high-risk factors: fewer than 13 nodes in the surgical specimen, tumor perforation or clinical obstruction, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, poorly differentiated histology, high tumor budding score) despite the lack of direct data from randomized controlled trials to support benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy in this high-risk subset. In this setting, a fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen is usually chosen, although patients with higher-risk stage II disease may be offered an oxaliplatin-based regimen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15256.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected stage II colon cancer"</a>.)</p><p>The role of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in patients with resected colon cancer is poorly defined. Nevertheless, current guidelines suggest that adjuvant RT be offered to the following subgroups of patients who have an estimated risk of local recurrence that is 30 percent or higher: T4  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) primary of the ascending or descending colon or a positive resection margin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2471.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer", section on 'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15256.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected stage II colon cancer", section on 'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15754045"><span class="h3">Rectal cancer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As with colon cancer, treatment for stage I rectal cancer is surgical resection alone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106743.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of rectal adenocarcinoma", section on 'Management according to initial clinical stage'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to colon cancer, rectal cancers have a higher rate of local failure after surgery alone (mainly because of the difficulty in obtaining optimal surgical clearance of the radial margin), particularly if the tumor is more advanced. As a result, the combination of postoperative chemotherapy and RT (which is typically administered concomitantly with chemotherapy as a radiosensitizer) is a standard approach after resection of node-positive rectal cancer, and in most cases, after resection of transmural node-negative (T3-4, N0) tumor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2529.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy", section on 'Stage II to III disease following transabdominal surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Combined modality therapy may be administered preoperatively (neoadjuvant therapy). This approach results in a more favorable long-term toxicity profile and better local control. Upfront chemoradiotherapy may also enhance the ability to perform sphincter preservation in some patients with low-lying rectal cancers. Indications for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with rectal cancer are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2468.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma", section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15750451"><span class="h3">Prognosis and natural history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Five-year survival rates for all stages of colon and rectal cancer are approximately 65 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Disease stage is the most important prognostic factor. As an example, five-year survival rates for colon cancer, stratified by stage, in data collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 1991 and 2000 were as follows [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2507.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of primary colon cancer", section on 'Prognosis'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage I (T1-2N0) – 93 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IIA (T3N0) – 85 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IIB (T4N0) – 72 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IIIA (T1-2 N1) – 83 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IIIB (T3-4 N1) – 64 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IIIC (N2) – 44 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IV – 8 percent</p><p></p><p>Five-year overall survival rates, stratified according to 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor stage at diagnosis for rectal cancer and derived from the SEER database, are illustrated in the following figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60598" href="/z/d/graphic/60598.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, these outcome estimates are problematic in two ways:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The survival rates depict overall and not cancer-specific survival. Because the incidence of CRC increases with age, there are relevant risks of dying from causes other than CRC.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Furthermore, in the case of rectal cancer, these survival estimates were derived from studies in which surgical resection was not preceded by neoadjuvant therapy. Outcomes may be better in patients who undergo pathologic staging after preoperative treatment.</p><p></p><p>These two issues were addressed in a series of 771 consecutive patients with stages I to IV rectal cancer who were undergoing resection between 1991 and 2008; 296 (38 percent) received some form of neoadjuvant therapy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Ten-year cancer-specific survival rates for patients with stage I, II, III, and IV disease at the time of resection were 89, 80, 63, and 11 percent, respectively. Only approximately one-third of the observed deaths in patients with stages I to III disease were related to rectal cancer. In addition, a substantial number of deaths due to rectal cancer occurred between years 5 and 10 (5-year and 10-year cancer-specific survival 73 versus 66 percent), highlighting the importance of longer follow-up periods to avoid underestimating the real burden of rectal cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2484.html" rel="external">"Pathology and prognostic determinants of colorectal cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2468.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma", section on 'Prognosis and extent of tumor regression'</a>.) </p><p>Despite potentially curative surgery and the use of modern locoregional and systemic therapy, approximately 40 percent of patients who present with stage II or III disease will have a disease recurrence following primary therapy [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Over 90 percent of recurrences develop within five years, most within the first three years [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Most patients who develop recurrent disease will die from it, although a small subset, mainly those with isolated limited metastatic disease to the liver or lungs, may be eligible for additional curative intent surgery:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Five-year survival rates approaching 40 percent have been reported in patients undergoing partial hepatectomy for limited hepatic metastases  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74509" href="/z/d/graphic/74509.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2483.html" rel="external">"Potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases: Integration of surgery and chemotherapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although isolated lung metastases are less common than liver involvement, metastasectomy has also been used to treat carefully selected patients with lung metastases, with five-year survival rates of 35 to 45 percent.

Guidelines for post-treatment surveillance are presented below. (See <a class="local">'Surveillance for disease recurrence and second primaries'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15754422"><span class="h1">POST-TREATMENT FOLLOW-UP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a history of CRC are recommended to undergo regular follow-up, which includes surveillance for disease recurrence or new primary tumors (polyps and invasive cancers) and evaluation and management of treatment-related late effects.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H976608196"><span class="h2">Surveillance for disease recurrence and second primaries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following treatment for a stage II or III CRC, post-treatment surveillance usually consists of periodic history and physical examination with serial assay of the serum concentrations of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), annual surveillance computed tomography (CT) scans, and colonoscopy to detect metachronous primaries. The recommendations of varying expert groups, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], are outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91618" href="/z/d/graphic/91618.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

The purpose of surveillance is early identification of recurrent disease, for the potential of cure by further surgical intervention, and screening for second primary cancers and polyps.</p><p>Although 5 of 11 randomized controlled trials comparing an intensive versus less intensive surveillance strategy in patients with CRC failed to demonstrate a significant survival benefit for more intensive surveillance, several meta-analyses examining intensive versus less intensive surveillance found a significant absolute risk reduction in all-cause mortality favoring intensive post-treatment surveillance  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77401" href="/z/d/graphic/77401.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Surveillance tests evaluated in these studies included history and physical examination, serum assay for CEA, abdominal/chest imaging, proctosigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. These data are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment", section on 'Intensive versus less intense surveillance strategies'</a>.)</p><p>Taken together, this evidence supports intensive surveillance among CRC survivors. However, the emerging consensus is that more follow-up tests are generally appropriate for those with resected stage II or III  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) disease. Because of very favorable outcomes (over 93 percent are cured by surgery alone), recommended post-treatment surveillance for individuals with resected stage I  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) CRC is limited to periodic colonoscopy and clinician visits (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment", section on 'Stage I disease'</a>).</p><p>The optimal combination and frequency of surveillance tests for patients with resected stage IV (metastatic) disease is unknown.

Most research indicates that overall QOL in long-term CRC survivors five or more years after diagnosis is comparable with that of the general population, although specific impairments may persist for years in the following domains: psychological (distress and depression), social (employment), and physical (bowel problems and fatigue) [<a href="#rid20">20-27</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, long-term complications of surgery, late toxicities from chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT), and comorbidities with advancing age can all be associated with lower QOL among CRC survivors at ≥5 years after diagnosis [<a href="#rid22">22,26,27</a>]. In one study of patients with rectal cancer, a lower QOL was associated with receiving chemoradiotherapy in addition to surgery, having a permanent stoma, or a primary tumor in the lower-third of the rectum [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>Few professional organizations have developed guidelines for assessing and managing physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects of treatment specifically for CRC survivors. However, guidelines are available from the American Cancer Society [<a href="#rid28">28</a>] and the NCCN [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H617978421"><span class="h3">Psychosocial issues</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H539332700"><span class="h4">Psychological distress and depression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following the completion of active anticancer therapies, cancer survivors generally report more psychological distress (including fear of recurrence and death, adjustment to physical changes, alterations in customary social support, social reintegration, and employment and insurance problems) when compared with individuals without a prior history of cancer [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Psychological distress can be debilitating and may interfere with long-term health behaviors. Distress levels tend to be highest early in the survivorship phase. For CRC patients specifically, a prospective survey (n &gt;1800) revealed that 7 percent experienced clinically significant psychological distress at 12 months postdiagnosis [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The presence of other comorbidities and the lack of social support were independently associated with increased distress.</p><p>Depression is common immediately after starting treatment for CRC. In one study, 18 percent of CRC survivors screened positive for depression within four to six weeks of starting treatment; after a year of follow-up, the prevalence of depression decreased [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Female patients, African Americans, people with two or more comorbid conditions, and those with either poor physical or social functioning exhibited worse depressive symptoms.</p><p>Over the long term, patients who survive at least five years after a CRC diagnosis continue to experience higher rates of depression when compared with age-matched controls; approximately 14 to 16 percent will screen positive for depression [<a href="#rid20">20,32</a>]. Moreover, in another study, 26 to 44 percent of long-term CRC survivors continued to worry about cancer recurrence, diagnostic tests, or another cancer [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>These studies suggest that regular psychological distress screening should be performed during the cancer survivorship phase of care to identify CRC survivors who may need specialized psychological interventions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H539332739"><span class="h4">Social relationships and economic burden</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The process of reintegrating into social relationships can be difficult for many survivors; this frequently affects a wide spectrum of social domains, including interactions with spouses and partners, friends, and peers at school or work. Furthermore, survivors shoulder a significant economic burden [<a href="#rid34">34-37</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>While data specific to CRC are sparse, one study showed that CRC survivors were at higher risk for unemployment when compared with age- and gender-matched healthy adults (59 versus 53 percent for colon and 54 versus 43 percent for rectal cancer, respectively) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another prospective cohort study of survivors of CRC or lung cancer, employment declined from 39 percent to 31 percent over the first 15 months after cancer diagnosis, and approximately 17 percent of those who were employed at baseline left the workforce as a result of their cancer [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Lower socioeconomic status and advanced age among CRC survivors were associated with significantly higher rates of labor force departure, highlighting the need for attention to these specific subsets of the population.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An analysis of the 2008 to 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey examined excess economic burden attributable to cancer (excess annual medical expenditures, productivity loss) for 540 CRC survivors relative to 109,423 individuals without a cancer history [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Compared with individuals without a cancer history, non-older-adult CRC survivors experienced annual excess medical expenditures of $8647 (95% CI $4932 to $13,974); for older adult patients the annual excess expenditure was $4913 (95% CI $2768 to $7470). Furthermore, non-older-adult CRC survivors experienced significantly higher rates of employment disability (13.6 versus 4.8 percent) and productivity loss at work (7.2 versus 3.3 days) and at home (4.5 versus 3.3 days).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15755702"><span class="h4">Issues related to an ostomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A significant number of CRC patients require diversion of the fecal stream in the form of either a permanent or temporary ostomy as a component of their cancer management. An ostomy has pervasive effects on everyday life (wearing an ostomy bag underneath one's clothing, the possibility of repeated skin irritations and other complications such as leakage and needing to change the pouching system too frequently, difficulties with diet selection and bowel control, as well as reduced social, emotional, sexual, and occupational functioning) that combine to reduce overall functioning and QOL [<a href="#rid38">38-40</a>]. An individual patient's response and subsequent adjustment to intestinal diversion surgery can be highly variable, thus making management and follow-up care challenging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1384.html" rel="external">"Ileostomy or colostomy care and complications"</a>.)</p><p>Because ostomies typically result in the loss of control of intestinal contents, including both stool and gas, survivors who are living with ostomies are more likely to experience significant issues with their self-image, comfort with travel and other physical activities, and interpersonal relationships. These issues may contribute to higher rates of depression and decreased overall QOL [<a href="#rid24">24,38,39,41-44</a>]. Therefore, they warrant particular attention during the survivorship phase of cancer care.</p><p>Sexual activity is an area of special concern. Ostomy surgery does not typically affect sexual desire or organic sexual function, although injury to pelvic nerves related to rectal dissection or RT may occur. (See <a class="local">'Sexual dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients frequently express concerns regarding the psychological aspects of sexual activity, including the partner's response to intimacy. Thus, appropriate counseling in this area is important to the rehabilitation and support of ostomy patients. In general, survivors are advised to empty their pouch and ensure that the pouch is sealed appropriately before engaging in sexual activity. In addition, many patients and partners find it helpful to use special lingerie or cummerbunds to conceal and secure the pouch.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14373701"><span class="h4">Summary</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the potential for significant psychosocial sequelae, clinical practice guidelines from several groups, including ASCO [<a href="#rid16">16</a>] and the NCCN [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], advise regularly scheduled visits with a health care provider during the first five years of survivorship  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91618" href="/z/d/graphic/91618.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) and that cancer patients be routinely screened for distress at all stages of disease to facilitate appropriate supportive care. In addition to providing opportunities to screen for psychosocial problems, these visits allow health care providers to offer appropriate referrals to mental health, rehabilitation, and social services to facilitate healing. Survivors may also benefit from a referral to a patient support group in order to share their concerns with others who have successfully navigated the cancer survivorship process and receive advice and encouragement about how best to cope with psychological and emotional stressors [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H617978428"><span class="h3">Medical issues</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H617978435"><span class="h4">Bowel and anorectal problems</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic persistent diarrhea is one of the most common long-term sequelae of treatment for CRC, affecting 49 percent of survivors in one study [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Chronic diarrhea limits activities and can negatively affect QOL. Specifically asking about this issue is important because survivors may assume that abnormal bowel symptoms are an inevitable consequence of treatment and not volunteer information about persistent diarrhea at follow-up appointments.</p><p>Among patients who undergo low anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer, bowel dysfunction is common and can have a profound impact on QOL [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Progressively lower surgical anastomoses are associated with a corresponding progressive decline in anorectal function, including increased stool frequency, more incontinence and perianal irritation, decreased stool and flatus discrimination, more incomplete evacuations, and decreased rectal compliance [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15311.html" rel="external">"Surgical treatment of rectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Among patients treated for rectal cancer, rates of bowel and anorectal problems are also higher in irradiated patients, whether RT is administered preoperatively or postoperatively, and they are high in patients receiving chemoradiotherapy as compared with conventional fractionation RT alone [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>]. The late effects of RT delivered for treatment of rectal cancer can be illustrated by the following data:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A randomized Dutch trial compared preoperative short-course RT (an approach that is infrequently used in the United States because of higher rates of late gastrointestinal [GI] toxicity) versus surgery alone in 597 patients with rectal cancer [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. At a median five years of follow-up, the irradiated group had significantly higher rates of fecal incontinence overall (62 versus 38 percent, p &lt;0.001), daily incontinence (14 versus 5 percent), and pad wearing as a result of incontinence (56 versus 33 percent, p &lt;0.001) [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Among the 362 patients who did not have a stoma, mean bowel frequency during the day was significantly higher in the irradiated patients (3.69 versus 3.02).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">At least in the United States, the more common approach is preoperative standard fractionation RT with concomitant radiosensitizing doses of a fluoropyrimidine. One of the advantages of neoadjuvant as compared with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a lower rate of long-term GI toxicity, particularly anastomotic stricture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a matched comparison of patients who did (41 patients) and did not (59 patients) receive chemoradiotherapy after an LAR for rectal cancer, the group that had chemoradiotherapy had more bowel movements per day (median 7 versus 2), more nighttime movements (46 versus 14 percent), more fecal incontinence (occasional 39 versus 7 percent or frequent 17 versus 0 percent), wore a pad more often (41 versus 10 percent), and were more often unable to defer defecation for more than 15 minutes (78 versus 19 percent) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p></p><p>Antidiarrheal medications are common first-line treatment for chronic diarrhea after RT. Dietary adjustments, especially elimination of raw vegetables, may be of benefit [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. Low-fat diets, probiotic supplementation, and elemental diets also may be beneficial among patients treated with pelvic radiation, but the evidence is stronger in preventing acute than chronic diarrhea [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p>Available options for treatment of fecal incontinence include medical therapy to reduce stool frequency and improve stool consistency, biofeedback therapy to improve control of the pelvic floor and abdominal wall musculature, and surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96913.html" rel="external">"Fecal incontinence in adults: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H617978442"><span class="h4">Urinary dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of long-term urinary dysfunction in patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer depends on the specific operation (rates are higher with abdominoperineal resection as compared with LAR) and the extent of pelvic dissection (rates are lowest in patients undergoing total mesorectal excision [TME] with autonomic nerve preservation). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15005.html" rel="external">"Management of intra-abdominal, pelvic, and genitourinary complications of colorectal surgery", section on 'Urinary dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>Rates of long-term urinary incontinence do not seem to be higher in patients who undergo RT in addition to surgery. This was illustrated in a report from the Dutch trial described above in which rates of difficulty with bladder emptying were not significantly different in the groups that did versus did not receive preoperative RT (27 versus 34 percent) [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25842894"><span class="h4">Sexual dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A wide variety of sexual dysfunctions are experienced by CRC survivors that may impact their QOL. Among men, these include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction (ED), and ejaculatory disorders, including retrograde ejaculations and low or alterations in ejaculation. Among women, specific sexual dysfunctions include decreased libido or sexual desire, dyspareunia, changes in genital arousal and lubrication, and altered orgasms [<a href="#rid55">55,56</a>].</p><p>Prevalence rates for specific sexual dysfunction are difficult to define, in part because of variable methods of data collection and lack of baseline data on sexual activity. A systematic review of sexual function after treatment for rectal cancer concluded that there is a wide range of sexual dysfunction rates in published studies (23 to 69 percent in men and 19 to 62 percent in women), but that, on average, 30 to 40 percent of previously sexually active patients reported sexual inactivity following treatment [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. A post-treatment reduction in sexual activity of approximately the same magnitude has been noted by others using patient reports of health-related QOL and sexual functioning before and after treatment for rectal cancer [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].</p><p>In general, sexual dysfunction is more common in patients treated for rectal than colon cancer [<a href="#rid44">44,59</a>], and in contrast to urinary dysfunction, RT is a major risk factor as illustrated by the following data:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a questionnaire study of 241 patients treated with surgery with or without preoperative RT for locally advanced rectal cancer, a median of 4.5 years after surgery, irradiated patients had significantly poorer scores for erectile function, orgasmic function, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction with sex life compared with those treated without RT [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. ED was associated with low serum testosterone levels.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 990 Dutch patients who underwent TME with or without preoperative RT, among male patients who were sexually active preoperatively, an increase in general sexual dysfunction, ED, and ejaculatory problems were reported by 76, 80, and 72 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. Ejaculatory and ED deteriorated over time. Among female patients who were sexually active preoperatively, general sexual dysfunction, dyspareunia, and vaginal dryness were reported by 62, 59, and 57 percent, respectively. Risk factors for increased sexual dysfunction in both men and women included preoperative RT and the presence of a stoma.</p><p></p><p>Studies show that post-treatment sexual dysfunction is often not addressed either at the time of treatment for CRC or during follow-up care [<a href="#rid62">62-64</a>]. Specifically asking about this issue is important because of its impact on QOL and the availability of specific treatments, particularly for men.</p><p>A number of therapies are available to address sexual dysfunction in men. Testosterone replacement therapy may be effective in increasing sexual desire and may improve erectile function in men with low levels of serum testosterone. Oral therapy with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor is considered a first-line approach to treatment of ED. In one study, 79 percent of patients with ED who had undergone rectal excision for rectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease had a satisfactory response to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9643" href="/z/d/drug information/9643.html" rel="external">sildenafil</a> [<a href="#rid65">65</a>].

Water- or silicone-based lubricants during intercourse and vaginal moisturizers can be useful for women with vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. If these are insufficient to alleviate dyspareunia, low-dose vaginal estrogen preparations may be considered. Pelvic floor muscle training and vaginal dilators may be recommended after pelvic RT to prevent vaginal stenosis, but there are few data to support the efficacy of these approaches [<a href="#rid67">67</a>].

Despite the potential survival benefits, chemotherapy also carries the risk for significant toxicities. Chemotherapies that are commonly used in the setting of CRC can be associated with mucositis, emesis, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, and cardiotoxicity. Fortunately, most of these symptoms are reversible with cessation of the chemotherapy, and late and long-term effects from CRC-specific cytotoxic agents are relatively infrequent with the exception of oxaliplatin-related peripheral neuropathy.

Up to 90 percent of patients receiving a six-month course of an oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy regimen develop a neuropathy during treatment; neuropathy is generally reversible, although it may take several years. As an example, in one systematic review of 27 studies, the pooled prevalence of persistent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) of any grade at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy was 58, 45, 32, and 24 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. The average prevalence of CIPN decreased by 26 percent per year after chemotherapy (pooled relative risk 0.74, 95% CI 0.72-0.75). Symptoms may include numbness, tingling, and cold-induced pain. Persisting neuropathy symptoms, especially pain, can negatively impact QOL [<a href="#rid71">71,72</a>].

At a median follow-up of 14 years, there was no significant difference in the number of secondary cancers in irradiated compared with nonirradiated patients (10-year rates of secondary malignancies 14.8 versus 15.3 percent) [<a href="#rid81">81</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On the other hand, an increased risk of second cancers following standard conventional fractionation RT was suggested in one analysis of 1599 patients treated with either preoperative (5 X 5 Gy fractions) or postoperative RT (30 X 2 Gy fractions for stage II or III disease) or surgery alone in the Swedish and Uppsala rectal cancer trials [<a href="#rid82">82</a>].

The increase in second cancers among those receiving RT could not be attributed to one or a few specific cancer types. An important point, however, is that in the Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial 20 percent of the irradiated patients developed either a local recurrence or a second cancer compared with 31 percent of the nonirradiated patients (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.44-0.70), suggesting that while there is a higher risk of second cancers, there is also a lower risk of local recurrences following RT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An elevated risk for second gynecologic malignancies of the uterine corpus (adjusted HR [aHR] 3.06, 95% CI 2.14-4.37) and ovarian cancer (aHR 2.08, 95% CI 1.22-3.56) in radiated as compared with nonirradiated individuals was noted in a population-based cohort study of 20,142 women diagnosed with locoregional rectal cancer between 1973 and 2015 and reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database [<a href="#rid84">84</a>].

During a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, the rate of developing diabetes was 53 percent higher among patients with CRC compared with those without a diagnosis of CRC in the first year postdiagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.53, 95% CI 1.42-1.64), and it remained increased in the fifth year (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.35).

This was shown in an analysis derived from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database in which 72,408 individuals over the age of 65 diagnosed and treated for stage I to III CRC between 2000 and 2011 (27 percent of whom received some form of adjuvant chemotherapy and 12 percent of whom received RT) were compared with a matched cohort of 72,408 Medicare patients without cancer [<a href="#rid89">89</a>]. At a median follow-up of eight years, the 10-year cumulative incidence of new-onset cardiovascular disease and heart failure was significantly higher in patients treated for CRC (57 and 55 percent compared with 22 and 18 percent for control, respectively). Risk increased with age and was influenced by exposure to fluoropyrimidines and preexisting comorbidities. Patients who received <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a> rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> had a significantly higher risk for heart failure (two years or more since diagnosis; HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.36-1.81) but a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62-0.84). Among the CRC survivors, factors that contributed to the accelerated time to heart failure and cardiovascular disease included African American race/ethnicity and RT. In addition, there were significant interactions between chemotherapy and diabetes for accelerated time to heart failure and between hypertension and chemotherapy for accelerated time to cardiovascular disease.</p><p>These findings provide evidence to support close medical surveillance for heart failure and cardiovascular disease in older CRC cancer survivors, particularly those with preexisting hypertension and diabetes.</p><p>The increased cardiovascular disease risk in CRC survivors relative to the general population is likely attributable to multiple shared risk factors, many of which are precursors or consequences of obesity. Clinical care guidelines recommend that clinicians counsel patients with CRC regarding the association between obesity and cardiovascular disease risk [<a href="#rid28">28</a>], although this recommendation is based exclusively on expert opinion, and the evidence to support this recommendation is weak. A population-based retrospective cohort study of 2839 patients diagnosed with stage I to III CRC between 2006 and 2011 at an integrated health system in North America examined the association between body composition and post-treatment cardiovascular events [<a href="#rid90">90</a>]. The median age at diagnosis was 62, although the range was 19 to 80. The cumulative incidence of a major adverse cardiovascular event 10 years after diagnosis of CRC was 19 percent. Body mass index (BMI) was not correlated with the risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event (contrasting BMI categories of ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> versus 18.5 to 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the HR was 1.23, 95% CI 0.85-1.77). By contrast, visceral adiposity (as assessed by CT scan) was associated with excess risk (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02-2.31), but subcutaneous adiposity was not (HR contrasting the highest versus lowest quintile 1.15, 95% CI 0.78-1.69). The association of visceral, but not subcutaneous, adipose tissue area with major adverse cardiovascular events is consistent with broad evidence associating visceral adiposity with the pathogenesis of multiple chronic diseases. This finding also suggests that assessing BMI alone may have limited use for determining cardiovascular risk in this patient population.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis CRC) are the most common of the familial CRC syndromes, but together these two conditions account for only approximately 5 percent of CRC cases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2606.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer", section on 'Hereditary CRC syndromes'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2593.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Lynch syndrome is more common than FAP and accounts for approximately 3 to 5 percent of all colonic adenocarcinomas. The term Lynch syndrome denotes families who have been genetically determined to have a disease-causing defect in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The biologic footprint of a defect in MMR capacity is high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI testing of CRCs is routinely used to help establish the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. Some institutions perform MSI testing or immunohistochemistry testing for MMR proteins in CRCs in young patients (diagnosed prior to age 50 years) or in those who meet the Bethesda criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72965" href="/z/d/graphic/72965.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). At other institutions, universal testing of all CRCs for MSI is practiced and is endorsed in guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society for Medical Oncology, and others [<a href="#rid91">91-93</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15804.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management"</a>.)</p><p>Extracolonic cancers are very common in Lynch syndrome, particularly endometrial carcinomas, which may occur in up to 60 percent of female mutation carriers in some families. Other sites at increased risk of neoplasm formation include the ovary, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary system, brain, and renal pelvis or ureter.</p><p>The development of one or more of these cancers in a family member of a CRC survivor may prompt consideration for genetic testing. Family history is seldom updated regularly during follow-up. However, regularly updating a three-generation family history pedigree from cancer survivors can be valuable to help determine the potential risk for cancer in family members as well as the survivor's own risk of subsequent cancers that may be associated with a previously unrecognized hereditary syndrome.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H617978491"><span class="h1">LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The role of lifestyle modification (eg, diet, exercise, smoking cessation) and the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>/nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in preventing a cancer recurrence is often a topic of interest to cancer survivors.

Furthermore, because many cancer survivors are older adults, primary care providers may be better equipped to address recommended chronic disease care that is often not addressed among cancer survivors [<a href="#rid112">112</a>]. Yet, most primary care providers encounter few such patients in their practices; they may be unaware of or unprepared to handle potential long-term complications of treatment [<a href="#rid113">113,114</a>] or be unaware of recommendations for post-treatment surveillance from organizations such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), among others.</p><p>A shared care model that involves coordinated care between primary care and specialists may optimize adherence to guidelines for recommended follow-up care in cancer survivors along with general preventive and chronic disease care, although there is low-quality evidence to support benefit from such a model of care for patients with chronic diseases.
