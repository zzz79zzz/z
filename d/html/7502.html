The arthritis is typically symmetrical, and usually leads, if uncontrolled, to destruction of joints due to erosion of cartilage and bone, causing joint deformities. The disease usually progresses from the periphery to more proximal joints and results in significant locomotor disability within 10 to 20 years in patients whose disease does not respond to treatment.</p><p>The major clinical features of RA, including the articular manifestations, are reviewed here. The systemic and extraarticular features and the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of RA are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7511.html" rel="external">"Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7504.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">INITIAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) most typically presents as polyarticular disease and with a gradual onset, but some patients can present with acute onset, with intermittent or migratory joint involvement, or with monoarticular disease. (See <a class="local">'Typical 'classic' RA'</a> below and <a class="local">'Palindromic rheumatism'</a> below and <a class="local">'Monoarthritis'</a> below.)</p><p>The symptoms of RA can affect patients' capacity to perform the activities of daily living (eg, walking, stairs, dressing, use of a toilet, getting up from a chair, opening jars, doors, typing) and those required in their occupation.</p><p>Systemic symptoms may also be present in these patients, particularly those with disease onset after age 60 (historically termed "elderly-onset RA"); in up to one-third of patients, the acute onset of polyarthritis is associated with prominent myalgia, fatigue, low-grade fever, weight loss, and depression. Less often, extraarticular manifestations such as nodules or episcleritis may also be present. (See <a class="local">'Extraarticular involvement'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H144733302"><span class="h2">Articular disease</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h3">Typical 'classic' RA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The disease onset in RA is usually insidious, with the predominant symptoms being pain, stiffness (especially morning stiffness), and swelling of many joints [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Typically, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the fingers, the interphalangeal joints of the thumbs, the wrists, and the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints of the toes are sites of arthritis early in the disease. Other synovial joints of the upper and lower limbs, such as the elbows, shoulders, ankles, and knees, are also commonly affected [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>Morning stiffness is a common feature of those with active RA; it can be defined as "slowness or difficulty moving the joints when getting out of bed or after staying in one position too long, which involves both sides of the body and gets better with movement" [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Morning stiffness lasting more than one hour reflects a severity of joint inflammation that rarely occurs outside of active inflammatory arthritis. Morning stiffness, or stiffness after any prolonged period of inactivity (“gelling phenomenon”), is seen in virtually all inflammatory arthropathies [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, features suggesting polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) may be present in addition to features of polyarticular RA, and some patients who subsequently develop RA may present with typical PMR. When this occurs in the absence of clinically detectable synovitis, the distinctive clinical features of RA may not develop until months or even years later. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8235.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica", section on 'Clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8235.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Palindromic rheumatism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The onset of RA is episodic in a few patients, with one to several joint areas being affected sequentially for hours to days, alternating with symptom-free periods that may last from days to months; this episodic pattern is referred to as "palindromic rheumatism." Patients with palindromic rheumatism have similar predisposing genetic risk factors to patients with a more typical persistent presentation of RA and exhibit a similar dose effect of carriage of certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7519.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of, risk factors for, and possible causes of rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Familial and genetic risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The proportion of patients presenting with palindromic rheumatism who progress to develop RA or another well-defined disease varies between studies. In one study of 60 patients with palindromic rheumatism followed over 20 years, 40 (67 percent) developed RA [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In another study, among 147 such patients seen in a tertiary referral center, 41 were eventually diagnosed with RA (28 percent) and four with other disorders (three with systemic lupus erythematosus and one with Behçet syndrome) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>The presence of anti-citrullinated peptide/protein antibodies (ACPA), a serologic finding that is common in RA, might predict progression of palindromic rheumatism to RA, but evidence evaluating this possibility has been mixed [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In one study, involving 61 patients followed for a mean of five-and-a-half years, ACPA testing was performed within a year of symptom onset and antibodies were present in 83 percent of patients who progressed to definite RA, but only 19 percent of those whose disease did not [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. However, in another study, a majority of those with palindromic rheumatism also had ACPA, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of ACPA between patients with persistent palindromic rheumatism and those who subsequently developed RA [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7503.html" rel="external">"Biologic markers in the assessment of rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies'</a>.)</p><p>A response among patients with palindromic rheumatism to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a>, which is also used for the treatment of RA, further supports the possibility that palindromic rheumatism can be a presenting feature of RA. The use of hydroxychloroquine in such patients may also reduce the risk of progression to RA. One retrospective study of 113 patients with palindromic rheumatism found that those who received hydroxychloroquine were 20 percent less likely to develop a chronic rheumatic disease [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Monoarthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Persistent single joint arthritis (monoarthritis), frequently of a large joint such as the wrist, knee, shoulder, hip, or ankle, may be the sole manifestation of RA or may herald the onset of polyarticular disease. There may be a history of joint trauma as an apparent initiating event. The interval between monoarthritis and polyarthritis may extend from days to several weeks in patients whose disease progresses. Until polyarthritis develops, the approach to such patients is that for any patient with monoarticular arthritis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1820.html" rel="external">"Monoarthritis in adults: Etiology and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Extraarticular involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A proportion of patients complain of a constellation of persistent extraarticular symptoms, which may antedate the onset of polyarthritis by many months; these include generalized aching, stiffness, symptoms of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, loss of weight, depression, and fatigue (the last simulating chronic fatigue syndrome [CFS], also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [ME/CFS]).</p><p>Involvement of the musculoskeletal system other than joints (eg, bone and muscle) and of extraarticular organs (eg, skin, eyes, lungs, heart, and others) occurs in approximately 40 percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over the course of the disease. In addition, patients may rarely present with extraarticular disease in the absence of clinical arthritis.</p><p>The systemic and extraarticular manifestations of RA are discussed in detail separately. (See <a class="local">'Symptoms and physical findings'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7511.html" rel="external">"Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">SYMPTOMS AND PHYSICAL FINDINGS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Joint pain and swelling, especially of the small joints of the hands, wrist, and forefoot are common, along with morning stiffness and decreased grip strength, although all peripheral joints and, to a lesser degree, the more proximal joints of the extremities can be affected. The axial skeleton is usually spared, other than the cervical spine (particularly C1 to C2), where severe disease may cause serious neurologic compromise, generally in patients with longstanding disease. Patients with poorly controlled disease typically experience progressive joint damage, which may result in significant joint deformities and functional impairment (see <a class="local">'Physical findings of joint inflammation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Distribution of involved joints'</a> below and <a class="local">'Upper extremity'</a> below and <a class="local">'Lower extremity'</a> below and <a class="local">'Axial skeleton'</a> below and <a class="local">'Cricoarytenoid joint'</a> below). Disease outcome and functional impairment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7505.html" rel="external">"Disease outcome and functional capacity in rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms and findings of systemic and extraarticular manifestations may include generalized aching, stiffness, weight loss, depression, and fatigue. Most patients with extraarticular features of RA have longstanding and severe disease; these features, which are discussed in more detail separately, include anemia, fatigue, subcutaneous ("rheumatoid") nodules, pleuropericarditis, airway and parenchymal lung diseases, neuropathy, episcleritis, scleritis, splenomegaly, Sjögren's disease, vasculitis, and others. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7511.html" rel="external">"Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78856275"><span class="h2">Physical findings of joint inflammation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The key features of early rheumatoid inflammation are pain and swelling of the affected joints. Painful inflammation is demonstrated either by local tenderness from pressure applied on the joint or by pain on moving the joint. Swelling may be due to synovial hypertrophy or effusion. Synovial thickening is detected by a "boggy" feel to a swollen joint, and effusion by demonstrating fluctuance. Heat and redness are not prominent features of RA, although an involved joint is often perceptibly warmer on careful examination. Synovitis of the wrist may present as carpal tunnel syndrome even in very early disease when swelling may not be particularly evident. The characteristic joint deformities are late manifestations of disease that result from the physical stresses and damage to the local anatomy of involved joints.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H54966337"><span class="h2">Distribution of involved joints</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>RA eventually affects the peripheral joints in almost all patients. Involvement of axial and central joints is less common, occurring in 20 to 50 percent of patients; such joints include the interfacetal and atlantoaxial joints of the neck; the acromioclavicular [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], sternoclavicular, temporomandibular, and cricoarytenoid joints; and the shoulders and hips. Lumbar spine facet joint synovitis may occur, but the frequency of such involvement is rare.</p><p>Symmetrical involvement of joints is a characteristic feature, although this may be less apparent early in the disease. The severity of joint disease and consequent deformity is sometimes notably asymmetrical, an observation that may be attributed to increased structural damage to joints related to unilateral overuse of a dominant limb, or joint protection of a limb resulting from neurologic disease. Squeeze tenderness at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints and palpable synovial thickening at these joints are characteristic of RA.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H54966692"><span class="h2">Upper extremity</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Hands</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main signs of disease can often be found in the hands early in the course of RA [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Symmetrical effusions and soft tissue swelling around the MCP and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints typically occur. These joints are tender to the touch and exhibit a restricted range of movement (eg, inability to make a fist). Reduced grip strength is a sensitive but nonspecific feature of disease activity affecting the hands and wrists. Palmar erythema may be present (as with any peripheral arthritis).</p><p>Occasionally, thickening of the flexor tendons can be detected by palpation of the palm; this finding is due to synovitis of the tendon sheaths ("tenosynovitis"). Nodules may form along the palmar tendon sheaths, resulting in the tendon sheath catching (or triggering) and in an inability to fully extend the finger. The nodules may cause tendon rupture, especially of the extensor pollicis longus (extensor of the distal interphalangeal [DIP] joint of the thumb).</p><p>Other physical signs include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced grip strength, which is common, can be a surprisingly sensitive indicator of early disease, as well as a useful parameter in the evaluation of disease activity and progression. However, the multiplicity of factors (joint pain, tendon involvement, nerve compression, and muscle wasting) that contribute to a weak grip makes this assessment rather nonspecific.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The whole hand may be swollen in very acute RA, with pitting edema over the dorsum giving rise to the "boxing glove" appearance. The range of movement of involved joints is restricted, and loss of active flexion may be so severe that the patient is unable to oppose the fingertips to the palm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Between 1 and 5 percent of patients present with carpal tunnel syndrome. Affected patients develop dysesthesia and muscle weakness of the first three fingers and the radial side of the fourth finger. A positive Tinel's or Phalen's sign is usually present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5288.html" rel="external">"Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The characteristic joint deformities appear in more established chronic RA. These findings include MCP subluxation, ulnar deviation or "ulnar drift", swan neck and Boutonniere deformities of the fingers  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57439 graphicRef66140 graphicRef96568" href="/d/graphic/57439.html" rel="external">picture 1A-C</a>), and the "bow string" sign (prominence of the tendons in the extensor compartment of the hand). Occasionally, patients present with extensor tendon rupture, most commonly affecting the thumb or little or ring fingers of either hand. The nails and fingertips may show evidence of digital infarcts in patients with rheumatoid vasculitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8237.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis", section on 'Cutaneous vasculitis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Wrists, elbows, and shoulders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All of the upper extremity joints may be involved in RA, including the wrists, elbows, and shoulders. Wrist involvement is often seen early in the disease course.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Wrists</strong> – The wrist is probably the most common upper extremity joint to be involved other than the small joints in the hand. Early in the disease there is a loss of extension. Late changes due to erosive damage lead to volar subluxation and radial drift of the carpus, resulting in increasing prominence of the ulnar styloid and lateral deviation [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Tendon rupture can also occur at the wrist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elbows</strong> – The elbow is frequently affected, with loss of extension (fixed flexion) both in early and late disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76905" href="/d/graphic/76905.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). An effusion or synovitis may be detected as a bulge between the head of the radius and the olecranon. A compressive neuropathy of the ulnar nerve, with dysesthesias of the fourth and fifth fingers, can result from elbow synovitis. Olecranon bursitis is also common. Destruction of the joint may occur due to erosion of cartilage and bone.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The extensor surface of the elbow is the most common site for subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74194" href="/d/graphic/74194.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). These should always be visually examined and palpated for in view of their diagnostic and prognostic importance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7523.html" rel="external">"Rheumatoid nodules"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Shoulders</strong> – The shoulder, being more proximal, tends to be involved later in the disease. A prospective study performed prior to the widespread availability of biologic agents assessed shoulder involvement over time in 74 patients with RA [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. At 15 years, 55 percent had developed radiographic evidence of erosive glenohumeral joint disease [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The most common site for erosions was the superolateral aspect of the humerus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Disease in the glenohumeral joint leads to painful restriction of movement resembling a capsulitis, and can result in the development of a "frozen" shoulder. This will typically cause pain at night, when the patient lies on the affected shoulder and marked restriction of range of motion due to the accompanying pain. Rotator cuff injury is common. Effusions are relatively rare, but when they occur, they may be detected in the anterior glenohumeral joint as a filling of the depression under the clavicle anterior to the head of the humerus.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Lower extremity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lower extremity joints are often involved in RA, particularly in the forefoot and ankles; the knees and hips may also be affected, but hip involvement tends to occur in more severe or longstanding disease. Synovitis in the knee may predispose to the development of popliteal (Baker's) cysts.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Feet and ankles</strong> – Foot involvement, especially of the MTP joints, is common in early disease, with a pattern that mirrors that occurring in the hand. Involvement of the feet is typically under-recognized, making it imperative for the clinician to closely inspect the bare feet.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tenderness of the MTP joints may be marked, resulting in the tendency to bear weight on the heels and hyperextend the toes. The fifth MTP is the most frequently involved, and swelling of this joint may be most readily appreciated on examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Erosive damage results in lateral drift of the toes and plantar subluxation of the metatarsal heads  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96569" href="/d/graphic/96569.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), resulting in "cock-up" deformities. The latter may be palpable as bony lumps on the sole with associated callosities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Involvement of the tarsus and the associated tendon sheaths is also common, leading to pain on inversion or eversion of the foot and diffuse edema and erythema over the dorsum of the foot.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Heel pain may be associated with retrocalcaneal bursitis or tarsal tunnel syndrome, caused by impingement of the posterior tibial nerve. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is also associated with paresthesia of the toes and is important because it can be diagnosed by ultrasound and treated by local injection or surgical release.

Typically, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the fingers, the interphalangeal joints of the thumbs, the wrists, and the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints of the toes are sites of arthritis early in the disease. Other joints of the upper and lower limbs are also commonly affected later in the disease course. Onset may occasionally be intermittent or with migratory joint involvement, or may be monoarticular. RA may adversely affect a patient's capacity to perform the activities of daily living.

Painful inflammation is demonstrated either by local tenderness from pressure applied on the joint or by pain on moving the joint. Swelling may be due to synovial hypertrophy or effusion. Synovial thickening is detected by a "boggy" feel to a swollen joint, and effusion by demonstrating fluctuation.

Involvement of axial and central joints is less common, occurring in 20 to 50 percent of patients. Symmetrical joint involvement is characteristic, although this may be less apparent early in the disease. The pattern of joint involvement may also be diagnostically useful. Squeeze tenderness at the MCP and metatarsophalangeal MTP joints and palpable synovial thickening at these joints are characteristic of RA.
