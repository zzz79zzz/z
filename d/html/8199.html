         Phlebitis and thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins is generally a benign, self-limited disorder; however, when the axial veins are involved (eg, great saphenous vein, accessory saphenous vein, small saphenous vein), thrombus propagation into the deep vein system (ie, deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) and even pulmonary embolism can occur [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Treatment is aimed at relieving local symptoms and preventing thromboembolic complications.

         The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of phlebitis and thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins are reviewed here. Phlebitis and thrombosis involving upper extremity veins most often occurs in the context of upper extremity venous cannulation and is discussed separately. Evaluation and treatment of patients with DVT is discussed separately. (See

         The main axial superficial veins of the lower extremity are the great saphenous, anterior accessory saphenous, and small saphenous veins  (

         ). A source of ongoing confusion continues to be the occasional use of the abandoned term "superficial femoral vein" to describe the main deep vein in the thigh located adjacent the superficial femoral artery, and which is properly referred to as the "femoral vein"  (

         The term phlebitis refers to the presence of inflammation within a vein, whereas thrombosis indicates the presence of clot within the vein [
         <a href="#rid5">

         The term superficial phlebitis denotes the presence of pain and inflammation involving a vein in the absence of thrombus. Superficial phlebitis is usually an initial clinical diagnosis, referring to the clinical findings of pain, tenderness, induration, and erythema along the course of a superficial vein. It is due to inflammation, and less commonly, with infection of the vein. If thrombus is apparent as a thickened cord or subsequently identified with imaging studies (often the case), the terms superficial thrombophlebitis or superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) are preferred.

         The more frequent use of duplex ultrasound has allowed the distinction of thrombophlebitis from phlebitis by confirming the presence or absence of thrombus within a vein. Although the term superficial thrombophlebitis can refer to any vein, in the lower extremity, we prefer to limit this term to the presence of symptoms of venous inflammation and confirmed thrombosis of the tributary veins, reserving the term SVT for inflammation and thrombosis of the axial veins (eg, great saphenous, accessory saphenous, and small saphenous veins).

         The term "superficial vein thrombosis" has been adopted in the medical literature to connote a similar level of seriousness that is attached to the term "deep vein thrombosis" (DVT). This is due to the recognition that thrombosis of the axial veins (eg, great saphenous, anterior accessory saphenous, and small saphenous veins) can be associated with DVT and PE at the time of diagnosis or lead to subsequent thromboembolism, particularly when the more cephalad vein is affected. Although the phlebitis term is lacking here, the presence of symptoms of inflammation is understood, as these larger veins uncommonly thrombose without associated symptoms.

          INCIDENCE

         </span>
         Thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins is relatively common and may be much more common than previously believed. In the past, phlebitis and thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins were diagnosed primarily on clinical grounds. With the more frequent use of duplex ultrasound, venous thrombosis is more readily identified. Thrombosis of the axial veins (ie, superficial vein thrombosis [SVT]) appears to be more prevalent than deep vein thrombosis (DVT) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. SVT more commonly involves the great saphenous vein compared with the small saphenous vein [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It is clear that a diagnosis of DVT increases the risk for thrombotic events, both at the time of initial diagnosis and subsequently. Whether a diagnosis of SVT of the lower extremity increases the risk for thrombotic events other than DVT or pulmonary embolism is uncertain [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. In a cohort study from the Danish National Registry, the risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, and death was increased following a diagnosis of SVT over a median seven-year follow-up [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The highest risk was in the first three months following a diagnosis of SVT (AMI: hazard ratio [HR] 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.5; stroke: HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.8-3.8; death: HR 3.5, 95% CI 3.1-4.0).

         </span>
         Thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins is associated with conditions that increase the risk of clotting, including those that lead to decreased venous flow and pooling, abnormalities of coagulation or fibrinolysis, and endothelial dysfunction. Venous hypertension can be due to acute venous disease (eg, deep vein thrombosis [DVT], vein injury), chronic venous disease (eg, varicose veins, chronic venous insufficiency), venous procedures (eg, sclerotherapy, surgical ablation, venipuncture), immobilization (eg, postoperative, trauma), pregnancy, obesity, infection, intravenous therapy, or drug abuse [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12

          Varicose veins

         ]. Varicose veins account for etiology of the thrombosis in up to 90 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         <strong>
          Vein excision/ablation
         </strong>
         – Thrombosis and inflammation of the superficial veins of the lower extremity can develop following open surgical, chemical, or endovenous ablation of incompetent veins. Following open vein excision, the residual end of an avulsed vein segment undergoes spasm and thrombosis. Thrombus may extend retrograde into an adjacent patent vein. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121344.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to treating symptomatic superficial venous insufficiency", section on 'Ambulatory phlebectomy'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Following endovenous ablation (eg, radiofrequency ablation, endovenous laser ablation, endovenous chemical adhesive ablation, sclerotherapy), treatment of the vein segment leads to inflammation, thrombosis, and fibrosis of the lumen. For some patients, SVT can occur in the treated segment if the amount of energy delivered was not adequate, or potentially above the treated segment when there is stasis. Varying degrees of pain and inflammation occur depending upon the device used to affect closure.

         Most patients present clinically with typical findings associated with venous inflammation and thrombosis. Signs of inflammation (ie, phlebitis) are readily identified in tributary veins (often varicosities), which are directly under the skin. Inflammatory changes associated with superficial vein thrombosis often cannot be appreciated since the superficial axial veins are typically 1.5 cm or more beneath the skin, especially in more cephalad thigh region. Symptoms and signs of venous thromboembolism (VTE; ie, deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism) can also occur. When pulmonary embolism occurs related to superficial vein thrombosis (SVT), it is more likely related to SVT located in the above-knee segment of the great saphenous vein [

         Most clinical presentations are uncomplicated with typical findings of tenderness, induration, pain, and/or erythema along the course of a superficial vein, usually a tributary varicosity. The degree of inflammation (ie, phlebitis) varies depending on the length of the vein affected. In addition, there is often a palpable, sometimes nodular cord due to thrombus within the affected vein. Persistence of this cord when the extremity is raised suggests the presence of thrombus. Low-grade fever may be present in uncomplicated superficial thrombophlebitis, but high fever should increase suspicion for suppurative superficial thrombophlebitis. (See

         High fever, fluctuance, and/or purulent drainage suggest infection within the vein (ie, suppurative or septic thrombophlebitis). Suppurative thrombophlebitis should be suspected when erythema extends significantly beyond the margin of the vein.

         Signs and symptoms of VTE (DVT, pulmonary embolism) may accompany the typical clinical features of SVT as described above.

The observed variability was due to the wide diversity of patients studied and methods used in the published reports; lower incidences are reported in primary care settings compared with vascular laboratory populations.

Concurrent symptomatic PE is diagnosed in approximately 5 percent of patients with SVT at the initial presentation. A later study of 844 patients with thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins affecting a segment ≥5 cm in length found symptomatic pulmonary embolus in 4 percent of patients [

         Thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins can occur as an isolated event but can be recurrent in the same vein. In some patients, distinctly different vein segments can be affected over time. When this occurs without an identifiable cause, it is referred to as migratory thrombophlebitis.

         The diagnosis of phlebitis and thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins is usually clinically apparent based upon the patient's complaints and physical examination as described above, especially in patients with known risk factors. The need for duplex ultrasound or further evaluation with laboratory or other studies depends upon the clinical scenario. Most feel that duplex examination is essential for patients with suspected superficial vein thrombosis (SVT; ie, thrombus within the axial veins) due to the high rate of concurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), as well as to accurately make the diagnosis and define that anatomic extent of the thrombus so the patient can be reevaluated should they demonstrate clinical signs of propagation.

         While a decision to obtain a duplex ultrasound depends on whether the information obtained will likely change clinical management, for most patients we suggest ultrasound upon initial presentation to rule out the presence of coexistent DVT and to evaluate the location and extent of thrombosis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102557" href="/z/d/graphic/102557.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid34">
          34-36
         </a>
         ]. The extent of thrombosis is often not appreciated by the clinician based on physical examination alone. Duplex ultrasound should also be performed for those in whom the clinical examination is uncertain, for lower extremity swelling that is greater than would be expected from thrombophlebitis alone, or for evidence of clinical progression during a period of follow-up.
        </p>
        <p>
         Duplex ultrasound should routinely evaluate the deep
         <strong>
          and
         </strong>
         superficial axial veins to exclude DVT and superficial venous thrombosis as well as the location of the main perforator veins. It is important to evaluate the entire extent of the involved superficial vein, and the ultrasound technician should be asked to document the exact location and length of any identified thrombus. The need to treat superficial vein thrombosis is based upon the length of thrombus being greater than or equal to 5 cm long. Any isolated tributary superficial veins with thrombosis or thrombophlebitis should also be documented.
        </p>
        <p>
         Duplex ultrasound can also help identify other pathology that may be a source of the patient's complaints (eg, popliteal cyst, muscle mass) [

          37,38

         SVT can progress to involve the deep veins at any level in the lower extremity; however, the risk of DVT progressing from the great saphenous or an anterior accessory saphenous vein (at the saphenofemoral junction) or small saphenous vein (at the saphenopopliteal junction) is greater than with the perforating veins.

         For patients with isolated uncomplicated phlebitis not affecting the axial veins and with no other risk factors for DVT, the likelihood of venous thromboembolism is low, and additional studies are generally not required. The patient should be treated symptomatically and undergo repeat clinical examination within 7 to 10 days to evaluate for resolution or progression. Resolution may take two to six weeks. Any worsening of clinical symptoms despite of treatment or clinical progression of signs of phlebitis on physical examination should prompt evaluation with duplex ultrasound. Clinical progression includes worsened pain, increased swelling, or extension of a region of erythema or palpable cord. (See

         Some patients may complain of pain along the known course of a superficial vein (eg, inner medial thigh and calf) but have minimal physical findings (ie, no palpable cord or erythema) to support a clinical diagnosis of superficial thrombophlebitis or SVT. However, it is important to remember that in all patients and in particular patients with obesity, the superficial veins are situated several centimeters below the surface of normal-appearing skin (especially in the thigh region), and erythema may not be as visually apparent on physical examination. Although these patients likely have thrombosis of the superficial veins, they may have DVT [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,20-22
         </a>
         ]. Duplex imaging is indicated in such cases to establish the diagnosis and to exclude the presence of DVT. It is important to note that even in a thin or normal-sized individual, SVT in the more cephalad great saphenous vein may not have the classic overlying erythema due to the depth of the vein in this location.

         Patients with clinical symptoms that are clearly along the course of an axial vein and indicative of SVT should undergo duplex examination to exclude extension into the deep venous system. Given their common risk factors, the association of superficial and deep venous thrombosis is not surprising. For patients with SVT in proximity (≤5 cm) to the deep vein system, there is a high prevalence of concomitant DVT. The risk of pulmonary embolism is also higher when SVT occurs in the more cephalad great saphenous vein. Coexisting DVT is diagnosed with ultrasound in approximately 25 percent of cases of SVT, with the highest risk occurring when the more cephalad great saphenous vein is involved [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,18,20-22,24,25,39-42

         ]. The physical findings can lag the extent of thrombosis as detected by duplex scan. As an example, duplex scan may identify thrombus encroaching upon the saphenofemoral junction in a patient with an erythematous, hot, tender cord confined to the course of the saphenous vein below the knee and without symptoms in the thigh.

Direct extension of thrombus from the superficial to deep veins at confluences (eg, saphenofemoral junction, saphenopopliteal junction) or via perforating veins can occur, and these regions should be evaluated and documented in detail (length, distance from junction with deep veins) at initial duplex examination and at any follow-up examinations. When superficial and deep vein thrombosis exist as a contiguous finding on duplex ultrasound, it may be difficult to determine whether the superficial or deep venous system was affected first. SVT can represent a retrograde extension of thrombus from the deep veins to the superficial veins, which can occur in patients with venous valvular incompetence [

         The need for any other evaluation depends upon the clinical scenario. Most patients with uncomplicated phlebitis will not require further laboratory evaluation or workup. For patients who require anticoagulation, we obtain baseline coagulation parameters and a D-dimer at the initiation of treatment and again at 45 days. If the D-dimer remains elevated, it is an indication that the thrombus burden has not completely resolved, and continuation of anticoagulation may be warranted.

         For patients with clinical signs consistent with suppurative phlebitis, we obtain a complete blood count and blood cultures.

         Abnormal coagulation profiles have been identified in patients with thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins. However, as with DVT, screening patients for hypercoagulability following a solitary episode is low yield and not cost effective. While no consensus exists, screening for hypercoagulability should be considered in patients with SVT not associated with varicose veins or recurrent SVT, along with a careful history and physical examination to assess for symptoms and signs consistent with malignancy or other thrombophilic conditions.

         Management of phlebitis and thrombosis of the superficial veins in the lower extremity includes treatment aimed at relieving symptoms (pain control, reducing inflammation) for all patients and serial clinical assessment that often includes ultrasound. Treatment may also include initiation of anticoagulation (prophylactic or therapeutic) for superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) depending on the location and the extent of thrombus, incorporating patient preference and the cost and convenience of the available treatments, and the burdens of follow-up visits and imaging.

         Anticoagulation is suggested for patients with SVT at increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Whether prophylactic or therapeutic dosing is suggested depends on the location and extent of thrombosis, which determines the risk for VTE, and the patient's medical history. (See

         There is no role for anticoagulation, prophylactic or therapeutic, for patients with superficial phlebitis alone (ie, without evidence of thrombosis) or superficial thrombophlebitis (ie, thrombosis of a tributary vein). (See

         Patients with indications for anticoagulation, but in whom it is contraindicated, may be candidates for ligation of the vein (eg, high ligation at the saphenofemoral junction) to prevent propagation. Rarely, others with varicose vein SVT may benefit from vein excision to relieve local symptoms if there is not an appropriate response to symptomatic care or for recurrence of phlebitis. (See

For patients with superimposed limited thrombus, resolution of pain usually occurs within a week; however, for involved superficial tributary veins (typically varicosities), a venous cord may remain palpable for several months [

It is important to distinguish between phlebitis and thrombus in a tributary varicose vein (superficial phlebitis, superficial thrombophlebitis) versus thrombus within an axial superficial vein (ie, superficial vein thrombosis) because treatment of the latter may also involve anticoagulation.

         NSAIDs are effective in relieving the pain associated with venous inflammation. NSAIDs are appropriate for the treatment of superficial phlebitis or superficial thrombophlebitis; however, due to concern over increased bleeding risk, we avoid NSAIDs in patients with superficial vein thrombosis who will be anticoagulated.

         Isolated, uncomplicated SVT does require close follow-up to watch for evidence of propagation of thrombus, which may occur over the course of several weeks. If there is no propagation, it may resolve with symptomatic care alone. We use NSAIDs as the preferred initial medication to control pain and decrease inflammation  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). We also suggest routine serial examinations and repeat duplex ultrasound to identify patients who develop thrombus extension and who may then benefit from anticoagulation, as many of these patients do exhibit subsequent propagation. (See

         ]. Patients had duplex-confirmed SVT over at an least 5 cm segment of vein (ie, anatomic low risk). Patients with involvement of the great saphenous vein within 3 cm of the saphenofemoral junction were excluded, as were patients with medical risk factors for thromboembolism (eg, recent surgery, prior phlebitis or DVT, cancer). Interval duplex examination was performed at the discretion of the physician. Less than 5 percent of patients developed thrombus extension or DVT. This trial demonstrated a significant reduction in the primary efficacy outcome for the treatment group compared with placebo at 47 days immediately after stopping treatment (0.9 versus 5.9 percent) and out to day 77. The incidence of each component of the primary efficacy outcome was also significantly reduced in the fondaparinux group (symptomatic DVT [0.2 versus 1.2 percent], symptomatic PE [0 versus 0.3 percent], symptomatic SVT extension [0.3 versus 3.4 percent], symptomatic SVT recurrence [0.3 versus 1.6 percent]), except for the outcome of death (0.1 percent in both groups).

In those with extension ≤3 cm, DVT occurred in four patients and pulmonary embolism in one, and in those with extension &gt;3 cm, DVT occurred in three patients and pulmonary embolism in two patients. A cost model derived from the CALISTO trial data and other studies found that treatment of acute, isolated SVT with

No significant differences were found for the primary efficacy outcome at 45 or 90 days (composite of symptomatic DVT or pulmonary embolism, progression or recurrence of SVT, and all-cause mortality; hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% CI 0.6-6.4), or for the individual endpoints. There were no major bleeds in either group, but more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in the rivaroxaban group (3 versus &lt;1 percent). This trial demonstrated noninferiority of rivaroxaban when compared with fondaparinux at prophylactic doses for the prevention of subsequent thromboembolic risk over a period of 90 days from the initial diagnosis of SVT. Thus, rivaroxaban may offer a more cost-effective, oral option for the treatment of patients with SVT. (See

High risk was defined as age &gt;65, male sex, previous thromboembolism or prior SVT, cancer, autoimmune disease, or involvement of nonvaricose veins. Approximately 50 percent of patients had a history of DVT, PE, or SVT. Many believe that high-risk SVT patients may warrant longer treatment based upon the results of this trial, although there are no studies specifically looking at this. It may be that they require longer treatment at prophylactic doses or that they require therapeutic anticoagulation, but this remains unknown. What we do know from this study is that high-risk patients with SVT from SURPRISE are very different from low-risk patients from CALISTO.

         For thrombus in the great saphenous vein below the knee, we provide symptomatic care and monitor for propagation (clinically, ultrasound).

For focal thrombus, clinical monitoring may be sufficient; however, serial duplex ultrasound more accurately monitors the extent and propagation of thrombus. If thrombus propagation is demonstrated, we provide prophylactic anticoagulation for a duration for 45 days.

Thrombosis occurring in perforator veins is less well studied, but we can extrapolate that thrombus in proximity to the deep veins via a perforator is like thrombus close to the saphenofemoral junction, and anticoagulation, prophylactic or therapeutic, may be warranted depending on the perceived risk for VTE.

          Recurrent thrombophlebitis

         — Recurrent thrombophlebitis in a vein that previously responded to conservative therapy may require vein excision to prevent re-recurrence. For some patients with recurrent thrombophlebitis, vein excision can be performed once acute inflammation has subsided; removal of the vein precludes another episode of phlebitis at that location [

          62,64,87
         </a>
         ]. Two episodes in the same vein should prompt a discussion for intervention. However, compared with anticoagulation, surgical therapy (ligation of the saphenofemoral junction or excision of thrombosed superficial veins) appears to be associated with higher rates of VTE in the acute period [

          Lower extremity phlebitis and superficial vein thrombosis
         </strong>
         – Phlebitis and superficial vein thrombosis is generally benign and self-limited. When the axial veins (ie, great saphenous, anterior accessory saphenous, or small saphenous veins) are involved (typically varicosities), we refer to this as superficial vein thrombosis (SVT), which can be associated with concurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) at the initial presentation. Following appropriate management, there is also a subsequent risk of symptomatic DVT, symptomatic PE, extension of thrombus, and recurrence of the SVT. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         <strong>
          Risk factors
         </strong>
         – The risk of phlebitis and superficial vein thrombosis is increased in patients with varicose veins, abnormal coagulation or fibrinolysis, endothelial dysfunction, malignancy, infection, venous stasis, intravenous therapy, or intravenous drug abuse. Vein thrombosis in the absence of venous insufficiency should prompt a workup for occult malignancy and hypercoagulability. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk factors'

         <strong>
          Clinical presentations
         </strong>
         – The clinical diagnosis of SVT relies on findings of pain, tenderness, induration, and/or erythema along the known course of a superficial, typically varicose, vein. It is important to remember that the superficial veins can be several centimeters below the surface of normal-appearing skin, particularly in those with obesity, and patients may complain of pain (eg, along inner medial thigh) but have minimal physical findings (ie, no erythema or palpable cord). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – For patients with suspected thrombosis of an axial vein (great saphenous, anterior accessory saphenous, small saphenous veins), we suggest ultrasound upon initial presentation to rule out the presence of coexistent DVT and to evaluate the location and extent of thrombosis. Duplex ultrasound should also be performed for those in whom the clinical examination is uncertain, for lower extremity swelling that is greater than would be expected from thrombophlebitis alone, or for evidence of clinical progression during a period of follow-up. (See
         <a class="local">
          'When to obtain duplex ultrasound'

          Treatment of phlebitis
         </strong>
         – For all patients with phlebitis, symptomatic care measures should be instituted and consist of extremity elevation, warm or cool compresses, compression stockings, and pain management. (See

         <strong>
          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – Patients should undergo repeat physical examination within 7 to 10 days of their initial diagnosis to evaluate for resolution or progression. Any worsening of clinical symptoms or extension of signs of phlebitis on physical examination should prompt duplex ultrasound. (See
