Obstruction can occur at valvar, subvalvar, and supravalvar levels.</p><p>The most common form of LVOT obstruction in children is valvar aortic stenosis (AS), accounting for as many as 71 to 86 percent of patients [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. More than three-quarters of affected patients are male [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Valvar AS will be reviewed here. Subvalvar and supravalvar AS are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5776.html" rel="external">"Subvalvar aortic stenosis (subaortic stenosis)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among children with valvar aortic stenosis (AS), the most common cause is a bicommissural or bicuspid aortic valve, that is, only two leaflets are present rather than the normal three. Bicommissural aortic valve is associated with both congenital and acquired AS. It is also the most common cause of acquired AS in adults. As an example, a review of 932 adults who underwent operative excision of an AS valve reported that two-thirds of the patients had a bicommissural aortic valve [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The severity of AS progressed with age, with the majority of patients requiring surgical intervention after 50 years of age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8157.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Based upon large retrospective autopsy studies, bicommissural aortic valve had been estimated to occur in 1 to 2 percent of the general population [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>]. This is likely to be an overestimation, as demonstrated by two echocardiographic screening studies which reported a lower prevalence of 0.5 percent in both neonates [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] and school-aged children [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In each of these studies, bicommissural aortic valves were more common among males than females (0.7 versus 0.2 percent) [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Familial clustering has also been observed, as approximately 35 percent of patients with a bicommissural aortic valve have at least one additional family member with a bicommissural aortic valve [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Patients with congenital AS are slightly more likely to have offspring with congenital heart disease (CHD). This was illustrated in a report from the Second Natural History Study of Congenital Heart Defects (NHS-2) in which CHD occurred in 3 offspring of 251 (1.2 percent) males with AS and 1 of 72 females (1.4 percent) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]; these values are somewhat higher than the 0.5 to 0.8 percent incidence of CHD in live births in the general population [<a href="#rid1">1,13</a>].</p><p>Associated cardiovascular anomalies have been noted in as many as 20 percent of children with congenital AS [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Among patients with a bicommissural aortic valve, coexisting coarctation of the aorta is seen in approximately 6 percent of cases [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]; on the other hand, as many as 30 to 40 percent of patients with coarctation have a bicommissural aortic valve [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Dilated ascending aorta is commonly associated with bicommissural aortic valve. Less common concomitant congenital anomalies include ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, bicommissural pulmonic valve, and congenital mitral regurgitation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8157.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5760.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta"</a>.)</p><p>Less common forms of congenital AS include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unicommissural or unicuspid aortic valves, in which two of the three commissures are fused [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aortic annular hypoplasia, which may be an isolated abnormality or may be seen in association with leaflet abnormalities [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p></p><p>These rarer forms of congenital AS are often associated with severe obstruction to left ventricular outflow and heart failure in infancy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The normal aortic valve has three commissures, which results in three leaflets of approximately equal size [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The free margins of the leaflets have a semilunar shape. Normal leaflets are smooth and pliable. In older patients, a fibrous nodule may be located at the center of their free margins.</p><p>Mild aortic stenosis (AS) from a bicommissural aortic valve commonly progresses as the patient ages, although the rate is variable [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. In the majority of patients with bicommissural aortic valves, the size of the valve leaflets is unequal, which is thought to result from the fusion or absence of one of the three valve commissures; a false commissure or raphe is frequently present [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. With absence of the right-left (intercoronary) commissure, the most common form, the leaflets are oriented anterior and posterior, the raphe is usually in the anterior leaflet, and both coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses above the anterior leaflet. In a series of 1135 patients, this orientation was found in 70 percent of cases [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Less commonly, there is absence of the right-noncoronary commissure, and the leaflets are oriented to the right and left; the raphe is usually in the right leaflet, and the coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses above each leaflet  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef108115" href="/z/d/graphic/108115.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Absence or fusion of the left-noncoronary commissure is exceedingly rare. The free margins of a bicommissural valve are relatively straight rather than semilunar. This configuration limits their mobility [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Bicommissural valve morphology has clinical and prognostic importance, as illustrated in the review of 1135 patients cited above [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Patients with fusion of the right-noncoronary commissure had a higher incidence of valvar dysfunction: moderate or greater AS, and moderate or greater aortic regurgitation (AR). In contrast, patients with the more common absence of the right-left commissure had lesser degrees of aortic valve dysfunction but an increased incidence of coarctation of the aorta; 89 percent of patients with coarctation and a bicommissural aortic valve had the absent right-left commissure morphology.</p><p>In a subsequent nested cohort longitudinal study of 310 patients selected from the above study [<a href="#rid22">22</a>], patients with the right-noncoronary commissural absence compared with those with right-left commissural absence were more likely to require intervention because of more rapid progression of AS and AR [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>A unicommissural or unicuspid aortic valve results from the absence of two of the three commissures. Most commonly, the patent commissure is the left-noncoronary commissure, which results in a valve with an eccentric, teardrop-shaped opening that may extend leftward and posteriorly to the annulus. The valve is thus described as having a single "cusp." Absence of all three commissures results in aortic atresia and usually in the hypoplastic left heart syndrome.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most cases of valvar aortic stenosis (AS), systemic blood pressure and cardiac output remain normal because left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure and total cardiac work are elevated. Despite the increase in total cardiac work, wall stress remains normal or even reduced, presumably because of the compensatory increase in LV wall thickness. In a study of LV mechanics, the ejection fraction (0.88 versus 0.64) and mean velocity of fiber shortening (1.8 versus 1.22 circ/s) were higher in children with AS than in normal subjects [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>An important physiologic derangement in valvar AS is the relative reduction in coronary blood supply to a hypertrophied, hypertensive LV with increased myocardial oxygen demand. This may lead to subendocardial ischemia and infarction. The imbalance between supply and demand is due to a decrease in coronary perfusion pressure and a shortened diastolic filling period (due to prolonged systolic ejection across the stenotic orifice). This imbalance is exaggerated by exercise, which further shortens the diastolic filling period, decreases coronary perfusion, increases the gradient across the stenotic aortic valve, and results in both increased myocardial oxygen demand and decreased myocardial oxygen delivery [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most children with congenital valvar aortic stenosis (AS), even to moderate degrees, are relatively asymptomatic [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Patients with bicommissural valves and no stenosis still require long-term follow-up because progressive stenosis develops in approximately 75 percent of adults. Thickening and focal calcification of the bicommissural valve can be detected pathologically and on echocardiography as early as the second decade of life [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>More severe disease in childhood is not uncommon, as approximately 10 percent of patients develop heart failure during the first year after birth. Of these, approximately two-thirds become symptomatic by two months of age, and most present before six months. Infants with critical AS, the most severe form, present with signs of severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock in the neonatal period or shortly thereafter, following closure of the ductus arteriosus.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Critical aortic stenosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Critical AS is often well tolerated in utero because left ventricular (LV) output is decreased and the right ventricle (RV) supports a greater share of the fetal cardiac output via the ductus arteriosus. However, there are reports of in utero cardiac dysfunction, hydrops fetalis, and endocardial fibroelastosis due to critical AS [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. In particular, the rare combination of severe fetal AS and mitral regurgitation results in left heart dilation and compression of the RV, causing poor cardiac output and hydrops fetalis, and a poor outcome [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>In addition, severely restricted forward flow from critical AS may lead to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) with small left-sided heart structures in utero [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Fetal echocardiography may be helpful in predicting which fetuses with AS will develop HLHS. Identification of these fetuses becomes increasingly important with the possible development of in utero intervention to prevent the progression of AS to HLHS. In one study from a tertiary center, fetuses at midgestation (16 to 30 weeks gestation) who were more likely to develop HLHS had echographic findings of reversed blood flow in the transverse aortic arch, left-to-right blood flow across the foramen ovale, monophasic mitral valve inflow, and moderate to severe LV dysfunction [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. However, the ability to detect these changes is dependent on operator expertise, and in other clinical settings the ability to detect prenatal heart disease is low [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Fetal intervention'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116293.html" rel="external">"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome", section on 'Fetal intervention'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6755.html" rel="external">"Congenital heart disease: Prenatal screening, diagnosis, and management"</a>.)</p><p>Following delivery, the ductus arteriosus closes, pulmonary vascular resistance falls, and venous return to the left atrium increases. If the LV cannot fill or eject a sufficient volume of blood, cardiac output cannot be maintained, leading to signs and symptoms of heart failure or even cardiogenic shock [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. This condition is fatal without intervention.</p><p>Infants with critical AS may present at birth with poor peripheral perfusion and cyanosis. Physical examination reveals a hyperactive precordium and poor pulses. A cardiac murmur is frequently not heard because of the poor cardiac output. Although a gallop rhythm may be appreciated, an ejection click is almost never present. Distal pulses are often poor or inappreciable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Infantile aortic stenosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infants with severe, but not critical, AS present in infancy with heart failure. They typically have tachypnea, poor feeding, and growth failure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14373.html" rel="external">"Heart failure in children: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>A hyperactive precordium is usually present on physical examination. Most have a characteristic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border that radiates to the neck, although it may be very soft if heart failure is severe. An ejection click may be heard. Many patients have hepatomegaly and peripheral edema.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Older children</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Older children with AS are rarely symptomatic. Nearly all have appropriate growth and development [<a href="#rid26">26,34</a>]. Some patients report fatigability, which appears to be unrelated to the severity of AS. Angina and syncope occur in less than 5 percent of children with valvar AS and are more common in those with higher gradients [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>Older children typically have normal vital signs, including blood pressure. Auscultation and palpation may reveal one or more of the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51024" href="/z/d/graphic/51024.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Visible apical activity and an increased LV impulse on palpation are common with severe stenosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The first heart sound is usually normal, and the second heart sound is normally split unless stenosis is severe.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Approximately 60 to 90 percent of children with valvar AS have an ejection click, which is usually loudest at the apex or lower left sternal border  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef72877" href="/z/d/graphic/72877.html" rel="external">movie 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A systolic ejection murmur is present; its intensity is proportional to the extent of stenosis.

In addition, they are at risk for infectious endocarditis and sudden death [<a href="#rid35">35,37</a>].</p><p>The long-term outcome of this disorder was evaluated in the Second Natural History Study of Congenital Heart Defects (NHS-2) study, which included 371 patients (mostly children) with AS who underwent cardiac catheterization from 1958 to 1969; 92 percent were asymptomatic [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Most patients with gradients across the aortic valve ≥80 mmHg underwent valvotomy, whereas those with gradients &lt;50 mmHg were mostly treated medically. Patients with intermediate gradients had either medical or surgical therapy. The following findings were noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The probability of 25-year survival was 92.4 and 81 percent for patients with initial peak systolic ejection gradients &lt;50 or ≥50 mmHg, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 32 percent of 212 patients who were treated medically, obstruction progressed to a severe gradient, especially in the younger patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The likelihood of needing surgery in 25 years was 20, 40, and 60 percent for patients with initial gradients of &lt;25, 25 to 49, and 50 to 79 mmHg, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sudden death occurred in 25 patients (5 percent) and accounted for more than one-half of cardiac deaths. These patients were almost all older than 10 years and had significant obstruction and/or aortic regurgitation; 19 had prior surgery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infectious endocarditis occurred in 3 percent. In another report from this registry, the overall risk of endocarditis was 0.27 percent per year [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. The risk was greater in patients treated surgically (0.41 versus 0.16 percent per year in those with less severe disease who were treated medically). The applicability of these findings to current practice is uncertain since the data were obtained before widespread use of antimicrobial prophylaxis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2147.html" rel="external">"Prevention of endocarditis: Antibiotic prophylaxis and other measures"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>A study of patients with mild AS (initial systolic gradient between 10 and 25 mmHg) reported that a low gradient-slope of &lt;1.2 mmHg/year (change of gradient over time in years) was associated with a low risk of increasing obstruction and need for surgical correction [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Based upon their results, the authors suggested that follow-up echocardiography could be performed every four to five years in this low-risk group, but in children with higher gradient-slope (≥1.2 mmHg/year), echocardiography should be performed every one to two years.</p><p>A similar finding of a slow progression of obstruction in children with mild disease was reported in a retrospective study of 245 children with valvar AS followed over a mean of nine years (range 0.1 to 19.4 years) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The rates of intervention and mortality were greatest in patients diagnosed in infancy with more severe disease. Deaths in infants were mostly due to progressive left ventricular dysfunction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of valvar aortic stenosis (AS) is almost always made by physical examination and echocardiography.

(See <a class="local">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The diagnosis of valvar AS may be made on physical findings and generally confirmed by echocardiography  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef108115" href="/z/d/graphic/108115.html" rel="external">movie 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef59607" href="/z/d/graphic/59607.html" rel="external">movie 4</a>). Cardiac catheterization is performed if the severity/diagnosis remains uncertain, if there are associated defects that cannot be completely evaluated noninvasively, or if balloon aortic valvuloplasty is anticipated. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treatment is indicated for patients who present with severe obstruction, which is especially urgent in the critically ill neonate and infant with heart failure. In other patients, the decision to treat is based on the peak-to-peak systolic gradient obtained during cardiac catheterization (see <a class="local">'Indications for intervention'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with a peak-to-peak systolic gradient &gt;50 mmHg should be treated, as they are at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death due to progressive obstruction from their lesions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with a peak-to-peak systolic gradient &lt;25 mmHg can be followed medically on a regular basis as they have mild disease and are at low risk for mortality and morbidity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Data are less conclusive of patients with a peak-to-peak systolic gradient between 25 and 50 mmHg, as they are at intermediate risk for poor outcome. In our practice, we monitor their clinical status closely and intervene if there is a worsening of the gradient or development of symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Definitive therapy consists of reducing the degree of valvar stenosis. In our center, the treatment of choice is balloon valvuloplasty, regardless of the age and size of the patient, which has largely replaced surgical valvotomy. Aortic valve replacement is usually reserved for adults with congenital AS in whom balloon dilation is generally ineffective.
