         An adnexal mass (mass of the ovary, fallopian tube, or surrounding connective tissues) is a common gynecologic problem. Adnexal masses may be found in females of all ages, from fetuses to older adults, and there is a wide variety of types of masses  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). Pathology in this area may also arise from the uterus, bowel, retroperitoneum, or metastatic disease from another site, such as the gastrointestinal tract or breast.
        </p>

         The different types of adnexal masses are reviewed here. Diagnosis and management of an adnexal mass and other related topics are discussed separately:

         The uterine adnexa consist of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and surrounding vascular, lymphatic, and connective tissues  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55921" href="/z/d/graphic/55921.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The ovaries are suspended lateral and/or posterior to the uterus. The supporting structures of the ovaries include the utero-ovarian ligament that attaches the ovary to the uterus; the infundibulopelvic ligament (also referred to as the suspensory ligament of the ovary), through which the ovarian vessels travel, that attaches the ovary to the pelvic sidewall; and the broad ligament, which condenses to form the mesovarium. It is also attached to the broad ligament through the mesovarium.
        </p>
        <p>
         The ovary consists of an outer cortex, where the ova and follicles are located, and a medulla, where the blood vessels and connective tissue compose a fibromuscular tissue layer  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77045" href="/z/d/graphic/77045.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The fallopian tubes arise from the uterine corpus posterior and superior to the round ligaments. The broad ligaments support the tubes with a condensation of connective tissue called the mesosalpinx.

         The ovary includes several different tissue types. The most common neoplasms are epithelial. These derive from the stem cells that would typically give rise to fallopian tube epithelium (most high-grade serous carcinomas), or ovarian surface epithelium and inclusions (eg, cystadenomas). Ovarian germ cell tumors are derived from primordial germ cells of the ovary  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72286" href="/z/d/graphic/72286.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors derive from stem cells that would normally give rise to supporting epithelial cells, including ovarian stroma (eg, fibromas) and follicles (eg, granulosa cell tumors, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors).
        </p>
        <p>
         The fallopian tubes consist of an outer muscularis layer of the tube with longitudinal smooth muscle fibers and an inner layer with circular fibers. The fallopian tube mucosa is composed of numerous delicate papillary folds (plica) consisting of three cell types: ciliated columnar cells; nonciliated, columnar secretory cells; and intercalated cells, which may simply represent inactive secretory cells [

         There are many different types of adnexal masses  (

          table 1

         ). The likely etiology of an adnexal mass differs by age and reproductive status. This is because some masses are stimulated by reproductive hormones.

         In terms of frequency, the distribution of histologic types of adnexal masses in an international cross-section study from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group of over 4848 patients is shown in the table  (

         Follicular ovarian cysts are common in fetuses and increase in frequency with advancing gestational age and with some maternal complications (eg, diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, Rh isoimmunization).
        </p>
        <p>
         A pelvic mass in a newborn is most likely a physiologic cyst that initially arose due to maternal hormonal stimulation in utero. The differential diagnosis of an intra-abdominal mass in fetuses or neonates includes genitourinary tract disorders (eg, reproductive tract anomalies, urinary tract obstruction, urachal cyst), gastrointestinal tract disorders (eg, mesenteric or omental cyst, volvulus, colonic atresia, intestinal duplication), or miscellaneous disorders (eg, choledochal, splenic, or pancreatic cyst, lymphangioma).
        </p>
        <p>
         Between the neonatal period and puberty, physiologic cysts are uncommon because gonadotropin ovarian stimulation decreases in infancy and early childhood and then increases during puberty. Nevertheless, most simple ovarian cysts in children are physiologic and result from enlargement of a cystic follicle.
        </p>
        <p>
         Between menarche and age 18, ovulatory dysfunction is common due to an immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Adolescent ovaries may contain multiple follicles in different stages of development and include unilocular cysts (resulting from failure of the maturing follicle to ovulate and involute) and hemorrhagic cysts. These dysfunctional follicles typically resolve spontaneously and are often clinically insignificant.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ovarian neoplasms (benign and malignant) account for approximately 1 percent of all tumors in children and adolescents. Most ovarian masses are physiologic or benign neoplasms; fewer than 5 percent of ovarian cancers occur in this age group.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ovarian cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in patients ≤25 years of age, and germ cell tumors are the most common histology [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Germ cell tumors compose one-half to two-thirds of ovarian neoplasms in patients up to 18 years of age compared with 20 percent of ovarian neoplasms in adult patients. In patients younger than nine years of age, approximately 80 percent of ovarian neoplasms are malignant. Epithelial neoplasms are rare in the prepubertal age group.
        </p>
        <p>
         The etiology, diagnosis, and management of ovarian neoplasms from the fetal to adolescent age group are reviewed separately. (See

         There is a broad differential diagnosis of an adnexal mass in patients of reproductive age. Adnexal masses stimulated by reproductive hormones are found almost exclusively in this age group. These include physiologic cysts, endometriomas, and leiomyomas. Ovarian or tubal malignant neoplasms are uncommon in this age group, although the peak age for ovarian germ cell tumors is between ages 10 and 30 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Adnexal masses in the reproductive-age patients that are associated with reproductive hormones include some that result from an aspect of the menstrual cycle, including:

         Premenopausal patients may develop benign or malignant neoplastic adnexal masses. These occur most commonly in the ovary but may develop in the fallopian tube.

        <p>
         Common benign neoplasms include mature teratomas and cystadenomas. In general, ovarian or tubal cancers increase in incidence with increasing age and so are more common in postmenopausal patients. However, ovarian germ cell tumors (eg, teratomas) arise primarily in young patients between 10 and 30 years of age; they represent 70 percent of ovarian neoplasms in this age group [

         In the process of normal ovulation, a follicle develops to maturity and then ruptures to release an ovum; this is followed by formation and subsequent involution of the corpus luteum  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62189" href="/z/d/graphic/62189.html" rel="external">
          figure 4

          "Normal menstrual cycle"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Follicular cysts (also referred to as physiologic cysts) arise when rupture does not occur and the follicle continues to grow; corpus luteal cysts occur when the corpus luteum fails to involute and continues to enlarge after ovulation (the corpus luteum enlarges for the first six weeks of pregnancy and doubles its prepregnancy size [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]). These cysts are therefore called physiologic or functional. Either type may become hemorrhagic.
        </p>
        <p>
         Follicular cysts appear smooth, thin walled, and unilocular on ultrasound examination  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109386" href="/z/d/graphic/109386.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ), while corpus luteum cysts can look complex and grossly are yellow  (

          image 2
         </a>
         ). Unilocular cysts &lt;3 cm in diameter are considered to be normal follicles. Physiologic or follicular cysts can become quite large but are usually less than 10 cm in size. The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (RSU) Consensus Conference Statement has developed guidelines to address which cysts need to be followed and which can be ignored, this is discussed in detail separately [
         <a href="#rid6">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Corpus luteal cysts in the normal menstrual cycle may have a variety of appearances on ultrasound. They are unilocular and can contain internal debris (hemorrhage) and thick walls. They can also be enlarged, up to 8 cm, but typically resolve spontaneously [
         <a href="#rid7">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An early intrauterine pregnancy is always associated with a corpus luteum, which is typically &lt;2.5 cm in diameter. However, the corpus luteum may occasionally become enlarged and painful due to hemorrhage.
        </p>
        <p>
         Functional and corpus luteal cysts are generally asymptomatic unless they rupture, they become hemorrhagic, or torsion occurs. Most spontaneously resolve within a few weeks, but some persist for several months. (See

         Theca lutein cysts (also called lutein cysts or hyperreactio luteinalis) are luteinized follicle cysts that form as a result of overstimulation from high human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels or extreme sensitivity to hCG.

         Bilateral multiseptated cystic adnexal masses in a patient with gestational trophoblastic disease, multiple gestation, ovarian hyperstimulation, or a pregnancy complicated by fetal hydrops are likely to be theca lutein cysts rather than malignant neoplasms. This type of cyst can also occur in a normal pregnancy due to hypersensitivity to normal levels of hCG. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The classic phenotype of PCOS is a patient who is obese, hirsute, and anovulatory. Polycystic ovarian morphology visualized on ultrasound includes an antral follicle count &gt;20 and/or increased ovarian volume (&gt;10 mL, calculated using the formula 0.5 x length x width x thickness) in at least one of the ovaries. Typically, multiple small follicles (2 to 9 mm) at the periphery of the ovary and increased central stroma are also seen. (See

         Patients with endometriosis often complain of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia. An endometrioma, or "chocolate cyst," appears as a unilocular or multilocular cystic mass on ultrasound, typically containing homogeneous internal echoes. The ultrasound appearance of an endometrioma is often described as containing "ground glass" internal echoes  (

         A leiomyoma (fibroid) is a benign neoplasm of smooth muscle origin, which usually arises from the uterus but may also be found in the broad ligament  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73375" href="/z/d/graphic/73375.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients with symptomatic fibroids are in their 30s or 40s. Myomas are clinically apparent in approximately 25 percent of reproductive-age patients and noted on pathologic examination in approximately 80 percent of surgically excised uteri. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5486.html" rel="external">
          "Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Depending on the size and location of the leiomyoma, patients often present with complaints of pelvic pressure, pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and/or dysmenorrhea. Physical examination usually reveals an enlarged, irregularly shaped uterus that appears as a solid uterine tumor or tumors on ultrasound examination.
        </p>
        <p>
         A fibroid arising from the posterior uterus and projecting into the posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas) or coming from the fundus as a pedunculated mass can be confused with an ovarian neoplasm  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73375" href="/z/d/graphic/73375.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). Cystic degeneration of a fibroid can result in the appearance of a fluid-filled center of the fibroid on ultrasound. This, coupled with the fact that fibroids can cause an elevation in the serum cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) concentration, results in further concern that the mass may be a malignant ovarian neoplasm. Transvaginal imaging is key to differentiating between a leiomyoma in the adnexa from a solid ovarian tumor. First, the ovary must be found intact, normal, and completely separate from the leiomyoma. Also, Doppler flow can be used to see the vascular communication between the uterus and the pedunculated leiomyoma.

         A tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is an inflammatory mass involving the fallopian tube, ovary, and, occasionally, other adjacent pelvic organs (eg, bowel, bladder). This may manifest as a tubo-ovarian complex (an agglutination of those structures) or a collection of pus (TOA). These abscesses are found most commonly in reproductive-age patients and typically result from upper genital tract infection. TOA is usually a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
        </p>
        <p>
         Findings of abdominopelvic pain, fever, purulent cervical discharge, and cervical motion tenderness in association with an adnexal mass suggest a diagnosis of TOA. (See

         Untreated or undertreated cases of PID result in scarring or "clubbing" of the tubal fimbriae. This leads to a collection of either tubal secretions or pus, resulting in a hydrosalpinx or pyosalpinx, respectively.

        <p>
         After acute infection has resolved, a hydrosalpinx may remain. The tubal function is often compromised, and this may contribute to infertility. (See

        <p>
         A hydrosalpinx should be suspected when a dilated, tubular cystic structure is seen adjacent to the ovary. Hydrosalpinges often have incomplete septations. Three-dimensional ultrasound using sectional planes is useful to visually reconstruct the hydrosalpinx  (

         Compared with serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas occur less frequently, are more likely to be multiloculated, are larger (they can attain an enormous size), and are less often bilateral (less than 5 versus 20 to 25 percent)  (

         ) are rare, although it is now believed that most high-grade serous carcinomas in the adnexa arise in the fallopian tubes. Since the tubes and broad ligaments are not usually visualized on ultrasound examination, the source of these tumors may be erroneously attributed to the ovary or uterus, which are more common sites for neoplasms.

         The most common findings in this area are unilocular, anechoic, simple cysts that originate from the remnants of paramesonephric (müllerian) or mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts that are present during urogenital embryologic development  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107660" href="/z/d/graphic/107660.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. These are not neoplastic. The histology of these lesions may also be mesothelial. Paramesonephric cysts are most common, in particular the hydatid cyst of Morgagni [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. A hydatid cyst of Morgagni is attached to the tubal fimbriae and contains serous fluid surrounded by a translucent wall. These are non-neoplastic cysts lined by either mesothelium or fallopian tube-like epithelium.
        </p>
        <p>
         Neoplasms may also present as paratubal or paraovarian masses. In a retrospective study of 59 patients who underwent surgery for cystic paraovarian lesions, 75 percent had simple cysts and 25 percent had neoplastic lesions (seven cystadenomas and eight cystadenofibromas); there were no malignant neoplasms [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. A primary malignancy deriving from the paratubal or paraovarian lesions is rare; a literature review found 14 reports of malignant or borderline paraovarian epithelial neoplasms [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]; however, metastatic malignancies often involve the paraovarian or paratubal tissues.
        </p>
        <p>
         These cysts are usually discovered incidentally during pelvic sonography or surgery. There are no data regarding whether these cysts, either benign or malignant, are more common in pre- or postmenopausal patients. The key to diagnosis is a unilocular, anechoic cyst seen adjacent to a normal ovary.
        </p>
        <p>
         When a paratubal or paraovarian cyst is symptomatic, it most commonly presents as dull unilateral pelvic pain [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. As with larger ovarian cysts, a paratubal cyst may result in torsion of the adnexa and acute severe pain requiring emergency surgical intervention  (

          "Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion"
         </a>
         ). A simple, asymptomatic paratubal or paraovarian cyst can be managed expectantly. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         It is often difficult to distinguish between a paratubal cyst and an exophytic simple ovarian cyst as they can look similar on ultrasound. It is not clinically relevant to distinguish them as both are benign cysts and can be managed similarly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rarely, a leiomyoma may arise in the fallopian tube or broad ligament. An adenomatoid "tumor" may arise in the fallopian tube. It is unclear whether such a tumor is neoplastic. It is a benign mesothelial proliferation that grossly resembles a leiomyoma and histologically may be confused with a carcinoma [

Most primary ovarian neoplasms are partially cystic and derive from epithelial cells, although they can also arise from other cell types, such as germ cell, sex cord-stromal, and mixed cell types. Germ cell tumors are the second most common type of ovarian neoplasm in females younger than 30 years old, but they become rare after this age. (See

         Most adnexal cysts in postmenopausal patients are benign, but the incidence of ovarian cancer increases with advancing age; at least 30 percent of ovarian masses in patients over age 50 are malignant neoplasms [
         <a href="#rid23">

        <p>
         Nonmalignant etiologies of an adnexal mass in postmenopausal patients include many of those also seen in patients of reproductive age, such as cystadenoma, paraovarian cyst, or hydrosalpinx. Leiomyomas or endometriomas are stimulated by estrogen, serum levels of which decrease significantly after menopause. Thus, these lesions typically decrease in size in postmenopausal patients but may remain as smaller masses.

         Epithelial carcinoma is the most common histologic type of cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum, accounting for 90 percent of all cancers at these sites [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28

         The different subtypes also differ in risk factors and clinical behavior. It has been proposed that what had been diagnosed as ovarian or peritoneal serous carcinomas (HGSC and LGSC) may originate from fallopian tube precursors, serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasia/carcinoma in the case of HGSC, and endosalpingiosis/müllerian rests in the case of LGSC [

         High-grade tubal intraepithelial neoplasia/carcinoma is typically seen either associated with an ovarian or tubal mass or as a pathology result after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in a patient with a
         <em>

         The average age at diagnosis of ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal carcinoma is approximately 60-years old. Patients often present with vague gastrointestinal symptoms including dyspepsia, early satiety, anorexia, constipation, and bloating; these nonspecific complaints are associated with advanced disease. Physical findings may include an adnexal or abdominopelvic mass, abdominal distention with ascites, and/or pleural effusion. (See

         The ovaries and fallopian tubes are common sites of metastases of endometrial, breast, and some gastrointestinal malignant neoplasms. In studies of 50 or more cases of metastatic neoplasms to the ovary, the sites of primary tumors included colon cancer (15 to 32 percent), breast (8 to 28 percent), gastric (6 to 22 percent), and appendix (2 to 20 percent) [

         The prevalence of diverticular disease in the general population is age dependent, increasing from less than 5 percent at age 40, to 30 percent by age 60, and 65 percent by age 85. During an episode of diverticulitis, a tender mass is palpable in approximately 20 percent, and abdominal distention is common. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain (usually left lower quadrant), nausea and vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms. Diverticular disease should be considered in the older patient who presents with fever, left-sided pelvic pain, and a pelvic mass on pelvic or ultrasound examination.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a patient with constipation, a somewhat firm, usually mobile adnexal mass may be palpated on pelvic examination. However, this resolves if the constipation is treated.

         Examples of other bowel masses that may present as an adnexal mass include: appendiceal tumor or inflammatory mass, a tumor arising from a Meckel's diverticulum, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the small and large intestine.

         A peritoneal inclusion cyst may occur as a result of pelvic adhesions. The typical presentation is a patient with prior surgery (especially hysterectomy) or history of inflammation (pelvic inflammatory disease) with a cystic mass seen on transvaginal ultrasound that is not clearly palpable. The ultrasound appearance includes pockets of fluid in the pelvis separated by filmy adhesions that can move ("flapping sails" sign). Often the ovary, if present, is contained within the loculated fluid, which conforms to surrounding pelvic structures and sidewalls. There is generally an irregular-shaped exterior border rather than a round cyst [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Resolution of the loculated fluid or reduction of the volume may be seen over time as this is peritoneal fluid trapped within filmy adhesions. (See

         Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare neoplasm of the serosal membranes of the pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, or tunica vaginalis testes. The disease distribution is typically diffuse, but localized disease may occur and could potentially be detected as an adnexal mass. There are no signs or symptoms that are specific for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. The most frequent symptoms are abdominal distention/pain, weight loss, dyspnea, and chest pain. (See

         An ovarian cyst may become hemorrhagic (ie, there may be bleeding within the cyst). Patients with a hemorrhagic cyst may be asymptomatic or may present with mild to severe pelvic pain. Ultrasound features typically include a cystic mass with internal echoes, which vary depending on the evolution of a blood clot. There may be a fluid level if there has been fresh bleeding or a blood clot that appears as an avascular solid internal mass. Or there can be "cobweb" internal echoes as the blood clot resolves. Hemorrhagic cysts or hemorrhagic corpus luteum cysts usually occur with ovulatory dysfunction. Patients who are on anticoagulation are at increased risk. (See

         Ovarian torsion refers to the complete or partial rotation of the ovary on its ligamentous supports, often resulting in ischemia. The fallopian tube often twists along with the ovary; when this occurs, it is referred to as adnexal torsion. The primary risk factor for ovarian torsion is an ovarian mass and is most common if the ovary is 5 cm or larger.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pelvic ultrasound is the first-line imaging study for patients with suspected ovarian torsion and will identify a mass or cyst that is usually 5 to 10 cm. Power Doppler can be used to evaluate blood flow to the ovary, but the diagnosis and decision for surgery is a clinical one. Blood flow will be seen unless the torsion involves complete obstruction of the supplying vessels, so observing blood flow to the ovary does not rule out adnexal torsion. The "whirlpool sign" represents the twisted vascular pedicle as seen with color Doppler. A definitive diagnosis of ovarian torsion is made by direct visualization of a rotated ovary at the time of surgical evaluation. (See

          Clinical significance
         </strong>
         – An adnexal mass (mass of the ovary, fallopian tube, or surrounding connective tissues) is a common gynecologic problem and may be found in females of all ages. While there are many different types of adnexal masses  (

          Histology
         </strong>
         – Ovarian neoplasms derive from the three different ovarian cell types. The most common ovarian neoplasms are epithelial. These derive from the stem cells that would typically give rise to fallopian tube epithelium (most high-grade serous carcinomas), or ovarian surface epithelium and inclusions (eg, cystadenomas). Ovarian germ cell tumors are derived from primordial germ cells of the ovary  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72286" href="/z/d/graphic/72286.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors derive from stem cells that would normally give rise to supporting epithelial cells, including ovarian stroma (eg, fibromas) and follicles (eg, granulosa cell tumors, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors). (See

          Fetus, children, and adolescents
         </strong>
         – Ovarian neoplasms (benign and malignant) account for approximately 1 percent of all tumors in children and adolescents. In this age group, most ovarian masses are physiologic or benign neoplasms; fewer than 5 percent of ovarian masses in such patients are ovarian cancers. Germ cell tumors are the most common histologic type of ovarian cancer in children and adolescents. (See

          Premenopausal patients
         </strong>
         – There is a broad differential diagnosis of an adnexal mass in patients of reproductive age. Adnexal masses stimulated by reproductive hormones are found almost exclusively in this age group. These include physiologic cysts (eg, follicular cyst, corpus luteal cyst), endometriomas, and leiomyomas. Ovarian or tubal malignant neoplasms are uncommon in this age group, although the peak age for ovarian germ cell tumors is between ages 10 and 30 years. (See

         <strong>
          Postmenopausal patients
         </strong>
         – There is a high index of suspicion for ovarian cancer in postmenopausal patients with an adnexal mass. At least 30 percent of ovarian masses in patients over age 50 are malignant neoplasms. Nonmalignant etiologies of an adnexal mass in postmenopausal patients include many of those also seen in patients of reproductive age. Simple cysts are common in this age group and are rarely malignant. (See
