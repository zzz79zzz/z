         Thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count &lt;150,000/microL, is clinically suspected when a child develops characteristic clinical symptoms, which include a petechial rash, easy bruising or bleeding, or mucosal hemorrhage. Depending on the degree of thrombocytopenia, it can present with bleeding symptoms or may be asymptomatic (eg, an incidental finding during routine evaluation or during laboratory investigations performed for other reasons). A common cause of thrombocytopenia in children is immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), defined by consensus as isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100,000/microL) in the absence of an underlying condition [

          PLATELET COUNT AND BLEEDING RISK
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Bleeding risk generally increases with a low platelet count. This is because circulating platelets fulfill many critical hemostatic functions, including adhesion to sites of vascular injury, secretion of mediators of hemostasis, activation of the coagulation cascade, and aggregation via fibrinogen binding (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81908" href="/z/d/graphic/81908.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6683.html" rel="external">
          "Platelet biology and mechanism of anti-platelet drugs", section on 'Overview of platelet function'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The normal platelet count for children ranges from approximately 150,000 to 450,000/microL [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In general, the risk of bleeding does not increase until the platelet count falls well below 100,000/microL, and significant spontaneous bleeding is not likely to occur until the platelet count falls below 20,000/microL. Surgical bleeding solely due to a decreased platelet count typically occurs only if the platelet count is &lt;50,000/microL. If a patient with thrombocytopenia has bleeding that is out of proportion to the degree of thrombocytopenia, other potential causes of bleeding should be considered (eg, inherited functional platelet disorders, medications). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6675.html" rel="external">
          "Inherited platelet function disorders (IPFDs)"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The platelet lifespan ranges from 7 to 10 days, after which they are removed from the circulation by cells of the monocyte-macrophage system. Younger circulating platelets are generally larger and more hemostatically active. For example, at a platelet count of 20,000/microL, patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) have a higher proportion of younger circulating platelets and, consequently, less severe bleeding symptoms than patients with a similar degree of thrombocytopenia due to a production defect such as bone marrow failure or malignancy. Thus, for a given platelet count, bleeding risk is generally higher in patients with thrombocytopenia due to impaired platelet production primarily due to an older circulating population of platelets. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Reticulated platelets/immature platelet fraction'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         When thrombocytopenia is recognized or suspected, reasonable precautions to minimize bleeding risk should be implemented. This includes precautions to reduce the risk of traumatic injury, particularly head injury (eg, ensuring adult supervision during play; avoidance of contact and collision sports; and avoidance of other activities that pose high risk of head trauma with velocity such as trampolines or bounce houses or riding a bicycle, scooter, all-terrain vehicle, hoverboard, or similar vehicle without helmet). In addition, drugs that impair platelet function (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) should be avoided. (See

         Many children with mild or moderate thrombocytopenia may be asymptomatic, and thrombocytopenia may be first detected on a complete blood count (CBC) obtained for another reason. Patients with symptomatic thrombocytopenia generally present with cutaneous and/or mucosal bleeding (eg, easy bruising, petechiae, gingival bleeding, epistaxis). Some affected children with severe thrombocytopenia may have persistent, profuse bleeding from superficial cuts. In postmenarcheal females, thrombocytopenia may present with heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116.html" rel="external">
          "Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Evaluation and approach to diagnosis", section on 'Causes of heavy menstrual bleeding'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The pattern of bleeding differs between patients with thrombocytopenia and those with disorders of coagulation factors, such as hemophilia. Patients with thrombocytopenia are more likely to have bleeding after minor cuts and less likely to have deep bleeding into tissues, muscles, and joints or to have delayed bleeding. In patients with thrombocytopenia, posttraumatic or postoperative surgical bleeding usually responds to local measures. In addition, petechiae are a characteristic finding in patients with thrombocytopenia, whereas patients with coagulation disorders tend not to have petechiae. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1310.html" rel="external">

         Cutaneous bleeding is usually manifested as petechiae or superficial ecchymoses. Petechiae are small, red, flat, discrete lesions attributable to red cells which have extravasated from capillaries (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73905" href="/z/d/graphic/73905.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). They often occur in crops in dependent areas, are nontender, and do not blanch under pressure. Petechiae that are confluent form a type of purpura that is

          not
         </strong>
         <strong>
          palpable
         </strong>
         (in contrast with the palpable purpura seen in vasculitic disorders). (See

          "Vasculitis in children: Evaluation overview"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Ecchymoses and hematomas are larger areas of bleeding into the skin (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59402" href="/z/d/graphic/59402.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). The affected area of the skin is initially red or purple due to the presence of extravasated blood and then evolves to green, orange, and yellow due to breakdown of heme pigment by skin macrophages. Ecchymotic lesions in patients with thrombocytopenia are usually small, multiple, and superficial. They may develop without trauma and in areas not usually prone to bruising such as the back or chest.

          3
         </a>
         ]. However, thrombocytopenia-associated bleeding in children, particularly children with immune thrombocytopenia, is very heterogeneous and unpredictable [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Further validation of predictors for severe bleeding are needed in children with thrombocytopenia. To date, no factors have been identified that can accurately predict at the time of presentation whether a child will develop more serious bleeding.

         Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a rare but serious consequence of thrombocytopenia and is the most common cause of death in affected patients. When ICH occurs, it is often preceded by a history of head trauma. (See

         The initial step in the evaluation of suspected thrombocytopenia in children is verification of a low platelet count. Once thrombocytopenia has been confirmed, the evaluation is focused on determining the underlying etiology so that directed therapeutic measures can be implemented. The evaluation includes a detailed history, complete physical examination, and laboratory testing.

         A platelet count that is inconsistent with the clinical presentation of the patient (such as a platelet count &lt;20,000/microL in a patient with no petechiae or other abnormalities) should be confirmed before extensive evaluation is undertaken to ensure that the low platelet count is not due to artifact or laboratory error. This can be accomplished through repeating testing or, preferably, review of the peripheral blood smear by a qualified observer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Spurious thrombocytopenia can be caused by improper collection, delayed processing, or inadequate anticoagulation of the blood sample, resulting in platelet clumps that are counted as leukocytes by automated cell counters. In addition, agglutination of platelets by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-dependent antibodies, which are normally present in 0.1 percent of adults, may cause a falsely low platelet count (referred to as pseudothrombocytopenia). EDTA exposes a normally concealed epitope on the platelet membrane, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, which interacts with these antibodies, resulting in platelet clumping. Examination of the blood smear will demonstrate large clumps, often found on the edges of the blood film, of agglutinated platelets or adherent platelets surrounding neutrophils. The presence of pseudothrombocytopenia can also be confirmed by collecting a blood sample in a non-EDTA anticoagulant tube such as sodium citrate and confirming a normal platelet count.

         The history should document the onset, frequency, and severity of present and past bleeding symptoms. The family history should be reviewed, focusing on family members with a history of bleeding or thrombocytopenia. Other components of the history may provide clues to the underlying etiology of thrombocytopenia (

         The extent of the bleeding should be evaluated and documented in detail. Bleeding into the skin is one of the most common findings in patients with thrombocytopenia and may include petechiae, nonpalpable purpura, and ecchymoses (see
         <a class="local">
          'Cutaneous bleeding'
         </a>
         above). Sites of bleeding should be noted, especially dependent parts of the body. Serial examinations can monitor the patient's clinical course by noting changes in the number of petechiae or bleeding pattern within involved areas. In hospitalized patients, careful examination for bleeding should be performed at the sites of indwelling catheters, drains and incisions, areas of previous trauma, and exit sites of venous access devices. The gingival and oral cavity should be examined carefully for evidence of bleeding.

         A low MPV (3 to 5 fL) is almost exclusively seen in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome or X-linked thrombocytopenia. (See

         These abnormalities should be further evaluated by visual examination of the peripheral blood smear since both platelet counts and calculated MPV from automated cell counters can be inaccurate when platelet size is outside of the reference range [

         Reticulated platelets (RP) are the youngest circulating platelets, analogous to the relationship between reticulocytes and mature red blood cells. RPs can be quantified by flow cytometry or with an automated measurement called the "immature platelet fraction" (IPF). IPF is not available on all automated blood cell counters, though it is increasingly available on newer models. Additional details about this testing are provided separately. (See

         In many cases, the cause of thrombocytopenia can be determined based on the history, physical examination, and initial laboratory testing (CBC and blood smear). For example, in an otherwise well-appearing child who presents with sudden-onset mucocutaneous bleeding without other systemic signs or symptoms and with laboratory confirmation of isolated thrombocytopenia, a provisional diagnosis of ITP can be made. The initial evaluation in this setting is summarized in the table and discussed in detail separately (

          Bleeding symptoms

         – Symptomatic patients generally present with cutaneous (petechiae, nonpalpable purpura, ecchymoses) and/or mucosal (epistaxis, gingival bleeding, bullous hemorrhage, menorrhagia) bleeding. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a rare but serious consequence of thrombocytopenia and is the most common cause of death in these patients. When ICH occurs, it is often preceded by a history of head trauma. (See

          Verify the finding
         </strong>
         – The initial step in the evaluation of suspected thrombocytopenia in children is verification of the low platelet count. In particular, a platelet count that is inconsistent with the clinical picture (eg, a platelet count &lt;20,000/microL in a patient with no petechiae or other bleeding symptoms) should be confirmed before extensive evaluation is undertaken to ensure that the low platelet count is not due to artifact, laboratory error, or pseudothrombocytopenia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Verification of thrombocytopenia'
         </a>

         <strong>
          History and physical examination
         </strong>
         – Once thrombocytopenia has been confirmed, the evaluation is focused on determining the underlying etiology (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61163" href="/z/d/graphic/61163.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The evaluation starts with a detailed history and physical examination. One of the most common causes of thrombocytopenia in childhood is immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), which typically presents with the sudden appearance of a petechial rash in a previously healthy and otherwise well-appearing child. Thrombocytopenia associated with systemic symptoms and/or the presence of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly should raise suspicion for malignancy or other proliferative process; patients with these signs or symptoms should be evaluated expeditiously.

         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Laboratory evaluation
         </strong>
         – Laboratory evaluation of thrombocytopenia begins with a complete blood count (CBC) and evaluation of the peripheral blood smear. The blood smear must be carefully examined for estimation of platelet number, size, and morphology (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89962" href="/z/d/graphic/89962.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ); presence of platelet clumping; and any associated white or red blood cell abnormalities. (See

         Bone marrow examination is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         routinely required for the initial evaluation in most cases of unexplained isolated thrombocytopenia in children. Bone marrow examination is indicated in patients with evidence of involvement of other blood cell lines (anemia, leukopenia, or peripheral blasts), systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, bone pain), abnormal physical examination findings (specifically, lymphadenopathy and/or organomegaly). (See
