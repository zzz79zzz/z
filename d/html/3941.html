Various treatments are available, depending upon the specific genetic defect and the parts of the immune system affected. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the treatment of choice for most cases of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and is also a treatment option for several other forms of IEI including many combined immunodeficiencies, syndromic immunodeficiencies, immune dysregulatory disorders, phagocytic cell defects, some defects of innate immunity, and a few autoinflammatory disorders. Improvements in HCT procedures and supportive care have resulted in better outcomes.</p><p>This topic reviews aspects of HCT specific to patients with IEI other than SCID, which is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115988.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiencies"</a>.)</p><p>Numerous topics discuss other aspects of HCT:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3537.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): Sources of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3535.html" rel="external">"Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1399.html" rel="external">"Evaluation for infection before hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3538.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic support after hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3542.html" rel="external">"Prevention of graft-versus-host disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129806.html" rel="external">"Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease) in adults", section on 'Introduction'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129806.html" rel="external">"Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease) in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The general aspects of medical therapy for immunodeficiency, including therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a>, prophylactic antimicrobials, biologic therapies, vaccination recommendations, and gene therapy, are also discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3948.html" rel="external">"Inborn errors of immunity (primary immunodeficiencies): Overview of management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3911.html" rel="external">"Immune globulin therapy in inborn errors of immunity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3882.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106521.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in patients with inborn errors of immunity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3938.html" rel="external">"Overview of gene therapy for inborn errors of immunity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1159816883"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allogeneic HCT is indicated for treatment of typical SCID since it is the only potentially curative, nonexperimental therapy available for a condition that, if untreated, is almost always lethal in the first few years of life. However, use of HCT is less clear cut for other forms of IEI. Factors to consider include the type of IEI, the severity of the phenotype in a particular patient, the survival and quality of life with and without HCT of previously reported cases with the same condition, and whether the disease manifestations can be prevented or improved with HCT  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96738" href="/z/d/graphic/96738.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Discussing the role of allogeneic HCT for each individual genetic disease is beyond the scope of this topic since there are more than 450 IEI. Rather, a broad overview regarding the types of IEI that are usually or sometimes treated with allogeneic HCT and nuances relative to certain disease types is presented in this topic.</p><p>The familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) disorders are an example of a disease group for which allogeneic HCT is almost always used. HLH in these disorders is almost universally fatal if left untreated, and life-threatening hyperinflammation will generally keep reoccurring in patients with familial HLH without curative allogeneic HCT. Thus, the decision to perform allogeneic HCT is straightforward in these patients if the patient can tolerate the procedure and a suitable stem cell donor is available. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) also generally suffer repeated life-threatening complications of their diseases, and allogeneic HCT is often performed in these patients. On the other end of the spectrum, patients with predominantly antibody deficiencies are infrequently treated with allogeneic HCT since most of these patients can have an acceptable quality of life and life expectancy with medical management.</p><p>For some disorders, the indication for allogeneic HCT is less clear. As an example, the indication for allogeneic HCT in patients with CD40 ligand (CD40L) deficiency remains controversial. A large, retrospective study of 176 transplanted and nontransplanted patients was published in 2017 and observed no survival advantage for transplanted patients compared with untransplanted patients [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, the study included patients who were diagnosed with CD40L deficiency as far back as 1964, and HCT outcomes have improved significantly since then. One-year survival following allogeneic HCT was close to 90 percent for patients who were transplanted between 2006 and 2013. In addition, surviving patients in another study who were treated with allogeneic HCT had higher quality-of-life scores than patients who were not transplanted [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1081718290"><span class="h1">PRETRANSPLANT CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are several considerations surrounding allogeneic HCT for IEI including the underlying diagnosis, patient health status, donor options, local transplant center practice preferences and experience, and parental/caregiver understanding and willingness. Practice patterns for patients with non-SCID IEI vary greatly among transplant centers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H615560159"><span class="h2">Parent/caregiver preferences</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A major challenge is that parents/caregivers may not agree to exposing their child to the risks of HCT early in life before onset of major infections or organ damage, but the risks of HCT increase after these complications have occurred.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335817085"><span class="h2">Conditioning chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SCID is the only immunodeficiency in which the complete absence of T cell immunity sometimes allows HCT to be performed without chemotherapy in selected cases. In all other conditions, there is sufficient host immunity to resist engraftment of allogeneic cells. Thus, some type of pretransplant conditioning is always required to allow engraftment of donor-derived stem cells in non-SCID combined immunodeficiencies (eg, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome [WAS], X-linked hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome); disorders of phagocytic cell function (eg, chronic granulomatous disease [CGD], leukocyte-adhesion deficiency [LAD]); diseases of immune dysregulation (eg, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [HLH]); and other categories of IEI. The patient's underlying genetic defect, health status, available donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match, and other factors influence the type of conditioning chemotherapy used.</p><p>Conditioning regimens were historically classified as myeloablative (MAC), nonmyeloablative (NMA), or reduced intensity (RIC) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. MAC regimens irreversibly ablate recipient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and exogenous HSCs must be given in order to achieve count recovery. NMA regimens do not result in irreversible marrow destruction, and autologous marrow recovery can occur. RIC regimens fall somewhere in between MAC and NMA regimens and can also allow some autologous marrow recovery following transplant, which may result in mixed chimerism. MAC regimens have the benefit of increased success of engraftment but are associated with higher toxicities compared with RIC regimens, which have fewer toxicities but can be associated with decreased stable engraftment. Subsequently, conditioning regimens that are myeloablative but reduced in intensity compared with traditional fully myeloablative <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9173" href="/z/d/drug information/9173.html" rel="external">busulfan</a> (16 mg/kg) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> regimens have come into use in some IEIs. As an example, a regimen that targets busulfan exposure to achieve myeloablation but reduce toxicities using pharmacokinetic-guided dosing and includes <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8452" href="/z/d/drug information/8452.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a> is often used in patients with CGD and some other IEIs. This type of approach is sometimes referred to as a "reduced toxicity" regimen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3557.html" rel="external">"Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1446570188"><span class="h2">Conditioning serotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conditioning regimens often also contain serotherapies such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8725" href="/z/d/drug information/8725.html" rel="external">alemtuzumab</a> or antithymocyte globulin. These agents deplete recipient T cells and help prevent graft rejection. These agents often linger through the early peritransplant period and so also deplete donor graft T cells, which can help prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2472851847"><span class="h2">Donor choice</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As with all allogeneic HCT, an HLA-matched related donor (MRD), such as an unaffected brother or sister, is considered the optimal choice for non-SCID HCT [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, fewer than 20 percent of patients in the US have such a donor, although this may not be the case in cultures with high degrees of consanguinity and large sibship sizes. Alternatives include a matched unrelated donor (MUD/MURD), a mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD), a mismatched related donor (MMRD), or an umbilical cord blood (UCB) donor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3535.html" rel="external">"Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4096263235"><span class="h3">Matched related (sibling) donor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historically, transplants with a matched related (sibling) donor (MRD/MSD) have had the highest rate of overall survival (see <a class="local">'Long-term prognosis'</a> below). For example, an older, large European study of 783 patients with non-SCID IEI transplanted between 1968 and 2005 observed a 71 percent 10-year survival among patients transplanted with a related, genotypically identical donor compared with 39 to 63 percent for all other donor types [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>However, many non-SCID immunodeficiencies do not manifest early in life or are not diagnosed early in their course, and there can be considerable differences in severity. Thus, an essential part of screening for potential related donors is to test them for the condition affecting the patient. This process may identify an apparently healthy relative as genetically affected with the same condition as the patient, a circumstance that can cause distress not only by disqualifying a potential donor but also by revealing new, unwelcome information.</p><p>An additional issue is whether female carriers of X-linked conditions, even if HLA matched, should be used as related donors for their affected male relative. Females heterozygous for X-linked CGD themselves have a higher incidence of autoimmune disease than noncarriers, and, in addition, those who by chance have unbalanced X-chromosome inactivation in their hematopoietic cell lineages may themselves experience infections similar to those of affected males [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Use of such donors could result in engraftment of a new immune system that would not fully correct the patient's original defect. There is no consensus regarding whether or not to use carrier siblings, since there are no large studies that demonstrate the frequency with which recipients develop clinical problems related to the use of a carrier sibling in the various IEI. The risk probably also depends upon the degree of skewing of X-chromosome inactivation. The donor choice decision is often determined by the primary transplant clinician who considers other characteristics of the potential sibling donor (such as size of the sibling, which can affect the amount of the anticipated stem cell collection), what potential MUD options exist, urgency of transplant, and other factors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1749923196"><span class="h3">Other donor types</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Options for patients without a matched sibling donor include an adult MUD, an adult MMUD, an MMRD such as a haploidentical parent, or UCB that has been cryopreserved in a cord blood repository. Historically, success rates have been lower with these donor sources due to graft rejection and GVHD. However, improvements in graft processing, conditioning regimens, and prevention of posttransplant complications have made MUD HCT outcomes almost as good as patients transplanted with an MRD. As an example, a study of reduced-toxicity conditioning in CGD observed a two-year overall survival of 100 percent for MRD transplants and 94 percent for MUD transplants [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. For patients who lack an MRD or MUD, mismatched donor transplantation can be pursued, but the degree of mismatch directly affects survival [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. There are several options to attenuate the risks of GVHD and mortality, including graft engineering or the use of aggressive GVHD prophylaxis strategies such as including posttransplant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>. Several centers have reported success with the use of T cell-depleted MUD or MMRD grafts [<a href="#rid9">9-13</a>]. In a large series of 98 patients, overall survival was 86 percent in the MUD group and 87 percent in the MMRD group [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In two reports of haploidentical transplantation with posttransplant cyclophosphamide that included sizable groups of non-SCID IEI, two-year overall survival was 65 to 78 percent [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p>Unrelated donor registries, including the US National Marrow Donor Program (publicized with the "Be the Match" campaign) have enlisted millions of volunteers who have given blood samples for HLA typing and indicated willingness to donate bone marrow or peripheral mobilized HSCs anonymously if a patient needing a transplant of their HLA type is identified. Although not all ethnicities are equally represented, the unrelated donor registry now provides donors for the majority of patients lacking an unaffected matched sibling.</p><p>There are also large repositories of donated, cryopreserved UCB. In the past, GVHD was less of a problem with UCB transplants than adult MUD transplants, but the gap has closed with graft engineering of adult donor cells. In addition, UCB units have a limited cell number and no possibility of returning to the same donor for additional cells if a boost is needed, making UCB a less viable option for older, larger patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3968223166"><span class="h2">Graft engineering</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Removal of T cells from the graft decreases the risk of GVHD. However, this process can result in higher rates of graft failure and increase the time to immune recovery, resulting in increased rates of infection and viral reactivation and lower rates of survival. T cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta/CD19 depletion removes these T cells (and CD19+ B cells) but leaves behind TCR gamma delta T cells and natural killer (NK) cells that should improve immune recovery and infection control compared with other methods of T cell depletion [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Grafts can also undergo CD34+ selection to select out only the CD34+ stem cells for infusion. Other graft manipulation techniques also exist.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1000854160"><span class="h1">COMPLICATIONS OF HCT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complications during and following HCT include infections, toxicities from cytoreductive chemotherapy, graft failure, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Late effects such as endocrinopathies and fertility problems also occur. The incidence of these adverse events varies with the type of HCT, conditioning regimen, and underlying disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H576319853"><span class="h2">Infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infection is one of the most common causes of mortality after HCT. All patients who undergo allogeneic HCT are at risk of bacterial, fungal, and viral infections and should receive appropriate prophylactic antimicrobial treatments during allogeneic HCT. However, there are some unique situations that can occur in IEI patients depending on the underlying disorder. At the time of HCT, for example, patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) may have refractory fungal or bacterial infection, and patients with interferon gamma receptor deficiencies may have refractory atypical mycobacterial infections. Unique situations such as these require experienced teams of care providers, and all patients with IEI should be thoroughly evaluated for infections prior to transplant. Control and prevention of infections are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15803.html" rel="external">"Early complications of hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Prevention of infection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1403.html" rel="external">"Overview of infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1397.html" rel="external">"Prevention of infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16533.html" rel="external">"Prevention of viral infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H234207968"><span class="h2">Management of toxicity from cytoreductive chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients can experience a variety of early complications related to allogeneic HCT. An expected complication of cytoreductive chemotherapy is myelosuppression with attendant cytopenias. Patients may have bleeding, anemia, or suffer infections related to leukopenia. Blood and platelet transfusions are usually required during the period of marrow aplasia. Mucositis may occur and limit oral nutrition. Patients often require enteral or intravenous nutrition supplementation. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease or transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy can occur.

Primary graft failure is typically defined as a failure to engraft following allogeneic HCT [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Patients may require an emergent second transplant in the absence of autologous recovery. Secondary graft failure is typically said to have occurred if engraftment initially occurred but was subsequently lost, resulting in cytopenias in at least two blood cell lineages [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Graft failure can be due to immune-mediated rejection and is sometimes referred to as graft rejection in this situation. Secondary graft failure can also be said to have occurred in the setting of having only low-level donor chimerism in either whole blood or within a particular cell type relevant to the underlying IEI. For instance, a patient with CGD who is nine months posttransplant with normal complete blood count parameters but only 4 percent donor chimerism in peripheral blood and 2 percent in myeloid cells is considered to have secondary graft failure.

Nonmyeloablative (NMA) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens are associated with increased rates of graft failure. Underlying disease can also increase the risk, and patients with immune dysregulatory diseases such as immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) and gain-of-function signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (<em>STAT1</em>) mutations have increased rates of graft failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H829407782"><span class="h2">Mixed chimerism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following allogeneic HCT, especially if patients receive NMA conditioning or RIC, recipient marrow can recover alongside donor marrow engraftment. Mixed chimerism is often defined as having donor-derived cells that account for less than 95 percent of peripheral blood samples. Patients with most IEI do not require complete donor chimerism for cure of the underlying disease but may develop symptoms of disease with ill-defined low levels of donor chimerism (generally less than 5 to 20 percent) within relevant cell types.

A history of respiratory impairment and malnutrition adversely affected survival. A report from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) included 1902 patients with non-SCID IEI [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Three-year overall survival in the 816 non-SCID patients transplanted between 2010 and 2016 was 75 percent.</p><p>There are several complications of allogeneic HCT that manifest late after transplant.

Diabetes caused by immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, and enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) or other immune dysregulatory disorders does not resolve.

Some IEI are characterized predominantly by risk of life-threatening infections, and the range of infections can be broad or limited to only a few specific pathogens. Other IEI are characterized predominantly by immune dysregulation and manifest as life-threatening autoimmunity or hyperinflammation. The variability in disease pathophysiology and clinical manifestations among different IEI results in nuanced approaches to some specific IEI or IEI phenotypic groups. The frequency at which HCT is used also varies by phenotypic category  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96738" href="/z/d/graphic/96738.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

However, the probability of success with this approach is not high, and genetic counseling is essential.

However, there are many life-threatening complications of allogeneic HCT. Thus, clinicians must weigh the risks and benefits of allogeneic HCT against the risks of the underlying IEI. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Parent/caregiver preferences</strong> – A major challenge with HCT for IEI other than severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is that parents/caregivers may not agree to expose their child to the risks of HCT early in life, before onset of major infections or organ damage, but the risks of HCT are greater after these complications have occurred. (See <a class="local">'Parent/caregiver preferences'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Conditioning chemotherapy</strong> – There is sufficient host immunity to resist engraftment of allogeneic cells in all non-SCID IEI. Thus, some type of pretransplant conditioning is always required to prevent graft failure. (See <a class="local">'Conditioning chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Donor choice</strong> – As with all allogeneic HCT, a matched related (sibling) donor (MRD/MSD) is considered the optimal choice. However, improvements in graft processing, conditioning regimens, and prevention of posttransplant complications have made matched unrelated donor (MUD) and mismatched related donor (MMRD) HCT viable options in patients without an MSD. (See <a class="local">'Donor choice'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognosis following HCT</strong> – Survival rates following allogeneic HCT for most non-SCID IEI are approximately 70 percent or higher, and, in general, younger age and better health status (particularly absence or control of severe infections and/or autoimmune disease) at the time of transplantation are associated with superior outcomes. (See <a class="local">'Pretransplant considerations'</a> above and <a class="local">'Long-term prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genotype-specific considerations</strong> – Specific genotypes may require different approaches to HCT and have distinct outcomes and complications.
