         Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor that usually occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3599.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology and risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the best long-term survival is observed after surgical therapies, most patients are not eligible because of tumor extent or underlying liver dysfunction. Surgical resection is a potentially curative therapy for patients without cirrhosis or for those patients with cirrhosis who lack portal hypertension, and liver transplantation is a potentially curative therapy for select patients who are not candidates for resection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2488.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         For individual patients, appropriate treatment options are determined both by the extent of the HCC and the severity of underlying liver disease, which can limit tolerance to all therapies (medical, interventional, or surgical).

        <p>
         This topic provides an overview of the treatment of HCC, focusing on the integration of systemic and locoregional therapies. Detailed discussions on individual treatment options are available.

         An overview of our general approach to treatment of HCC is shown in the algorithm  (

         ). Support for this approach is presented in the sections below.
        </p>
        <p>
         The availability, efficacy and safety of specific therapeutic approaches, especially nonsurgical liver-directed therapies, tend to vary based upon the available expertise. We strongly urge that patients with HCC be referred to specialized centers of excellence with multidisciplinary expertise so that the entire range of potentially available treatments can be offered.

         The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system has been a dominant approach to HCC internationally [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The BCLC staging classification comprises of five stages that are based on the extent of the primary lesion, performance status, vascular invasion, and extrahepatic spread; this classification was updated in 2022  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139139" href="/z/d/graphic/139139.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         However, growing movements in the West and in Asia disagree with some principles of the algorithm [
         <a href="#rid3">

         The BCLC algorithm does not acknowledge the potential value of resection for patients that do not fit their eligibility criteria, including some patients with single large tumors and those with multiple nodules [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], or limited macrovascular invasion. Selected patients with large or multifocal tumors, or limited vascular invasion may in fact benefit from surgical resection, as described below. However, the best results are achieved with careful patient selection, which should be done in the setting of multidisciplinary evaluation and in high-volume centers with surgical expertise. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2488.html" rel="external">

         In one large multi-institutional study among 2046 consecutive patients undergoing resection for HCC in high-volume centers, nearly one-half (1012) were not directed by the Barcelona algorithm to have surgery, yet survival was far better than that predicted by the BCLC (five-year overall survival rates were 61, 57, and 38 percent for patients with Barcelona stage 0/A, B, and C, respectively; overall 90-day mortality was &lt;3 percent) [

         A meta-analysis of seven studies (one randomized trial, six propensity score-matched retrospective analyses, total 2487 patients) concluded that for patients with BCLC stage B HCC, partial hepatectomy was associated with better overall survival than transarterial chemoembolization (TACE; hazard ratio [HR] 1.65, 95% CI 1.48-1.84) [

         Large tumor size does not appear to impact survival when vascular invasion is absent (eg, T1 tumors according to the Tumor, Node, Metastasis [TNM] staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC]/Union for International Cancer Control [UICC]  (

         </a>
         ]. Further, patients with T2 tumors (a solitary tumor with vascular invasion or multiple tumors, none more than 5 cm) may be suitable candidates for resection when liver function permits. Others have shown benefit from hepatic resection for patients with single HCCs over 5 cm in diameter and selected patients with tumors ≥10 cm. For these patients, multidisciplinary discussion is recommended to discuss surgical resection versus liver transplantation.

Although the algorithm suggests systemic chemotherapy for all patients, some may benefit from locoregional treatments (including resection) rather than systemic therapy. As an example, patients with a subsegmental branch tumor thrombus involving the portal vein (ie, Vp1 or Vp2) have a better prognosis and are potential candidates for certain locoregional treatments or surgical resection. By contrast, patients with more extensive tumor-associated thrombus involving the main portal vein (Vp3 or 4) have a less favorable outcome with most locoregional treatments, and may be better candidates for initial systemic chemotherapy. These issues and the classification system for PVTT is described in more detail below. (See

         Patients with limited BCLC stage B disease who are initially beyond the classic Milan Criteria and who respond to TACE or other locoregional therapy may be downstaged to where they are eligible for liver transplantation. Several studies have shown that patients who present with BCLC stage B disease who are successfully downstaged have good overall survival and low recurrence post-transplant. The XXL trial also demonstrated that patients who undergo liver transplantation after downstaging have significantly better survival than those patients who continue locoregional therapy alone [

         The availability, efficacy, and safety of specific therapeutic approaches, especially nonsurgical liver-directed therapies, tend to vary based upon the available expertise.

         New treatments for HCC and indications for various treatments are evolving rapidly. This is especially true in the area of systemic therapy. Given recent advances, the best way to integrate systemic and locoregional therapies is increasingly difficult to delineate as eligibility for individual treatments becomes blurred. (See

         These new developments have particular implications for the management of patients with liver-limited disease who are not surgical candidates because of large tumor size, number of lesions, or technically inoperable disease, but whose liver function is adequate to tolerate some form of therapy (intermediate stage, BCLC B stage,  (

However, not all patients who receive these therapies have a survival benefit, and some will never receive systemic therapy because of disease progression or decline in hepatic function. The increasing arsenal of effective systemic therapies, especially immunotherapies, has raised new questions about appropriate selection of patients with unresectable HCC for locoregional versus systemic therapies, including whether patients should be deemed refractory to locoregional therapy before switching to systemic therapies, and whether combination strategies would improve outcomes [

         At some institutions, systemic therapy is no longer reserved until failure of all local liver-directed therapies, but instead, used earlier, and sometimes in place of locoregional therapy, especially for patients with a large intrahepatic disease burden or PVTT. This practice is based on lower objective responses and higher risk of liver dysfunction with locoregional therapies in these settings when compared with patients with more limited tumor burden. Although there is no consensus definition for "TACE unsuitable" patients, the Asia-Pacific Consensus statement suggests that patients with tumor burden beyond "Up-to-Seven" Criteria, those with infiltrative disease, or those with bilobar multifocal disease are better candidates for up-front systemic therapy [

         The wide variety of treatments for HCC are offered by different specialties: surgery, transplant hepatology, interventional radiology, radiation oncology, and medical oncology. Multidisciplinary evaluation, planning, and management is frequently coordinated by hepatologists and improves patient outcomes [

Multidisciplinary teams typically provide more thoroughly vetted recommendations and are less likely to recommend suboptimal therapies driven by provider expertise rather than individual patient factors. In particular, and as noted below, for patients with apparently liver-isolated tumors, determining resectability is highly dependent on the skill, expertise, and comfort level of the treating surgeon/center.

         Hepatic resection is a potentially curative therapy and the preferred treatment for eligible patients. The ideal patient for resection has a solitary potentially resectable HCC confined to the liver that shows no radiographic evidence of invasion of the hepatic vasculature, and well-preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh class A) without evidence of portal hypertension. Long-term relapse-free survival rates average 40 percent or better, and five-year survival rates as high as 90 percent are reported in carefully selected patients. (See

         Perhaps more importantly, "resectability" is highly subjective concept in HCC, and this makes it difficult to develop algorithmic approaches to selecting patients for resection that are strictly based upon tumor location, size, number, or extent, and underlying liver function:

         Judging the resectability of a tumor is highly dependent on the skill, expertise, and comfort level of the surgeon and center. As an example, most consider American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIIB, IVA, and IVB disease to be incurable by resection  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110835" href="/z/d/graphic/110835.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). These stages are defined by invasion of a major portal or hepatic vein, direct invasion of organs other than the gallbladder, perforation of the visceral peritoneum, and nodal or distant metastases. However, hepatic resection for stage IIIB and IVA disease may be considered on a case by case basis in a center of excellence because clinical benefits and long-term survival can be achieved in a properly selected, though admittedly small, minority of patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2488.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Tumor location is another important factor. As an example, a 2 cm HCC necessitating resection of segment 3 in the left lateral sector is a lower risk tumor for resection than a 2 cm tumor adjacent to the right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava that would require a right hepatic lobectomy.

         Most patients who are eligible for resection are also candidates for thermal ablation. While thermal ablation is a less morbid procedure, and long-term outcomes may be similar, particular for tumors &lt;2 cm in size, we suggest resection rather than ablation for most patients, particularly if resection can be done using a laparoscopic approach which reduces patient recovery time.

         Liver transplantation is a potentially curative therapy for patients with HCC who are not surgically candidates (typically because of the degree of underlying liver dysfunction). Expanded transplantation criteria and downstaging to achieve transplant eligibility are now widely accepted.

This can be a significant benefit in patients with HCC since tumor growth during the waiting period can worsen prognosis.

         There is no single best approach to these patients, and clinical practice is variable. Selection of treatment is influenced by the severity of underlying liver disease, the size and distribution of the intrahepatic tumors, the vascular supply, the patient's overall performance status and local expertise/availability of specialized techniques. We based our approach on the extent of disease burden within the liver  (

         In the past, these patients were largely managed by liver-directed approaches such as ablation (if feasible), arterially-directed therapy or RT. (See

         However, the rapidly changing landscape of potentially effective and survival-prolonging systemic therapies in HCC has enabled clinicians to consider systemic rather than locoregional therapy in this setting, even if patients are eligible for liver-directed therapy. The variability in care at expert centers reflects uncertainty in the relative benefits of these approaches and guidelines from expert groups are disparate:

         2022 guidelines from the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group for patients with intermediate (B) or advanced stage (C) HCC suggest initial systemic therapy rather than arterially-directed therapy for those with diffuse infiltrative, extensive bilobar liver involvement, any degree of portal invasion, or a performance status of 1 or 2  (

However, these decisions are arbitrary, and there are few trials directly comparing these strategies in these patient subgroups, especially addressing the benefits of combined locoregional and systemic therapy, although these are areas of active ongoing research.

         For most patients with liver-isolated, unresectable HCC who are ineligible for transplantation and who have a limited intrahepatic tumor burden and no PVTT, we suggest locoregional liver-directed therapy (ie, ablation, arterially-directed therapies, external beam RT) rather than initial systemic therapy. Liver-directed therapies have high local response rates (up to 70 percent) favorable rates of local tumor control (66 to 90 percent), and favorable safety profiles. (See

         Local thermal ablation (RFA, MWA) is a preferred approach for those with one or a few relatively small tumors. The best results are in patients with one or two tumors &lt;3 cm in diameter. For cirrhotic patients, most clinicians restrict these approaches to those with Child-Pugh class A or B severity only  (

          table 3
         </a>
         ). Ablation is also an option for those with potentially resectable HCC who are inoperable due to extensive comorbidity. RFA and MWA can also be used as "bridging" therapy in patients awaiting liver transplantation to reduce the likelihood of becoming ineligible due to tumor progression. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2487.html" rel="external">

         Other liver-directed treatments (ie, TACE and bland embolization, transarterial radioembolization [TARE], HAIC, and EBRT, including SBRT) are generally reserved for tumors that are confined to the liver but not amenable to local ablation:

         Hepatic arterial embolization is an option for patients with a large unresectable or multifocal HCC who have relatively preserved liver function (ie, Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401" href="/z/d/graphic/78401.html" rel="external">

         Selected patients may benefit from a combined locoregional approach to liver-directed therapy. As an example, TACE plus RFA is a preferred approach over TACE or RFA alone for intermediate-sized HCC (ie, 3 to 5 cm). (See

         There may be a role for multiagent HAIC without embolization in centers with local expertise in this procedure, but how this approach compares with other locoregional treatment modalities is unknown.

         Locoregional therapies are increasingly being tested in combination with systemic therapies for HCC, including molecularly-targeted agents and immunotherapy. Randomized trials have not demonstrated benefit from the addition of systemic therapy to TACE or any other form of arterial embolization compared with arterially directed therapy alone, and this is not a standard approach, at least for patients with a limited intrahepatic tumor burden.

Specifically, the acceptance of the toxicity of a risky local procedure in a patient with borderline indications may be tempered by having viable alternative systemic options that did not previously exist. Unfortunately, there are no published randomized trials directly comparing any form of salvage local therapy versus any form of systemic therapy, especially combined

         </span>
         TACE has been a standard approach for treatment of large unresectable HCCs, and some have shown that the use of multiagent chemotherapy rather than a single agent plays an important role in improving survival while the addition of particle embolization increases the frequency of adverse effects but does not contribute to a survival advantage [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, it is often difficult to perform a complete embolization of large HCCs because of plentiful extrahepatic collateral arteries. This has led to interest in HAIC using multiagent chemotherapy, which provides sustained local high concentrations of chemotherapy agents in tumors, without the need for embolization. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15589.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         The potential benefit of this strategy over repeated courses of TACE alone was shown in a phase III trial in which 315 patients with unresectable large (≥7 cm) HCC without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread were randomly assigned to HAIC via the hepatic artery using FOLFOX (

         ]. The entire patient population was Asian, and had predominantly Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis (81 percent) and HBV as the underlying HCC risk factor (89 percent). The benefits of HAIC over TACE included significantly better median overall survival (23.1 versus 16.1 months; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.75), a higher objective response rate (46 versus 18 percent), a longer median PFS (9.6 versus 5.4 months), and better tolerability (incidence of serious adverse effects during treatment 19 versus 30 percent). However, abdominal pain was observed in 37 of the 157 patients receiving HAIC when oxaliplatin was injected, and it resolved when the injection was stopped. Furthermore, 12 patients had thrombosis or dislocation of the catheter tip in this group, and required catheter revision, and four developed gastric ulcers during therapy, one of which had upper GI bleeding that required endoscopic hemostasis.

         The study was open label, and there were significant differences in poststudy treatment that may have been influenced by investigator decisions, and affected the overall survival outcomes. As an example, more patients in the HAIC group underwent subsequent hepatic resection (38 versus 18 in the TACE group). Crossover to the alternative treatment was much more frequent in the TACE group (20 versus 8 patients).

         Eligibility was limited to patients with either no cirrhosis or cirrhosis of no worse than Child-Pugh class A. However, the number of patients without cirrhosis was not reported. Whether the results are generalizable to a broader population, including those with cirrhosis or HCC etiologies other than HBV, is uncertain.

         PVTT is the most common form of macrovascular invasion in HCC [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61,62
         </a>
         ]. The development of PVTT is usually accompanied by worsening liver function, vulnerability to spread of metastatic disease, a higher incidence of complications related to portal hypertension, and intolerance for treatment compared with patients without PVTT. PVTT, particularly those with Vp3 or Vp4 involvement, is associated with a dismal prognosis; among patients treated with supportive care only, median survival is only two to four months [

         The extent of PVTT is a major prognostic factor for HCC; patients with involvement of a lobar branch or the main trunk of the portal vein have a significantly worse outcome than do those with more proximal involvement [

Potentially curative resection could be performed on five patients between 27 and 40 weeks after beginning TACE and RT; four remained alive at last follow-up with an overall survival time of 119 to 149 weeks.

         TARE is gaining popularity as a treatment for HCC with PVTT. While main portal vein thrombus has historically been considered a contraindication to radioembolization, collective experience in over 200 patients with main portal vein thrombus suggests the safety and efficacy of this approach [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84-87

         ].There is theoretically less arterial ischemia induced by radioembolization because of the smaller particle size (32 versus 70 to 300 microns with beads), suggesting that it should be safer in the setting of portal vein thrombus. Compared with TACE, rates of severe adverse effects with radioembolization appear low [

Despite these adverse features, the one-year local control rate was 87 percent, and the median time to local progression had not been reached at a median follow-up of 31.4 months. Although responses were observed in patients with tumor vascular thrombus, the fraction (response rate) was not reported. The one-year survival rate was 55 percent.

         Whether results with SBRT are better than those that can be achieved with TARE in this setting is unclear; there are no randomized trials. A meta-analysis of 37 studies of TARE, SBRT, or 3D-CRT (all observational or single-arm prospective studies) concluded that while overall response and local control rates were different (and for the most part, favored SBRT over TARE), the response rate in the PVTT was similar with SBRT and TARE (39 versus 35 percent), as was overall survival at both one and two years [

As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 45 patients with advanced HCC treated with a variety of immune therapies, four of 19 patients with PVTT (29 percent) had a partial response or stable disease with

At some institutions, chemotherapy is still offered to select patients for third- or fourth-line therapy if not deemed optimal candidates for other approved therapies. (See

          Treatment algorithms
         </strong>
         – Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor that often occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Treatment options depend on both the tumor extent and the underlying liver function.

          Importance of multidisciplinary care
         </strong>
         – We strongly urge that patients with HCC (especially liver-localized HCC) be referred to specialized centers of excellence with multidisciplinary expertise so that the entire range of potentially available treatments can be offered, along with assessment, monitoring, and treatment of the underlying liver disease.

          Potentially resectable disease
         </strong>
         – Hepatic resection is a potentially curative therapy and the preferred treatment for eligible patients. There is no consensus on the parameters for selection of patients for hepatic resection and practice is variable. The ideal candidate has a solitary HCC confined to the liver that shows no radiographic evidence of invasion of the hepatic vasculature, with well-preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh class A,  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401" href="/z/d/graphic/78401.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         )) and no evidence of clinically significant portal hypertension. However, resectability is highly subjective and these patients should be evaluated in centers of excellence with multidisciplinary expertise. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Potentially resectable disease'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         While thermal ablation is a less morbid procedure, for most patients, even those with small tumors, we suggest resection rather than ablation particularly if resection can be done using a laparoscopic approach which reduces patient recovery time (

         Postoperative antiviral therapy improves outcomes after potentially curative treatment of HCC that is related to hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus (HCV), and is indicated for those with active viral infection. The benefit of any other form of adjuvant therapy remains unproven and not a standard approach. (See

          Liver transplantation
         </strong>
         – For patients without surgically resectable disease, liver transplantation is a potentially curative option. Expanded transplantation criteria and downstaging to achieve transplant eligibility are now widely accepted. Most patients will require bridging therapy prior to transplant because of time on the wait list. (See

          Ineligible for transplant
         </strong>
         – There is no single best approach to these patients, and clinical practice is variable. Selection of treatment is influenced by the severity of underlying liver disease, the size and distribution of the intrahepatic tumors, the vascular supply, the patient's overall performance status and local expertise/availability of specialized techniques. We based our approach on the extent of disease burden within the liver  (

         For most patients with limited intrahepatic tumor burden, we suggest liver-directed therapies (ablation, arterially-directed therapies, external beam RT) rather than initial systemic therapy, as long as they are suitable candidates (
