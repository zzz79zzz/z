Although patients with mild to moderate illness may respond to psychotherapy, patients with severe (eg, suicidality or psychosis), chronic, or recurrent syndromes often require pharmacotherapy.</p><p>The decision to prescribe antidepressants for pregnant patients requires clinicians to weigh the negative impact of untreated mood and anxiety disorders against the adverse effects of antidepressants. Although the risks to infants and children from antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) appear to be small to nonexistent, the potential risks are uncertain due to the lack of high quality data on the impact of these drugs. The complexity of managing pregnant women with mood and anxiety disorders requires coordinated efforts among psychiatrists, primary care clinicians, obstetricians, and pediatricians.</p><p>Maternal use of SSRIs and SNRIs during pregnancy is estimated at roughly 8 percent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. SSRIs and SNRIs are first- and second-line medications for depressive and anxiety disorders, as well as other disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. In addition, these antidepressants are often combined with second-generation antipsychotics for treating bipolar major depression in pregnant women.</p><p>When studying the long-term effects of antenatal antidepressants, it is difficult to disentangle medication effects from other factors, such as pre-existing and ongoing maternal psychiatric illness. Women with psychiatric symptoms in pregnancy are at high risk for postpartum depression and anxiety, and thus for impaired mother-infant interactions that are associated with delayed developmental in the offspring [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Maternal depression and anxiety can be chronic and recurrent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], so the impact upon children can extend beyond the immediate postnatal phase.</p><p>This topic reviews the association between antenatal exposure to SSRIs and SNRIs and the risk of abnormalities in growth, motor skills, and cognition in the offspring. Antenatal exposure to SSRIs and SNRIs and neonatal outcomes, as well as the risk of psychopathology in the offspring, are discussed separately. The antenatal use of antidepressants and risk of teratogenicity and adverse pregnancy outcomes are also discussed separately, as are the clinical features and choice of treatment for antenatal depression, and the risks of exposure to antenatal depression:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5007.html" rel="external">"Antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Neonatal outcomes"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114320.html" rel="external">"Antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Risk of psychopathology in the offspring"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89067.html" rel="external">"Antenatal use of antidepressants and the potential risk of teratogenicity and adverse pregnancy outcomes: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/100334.html" rel="external">"Antenatal use of antidepressants and risks of teratogenicity and adverse pregnancy outcomes: Drugs other than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1718.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression during pregnancy: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108261.html" rel="external">"Mild to moderate episodes of antenatal unipolar major depression: Choosing treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1703.html" rel="external">"Severe antenatal unipolar major depression: Choosing treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107638.html" rel="external">"Antenatal depression: Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106322.html" rel="external">"Antenatal depression: Risks of abnormal infant and child development"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107653.html" rel="external">"Antenatal depression: Risks of cognitive impairment and psychopathology in the offspring"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2291861629"><span class="h1">INTERPRETING THE EVIDENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evidence regarding the potential risk of antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors is limited due to several factors.

A prospective observational study assessed infants age 12 months who were born to mothers with antenatal unipolar major depression that was treated with SSRIs (n = 46), mothers with antenatal depression that was not treated (n = 31), and mothers who were neither depressed nor treated with SSRIs during pregnancy (n = 97) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Weight, length, and head circumference were comparable for the three groups of infants. In addition, a second prospective observational study of children (n = 55, mean age 14 months) who were exposed in utero to SSRIs found that duration of exposure was not associated with weight, length, and head circumference [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1708368835"><span class="h1">MOTOR SKILLS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Due to conflicting results across studies, it is not clear if antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with delayed or impaired childhood motor skills [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. As a result, it is generally thought that the risk of abnormal motor function is small to nonexistent and that this risk is outweighed by the risks of untreated moderate to severe antenatal depression [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Evidence that suggests antenatal exposure to SSRIs is not associated with impaired motor function includes the following [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a review of four observational studies of children aged four years and older, none of the studies found an association between in utero exposure to antidepressants and motor development [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. As an example, a national registry study identified pregnant women who used SSRIs (n &gt;15,000) and pregnant women with psychiatric disorders who did not use SSRIs (n &gt;9000); the offspring were followed for up to 14 years after birth [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, parental age and history of psychiatric diagnoses, and maternal smoking), the analyses found that the frequency of motor disorders (eg, impaired fine and gross motor coordination) in the exposed and unexposed children was comparable (0.7 and 0.6 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective study included children of mothers who were treated for antenatal depressive disorders with antidepressants (n = 35) and children of mothers who had no history of mood disorders and who were not treated with psychotropic drugs (n = 23) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The majority of antidepressants were SSRIs, and the children were assessed at a mean age of 19 months. Fine and gross motor development were each comparable in the two groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective study recruited pregnant women treated for depression with antidepressants (n = 415, treated primarily with SSRIs) and pregnant women with untreated depression (n = 489) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].

After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal age, birth outcomes, and postnatal depression), the analyses found that general gross motor activity at 6 months in exposed and unexposed infants was comparable (odds ratio 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-1.5). At 19 months, fine motor and gross motor function were also comparable.</p><p></p><p>However, other studies suggest that antenatal exposure to SSRIs may be associated with a small increased risk of abnormal motor skills [<a href="#rid8">8,16</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One prospective study included infants who were exposed in utero to SSRIs or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12878" href="/z/d/drug information/12878.html" rel="external">venlafaxine</a> (n = 31) for treatment of maternal depressive disorders, and infants who were not exposed (n = 52) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The infants were assessed at 10 months of age. After controlling for potential confounding factors (pre- and postnatal maternal depression, and antenatal smoking and alcohol use), the analyses found that gross motor functioning was worse in the exposed infants. However, fine motor development in the exposed and unexposed infants was comparable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A second prospective study assessed motor function in infants who were exposed in utero to SSRIs (n = 58) or not exposed (n = 44); assessments were conducted during the first week of life (median age three days) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal depression and anxiety during the third trimester, education, and infant gestational age), the analyses found that abnormal motor function was present in more exposed than unexposed infants (59 versus 33 percent). However, the infants were assessed again at age three to four months, at which point impaired motor function was comparable in exposed and unexposed infants (5 and 0 percent). The initial finding during the first week of infant life probably represented the transient syndrome of poor neonatal adaptation, which is associated with in utero exposure to SSRIs and SNRIs during the third trimester. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5007.html" rel="external">"Antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Neonatal outcomes", section on 'Poor neonatal adaptation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another prospective study included children aged three years with either prolonged in utero exposure to SSRIS (eg, 29 weeks; n = 159 children) or no exposure (n &gt;51,000), and assessed fine and gross motor development through maternal reports [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, parental education and maternal depression and smoking), the analyses showed that exposure was weakly associated with motor development delays that were not clinically significant. In addition, the analyses did not adjust for severity of depression; thus, severe depression may have been associated with motor skills delay, rather than the medication used to treat the illness. The investigators concluded that the findings did not warrant withholding medications indicated for antenatal depression.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2058044013"><span class="h1">COGNITION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2593882476"><span class="h2">General cognition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple observational studies consistently suggest that antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) is not associated with impairment of general cognitive functioning in children [<a href="#rid8">8,11,14,20,21</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A review of in utero exposure to antidepressants and general cognition identified five prospective studies of children aged four years and older; the studies included children exposed in utero to antidepressants (total n = 166), children exposed in utero to untreated maternal depression (n = 460), and unexposed children (n = 5545) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

Further analyses that used indirect proxies of depression severity also found that SSRI exposure was associated with an increased risk of speech/language disorders. Nevertheless, the association may be confounded by severity of depression and may also be due to residual confounding by variables that were not included in the analyses, such as postpartum depression.

After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal and child age, lifetime maternal mental illness, and antenatal use of other psychotropic drugs), the analyses found that expressive language was modestly worse in exposed than unexposed children, and that longer antenatal exposure to SSRIs and SNRIs was associated with greater impairment. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective observational study (n &gt;51,000 pregnancies) examined exposure to SSRIs during three time periods (from pregnancy week 0 to week 18, week 19 to week 29, and pregnancy week 30 until the child was six months old); language competence was assessed in the offspring at the age of three years [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. After controlling for potential confounding variables (eg, parental education and maternal depression before and during pregnancy), the analyses found that prolonged antenatal SSRI exposure for two or more periods (n = 161 pregnancies) compared with no use was associated with a delay in language competence in children age three years (relative risk 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.4). However, children of mothers with anxiety and depression throughout pregnancy also had an increased risk of delayed language competence by age three years (relative risk 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.4). In addition, the authors did not report the statistical significance of the association between SSRI use and language delay after accounting for postnatal anxiety and depression symptoms. Thus, residual confounding may explain the observed association between antenatal SSRI exposure and language delay.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2198646642"><span class="h2">Intelligence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antenatal exposure to SSRIs does not appear to be associated with decreases in general intellectual functioning, which is typically assessed by measuring the child’s intelligence quotient (IQ) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. A review of in utero exposure to antidepressants and IQ identified five prospective observational studies of children aged three years and older (total n = 404) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The results indicated that factors such as maternal IQ and/or maternal depression, rather than prenatal exposure to antidepressants, predict child IQ. As an example:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study compared children of mothers with antenatal depression treated with SSRIs (n = 62), children of mothers with antenatal depression treated with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12878" href="/z/d/drug information/12878.html" rel="external">venlafaxine</a> (an SNRI, n = 62), and children of mothers with antenatal depression that was not treated with antidepressants (n = 54) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The mean IQ scores were comparable for the three groups. However, the IQ of these three groups of children were lower than the mean IQ score of a fourth group of children born to mothers who were not depressed and not treated with antidepressants (n = 62), suggesting that maternal depression rather than antenatal exposure to SSRIs or venlafaxine may affect intelligence.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The same research group conducted a study of 45 sibling pairs, one of whom was exposed to SSRIs and/or SNRIs during gestation and one of whom was not; this approach accounted for shared genetic and environmental factors [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The antidepressants were prescribed for antenatal depressive disorders, and IQ was assessed in the children between the ages of three to six years. After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, child’s age, birth order, and severity of maternal depressive episodes during pregnancy and after delivery), the analyses found that the Full Scale IQ in the exposed and unexposed siblings was comparable (103 and 106). However, higher maternal IQ was associated with higher offspring IQ.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H237061350"><span class="h3">Intellectual disability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antenatal exposure to SSRIs does not appear to be associated with intellectual disability (IQ &lt;70 plus functional impairment). A national registry study identified children of mothers who used SSRIs during pregnancy (n &gt;3000) and children who were not exposed (n &gt;170,000) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The children were followed for an average of eight years following birth. After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, parental age, education, and psychiatric diagnoses), the analyses found that intellectual disability in the exposed and unexposed children was comparable (relative risk 1.48, 95% CI 0.98-2.23).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4242805953"><span class="h2">Educational achievement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is not clear whether antenatal exposure to SSRIs is associated with diminished educational achievement, due to conflicting results across national registry studies that included pregnant women who filled prescriptions for SSRIs. However, the best evidence suggests that exposure is not associated with adverse outcomes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One study identified pregnant women with depressive disorders who either used SSRIs (n &gt;15,000) or did not use SSRIs (n &gt;9000); the offspring were followed for up to 14 years after birth [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, parental age and history of psychiatric diagnoses, and maternal smoking), the analyses found that the frequency of scholastic disorders (eg, reading disorder or disorder of mathematical skills) in the exposed and unexposed children was comparable (0.4 and 0.6 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A subsequent study of children and adolescents included youth with no antenatal exposure to antidepressants (n &gt;560,000) and youth exposed in utero to SSRIs (n &gt;8000) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, parental psychiatric history and maternal prescription fill for other psychotropic drugs), the analyses found that language test scores were comparable in the two groups. Conversely, mathematics test scores were lower in the group exposed to antenatal SSRIs; however, the difference was small, and the clinical significance was uncertain. In addition, this study lacked the methodologic advantage of the first study, which included only women with depressive disorders.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2052804757"><span class="h1">PSYCHOPATHOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and the risk of psychopathology in the offspring is discussed separately.
