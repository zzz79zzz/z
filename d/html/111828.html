         Bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is characterized by recurrent episodes of elevated mood (mania or hypomania), which exceed what is expected for the child's developmental stage and are not better explained by other psychiatric and general medical conditions [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. In addition, youth with bipolar disorder usually have recurrent episodes of major depression; however, depressive episodes are not necessary for diagnosing bipolar disorder. Pediatric bipolar disorder severely affects normal development and psychosocial functioning and increases the risk for behavioral, academic, social, and legal problems, as well as psychosis, substance abuse, and suicide [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The large majority of patients with pediatric bipolar disorder have comorbid psychiatric and general medical conditions, and many bipolar patients have multiple comorbid illnesses [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. The presence of comorbidities can hinder clinicians from recognizing bipolar disorder, particularly in youth with bipolar II disorder (periods of hypomania and/or major depression). Clinicians should identify and treat comorbidities because they may adversely affect response to treatment of bipolar disorder and the course of illness [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,8,9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic describes the comorbid psychiatric and general medical illnesses that commonly occur in pediatric bipolar disorder. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents are discussed separately.

According to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), the subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder, and other specified bipolar disorder. The clinical features and diagnosis of these subtypes are described separately. (See

         The large majority of patients with pediatric bipolar disorder have a co-occurring psychiatric condition, such as an anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or oppositional defiant disorder, and many patients have multiple comorbid illnesses [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7

         Some comorbidities, such as ADHD or oppositional defiant disorder, may be difficult to distinguish from mania/hypomania because the symptoms of ADHD or oppositional defiant disorder can overlap with those of mania/hypomania  (

         In youth with bipolar disorder, the prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders ranges from approximately 40 to 66 percent, as indicated by nationally representative community surveys, as well as studies in clinical settings and studies of administrative claims databases [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,9,11-13
         </a>

         Some youth had more than one comorbid anxiety disorder [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the lifetime prevalence of any anxiety disorder was greater in youth with childhood-onset bipolar disorder than adolescent-onset bipolar disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
         The temporal sequence of bipolar disorder and co-occurring anxiety disorders is such that anxiety disorders typically arise prior to onset of the first manic episode [

         Pediatric bipolar disorder mood episodes are more likely to persist longer in patients with comorbid anxiety disorders than patients without comorbidity; following recovery from mood episodes, recurrences are more likely in patients with comorbid anxiety disorders [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. In addition, co-occurring anxiety disorders are often protracted; a five-year prospective study of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder found that among those with anxiety disorders during follow-up (n = 137), the average duration of the anxiety disorder was approximately one year [

         Among youth with bipolar disorder who present to clinical settings, approximately 50 percent have comorbid ADHD [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,19
         </a>
         ]. This estimate is based upon a meta-analysis of 20 observational studies that included youth with bipolar I disorder and other specified bipolar disorder (total n &gt;2000, average age 11 years) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19

         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16,20
         </a>
         ]. Although shared genetic factors for ADHD and bipolar disorder may perhaps be involved in the high rate of co-occurrence of the two disorders [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

        </p>
        <p>
         Among youth who are treated for bipolar disorder, comorbid ADHD is associated with poorer outcomes. As an example, a meta-analysis of five observational studies of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder (n = 273) found that treatment response was less likely to occur in youth with comorbid ADHD than youth without ADHD (relative risk 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.97) [

         <a href="#rid24">
          24,26,28,29
         </a>

         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30

        <p>
         Multiple risk factors for comorbid substance use disorders in pediatric bipolar disorder have been identified. A prospective observational study found that among adolescents with bipolar disorder who do not have a comorbid substance use disorder when they first present (n = 167), experimentation with alcohol at the start of the study was the single strongest predictor of later substance abuse, although experimentation with cannabis also predicted later substance abuse [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Other risk factors for developing a substance use disorder included greater severity of hypomanic/manic symptoms; poor family functioning; lifetime history of alcohol use (experimentation), panic disorder, or oppositional defiant disorder; and family history of substance use disorder. Onset of substance use disorders was more likely in teens with three or more risk factors than teens with zero to two risk factors (55 versus 14 percent). This study suggests that there may be a window of two to three years during which clinicians can attempt to prevent substance abuse in these youth by targeting the risk factors that are amenable to intervention.

         Cannabis – Cannabis use disorder is common in pediatric bipolar disorder. An administrative claims database of youths with mood disorders (n &gt;200,000, mean age 17 years) found that after adjusting for potential confounding demographic, clinical, and treatment factors, the risk of comorbid cannabis use disorder was greater in patients with bipolar disorder than depressive disorders (relative risk 1.24, 95% CI 1.21-1.29) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32

In addition, the entire sample was followed for up to one year, during which the risk of nonfatal self-harm was greater in youths with mood disorders plus cannabis use disorder, compared to those without cannabis use disorder (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% CI 2.6-4.2). Comorbid cannabis use disorder was also associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2).

         Tobacco – Smoking is also common in pediatric bipolar disorder. In a prospective observational study of 441 youth with bipolar spectrum disorder, current daily smoking was present in 11 percent, and a history of smoking in the past but not currently was present in another 14 percent [

         Youth with bipolar disorder and a current or past history of smoking were more likely to have a history of other substance use disorders and suicide attempts, compared to bipolar youth with no history of smoking. These findings suggest that bipolar patients who smoke should be evaluated for abuse of other substances and risk of suicide, as well as the physical effects of smoking.

         The increased risk of comorbid general medial illnesses in youth with bipolar disorder may be due to biologic vulnerability, increased weight, increased smoking, poor eating habits, insufficient physical activity, and use of medications that can increase weight and induce the metabolic syndrome as well other medical conditions (eg, fatty liver and extra pyramidal symptoms) [

         We suggest that adolescents with bipolar disorder be monitored for cardiovascular disease. Adolescent bipolar disorder appears to be associated with premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,42

         ]. Several traditional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus, sedentary lifestyle, and tobacco smoking) are more prevalent among adolescents with bipolar disorder compared with the general pediatric population. Although psychotropic medication may contribute to the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, it appears that a substantial portion of the association between bipolar disorder and cardiovascular disease is independent of medication effects. In 2015, the American Heart Association proposed that bipolar disorder be positioned alongside other pediatric diseases (chronic inflammatory disease, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, Kawasaki disease, and nephrotic syndrome) that are considered moderate risk factors for early cardiovascular disease [

         Many children and adolescents with bipolar disorder are overweight or obese, at rates comparable to those in the general population. Studies in both community and clinical samples of youth with bipolar disorder suggest that excess weight (body mass index [BMI] 85

         A nationally representative survey of adolescents in the United States (n &gt;10,000) showed that among those with bipolar disorder (n = 295), 21 percent were overweight and 17 percent were obese, which was comparable to the weight status of controls [

          46

         ]. After controlling for potential demographic and clinical confounders, the analyses found that adolescents with bipolar who were overweight or obese were more likely to have a history of suicide attempt, binge eating and bulimia, and conduct disorder, compared to adolescents with bipolar disorder who were normal weight.

         Juvenile bipolar disorder is often treated with second-generation antipsychotics, which can cause weight gain and may also be associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. (See

         Studies of medical claims data have found that the prevalence of neurologic, respiratory, and other chronic general medical disorders was greater in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder, compared with control groups. In addition, approximately 25 to 33 percent of patients had multiple medical comorbidities:

         In one study of an administrative claims database that identified youth with bipolar disorder (n &gt;800) and youth with other psychiatric disorders (n &gt;21,000), youth with bipolar disorder were more likely to have comorbid neurologic disorders, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal and hepatic disorders, and female reproductive disorders [

          39

         A second study of medical claims identified youth with bipolar disorder (n &gt;1800) and youth with no psychiatric disorders (n = 4500), and found that the prevalence of epilepsy, migraine headaches, neurodevelopmental disorders (eg, intellectual disability), asthma, and endocrine disorders was greater in youth with bipolar disorder than controls [

         Bipolar disorder may also be associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction. A study examined cerebrovascular reactivity (a marker of cerebrovascular health measured by the vasodilatory capacity of cerebral blood vessels in response to vasoactive substances) in 25 adolescents with bipolar disorder and 25 healthy controls [

          48

         The large majority of patients with pediatric bipolar disorder have a comorbid psychiatric condition, and many patients have multiple comorbid illnesses. Clinicians should identify and treat comorbidities because they can adversely affect response to treatment of bipolar disorder and the course of illness.
