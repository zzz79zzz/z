In a minority of patients, acute grief may progress to prolonged grief disorder, which is a unique and recognizable syndrome marked by unusually intense, unrelenting, and functionally debilitating symptoms that require specific treatment [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Recognition of problematic grief extends back to at least 1980, when Bowlby explained how grief could lead to a state of “suspended growth in life” if certain natural defensive processes persisted too long and/or dominated the bereaved person’s mental functioning [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews treatment of prolonged grief disorder. The clinical manifestations, assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder are discussed separately, as are bereavement, grief, and palliative care.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91887.html" rel="external">"Prolonged grief disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14684.html" rel="external">"Bereavement and grief in adults: Clinical features"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101289.html" rel="external">"Bereavement and grief in adults: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H732354"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prolonged grief disorder is a form of grief that is abnormally intense, protracted, and disabling, and is characterized by maladaptive thoughts, dysfunctional behaviors, dysregulated emotions, and/or serious psychosocial problems that impede adaptation to the loss. The syndrome of prolonged grief disorder is a unique and recognizable condition that can be differentiated from normal grief as well as other psychiatric disorders, such as unipolar depression or posttraumatic stress disorder. Much of the research establishing this diagnosis and its treatment was conducted using the term complicated grief. Other terms that have been used to describe prolonged grief disorder include chronic grief, complex grief, pathological grief, persistent complex bereavement disorder, traumatic grief, and unresolved grief.</p><p>Additional information about the terminology that describes different aspects of death is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91887.html" rel="external">"Prolonged grief disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1518081"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3255411"><span class="h2">Goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of treatment for prolonged grief disorder is to facilitate integration of the loss by addressing impediments to adaptation. Resolution of the disorder is indicated by:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Accepting the reality of the death, including its finality and consequences, as well as a changed relationship with the deceased loved one.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Restoring the capacity to thrive – This includes reestablishing:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A sense of purpose and meaning in life</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Belief in one’s competence to face and meet important challenges</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Feelings of belonging and mattering</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>At least one close relationship</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Relief of maladaptive ruminations that represent persistence and/or undue influence of natural defensive responses to the death. Examples of these defenses include disbelief, protest, imagining alternative scenarios to the death (counterfactual thinking) such as daydreaming about being together, and caregiver self-blame.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overcoming excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss and/or efforts to escape from the painful reality by seeking proximity to sensory reminders of the deceased (eg, listening to a recording of the deceased person’s voice or the smelling the person’s clothes).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improved regulation of emotions – This includes modulating emotions effectively (eg, by experiencing them and setting them aside) and increasing one’s ability to experience and appreciate positive emotions.</p><p></p><p>Treatment of prolonged grief disorder does not aim to achieve full remission of grief [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Rather, feelings of grief diminish in frequency, intensity, and duration as patients learn to adapt to the loss. When adaptation is successful, most bereaved people continue to miss the deceased and feel sadness at times; in this manner, grief is permanent. Occasionally grief may be strongly activated by reminders of the lost loved one, especially on certain calendar days or occasions, such as the anniversary of the death, holidays, or important family events (eg, marriages or births). These periods of activation are usually short-lived and are normal experiences that should not be considered pathological.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H293267462"><span class="h2">Education</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One component of most treatments for prolonged grief disorder is education about grief. It is important to help patients understand that the disorder is not a completely different form of grief, but rather an unusually intense form of grief that continues beyond the time that it is expected to recede, according to the patient’s social group and culture. Many patients with prolonged grief disorder are discouraged by the persistence of anguishing grief, and surveys suggest that they are usually relieved to receive the diagnosis as well as education about the condition [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Although education about prolonged grief disorder is not sufficient on its own to resolve symptoms, its effect might be bolstered by also educating supportive family or friends. Individuals who initially were supportive often become frustrated by seemingly fruitless efforts to try helping. They may withdraw or become harsh and critical because they do not understand prolonged grief disorder and do not realize the patient has a treatable condition. In many cases, patients have been misdiagnosed and treated unsuccessfully for unipolar major depression or another disorder, which can engender hopelessness in patients as well as family.</p><p>Evidence that supports educating patients about prolonged grief disorder includes randomized trials:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 13-month trial compared education plus usual care with usual care alone in bereaved patients with symptoms of prolonged grief disorder (n = 67) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Patients and primary care clinicians who were assigned to the active intervention received information about the symptoms of prolonged grief disorder and its risk factors, as well as information about two strategies for adapting to the loss: confronting the painful reality of the loss and setting the pain aside to focus upon something emotionally neutral or positive. There was a trend for greater improvement in the group who received education.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A four-week trial enrolled patients (n = 42) with moderately high levels of prolonged grief disorder symptoms, all of whom received usual care consisting of two sessions of education about prolonged grief disorder [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Patients assigned to the active intervention also received two sessions about supportive relationships in bereavement, thus receiving a total of four education sessions. In addition, a close friend or relative of patients in the active intervention received two education sessions about helpful social support. Assessments eight weeks posttreatment showed that improvement of prolonged grief disorder symptoms, as well as depressive symptoms, was greater in patients who received education about both prolonged grief disorder and social support, compared with education about only the disorder.</p><p></p><p>Education of family members is an element of the psychotherapies that have the strongest data demonstrating efficacy for prolonged grief disorder [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Choosing treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Information about grief and prolonged grief disorder is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14684.html" rel="external">"Bereavement and grief in adults: Clinical features"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91887.html" rel="external">"Prolonged grief disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4671709"><span class="h2">Monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outpatients with prolonged grief disorder are monitored by clinicians every one to four weeks, depending upon symptom acuity. Response to treatment can be monitored with the:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical Global Impression Scale for Prolonged Grief Disorder  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93614" href="/d/graphic/93614.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), which is a two-item, interviewer-administered instrument. The two items are global severity of prolonged grief disorder symptoms and global improvement; each item is rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7, and each point of the scale includes a behavioral description.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reasonable alternatives include self-report questionnaires such as the 19-item Inventory of Complicated Grief  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94132" href="/d/graphic/94132.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), the 13-item Prolonged Grief Disorder-13-Revised scale, or the five-item Brief Grief Questionnaire  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94493" href="/d/graphic/94493.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p></p><p>Suicidal ideation and behavior should be routinely monitored during treatment of prolonged grief disorder. In addition, patients who have used alcohol and other substances to regulate painful emotions are monitored for ongoing use.</p><p>We also encourage patients to self-monitor their grief systems using a tool available online at <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fprolongedgrief.columbia.edu%2Fbrief-grief-questionnaire%2F&amp;token=aZlo%2FVqcY24jBR5aN8jgpj6CUU6fqo4e9fiKMZNx3WTEr7iCXfR7DWowRkydn6qtXLhK2uRejkGAqLmJCl3YI68AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=91837" target="_blank">The Center for Prolonged Grief</a>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1627096"><span class="h2">Comorbidity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prolonged grief disorder is often accompanied by comorbid psychiatric disorders such as unipolar major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, and by suicidal thinking or behavior. Following successful treatment of prolonged grief disorder, comorbidity that persists should be managed with indicated treatments (eg, pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy). In patients with major depression or other comorbidities, concurrent treatment of prolonged grief disorder and the co-occurring psychiatric disorders may represent an optimal approach [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Comorbid psychiatric disorders that commonly occur in prolonged grief disorder are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91887.html" rel="external">"Prolonged grief disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Psychiatric'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5887045"><span class="h1">PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The possible benefits of psychotherapy during acute grief to prevent prolonged grief disorder are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101289.html" rel="external">"Bereavement and grief in adults: Management", section on 'Interventions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4670119"><span class="h1">CHOOSING TREATMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H355926345"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Based upon randomized trials, the best treatment for prolonged grief disorder (previously called complicated grief) is psychotherapy that was developed specifically for the disorder, rather than therapies that are effective for bereavement-related unipolar major depression (eg, interpersonal psychotherapy or antidepressant medication) [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of five trials compared psychotherapies tailored for prolonged grief disorder with control conditions in 368 patients with the disorder [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The psychotherapies consisted of prolonged grief disorder therapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) modified for prolonged grief disorder; control conditions included nonspecific supportive psychotherapy or interpersonal psychotherapy. Improvement was greater with psychotherapy specific for prolonged grief disorder and the clinical benefit was moderately large. However, heterogeneity across studies was also large. In the one study with posttreatment follow-up (six months), improvement was greater with psychotherapy specific for the disorder and the clinical effect was large.</p><p>Serious psychosocial problems may occur after bereavement, and therapists may need to address these problems prior to undertaking a psychotherapy targeting prolonged grief disorder. As an example, patients may face financial, occupational, or interpersonal problems, such as homelessness, loss of income, or health problems. If psychosocial problems are present and unrecognized, grief focused treatment may stall, and poor adherence may occur after four to six sessions or patients may demonstrate little or no improvement after 10 to 12 sessions. In these cases, patients may require other treatment; as an example, patients involved in a lawsuit should receive supportive therapy until the suit is concluded. If prolonged grief disorder symptoms are still present after the psychosocial problem has been addressed, prolonged grief disorder-targeted treatment should be resumed or instituted.</p><p>No randomized trials have demonstrated that pharmacotherapy alone is beneficial for prolonged grief disorder. However, medications can help manage comorbid psychopathology such as unipolar major depression [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], and may help patients with anxiety disorders or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p><p>We suggest that treatment of prolonged grief disorder proceed according to the sequence described in the sections below. Patients begin with initial therapy and progress through each step until they respond.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H355926405"><span class="h2">Initial therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with prolonged grief disorder, we recommend “prolonged grief disorder therapy” (formerly called “complicated grief treatment”) as first-line treatment. The therapy includes techniques from other psychotherapies, including CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, motivational interviewing, positive psychology, and psychodynamic psychotherapy; these techniques promote adaptation to loss by addressing impediments to integrating grief, and restore the capacity to thrive in a world without the deceased [<a href="#rid3">3,8,10-12</a>]. Different formats for administering prolonged grief disorder therapy include individual, group, and internet. In the largest randomized trial that studied the therapy, response occurred in more than 80 percent of patients who received it.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1325698692"><span class="h3">Theoretical foundation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The theoretical foundation for prolonged grief disorder therapy is based upon an attachment theory model. The model hypothesizes that people are biologically motivated to form close relationships with other people, and that adaptation to losing a close relationship requires acknowledging the finality and consequences of the loss, revising the internalized representation of the deceased, and re-envisioning life plans and goals [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Additional information about bereavement and loss of attachment is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14684.html" rel="external">"Bereavement and grief in adults: Clinical features", section on 'Loss of attachment'</a>.)</p><p>Prolonged grief disorder therapy facilitates adaptation to bereavement by focusing upon two key areas [<a href="#rid1">1,13,14</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss – Accepting the reality of the death, including its finality and consequences, a changed relationship with the deceased, and the permanence of grief.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Restoration – Restoring the capacity to thrive in a world without the loved one, including a sense of purpose and meaning, and possibilities for happiness.</p><p></p><p>Preliminary evidence supports the theoretical model underlying prolonged grief disorder therapy and the importance of specified treatment targets. Studies have found that reducing guilt/self-blame, negative thoughts about the future, and loss-related avoidance precede and help explain positive response to treatment [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The studies, along with a randomized trial comparing grief-focused treatment with and without exposure to memories of the death [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], suggest that such exposure is an important component of efficacious treatments for prolonged grief disorder [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4293372692"><span class="h3">Administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The protocol for administering prolonged grief disorder therapy includes four phases with a total of 16 sessions, which target seven healing milestones for adaptation to bereavement [<a href="#rid1">1,6,10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Getting Started (sessions 1 to 3) – Therapists elicit a history of the patient’s relationships, interests, and accomplishments, and introduce the first four healing milestones:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Milestone 1 – Understanding and accepting grief</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Milestone 2 – Managing grief-related emotions</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Milestone 3 – Seeing a promising future</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Milestone 4 – Strengthening relationships with others</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Monitoring of grief symptoms begins after the first session and continues throughout the treatment (see <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above). In the second session, therapists educate patients about acute grief, integrated grief, prolonged grief disorder, and the elements of prolonged grief disorder therapy. A procedure for identifying aspirational goals (milestone 3) is also introduced in the second session. For the third session, patients are encouraged to invite a close friend or relative, who is educated about prolonged grief disorder, the therapy, and possible ways to support the patient (milestone 4).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Core Revisiting Sequence (sessions 4 to 9) – This phase introduces the last three milestones:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Milestone 5 – Narrating the story of the death</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Milestone 6 – Learning to live with reminders of the loss</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Milestone 7 – Connecting with memories of the deceased</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Each session focuses upon both loss and restoration-related work:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Loss – A technique called “imaginal revisiting” is used to address milestone 5. During the four-part imaginal revisiting exercise, patients:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Visualize the time that they learned of the death</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Over a period of approximately 10 minutes, tell the story of what happened from that point forward</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Pause and reflect upon this story for another 10 minutes; during the reflection period, the therapist asks the patient to describe what they noticed or observed while telling the story, and helps the patient address any troubling feelings or thoughts about the death</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Set the story aside and plan a rewarding activity</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Audio-recordings are made of the 10-minute story of learning about the death, which patients listen to at home between sessions. The revisiting exercise is usually repeated weekly for four to six sessions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Milestone 6 is addressed using a technique to confront painful reminders of the loss by revisiting, in vivo, avoided situations. Beginning in session 5, a list is developed identifying situations the patient is avoiding and estimating the intensity of grief that each situation might activate; this list of situations is arranged from least to most painful. Each week an activity is planned that focuses on something that is challenging but doable, with patients confronting progressively more painful reminders of the loss.

If a disorder other than prolonged grief disorder is more salient, treatment should refocus upon the primary problem.

Therapy may also involve relaxation techniques, writing a letter to the deceased to express unresolved issues, different techniques to remember positive experiences with the deceased, and setting new goals.

It focuses upon decreasing avoidance of painful memories and situations that are associated with losing a loved one; this occurs by exposure to aversive reminders of the death in a therapeutic manner [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Exposure can take the form of imaginal exposure that is typically based on the patient talking or writing about the death event. In vivo exposure involves confronting real-life situations that remind one of the loss, such as looking at pictures, visiting a favorite restaurant, or spending time in a park that the patient frequented with the deceased. By repeatedly confronting these reminders of the loss and its permanence, they become less painful and meaningful memories become more accessible. Additional information about administering exposure therapy is discussed separately in the context of PTSD.

In exposure therapy, patients relived the time they experienced the death of the person. In nondirective therapy, patients discussed whatever they wished without receiving any direction and received no instructions on exposure techniques. Improvement was greater in patients who received exposure therapy and the clinical effect was large. In addition, reduction of depression and negative cognitions about oneself and the world were greater with exposure therapy, and the benefits of CBT with exposure therapy persisted at follow-up assessments two years posttreatment [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>An eight-week trial compared internet-delivered, therapist-supported exposure therapy with a waiting list control in 30 patients [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

The therapy consists of clinical strategies that include self-monitoring, structuring and scheduling activities, problem solving, establishing routines, and developing behavioral alternatives to rumination. Although behavioral activation was initially used for treating unipolar depression, it is also prescribed for other psychiatric disorders, as well as promoting well-being in nonclinical populations.

However, treatment is not intended to fully remit all grief symptoms. Instead, grief is reduced in frequency and intensity, and no longer interferes with ongoing life. Patients with prolonged grief disorder are often relieved to receive the diagnosis and education about the disorder. Response to treatment can be monitored with the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Complicated Grief  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93614" href="/d/graphic/93614.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choosing treatment</strong> – The best established treatment for prolonged grief disorder is psychotherapy that is specific for the condition. (See <a class="local">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Initial therapy</strong> – For patients with prolonged grief disorder, we suggest a psychotherapy called “prolonged grief disorder therapy” (previously labelled “complicated grief treatment”) as first-line treatment, rather than other psychotherapies (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). If patients are not responding to first-line treatment, they should be re-evaluated to verify the diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder and assessed for potential complicating factors such as undiagnosed comorbid psychopathology or psychosocial problems that require attention.

Patients unresponsive to prolonged grief disorder therapy followed by CBT specific for prolonged grief disorder can be treated with other psychotherapies modified for prolonged grief disorder, such as exposure therapy, behavioral activation, or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. (See <a class="local">'Alternatives'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other approaches</strong> – Some patients with prolonged grief disorder decline, do not respond to, or have access to initial therapy and alternative psychotherapies modified for prolonged grief disorder.
