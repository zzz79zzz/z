         Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are two manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Extending therapeutic anticoagulation beyond the conventional period of three months may benefit select patients who are at increased risk of recurrent thrombosis when anticoagulation is stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses the approach to continuing or discontinuing anticoagulation in patients who have completed a finite course of anticoagulant therapy for lower extremity DVT and acute PE  (

         ). The content does not apply to anticoagulant therapy in patients with thrombosis in other sites such as upper extremity DVT, splanchnic thrombosis, cerebral vein thrombosis, or portal vein thrombosis. Initiation of anticoagulant therapy in patients with acute VTE is discussed in detail separately. (See

         The rationale for extending anticoagulant therapy beyond three months in select patients is based upon an estimated high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence if anticoagulation is stopped. In such cases, anticoagulant therapy can potentially reduce recurrence by 80 percent or more [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,9-13
         </a>
         ]. While data demonstrate a clear benefit from a recurrence standpoint, few studies report a mortality benefit from prolonged anticoagulant therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, anticoagulant therapy cannot be given without some increase in the risk of major bleeding. Thus, indefinite anticoagulation is most likely to benefit those at the greatest risk of recurrence in whom the risk of bleeding is low. Furthermore, we believe that in the era of direct oral anticoagulants, the safety profile of extending anticoagulant therapy is more acceptable than that of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin
         </a>
         therapy. The decision also has to take into account that the consequences of a major bleed may be worse than the consequences of a recurrent episode of VTE. For example, approximately 12 percent of major bleeds associated with warfarin are fatal while only 4 percent of recurrent thrombotic episodes are fatal [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,14,15

         ]. Data describing risks of recurrence and bleeding associated with individual agents are discussed below. (See

         For patients with acute VTE who are nearing completion of a finite course of anticoagulant therapy, we assess the risk of recurrence, should anticoagulation be discontinued. The risk of VTE recurrence off anticoagulation is highest in the ensuing one to two years and is
         <strong>
          cumulative
         </strong>
         [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. Thus, when discussing risk with patients, we prefer to estimate cumulative risk over a longer period (eg, five years)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131266" href="/z/d/graphic/131266.html" rel="external">

          table 2
         </a>
         ). To assess risk, we obtain details regarding the index VTE event and risk factors (if any) associated with the index and any previous VTE event(s). We also ascertain any current risk factors that could impact potential future events. We characterize risk factors as transient or persistent, major or minor, and malignant or nonmalignant. Once assessed, the patient should be categorized according to the estimated risk of recurrence as the following; we assumed that individuals are no longer at risk after the recurrent event and that the risk of recurrence remains constant over time  (

         Guidance on how to estimate high, intermediate, and low risk is limited. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed but their clinical value, particularly in the era of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), is unclear [

However, "non-surgical" risk factors are a heterogenous group of risk factors leading to a wide range of recurrence risk. For example, the risk is likely at the lower end of this range for patients with VTE due to the oral contraceptive pill or pregnancy, and higher among those with VTE associated with prolonged travel or minor trauma to a leg muscle.

         In a 2019 Danish cohort study of nearly 74,000 patients with VTE, six month rates of recurrence were similar in patients with VTE who had or did not have an identifiable risk factor, presumably, because both patient populations were receiving anticoagulation during this period (ie, "provoked" and "unprovoked," respectively; 6.8 versus 6.9 percent per year) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Patients with cancer had the highest rates at six months (9 percent per year). However, at 10 years follow-up, rates were higher in patients without an identifiable risk factor ("unprovoked") compared with those who had an identifiable risk factor ("provoked"; 2.8 and 2.2 percent per year; hazard ratio [HR] 1.17) and approximated that of patients with cancer-related VTE (3.7 percent per year).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The terms "provoked" and "unprovoked" have been criticized as this binary designation suggests the pathogenesis of VTE can be separated into two distinct groups, whereas many patients may exist within a spectrum of risk factor severity [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,25
         </a>
         ]. Thus, while patients with unprovoked VTE (ie, VTE without any identifiable risk factor) have a high risk of recurrence, it should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be misconstrued that patients with provoked VTE (ie, VTE with an identifiable risk factor) have a low risk of VTE recurrence. In fact, patients with VTE provoked by persistent minor factors, such as heart failure, immobility, and frequent flyers with extended travel, have a cumulative risk of 15 percent over five years compared with 3 percent over five years in patients with a VTE provoked by major risk factor, such as orthopedic surgery [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, patients with reversible risk factors, whether recent surgery or use of estrogen-containing agents (eg, oral contraceptives), appear to be at low risk for recurrence after the risk factor is no longer present [

          table 1

         ). Typically, the factor associated with the greatest risk of recurrence is the major determinant of risk, although additional factors likely increase the risk further by an unknown amount.

         While major thrombophilic conditions (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome, antithrombin deficiency) increase the risk of a first VTE event, their impact on the risk of a recurrent event is less clear. In this population, it is likely that the major factors that influence recurrence is less likely the thrombophilic condition itself but rather the provoking risk factors associated with that event (ie, provoked or unprovoked, risk factor characteristics). Thus, factors that determine extending anticoagulation in these patients are likely

A 2021 meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials further supports the lower annualized rates of major bleeding with DOACs compared with warfarin (1.12 versus 1.74 percent) [

         We take a detailed history of any previous episodes of bleeding on or off anticoagulant therapy as well as risk factors that could impact future bleeding events  (

In general, indefinite anticoagulation should only be considered in those at low risk of bleeding (eg, ≤3 percent per year) and should, if possible, be avoided in patients with a high risk of bleeding (eg, &gt;3 percent per year). Importantly, clinicians should remember that the bleeding risk is cumulative and discussions with patients should emphasize
         <strong>
          cumulative

         rather than annualized rates.

         When assessing the risk of bleeding, many clinicians use gestalt estimates. However, several tools are also available to predict a patient's risk of bleeding while on anticoagulation. These models are discussed below. (See

         It should be noted that bleeding risk is dynamic such that frequent reassessment is important; for example, bleeding risk increases with age or the development of a new condition such as a gastric ulcer, or it may decrease following recovery from trauma or gastric ulcer treatment. (See

         When assessing the risk of bleeding, many clinicians use gestalt estimates. However, several tools are available to help predict a patient's risk of bleeding while on anticoagulant therapy, none of which has been proven superior. While some use a three-tiered system of low, intermediate, and high risk (eg, American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP] model)  (

          calculator 1

          calculator 2

         We discuss the risks and benefits of indefinite anticoagulant therapy in the context of the patients' personal values and preferences. Patients' preferences and values are particularly important in patients of intermediate risk of recurrence where the benefit of lifelong anticoagulation is less clear. Individual patients attach a variable degree of value on issues such as clinical and laboratory monitoring of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin
         </a>
         (eg, medication adjustments, telephone calls, frequency of office visits), inconvenience of or pain associated with injections (for low molecular weight heparin), and possible modification of (or restrictions upon) recreational activities that involve an increased risk of blunt trauma [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82-86
         </a>
         ]. In addition, patients weigh benefits and harms differently depending on their occupation, hobbies, comorbidities, and life expectancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, a young patient who is an avid mountain climber and has an indication for indefinite anticoagulation may accept the increased risk of VTE over their lifetime and avoid indefinite anticoagulant therapy rather than increase their risk of bleeding from accidental falls. In contrast, an older patient with active cancer may choose to remain on anticoagulation and accept the higher risk of bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         The impact of patient values was illustrated in an observational study that reported that 10 percent of patients declined indefinite anticoagulation despite being good candidates for it [

          1,6-8

         Patients at high risk of recurrent VTE are considered those with an estimated risk of greater than 5 percent per year or cumulative 5 year risk of greater than 23 percent, although this cutoff has been poorly defined (see
         <a class="local">

         For patients who have a bleeding risk that is not high and who have more than one episode of proximal DVT and/or symptomatic PE, and all episodes occurred without an identifiable risk factor (ie, &gt;1 "unprovoked" VTE), we recommend indefinite rather than three months of anticoagulant therapy. For those with a high bleeding risk, the benefits of indefinite anticoagulant therapy are less certain and depend heavily on patient-specific thrombotic and bleeding risk as well as the patient's values and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
         The recommendation for indefinite anticoagulation in patients with more than one episode of unprovoked DVT or symptomatic PE is based upon recurrence rates that are approximately 15 percent at one year and 45 percent at five years [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,46,87-89
         </a>
         ]. One 2012 meta-analysis of five randomized trials of patients with VTE reported that, extending therapy in patients with a second unprovoked VTE event resulted in 132 and 396 fewer events per 1000 patients at one year and five years, respectively, compared with a three or six month period of anticoagulation [

         Active malignancy is a risk factor for VTE with rates of recurrence as high as 15 to 20 percent per year in the absence of anticoagulant therapy [

          6,17,24,29,30

However, the decision is challenging since this population are also at higher risk of bleeding on anticoagulant therapy and patients may have personal factors that weigh into the decision (eg, life expectancy). Recommendations for this population are provided separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1340.html" rel="external">

         For most patients with proximal DVT and/or symptomatic PE who have no identifiable risk factors (ie, "unprovoked" VTE) and in whom the bleeding risk is not high, we suggest indefinite treatment with anticoagulant therapy rather than treatment for three to six months. For patients with a high bleeding risk, the benefits of indefinite anticoagulant therapy are likely outweighed by the high risk of bleeding such that indefinite anticoagulation is not generally performed.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, within this population, there is debate as to whether a subgroup may avoid indefinite anticoagulation. In such cases, some clinicians use the D-dimer level or calculate the DASH score (D-dimer, Age, Sex, Hormonal therapy; 1 point each) to facilitate this decision. For example, in female patients (but not in male patients) with unprovoked VTE and a low posttreatment D-dimer level (eg, four weeks after discontinuing anticoagulant therapy), the estimated eight-year recurrence risk is approximately 17 percent [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, data suggest that those with a DASH score ≤1 have an annualized risk of 3.1 percent (see
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical prediction rules'
         </a>
         above). In situations of uncertainty such as these, some experts including us, may decide not to administer anticoagulant therapy. We do, however, as a general rule in patients with unprovoked VTE maintain a low threshold to continue anticoagulation, for example, when the D-dimer becomes consistently elevated, there is a preference for avoidance of VTE (eg, avoidance of a life-threatening event in a patient with poor cardiopulmonary reserve), or the development of new VTE event. (See
         <a class="local">
          'D-dimer level'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for indefinite anticoagulation in this population is based upon the high estimated lifetime risk of recurrent VTE, which can be which can be reduced by 80 percent or more when anticoagulant therapy is continued beyond the conventional three months [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7,9,10,14,16,24,77,90-96
         </a>
         ]. However, this benefit occurs at the expense of an increased rate of bleeding and without a mortality benefit. Prior duration of anticoagulant therapy does not affect the risk of future recurrence once it is discontinued [

         In patients with any acute thromboembolic event (eg, distal or proximal DVT, symptomatic PE) and persistent nonmalignant risk factors (eg, obesity, active inflammatory bowel disease, active autoimmune disease, nephrotic syndrome, recurrent long-haul flights expected, continued hormonal therapy  (

         )), we typically have a low threshold to offer indefinite anticoagulation, provided the bleeding risk is not high.
        </p>
        <p>
         The range of recurrence risk is likely wide in this population due to the heterogeneous nature of this group. While a meta-analysis and other studies report an estimated risk of VTE recurrence of 5 percent at one year and 15 percent at five years in this population, these figures likely under- or over-estimate the actual risk in individual patients [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-9,97
         </a>
         ]. Thus, in this group, we pay attention to individual risk factors when assessing recurrence. For example, we believe that risk of recurrence associated with obesity is possibly lower than that associated with active inflammatory bowel disease and nephrotic syndrome, although the actual risk is undetermined.

         This group includes patients who develop VTE in association with transient minor risk factors including a long-haul flight, minor surgery &lt;30 minutes, hospitalization &lt;3 days, reduced mobility at home ≥3 days, lower extremity injury without fracture with reduced mobility ≥3 days  (

         Some experts favor indefinite anticoagulation in this population based upon the premise that VTE in the presence of a minor risk factor may represent a propensity for thrombosis. However, others prefer not to indefinitely anticoagulate this population [

          1

         ]. In such situations, use of additional factors and the patient's preferences is particularly important in helping the patient and clinician come to a decision. For example, a male patient with VTE associated with a long-haul flight who has an elevated D-dimer level off anticoagulation or a family history of DVT in the absence of proven inherited thrombophilias may warrant indefinite anticoagulant therapy, whereas a female patient with VTE following a long-haul flight who has no other risk factors and a normal D-dimer may not necessarily warrant indefinite anticoagulation.

For example, patients with more than one episode of VTE associated with a transient major risk factor such as surgery do not necessarily need indefinite anticoagulation, while those with recurrent VTE associated with a persistent risk factor or minor transient risk factor  (

         Management of anticoagulant therapy in patients with prothrombotic disorders is complex and likely depends upon the underlying thrombotic disorder and the provoking event.

         Major ("high-risk) prothrombotic conditions – Most patients with underlying major prothrombotic conditions (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome and anti-thrombin deficiency) and a first episode of acute VTE are treated indefinitely with anticoagulant therapy, provided the bleeding risk is not high  (

         UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, "The Basics" and "Beyond the Basics." The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.

          Rationale
         </strong>
         – Most patients with a first episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE; proximal lower extremity deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and/or pulmonary embolus [PE]) are anticoagulated for a finite period of three to six months. Select patients benefit from indefinite anticoagulation, which is administered with the primary goal of reducing the lifetime risk of recurrent thrombosis. (See

         To estimate VTE risk, we obtain details regarding the index event and risk factors (if any) associated with that event and with any previous event(s). We characterize risk factors as transient or persistent, major or minor, and malignant or nonmalignant  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131266" href="/z/d/graphic/131266.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). We estimate cumulative risk over a one-year or five-year period and categorize it as the following  (

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Several clinical prediction rules have been proposed to estimate the risk of recurrence in VTE not provoked by an identifiable risk factor (ie, "unprovoked" VTE) following discontinuation of anticoagulation; none have become routinely integrated into clinical practice but may be used when uncertainty exists. (See
         <a class="local">

         Similarly, we take a detailed history of any previous episodes of bleeding on or off anticoagulant therapy, risk factors that could impact future bleeding events  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97160" href="/z/d/graphic/97160.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ), and conditions that may affect the half-life of the administered anticoagulant (eg, renal failure, weight loss). Although prediction tools are available (
         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/131287.html" rel="external">
          calculator 2
         </a>
         ), many clinicians use gestalt estimates for the risk of bleeding and categorize it as high or low. In patients with a low bleeding risk in whom a factor Xa or direct thrombin inhibitor is being administered (ie, a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]), the annual risk of bleeding is likely lower (eg, &lt;1.5 percent per year) than that seen in older studies, which largely included patients on

          High-risk VTE recurrence
         </strong>
         – In general, patients at high risk of VTE recurrence  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131265" href="/z/d/graphic/131265.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) in whom the bleeding risk is not high are considered good candidates for indefinite anticoagulant therapy. In these patients, indefinite anticoagulation reduces recurrence by about 80 percent; however, the absolute risk reduction varies depending upon the baseline risk. (See
         <a class="local">
          'High recurrence risk'

         </span>
         For patients who have more than one episode of unprovoked proximal DVT and/or symptomatic PE and more than one episode was unprovoked, we recommend indefinite rather than three months of anticoagulant therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). The baseline risk of recurrence in this group is unacceptably high (eg, 15 percent at one year and 45 percent at five years). For those with a high bleeding risk, the benefits of indefinite anticoagulant therapy are less certain and depend heavily on patient-specific thrombotic and bleeding risk as well as the patient's values and preferences. (See
         <a class="local">

         Patients with VTE who have active cancer are typically appropriate candidates for consideration of indefinite anticoagulation. However, the decision is challenging since this population is also at higher risk of bleeding on anticoagulant therapy, and patients may have personal factors that weigh into the decision (eg, life expectancy). Recommendations for this population are provided separately. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Any VTE associated with active cancer not precipitated by a major provoking event'

         For most patients with a first episode of unprovoked proximal DVT and/or symptomatic PE, we suggest indefinite anticoagulant therapy rather than treatment for three to six months (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). In this population, the estimated baseline risk of recurrent VTE without treatment is approximately 10 to 16 percent for the first year and 5 percent per year thereafter. For patients with a high bleeding risk, the benefits of indefinite anticoagulant therapy are likely outweighed by the high risk of bleeding, such that indefinite anticoagulation is not generally performed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'First episode proximal DVT and/or symptomatic PE without identifiable risk factor'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         However, we believe that a subgroup may avoid indefinite anticoagulation. For select patients who are at lower risk (eg, females with unprovoked VTE and a low posttreatment D-dimer level or DASH score ≤1), we suggest not administering anticoagulant therapy indefinitely (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Close observation and a low threshold to anticoagulate is prudent. This suggestion does not apply to males.

          Intermediate-risk VTE recurrence
         </strong>
         – In general, for patients at intermediate risk of VTE recurrence  (

          table 2

         ), we typically assess the benefits and harms of extending anticoagulant therapy indefinitely on a
         <strong>
          case-by-case
         </strong>
         basis. These decisions are influenced by the number and type of risk factors as well as the values and preferences of the patient. This approach is based upon a risk of recurrence that is wide-ranging (3 to 5 percent per year; 14 to 23 percent over five years) and an efficacy and safety profile for indefinite anticoagulation that is ill-defined and poorly studied, such that patients may reasonably opt for not anticoagulating indefinitely. Patients in this category who are at high risk of bleeding are not typically treated with anticoagulant therapy. The following general principles apply (see
         <a class="local">

         In patients who develop VTE in association with transient minor risk factors including a long-haul flight, minor surgery &lt;30 minutes, hospitalization &lt;3 days, reduced mobility at home ≥3 days, and lower extremity injury without fracture with reduced mobility ≥3 days, we favor extending anticoagulant therapy based upon the observation that the development of VTE in this population may represent a high propensity for thrombosis. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients with a second episode of VTE provoked by a transient or persistent nonmalignant major or minor risk factor, the range of risk is wide. For example, patients with more than one episode of VTE associated with a major transient risk factor such as surgery do not necessarily need indefinite anticoagulation, while those with recurrent VTE associated with a persistent risk factor or minor transient risk factor may be reasonably considered for indefinite anticoagulation, provided the bleeding risk is not high.

          Low recurrence risk
         </strong>
         – For patients with a first episode of VTE provoked by a
         <strong>
          major
         </strong>
         transient risk factor  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131265" href="/z/d/graphic/131265.html" rel="external">
          table 2

          table 1
         </a>
         ), we recommend a three- to six-month finite course of anticoagulant therapy rather than administering indefinite anticoagulant therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). This approach is based upon a low risk of recurrence in this population (&lt;3 percent per year or &lt;15 percent at five years). Patients with major reversible risk factors include those who had surgery with general anesthesia for &gt;30 minutes, were confined to bed with "bathroom privileges" ≥3 days due to acute illness, underwent cesarian delivery, or were hospitalized for major trauma. Pregnancy, the puerperium, and estrogen supplementation are also generally considered major transient risk factors. (See

          Special populations

         <strong>
          Agent choice and regimens
         </strong>
         – For most patients in whom indefinite anticoagulant therapy is chosen, we suggest a factor Xa inhibitor (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/z/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">
          rivaroxaban

          apixaban

         ) rather than
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin

          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ) or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). However, alternate agents may need to be initiated for a variety of reasons during therapy. For many patients on a factor Xa inhibitor, we suggest full intensity or reduced anticoagulant therapy (eg, patients with unprovoked VTE) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). However, low-dose factor Xa regimens may not be appropriate in some patients (eg, patients with high body weight [eg, &gt;120 kg] or patients with highly prothrombotic conditions [eg, cancer]). For patients on warfarin, we suggest full-intensity dose warfarin rather than reduced intensity warfarin (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). We do not advocate the use of aspirin in this setting unless all other options are exhausted. (See
         <a class="local">

          Follow-up
         </strong>
         – During follow-up we assess patients at least annually for recurrence, adequacy of therapeutic control, the development of contraindications to anticoagulation, altered bleeding risk, and chronic hemorrhage, as well as for changes in agent preference. (See
