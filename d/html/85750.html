         Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms near the end of life that can cause substantial physical and psychological distress for patients and their families and significantly impact quality of life (QOL). Nausea, the unpleasant sensation of being about to vomit, can occur alone or can accompany vomiting, dyspepsia, or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Vomiting is the expulsion of gastric contents through the mouth caused by forceful and sustained contraction of the abdominal muscles and diaphragm. Retching differs from vomiting in the absence of expulsion of gastric contents.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many potential causes of nausea and vomiting in palliative care populations, and the etiology is often multifactorial, particularly in patients with cancer. In such patients, nausea and vomiting might be caused by anti-tumor treatment (radiation therapy [RT] or chemotherapy), represent an acute complication of the malignancy (hypercalcemia, malignant bowel obstruction), be due to gastroparesis (eg, from autonomic dysfunction), or be from drug-induced constipation (opioids, type 3 serotonin receptor [5-HT
         <sub>
          3
         </sub>
         ] antagonists). These various causes of nausea and vomiting may occur simultaneously or sequentially in any individual patient.

         Symptom research in patients who have a serious and/or life-threatening illness has largely been conducted in those with cancer. Cancer treatment is one of the more common causes of nausea and vomiting in such patients. Despite adherence to published guidelines on prophylactic antiemetics, breakthrough nausea and vomiting affects up to 40 percent of patients treated with either chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT).

         The incidence and severity of radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) are both treatment related (irradiated site and volume, single and total dose, fractionation schedule, techniques) and patient related. The most important factor appears to be the radiation field  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119996" href="/z/d/graphic/119996.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Between 90 and 100 percent of patients receiving total body irradiation, 30 to 90 percent of those undergoing upper abdominal or craniospinal irradiation, and 10 to 30 percent of those receiving brain, head and neck, thorax, or pelvic irradiation will develop RINV. Irradiation to the breast or extremities produces a less than 10 percent risk. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Chemotherapy is a well-known cause of nausea and vomiting. Three distinct types of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are defined (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1150.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The single most important factor predicting the likelihood that nausea and/or emesis will develop during chemotherapy is the intrinsic emetogenicity of the chemotherapy agent(s). Chemotherapy agents are divided into four emetogenic levels, which are defined by the expected frequency of emesis in the absence of effective antiemetic prophylaxis (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1150.html" rel="external">

         The predicted acute emetogenicity potential of individual parenteral and oral chemotherapy agents is provided  (

         ). For combination regimens, the emetogenic level is determined by identifying the most emetogenic agent in the combination and then assessing the relative contribution of the other agents. As an example,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">

         are both moderately emetogenic agents, but when given together, the regimen is considered to be highly emetogenic. (See

         Despite the improved control of both acute and delayed CINV when prophylaxis is provided according to published guidelines, breakthrough CINV, defined as nausea or emesis that occurs despite adequate antiemetic prophylaxis, remains a significant patient problem. The incidence of breakthrough symptoms is as high as 40 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ]. In particular, conventional antiemetics are more successful at preventing emesis than in preventing nausea, particularly delayed nausea. (See

         Nausea and vomiting that is unrelated to cancer therapy is also common in cancer patients at the end of life. In several reports, the prevalence of nausea and/or vomiting in terminal cancer patients who are no longer receiving anti-tumor treatment ranges from 30 to 60 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-13
         </a>
         ]. Although nausea is frequently reported, longitudinal studies measuring symptom intensity with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) suggest that it is generally not severe at the end of life; fewer than 20 percent of affected patients have a score ≥4 (moderate intensity or worse) during the last seven days of life [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. A population based cohort of over 10,000 patients also found nausea intensity to be low (mean ESAS &lt;1.5) with a stable, flat trajectory over the last six months of life [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Effective, readily available pharmacologic antiemetics may in part explain the low ESAS scores for nausea.

         ] comparing the prevalence of symptoms among end-stage patients with cancer, AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD) found that rates of nausea ranged from 43 to 49 percent in patients with AIDS, 17 to 48 percent in HF, and 30 to 43 percent in patients with CKD. No data could be obtained for the prevalence of nausea among patients with COPD. However, a subsequent study of patients with advanced COPD found a prevalence of 18 percent for nausea and 4 percent for emesis [

         Some of the challenge inherent to studying nausea and emesis in palliative care populations with life-limiting illness is that there may not be a clear distinction between nausea and vomiting. The distinction is important, since nausea and vomiting may have different pathophysiologic mechanisms and also different responses to interventions.

         In the setting of palliative care, identifying the underlying cause(s) of nausea and vomiting may be useful for selecting the therapeutic option. However, the success of etiology-based therapy is limited by the multifactorial etiology of nausea and vomiting, particularly in cancer patients, and the lack of prospective data demonstrating the superiority of this approach over empirically chosen antiemetic therapy (with the exception of chemotherapy- or radiation-related nausea and vomiting and treatment for malignant bowel obstruction). Nevertheless, etiology-based management of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients is widely practiced. (See

         An important distinction must be made between the mechanisms producing emesis (vomiting, retching) and those causing nausea. Emesis is not merely a more severe degree of nausea, since the neural circuits responsible for nausea appear to be anatomically distinct from those that generate emesis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Emesis is mediated centrally by two separate “centers”: the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the area postrema in the floor of the fourth ventricle, and the vomiting center (VC), an anatomically indistinct area that includes the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) and the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata  (

         ). Neural input from the CTZ, vestibular system, higher cortical centers, and thoracoabdominal organs is integrated in the VC. Chemosensitive receptors of the CTZ detect emetic agents in the blood and relay this information to the adjacent VC. The CTZ lacks a blood-brain barrier, and this allows toxins to activate the CTZ via dopamine 2 receptors. Peripheral signals from abdominal vagal afferents and splanchnic nerves that detect intestinal luminal contents and gastric tone via mechanoreceptors or by the release of serotonin from gut enterochromaffin cells also terminate in the NTS and can lead to emesis [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The vomiting reflex is coordinated by the VC in the brainstem and does not require input from the cortex. As such, autonomic activation, sepsis, and motion may induce vomiting in decorticate individuals.

        <p>
         On the other hand, the mechanisms underlying the symptom of nausea are not well understood. However, unlike vomiting, nausea requires conscious awareness and cerebral function [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ]. Studies of motion sickness in humans suggest involvement of gastric myoelectrical activity and endogenous neuroendocrine responses (ie, increases in plasma cortisol, beta-endorphins, epinephrine and norepinephrine). (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, the concept that nausea is mediated through different pathways than emesis is supported by the observation that nausea and vomiting seem to be pharmacologically distinct. Among patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy, neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists and type 3 serotonin (5-HT

         In general, it is conventional teaching in palliative care to base the choice of the antiemetic on the presumptive etiology of the nausea and vomiting (the so-called etiology or mechanistic-based approach as opposed to the empiric approach) even though outside of the setting of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the evidence to prove benefit for this approach is weak:

         In a prospective study, the management of nausea and vomiting in 121 patients with advanced cancer admitted to hospice based upon suspected etiology was only moderately effective (after one week, vomiting was controlled in 89 percent of patients, but nausea was only controlled in 56 percent); about one-fourth of patients were thought to have more than one cause for their nausea [

         The value of etiology-based as compared with empiric antiemetic therapy was addressed in a systematic review of 93 studies of treatment of nausea and vomiting in cancer unrelated to chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT) that was conducted by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The studies included one systematic review and 18 randomized trials, many of which were low quality based on either lack of blinding, lack of description of the method of randomization, concealment, and/or attrition. The authors concluded that there was no evidence that antiemetic choice based on the presumed etiology of the nausea and vomiting was any better than a single empirically chosen antiemetic.

         Despite the paucity of evidence, an etiology-based approach to pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting in palliative care is widely practiced.

         We suggest not pursuing the use of medical marijuana for refractory nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients. The use of medical marijuana for refractory nausea and emesis in patients with a terminal illness is very controversial. Medical use of marijuana is legal in several countries, including the Netherlands and Canada. Despite legalization by several states, marijuana use is still illegal in the United States at the federal level and there are no controlled clinical studies to support marijuana’s efficacy for symptom management [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, there can be disturbing central nervous system side effects, particularly among older individuals. Because of medical and legal concerns, the use of medical marijuana is not included in the guidelines for CINV from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), or MASCC [

         A variety of environmental and psychologic factors can contribute to nausea. Simple preventive measures such as minimizing the sights, sounds, and smells associated with nausea may be effective in the palliative care setting. Although avoidance of fatty, spicy, highly salted foods is frequently suggested [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ], there are no published studies on the benefits of dietary modification in reducing nausea.
        </p>
        <p>
         Complementary and integrative medicine measures (eg, acupuncture, ginger, guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, music therapy) have some evidence for benefit in control of nausea and vomiting; however, almost all studies have been conducted in patients with CINV [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Very few studies have examined the benefits of any of these complementary therapies, including acupuncture or acupressure, in patients with chronic nausea unrelated to chemotherapy, and the benefits in palliative care populations remain uncertain [

         The management of nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer should be individualized and targeted toward the specific etiology. For example, patients with nausea as a result of bowel obstruction will be managed differently than those with nausea as a result of hypercalcemia. In addition, patients with CINV or radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) require a different treatment strategy than those who have advanced cancer and are no longer receiving disease-specific therapy.

         For patients with nausea and emesis that occurs despite adequate antiemetic prophylaxis (“breakthrough” nausea and emesis), it is important to exclude other disease- and medication-related causes before considering changes to the antiemetic regimen. Examples include:

         Assuming these factors are excluded, it is important to ensure that the patient is receiving the antiemetic appropriate for the drug(s) being given  (

         ). A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing olanzapine with other standard antiemetics for either prevention (10 randomized controlled trials) or breakthrough treatment (three randomized controlled trials) found olanzapine inclusion improved CINV prophylaxis and was superior to standard therapy for rescue treatment [

         (not available in the United States), although antiemetic efficacy is modest at best, rigorous comparisons of either drug with the most effective antiemetic therapies for CINV are lacking, and adverse effects tend to be more intense and more frequent than with other rescue agents such as neuroleptics. The modest antiemetic activity of this class of agents combined with their relatively unfavorable side effect profile (vertigo, xerostomia, hypotension, dysphoria), especially in older patients, has limited their clinical utility. Nevertheless, guidelines from the NCCN [

         The incidence and severity of RINV are related to both treatment (irradiated site and volume, single and total dose, fractionation schedule, techniques) and patient factors. Risk categories for emesis based upon the site of irradiation stratify a patient’s risk for RINV into four categories  (

         ]. For patients being treated with concomitant RT and chemotherapy, antiemetic prophylaxis should be based upon the higher chemotherapy or RT emesis risk category. Notably, in contrast to CINV, the evidence base from randomized trials to support these specific guidelines is more limited. (See

         There are multiple etiologies of nausea in patients with advanced cancer who are not receiving chemotherapy or RT, including constipation, medications and metabolic abnormalities, central nervous system malignancy, bowel obstruction, gastroparesis, hepatomegaly, or ascites. A summary of the approach to management of non-chemotherapy or RT-related nausea and vomiting in patients with terminal cancer is provided in the figure  (

          algorithm 1

         ). A detailed history and physical examination are required as they may provide clues to the etiology; investigations such as computed tomography (CT) scans or abdominal radiographs may also be required in selected patients. (See

         Opioids have three potentially emetogenic mechanisms: a direct effect on the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), enhanced vestibular sensitivity, and delayed gastric emptying. Refractory constipation and stool impaction may be contributory. When present, constipation should be managed before addressing opioid-induced nausea. (See

         Chronic nausea from opioid therapy usually responds to the same group of drug therapies that are used for acute nausea and vomiting. Opioid rotation or a change in route of administration could also be considered, although the data to support benefit from any of these strategies are limited [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>

         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ] concluded that while there was some weak evidence for changing the opioid or the route of administration, the data were too limited to give evidence-based recommendations for the use of antiemetics for opioid-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer.

         Severe constipation is another easily reversible cause of nausea that needs to be considered especially in patients receiving opioids. Some patients are able to improve bowel function by dietary modifications, including increased consumption of fluids and dietary fiber. Fiber should be discontinued, however, if the patient is debilitated, bowel obstruction is suspected, or hydration has been difficult to maintain. Patients who have passed no stool in several days and who have no evidence of bowel obstruction or ileus are likely to be impacted. It is often possible to clear the rectal vault and lower sigmoid colon with a

         There are numerous options for laxative therapy  (

         Malignant large and/or small bowel obstruction (malignant bowel obstruction [MBO]) is a well-recognized complication in patients with advanced intraabdominal or pelvic tumors. Most of these patients are inoperable, and their survival is generally short. Clinical management of MBO requires a specific and individualized approach that is based on disease prognosis and the objectives of care. In most cases, there are few or no data addressing the relative value of palliative surgery versus medical management, and a decision to proceed to surgical intervention requires careful weighing of risks and benefits, including an assessment of the estimated life expectancy and patient goals and preferences. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         While treatment of CINV and RINV is supported by well-performed randomized controlled trials, high-quality evidence to support any specific antiemetic approach for patients with terminal cancer who have non-chemotherapy and non-RT-related nausea and no other obvious cause for the symptom is lacking. A systematic review of the treatment of nausea and/or emesis in cancer patients unrelated to chemotherapy and radiation included 93 studies and 14 randomized trials; the authors concluded that there was moderate-quality evidence for benefit from first-line therapy with

         For patients who do not have an identifiable cause for nausea, no evidence-based recommendations for a specific antiemetic can be made. However, the potential for prolongation of the corrected QT interval should be considered in drug selection. (See

         Among patients with cancer, chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) are common causes of nausea and vomiting. Despite adherence to published guidelines, breakthrough nausea and vomiting affects up to 40 percent of patients treated with either modality. (See

         Chronic nausea is also a significant problem in patients with terminal cancer who are not receiving active cancer treatment and in other palliative care populations with chronic kidney disease (CKD), AIDS, and heart failure (HF). (See

         In many cases, the cause can be determined from the history and physical examination. The most common causes of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients are outlined in the table  (

         Additional laboratory investigations or imaging may be required depending on the clinical presentation and prognosis of the patient. However, even in advanced disease, when the burden of diagnostic testing may outweigh the benefit, investigations may be justified if they could identify potentially modifiable etiologies and influence management.

         An effort should be made to identify and correct reversible underlying causes. This may include correction of metabolic abnormalities, aggressive bowel care for constipated patients, opioid rotation in patients with suspected opioid-induced nausea and vomiting, and, in patients with cancer who have brain metastases, the administration of glucocorticoids followed by local therapy (radiation or surgery).

         Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) should be suspected in a patient with progressively worsening colicky pain with diminishing stool and flatus. Most patients are inoperable, and survival is generally short. Clinical management requires a specific and individualized approach that is based on the likely cause, disease prognosis, and the objectives of care. In most cases, there are few or no data addressing the relative value of palliative surgery versus medical management, and a decision to proceed to surgical intervention requires careful weighing of risks and benefits, including an assessment of the estimated life expectancy and patient goals and preferences. Colonic stent placement is an acceptable palliative option for inoperable patients. Although clinical management should be individualized, a suggested algorithmic approach is provided  (

         Acupuncture or acupressure may be of benefit for CINV, but the available evidence is insufficient to support use in other palliative care populations. However, given the overall safety of this approach, interested patients may be referred for a trial of acupuncture if symptoms of moderate to severe nausea persist despite other forms of therapy.

         Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently have a high symptom burden that includes gastrointestinal symptoms, but medications (especially methylxanthines) are often responsible for nausea and vomiting. (See

         Among patients with AIDS, nausea may be caused by medications (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs], nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs], and protease inhibitors [PIs]). No specific antiemetic can be recommended, although there is limited evidence for the use of oral cannabinoid agents with a narrow therapeutic window. (See
