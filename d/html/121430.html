         Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a disorder defined by patterns of angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behavior, and vindictiveness of at least six months duration. The symptoms lead to conflicts with adults or peers, and are associated with impairment in home, school, or community settings. Symptoms typically begin in the preschool years, although the disorder may be first diagnosed later in childhood, adolescence, or even in adulthood. ODD often, but not always, precedes the development of conduct disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of ODD. Another topic describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of conduct disorder. Treatment of ODD and conduct disorder are discussed together in a separate topic. Topics discussing attentional problems, hyperactivity, mood disorders, and behavior and mood manifestations of prior trauma are also found separately.

         The reported prevalence rate of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) varies from 1 to 10 percent. In a large, representative United States sample of 3199 individuals from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, the lifetime prevalence of ODD was estimated as 11 percent in males and 9 percent in females [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, the prevalence of ODD in a representative sample of more than 10,000 5- to 15-year-old children from the United Kingdom was 3 percent in males and 1.4 percent in females [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In general, the disorder is more prevalent in males than females prior to adolescence but not consistently thereafter.

         Evidence for separate genetic pathways linking childhood irritability with later depression or anxiety, and defiant behavior with later conduct disorder and problematic substance use, has implications for the early identification of these disorders and for further research into the etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of ODD and comorbid conditions.

         Studies in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the United States demonstrate a moderate genetic influence on the irritability and defiant behavior components of ODD, with heritabilities ranging from 31 to 54 percent and 41 to 45 percent respectively [

         In British and Swedish studies, the genetic correlation of irritability was stronger with depressed mood than with delinquency while the genetic correlation for defiant behavior was stronger with delinquency than with depressed mood [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. Longitudinally, the overlap of childhood irritability with adolescent mood and anxiety disorders and of defiant behavior with adolescent substance use disorder symptoms was primarily due to common genetic influences [

         The prominent feature of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a persistent pattern of angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behavior, and vindictiveness of at least six months duration. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the individual or others (family, peer group) or impacts negatively upon social/interpersonal, educational, occupational, or other areas of functioning. Symptoms must occur with persons other than a sibling to make a diagnosis of ODD.

         Individuals who have the irritability aspects of the disorder tend to have comorbid symptoms such as anxiety or depression (ie, internalizing disorders) which may occur throughout the course of the illness. Individuals with more disruptive behavior aspects of the disorder tend to have comorbid attentional problems, substance use, and conduct disorder (ie, externalizing disorders) [

         Symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) typically appear during preschool, with many of the behaviors associated with ODD increasing throughout the preschool, childhood, and adolescent years. Children and adolescents with ODD are at increased risk of functional impairments in relationships, education, and the workplace in adulthood.

         While ODD and conduct disorder are often comorbid, some but not all children with ODD will develop conduct disorder:

         In a four-year follow-up study comparing children with ADHD to controls, two types of ODD associated with ADHD were identified [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. One type that is thought to be prodromal to conduct disorder and another that is subsyndromal to conduct disorder and is unlikely to progress to conduct disorder in later years. In the study, among the 140 children with ADHD, 65 percent had comorbid ODD while 22 percent had comorbid conduct disorder. Additionally, among those with comorbid ODD, 32 percent also had comorbid conduct disorder. In all but one of these cases, ODD preceded the diagnosis of conduct disorder by several years. Despite this comorbidity, children with ODD but without conduct disorder at baseline were at no greater risk for conduct disorder at four-year follow-up.

         In a 10-year follow-up, ODD persisted at full or subthreshold levels in 17 percent of those diagnosed previously [

          28

         ]. At 10-year follow-up, ODD also appeared to confer a higher risk of developing conduct disorder (odds ratio 6.2) or antisocial personality disorder (odds ratio 4.5). Furthermore, children with ODD also showed higher rates of educational problems such as needing extra help with schoolwork (65 percent), placement in a special class (12 percent), detention (35 percent), suspension (45 percent), or expulsion (6 percent) than children in the control group. However, these children did not show increases in arrests, convictions, or being fired from a job unless their ODD was accompanied by conduct disorder.

         We assess for interpersonal or relationship problems, school- or work-related problems, and legal problems across multiple situations and settings. Typically, history taking is obtained from caregivers or teachers. Children under the age of 10 are rarely used as informants given the lack of reliability and validity of the child’s reports of their oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms.

         </span>
         While we try make a carefully considered diagnosis, we prefer to treat all individuals with symptoms that cause psychosocial distress and impairment, whether they meet all the diagnostic criteria for ODD. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87571.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of oppositional defiant and conduct disorders"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         To meet criteria for the diagnosis, the frequency of symptoms must exceed that which is normative for the individual’s age. The frequency criteria provide a framework for the minimal frequency; however, other factors such as cultural, developmental, or gender factors are considered. It is important to recognize that while ODD and conduct disorder are frequently comorbid, they are distinct disorders that can be separately diagnosed and may co-occur. In addition, while ODD is typically considered a childhood disorder it can occur in adults and may similarly benefit from treatment.

        <p>
         The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) criteria for the diagnosis of ODD are as follows:

         “A. A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting at least six months as evidenced by at least four symptoms from any of the following categories, and exhibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling.

          Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)
         </strong>
         – ODD is a disorder that typically begins in preschool years but may be first diagnosed later in childhood, adolescence, or even in adulthood. The symptoms lead to conflicts with adults or peers and are associated with impairment in home, school, or community settings. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Prevalence
         </strong>
         – The prevalence of ODD ranges from 1 to 10 percent. The disorder is more prevalent in males than females prior to adolescence but not consistently thereafter. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prevalence'

         <strong>
          Socioeconomic correlates
         </strong>
         – Antisocial behaviors (eg, aggressive or rule-breaking behavior) are common in ODD and appear to be modestly associated with lower socioeconomic status. (See

          'Socioeconomic status and other correlates'

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – The prominent feature of ODD is a persistent pattern of angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behavior, and vindictiveness of at least six months duration. Symptoms must occur with persons other than a sibling to make a diagnosis of ODD. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Symptom dimensions
         </strong>
         – Individuals who have the irritability aspects of the disorder tend to have comorbid symptoms such as anxiety or depression (ie, internalizing disorders) which may occur throughout the course of the illness. Individuals with the more defiant behavior aspects of the disorder tend to have comorbid attentional problems, substance use, and/or conduct disorder (ie, externalizing disorders). (See

          Course
         </strong>
         – Symptoms of ODD typically appear beginning in the preschool years. Some, but not all, children with ODD, particularly those with the defiant behavior symptoms, will develop conduct disorder and substance use disorders. Similarly, some children with ODD, particularly those with the irritability symptoms, will develop mood and/or anxiety disorders. Children and adolescents with ODD are at increased risk of functional impairments in relationships, education and the workplace in adulthood. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Assessment
         </strong>
         – We assess ODD using a detailed medical and psychiatric history that includes structured or semistructured interviews of the child’s parents or caregivers and teachers. Symptom questionnaires or rating scales are often a useful supplement or alternative to structured or semistructured interviews. (See
