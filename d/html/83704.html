Adnexal masses may be found in females of all ages and have many etiologies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107713" href="/d/graphic/107713.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>The principal goals of the evaluation of an adnexal mass are to determine whether the mass is "almost certainly benign," has a "reasonable chance of being malignant," and whether there is an urgent condition (eg, ectopic pregnancy, adnexal torsion) that requires prompt medical or surgical treatment. Management of nonurgent conditions may involve:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Expectant management – When the mass is not suspicious for malignancy and there are no other indications for surgery or surveillance, no further follow-up is needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Surveillance – Surveillance is an option if the suspicion of malignancy is low but has not been completely excluded. Surveillance usually includes one or more pelvic ultrasounds and/or measurement of serum tumor markers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Surgery – Surgery is performed when there is a high risk of malignancy, histologic diagnosis is desired, or the patient has persistent pain or other symptoms.</p><p></p><p>This topic will focus on the evaluation and management of nonpregnant adult patients with an adnexal mass. The evaluation and management of patients with an adnexal mass in other populations (fetus, pediatric, and pregnant patients), as well as other related topics, are reviewed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3208.html" rel="external">"Adnexal mass: Ultrasound categorization"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3204.html" rel="external">"Adnexal mass: Differential diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5909.html" rel="external">"Ovarian cysts in infants, children, and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3201.html" rel="external">"Adnexal mass: Evaluation and management in pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, we will use the term "patient" to describe genetic females.

The patients in this study, the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) study, underwent transvaginal ultrasound examination at 22 centers (oncology centers, referral centers for ultrasonography, and general hospitals) and were selected for surgery by the managing clinician, which may affect the prevalences listed in the table.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2108607245"><span class="h2">Clinical presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with an adnexal mass may be asymptomatic or present with one or more of the following symptoms. Frequency of symptoms vary widely depending on the etiology of the mass and population studied:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pelvic pain or pressure – Pelvic pain or pressure is the most common symptom associated with an adnexal mass [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. When present, it is often unilateral and can be of variable severity, acute or gradual onset, sharp or dull, and constant or intermittent. More generalized pain may occur if an adnexal cyst ruptures and spills irritants (eg, blood, sebaceous material, inflammatory contents) into the peritoneal cavity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abdominal fullness or pressure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gastrointestinal discomfort (eg, nausea, vomiting, constipation, bloating).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Difficult or frequent urination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dysmenorrhea.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dyspareunia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fever.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) – AUB is more common in certain types of adnexal masses, including pregnancy-related masses (eg, ectopic pregnancy) and hormonally active ovarian tumors (eg, sex cord-stromal tumors).

Small adnexal masses may be difficult to palpate due to the deep anatomic location of the ovary. Larger masses can extend out of the pelvis and be difficult to feel. In patients with a prior hysterectomy, the ovaries may rise out of the pelvis and be difficult to palpate due to loss of ligamentous attachments.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Findings such as pain with palpation; abdominal distention, ascites, or bloating; or a mass that is irregular, fixed, and/or associated with posterior cul-de-sac nodularity should be noted.

Furthermore, there can be substantial variability in both image acquisition (eg, type of equipment, expertise of the sonographer) and interpretation. Thus, if there is suspicion for malignancy, or uncertainty about the degree of risk for malignancy, a repeat ultrasound examination with a specialist in gynecologic sonography, additional imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or consultation with a gynecologic oncologist should be obtained [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Role of additional imaging'</a> below and <a class="local">'When to refer to a gynecologic oncologist'</a> below.)</p><p>An emerging classification system for standardizing the reporting of sonographic findings and describing the risk of malignancy of an adnexal mass is the American College of Radiology (ACR) Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS), which is promising, but not yet widely used [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3208.html" rel="external">"Adnexal mass: Ultrasound categorization", section on 'O-RADS'</a>).

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
