As a result, there is an increase in pressures in the left atrium, pulmonary vasculature, and right side of the heart, while the left ventricle is unaffected in isolated MS. The most common cause of MS is rheumatic heart disease with mitral commissural fusion; thickened mitral valve leaflets with restricted motion at the leaflet tips; and thickening, shortening, fusion, and calcification of the chordae tendineae. Among patients with rheumatic heart disease in resource-limited countries, some present with pure MS, some present with pure mitral regurgitation, and some present with mixed MS and mitral regurgitation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13612.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease", section on 'Chronic valve disease'</a>.)</p><p>Severe mitral annular calcification and congenital MS are less common causes of MS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8137.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and natural history of mitral stenosis"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features and evaluation of MS due to rheumatic heart disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Other issues related to rheumatic MS, such as the pathophysiology, natural history, and management (including medical therapy, percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy, and mitral valve surgery) are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8137.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and natural history of mitral stenosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8139.html" rel="external">"Rheumatic mitral stenosis: Overview of management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8140.html" rel="external">"Surgical and investigational approaches to management of mitral stenosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2840034199"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The duration of the asymptomatic phase of rheumatic MS (or mixed MS and mitral regurgitation) varies widely, with generally more rapid progression in resource-limited countries, and slower progression to symptoms in resource-abundant countries.</p><p>MS usually presents with exertional dyspnea and/or decreased exercise tolerance [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These symptoms are primarily related to the severity of the valvular stenosis, as it impacts the left atrial pressure, pulmonary pressures, pulmonary vascular resistance, and cardiac output. However, many patients with severe MS do not recognize symptoms because slow progression of disease is accompanied by a gradual reduction in activity and generalized deconditioning. As a result, a careful history regarding exercise tolerance is often required to document a slow decline in functional status. (See <a class="local">'Staging'</a> below.)</p><p>Less common clinical presentations include fatigue, hemoptysis, and chest pain.</p><p>Additional clinical manifestations are caused by complications including ascites and lower extremity edema associated with right heart failure (particularly in patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension), stroke or other thromboembolic event (particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation [AF]), hoarseness, and, rarely, fever due to infective endocarditis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Dyspnea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common and, often, the only symptom of MS is exertional dyspnea, which occurs in up to 70 percent of symptomatic patients [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Dyspnea results from elevation in left atrial pressure and pulmonary venous hypertension, which leads to reduced compliance of the lungs, a decrease in vital capacity, and increased work of breathing. Dyspnea also may be related to an inability to increase the cardiac output with increased metabolic demands. As the degree of MS increases, dyspnea occurs with very little effort and orthopnea and fatigue may also occur.</p><p>However, for some patients, the initial clinical presentation is acute dyspnea with hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema precipitated by AF with rapid ventricular response, intercurrent noncardiac infection, pregnancy, or fluid overload. (See <a class="local">'Precipitants of symptoms'</a> below and <a class="local">'Atrial fibrillation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H550040260"><span class="h3">Fatigue</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fatigue is a less common symptom that may occur as the degree of MS worsens, cardiac output declines, and right heart failure develops (see <a class="local">'Right heart failure'</a> below). Thus, fatigue may be associated with low forward flow and a low transmitral gradient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Hemoptysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The increased pulmonary pressures and vascular congestion can lead to hemoptysis, which may have a variety of clinical manifestations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sudden hemorrhage (pulmonary apoplexy) due to the rupture of thin-walled and dilated bronchial veins when there is a sudden increase in left atrial pressure. This complication is rarely life-threatening, despite what appears to be a large amount of bleeding. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4394.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of life-threatening hemoptysis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood-tinged sputum induced by severe coughing associated with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or bronchitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pink frothy sputum resulting from pulmonary edema associated with left heart failure.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3924586418"><span class="h3">Chest pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with MS rarely present with chest pain. Although the pain often resembles angina and may be due to underlying coronary artery disease or a coronary artery embolism, it is most commonly the result of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right ventricular hypertrophy, which may be associated with right ventricular endocardial ischemia. Another cause of intermittent chest pain is an atrial tachyarrhythmia with left atrial and pulmonary vascular distension. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112486.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (group 2 pulmonary hypertension) in adults", section on 'Symptoms and signs'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6832.html" rel="external">"Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2731101774"><span class="h2">Precipitants of symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any situation that increases the cardiac output, which raises transmitral flow or causes tachycardia (which decreases diastolic filling time), can increase the transmitral pressure gradient and precipitate symptoms such as dyspnea or hemoptysis. Activities or conditions that can provoke symptoms include exertion, emotional stress, fever, infection (eg, pneumonia), AF, and pregnancy. However, stroke or other thromboembolic complication may be the first manifestation in previously asymptomatic individuals.</p><p>As an example, the increase in heart rate and cardiac output during pregnancy can substantially increase the resting transmitral gradient in pregnant patients with MS, which can lead to symptoms in a previously asymptomatic (and perhaps undiagnosed) patient or an exacerbation of symptoms in an already symptomatic patient [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8133.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy in women with mitral stenosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3600968144"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Except in patients with severe long-standing disease, the physical findings are subtle and the murmur may be difficult to appreciate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2353991464"><span class="h3">General examination</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When MS is severe, causing PH and diminished cardiac output, cutaneous vasodilation results in pinkish-purple patches on the cheeks (mitral facies).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lung examination may demonstrate crackles (rales) consistent with pulmonary edema. However, pulmonary congestion is absent in some patients with chronically elevated left atrial pressure, which has been attributed to compensatory lymphatic hyperfunction [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Advanced disease may be associated with the signs of right-sided heart failure such as elevated jugular venous pressure, lower extremity edema, and ascites.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2894070611"><span class="h3">Cardiovascular examination</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H600688063"><span class="h4">Pulse examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The arterial pulses are preserved in most patients with MS, reflecting preserved stroke volume. In patients with severe MS with AF, the arterial pulses are reduced in volume due to the decreased stroke volume. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1077.html" rel="external">"Examination of the arterial pulse"</a>.)</p><p>Findings on jugular venous examination include a prominent "a" wave (atrial contraction or systole) reflecting elevated right atrial pressure in the setting of PH and right ventricular hypertrophy. The "a" wave is absent in patients with AF and only a prominent "v" wave (atrial filling during ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve is closed) is seen. If present, tricuspid regurgitation can lead to a prominent "c-v" wave (reflecting regurgitation of blood into the right atrium) and the neck veins are very pulsatile. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1076.html" rel="external">"Examination of the jugular venous pulse"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2987961469"><span class="h4">Cardiac examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Identification of characteristic heart sounds, opening snap, and diastolic murmur may be diagnostic for MS with appropriate patient positioning in a quiet room. The classic findings of MS were originally described in populations in which rheumatic heart disease manifested at an early age, often in underweight individuals. The physical signs may be more difficult to detect in older patients with comorbidities such as obesity and chronic lung disease. The opening snap and murmur may be difficult to appreciate, particularly when MS presents during pregnancy or with rapid AF. In individuals with suspected rheumatic heart disease, the threshold for proceeding with echocardiography should be low.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28006618"><span class="h5">Palpation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Palpation of the chest wall reveals an apical impulse that is generally normal, although it may be reduced in magnitude. However, if PH is present, there may be a right ventricular heave (parasternal lift) and a palpable S2. The first heart sound (S1) may also be palpable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1081.html" rel="external">"Examination of the precordial pulsation", section on 'Right ventricular impulse'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1195813620"><span class="h5">Heart sounds</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following findings are characteristic for MS, but their absence does not exclude the diagnosis. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>S1</strong> – With stenotic but noncalcified mitral leaflets, the leaflets are widely separated at the onset of ventricular contraction due to elevated left atrial pressure, and the first heart sound (S1) is loud, reflecting the increased excursion of the stiff leaflets  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55136" href="/d/graphic/55136.html" rel="external">movie 1A</a>). As the leaflets become more rigid and calcified with severe obstruction, their motion is limited, and S1 becomes soft. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds", section on 'Intensity of S1'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>S2</strong> – The second heart sound is initially normal, but, with the development of PH, P2 becomes increased in intensity and may be widely transmitted. As pressure increases further, splitting of S2 is reduced, and, ultimately, S2 becomes a single sound.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>S3</strong> – A third heart sound of left ventricular origin is not heard in pure MS because of the obstruction to flow across the mitral valve. However, it may be present if there is coexisting aortic or mitral regurgitation or it may be generated from the right ventricle.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>S4</strong> – A fourth heart sound may be heard, generally originating from the right ventricle when it is hypertrophied and dilated and the patient is still in sinus rhythm.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3575146028"><span class="h5">Opening snap</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the presence of MS with leaflets with preserved mobility, an opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is heard  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55136 graphicRef66921" href="/d/graphic/55136.html" rel="external">movie 1A-B</a>). The OS is due to the abrupt halt in leaflet motion in early diastole, after rapid initial rapid opening, due to fusion at the leaflet tips. It is best heard at the apex and lower left sternal border. The OS following S2 may be mistaken for a split S2 unless the examiner recognizes that the two components of S2 are followed by the OS during the inspiration and that the OS is best appreciated at the apex, not the base. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds", section on 'Opening snap'</a>.)</p><p>As the MS progresses and left atrial pressure increases, the OS occurs earlier after S2 or A2. Thus, more severe MS is generally associated with a shorter A2-OS interval. However, this relationship is complicated by the effects of other conditions including tachycardia, hypertension, mitral regurgitation, and aortic valve disease, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds", section on 'Mitral valve'</a>.)</p><p>The OS is loudest when there is preserved excursion of the mitral leaflets. The OS is absent when the mitral valve leaflet motion is severely limited with calcification [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4089323639"><span class="h5">Diastolic murmur</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The murmur caused by MS is a low-pitched diastolic rumble that is most prominent at the apex. It is heard best in a quiet room with the patient lying on the left side in held expiration and by using the bell of the stethoscope or the low frequency range of an electronic stethoscope carefully positioned over the apex  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55136" href="/d/graphic/55136.html" rel="external">movie 1A</a>).</p><p>Although the intensity of the diastolic murmur does not correlate with the severity of the stenosis, the duration of the murmur is helpful since it reflects the transvalvular gradient and the duration of blood flow across the valve.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When MS is mild, the gradient is confined to late diastole (during atrial contraction), and, hence, the murmur is heard late in diastole, just before S1.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As the stenosis becomes more severe, there is a gradient at the very onset of the diastolic flow period, immediately following the OS. This early diastolic murmur is decrescendo, becoming softer as the transvalvular gradient decreases. If the patient is still in sinus rhythm, the increase in atrial pressure during atrial contraction results in an increase in the loudness of the murmur, termed "presystolic accentuation"  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55136" href="/d/graphic/55136.html" rel="external">movie 1A</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>With more severe MS, there is a continuous gradient throughout all of the diastolic flow period, from mitral valve opening to mitral valve closure. However, the diastolic murmur may be inaudible or absent when MS is very severe, due to the very slow flow across the mitral valve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1078.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>There are several maneuvers that have been used to evaluate heart sounds in MS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1080.html" rel="external">"Physiologic and pharmacologic maneuvers in the differential diagnosis of heart murmurs and sounds"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The diastolic murmur and OS are diminished with inspiration, but augmented with expiration (in contrast to tricuspid stenosis). With inspiration, the A2-OS interval widens and a distinct P2 may be heard.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing venous return (eg, by lying the patient down and lifting the legs) augments the gradient; as a result, the diastolic murmur lengthens while the A2-OS intervals shorten. Similar changes are seen in response to exercise. In contrast, reducing venous return with amyl nitrate, the Valsalva maneuver, or standing after squatting shortens the murmur and lengthens the A2-OS interval.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4131728058"><span class="h5">Other sounds</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are other murmurs or sounds that may be heard in patients with MS, particularly when PH is present.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A pulmonary ejection sound is heard in early systole; the sound diminishes with inspiration when the pulmonary arteries dilate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>With the development of tricuspid regurgitation, there is a holosystolic murmur best heard along the right sternal border that increases with inspiration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8119.html" rel="external">"Etiology, clinical features, and evaluation of tricuspid regurgitation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A faint and brief early diastolic murmur of pulmonic regurgitation (Graham Steell murmur) may be heard at the base.

The prevalence of AF is higher with more severe disease, increasing age, and the presence of other valvular abnormalities. In a report that included 854 patients with MS, AF was present in 47 percent overall; the rate was higher in those with other valvular abnormalities (such as mitral or tricuspid regurgitation) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The two independent risk factors for AF were left atrial diameter and increasing age. In other studies, the rate of AF among patients with severe MS ranged from 4 to 7 percent with mean patient age under 30 years to as high as 50 to 60 percent when the mean age was 50 to 60 years [<a href="#rid7">7-11</a>].</p><p>As discussed below, AF is one of the conditions that can precipitate or exacerbate symptoms such as dyspnea or hemoptysis.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topic (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/85373.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Mitral stenosis in adults (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24817810"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong> – The duration of the asymptomatic phase of rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) varies widely, with generally more rapid progression to symptoms developing in children and young adults in resource-limited countries and slower progression to symptoms developing in older adults in resource-abundant countries. Rheumatic MS most commonly presents with exertional dyspnea and/or decreased exercise tolerance. Less common clinical presentations include hemoptysis, chest pain, fatigue, ascites and lower extremity edema, and stroke or other thromboembolic event. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8137.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and natural history of mitral stenosis", section on 'Natural history'</a> and <a class="local">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Precipitants of symptoms</strong> – In patients with MS, any situation that increases the cardiac output or causes tachycardia can markedly increase the transmitral pressure gradient and precipitate symptoms such as dyspnea or hemoptysis. Activities or conditions that can provoke symptoms include exertion, emotional stress, fever, infection, atrial fibrillation (AF), and pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Precipitants of symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Auscultation</strong> – Identification of characteristic heart sounds, opening snap, and diastolic murmur may be diagnostic for MS with appropriate patient positioning in a quiet room  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55136 graphicRef66921" href="/d/graphic/55136.html" rel="external">movie 1A-B</a>). However, the opening snap and murmur may be difficult to appreciate, particularly with higher heart rates. (See <a class="local">'Cardiac examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – Complications of MS include AF, thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension (PH), right heart failure, infective endocarditis, and hoarseness. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis and evaluation</strong> – The diagnosis of rheumatic MS is suspected in a patient with demographics consistent with risk of rheumatic heart disease with symptoms and signs suggestive of MS. Transthoracic echocardiography is used to confirm the diagnosis and is integrated with symptoms to determine the stage of disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97546" href="/d/graphic/97546.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Role of additional testing</strong> – If there is a discrepancy between resting echocardiography and clinical symptoms or signs, hemodynamic exercise testing is suggested to evaluate changes in mean mitral gradient (generally by exercise stress echocardiograph) or pulmonary artery wedge pressure (by exercise testing during cardiac catheterization). Cardiac catheterization is rarely needed for diagnosis of MS and is most commonly performed as part a therapeutic interventional procedure. (See <a class="local">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis of rheumatic MS includes conditions that present with similar symptoms and signs, including obstructive cardiac lesions such as functional MS after transcatheter mitral valve repair, calcific MS, left atrial myxoma, and cor triatriatum. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Chandrashekhar Y, Westaby S, Narula J.
