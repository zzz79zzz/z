         Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea is a serious sign in the setting of head trauma. If any ear discharge is noted after serious head trauma, particularly clear or bloody discharge, the patient should undergo evaluation for CSF otorrhea caused by a basilar temporal skull fracture. (See

         Hemorrhagic otorrhea may also arise from middle ear trauma caused by a direct blow to the ear, auditory barotrauma, or intrusion of a foreign body into the external ear canal  (

         Because the mastoid air cells are connected to the distal end of the middle ear through a small canal or antrum, most episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) are associated with some inflammation of the mastoid. In rare cases, resolution of the mastoid infection does not occur, and acute mastoiditis develops with pus filling the air cells. The child with mastoiditis will have painful swelling behind the ear that typically pushes the pinna forward. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6062.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Other intratemporal complications that occur by contiguous spread of infection include petrositis (Gradenigo syndrome with sixth nerve palsy) and labyrinthitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intracranial complications of AOM are particularly a concern in children who appear ill. These complications include meningitis, epidural abscess, brain abscess, lateral sinus thrombosis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, subdural empyema, and carotid artery thrombosis. Patients with these illnesses usually develop fever and, over time, a toxic appearance; a few may manifest cranial nerve deficits, especially cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) and less commonly, cranial nerve VI.

         Also called malignant external otitis, this is a complication of bacterial otitis externa. Infection of the skin gives way to deeper seeding of cartilage, tissue, and bone. As the infection advances, osteomyelitis of the base of the skull, temporomandibular joint osteomyelitis, brain abscess, and generalized bacterial sepsis can develop. Although most commonly seen in older adults and adults with diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised children (eg, cancer patients on chemotherapy or HIV-infected patients) are at risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with malignant external otitis classically present with otorrhea and exquisite otalgia, which are not responsive to topical measures used to treat simple external otitis. The pain is generally more severe than that found in simple external otitis, although the two may be difficult to distinguish in their early stages. The pain in malignant external otitis tends to extend into the temporomandibular joint, resulting in pain with chewing.
        </p>
        <p>
         On physical examination, purulent otorrhea is seen in more than half of cases, and ipsilateral lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy can be present as well. Granulation tissue may be visible in the inferior portion of the external auditory canal at the bone-cartilage junction (at the site of Santorini fissures). This finding may be absent in atypical patients (eg, HIV-infected patients and children). Early empiric antibiotic therapy and otolaryngology consultation are essential to good outcomes. (See

         Cancer is a rare cause of otorrhea but should be considered in patients with abnormal tissue growth in the ear canal or a lack of response to prolonged external otitis treatment. These patients warrant prompt referral to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist with pediatric expertise.

         Ear canal cancer occurs far less frequently than auricular cancer, although the presentation and behavior are more sinister. In the early stages it is often indistinguishable from external otitis. In addition, rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma may manifest as auditory canal tumors in children. (See

         Otorrhea in children is often caused by one of several more benign diseases. Clinical findings after careful cleansing of debris will differentiate among most of these etiologies. (See

         Acute bacterial external otitis, often called "swimmer's ear," is an infectious inflammation of the external auditory canal. History often includes either water exposure or instrumentation with damage to the outer ear canal (such as cleaning with cotton swabs or finger scratching). Common symptoms include pain, pruritus, and hearing loss. Minor trauma to the canal's protective skin barrier and protective cerumen layer allows for bacterial overgrowth. Otitis externa is most commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, polymicrobial and anaerobic infections can occur. (See
         <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/z/d/html/3998.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         On physical examination, moderate to severe pain with minor tragus manipulation or pulling on the auricle is classic. An erythematous, edematous ear canal with cellular debris is seen. Since the middle ear is not necessarily involved in external otitis, there may not be any middle ear effusion or purulent otitis media. When visible, the tympanic membrane (TM) itself is typically erythematous or covered with debris. Often the membrane is difficult to see due to edematous narrowing of the canal. Otorrhea is purulent, white to yellow, and may dry to a crust.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with severe forms of otitis externa may also have fever, regional lymphadenopathy, or erythema of the pinna. If the pinna is infected, very aggressive treatment may be necessary such as admission for intravenous antibiotics, topical soaks, and surgical debridement. It is important to make the distinction between a generalized cellulitis of the skin of the pinna and a more serious cartilage infection such as perichondritis or chondritis. This distinction may be made by inspecting the lobule, which has no cartilage. If the lobule is spared, but the rest of the pinna is erythematous, this suggests involvement of the pinna cartilage.

         Ear foreign bodies (FBs) may cause otorrhea if they are long standing or consist of highly irritating substances. The history may or may not indicate their presence.

        <p>

         Button batteries require emergent removal because pressure necrosis and/or severe burns from residual electric current or leakage of caustic contents may rapidly lead to extensive damage to adjacent structures.
        </p>
        <p>
         Otoscopy is diagnostic. However, cerumen buildup or otorrhea may obscure the object, and cleaning may be necessary before the FB can be seen. Most ear FBs that do not cause otorrhea can be removed using simple techniques in the outpatient setting without referral to an ENT specialist. However, complications do result from multiple manipulations, and an ENT consult should be called when in doubt or when necessary visualization and removal equipment are not available.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with FBs that cause otorrhea, visualization and removal can be extremely difficult and must be done with care. Unless the clinician ensures visualization of the object and has the proper tools and setting (including the ability to restrain and possibly sedate the child), referral to an ENT specialist with audiometry is warranted.

         Occasionally, the tympanic membrane will rupture in the course of AOM. This is usually associated with ear pain and fever of relatively short duration, followed by pain relief associated with the onset of otorrhea. The drainage often has a clear or white appearance  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97987" href="/z/d/graphic/97987.html" rel="external">
          picture 2

          picture 3

         ). By the time the patient is seen, the perforation may have healed, but the drainage may continue for some time, especially if otitis externa has developed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Bacterial otitis externa'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Often the perforation itself may not be visible on otoscopy because the otorrhea obscures visualization of the tympanic membrane (TM) or the perforation has rapidly resealed. When seen, the TM typically has abnormal appearance and lack of mobility on pneumatic otoscopy. If the perforation is of recent origin, it generally heals spontaneously once the infection resolves.

         Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), or chronic otomastoiditis, is a perforation of the eardrum with chronic drainage from the middle ear cleft. This condition is more frequently seen in children who lack access to health care and, thus, do not have timely diagnosis and treatment of AOM. It should not be confused with longstanding otitis media with effusion (OME, or "serous" otitis media), or persistent AOM, both of which involve an intact tympanic membrane and no drainage. (See

         CSOM is often painless. On examination, a debris-filled canal is noted. The discharge is often white to yellow and mixed with soft cerumen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are common pathogens. Treatment typically consists of topical antibiotic ear drops, with topical quinolones being the best studied treatment choice. Parenteral antibiotic administration guided by culture of the ear discharge and/or tympanomastoidectomy may be necessary in refractory cases, though the evidence for superiority of systemic antibiotics over topical quinolone antibiotics is mixed and not convincing [

         Annoying to many parents/primary caregivers, but generally harmless, some children have thin cerumen that can present as ear drainage. In general, cerumen is only a problem if it is impacted or if it precludes examination of the eardrum. In such cases, removal may be necessary, but precautions should be taken when instrumenting the ear canal. (See

         10 to 30 percent of children with tympanostomy tubes will have at least one episode of acute otorrhea while their tympanostomy tubes are in place, either immediately postoperatively or during an episode of AOM. The drainage is usually foul smelling, mucoid, and may be mixed with blood  (

         Otomycosis is a fungal infection of the external auditory canal and a common reason for external otitis treatment failure. Patients with fungal external otitis most commonly report itching, a feeling that something is in the ear canal, discomfort, and discharge. Otorrhea is generally thick and purulent. Deep seated itching is the most troublesome symptom; pain is less intense than with bacterial otitis externa. Fungal organisms have a very characteristic appearance in the ear canal, especially under magnified vision  (

Hearing loss also may occur if the cholesteatoma obstructs the eustachian tube orifice, leading to middle ear effusion. Surgical therapy is required for most cholesteatomas. (See

          6,7
         </a>
         ]. Unlike cholesteatoma, keratosis obturans is associated with an expanded ear canal as keratin is shed from the complete circumference of the canal and does not cause osteonecrosis. When compared with cholesteatoma, keratosis obturans is generally more acute and painful, produces less otorrhea, and generally occurs in younger patients. It can often be managed with removal of the keratin plug, antibiotic ear drops, and periodic follow-up to remove any reaccumulated debris. Operative care is typically not needed.

         In most cases, no cleaning is necessary to make a diagnosis of otitis externa or otitis media with perforation. Not infrequently, however, careful removal of a small amount of debris enhances the view of the examiner, and this can be achieved using a cotton pledget wrapped tightly around a curette or a wick to soak up excess fluid.

        <p>
         Less commonly, careful cleaning through a standard otoscope head using a suction catheter or ear curette may be necessary to remove profuse, thick exudate that totally obscures the view of ear canal and tympanic membrane. Thorough cleaning is best done under direct visualization with use of either an otoscope with an operating head or an otologic microscope.

         Some practitioners will use irrigation to remove cerumen, but this should only be done if a patient is known to have an intact tympanic membrane. Otherwise, irrigation of a draining ear is potentially dangerous and should not be performed.

         Foreign body – A foreign body (FB) found in the canal may be the source of a child's otorrhea and requires time to cause drainage. A child rarely may place something in the ear in an attempt to relieve symptoms from a pre-existing ear condition. Thus, after removal of the foreign body, careful otoscopic evaluation is important to exclude other coincidental disease or complications, such as tympanic membrane perforation. Care must be taken not to cause further injury during FB removal; any FB that is difficult to remove should be referred to an ENT specialist. (See

         Organic mass or polyp – Polypoid masses or granulomas most often arise in response to chronic otitis media, foreign bodies in the external ear canal, or cholesteatoma. Rarely, they may arise from a neoplastic process. (See

         Quality of discharge – Thin white debris-filled discharge is typical of bacterial otitis externa. Tympanic perforation generally leads to a mucous discharge as does contact dermatitis. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea is a clear or thin bloody discharge that may be mistaken for more benign serous fluid. Purulent discharge can be from severe irritation, foreign body, middle ear infection, or severe external canal infections. Blood-tinged discharge is more likely caused by trauma, foreign body, granuloma, or carcinoma.

         Inflammation – Inflammation of the tympanic membrane is indicative of middle ear pathology. Inflammation of the external canal can occur with many conditions, but it is less likely with isolated middle ear infections with or without TM perforations. An edematous, erythematous external canal with debris and a generally clear tympanic membrane is typical of bacterial otitis externa.

         Culture of the external ear canal in otorrhea is rarely helpful, as Pseudomonas species are commonly identified with or without local infection. It is also quite difficult to obtain samples from the middle ear that are not contaminated by external canal flora. In addition, culture rarely changes management decisions in children with otorrhea.

         An external canal that appears pink, nonedematous, and noninflamed indicates likely tympanic membrane or middle ear pathology  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59068" href="/z/d/graphic/59068.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 3

         ). On examination of the tympanic membrane, bullous myringitis appears as multiple intact or ruptured blisters on the membrane itself, with possible middle ear inflammation behind. Granular myringitis can also be diagnosed on examination with visualization of the typical vascular, friable mass. A perforated tympanic membrane makes middle ear pathology the most likely source of the otorrhea.
        </p>
        <p>
         Debris in AOM with perforation may make visualization of the tympanic membrane difficult, so other signs of otitis media such as fever and pain preceding the drainage may lead to the diagnosis of AOM with perforation. A noninflamed tympanic membrane with serous drainage through a perforation is likely chronic serous otitis media (CSOM), especially in an otherwise asymptomatic child. Although extremely rare, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea has been described and should be considered when other more common causes of otorrhea have been excluded.

         An inflamed, edematous canal is typically associated with diseases external to the tympanic membrane  (

         ). After carefully clearing debris as needed, the examiner should check for a foreign body. A nonorganic foreign body can cause otorrhea when associated with concurrent irritation and inflammation. An organic appearing foreign body or growth in the ear suggests an inflammatory granuloma, polyp, otomycosis, carcinoma, or cholesteatoma. These masses each have their own characteristic appearance as described above.
        </p>
        <p>
         An inflamed, edematous, debris-filled canal with no foreign body is typical of contact dermatitis and otitis externa. History of moisture exposure or minor trauma differentiates infectious otitis externa from contact dermatitis, which is associated with exposure of the ear to some topical medications, cosmetics, or plants. Otitis externa also tends to be more painful with outer ear manipulation, though contact dermatitis can become painful when severe as well. Pruritus is typical with both diagnoses. The clinician should carefully check for pinna and cartilaginous involvement of severe otitis externa.

          Life-threatening conditions
         </strong>
         – Patients who are ill appearing or have otorrhea after head trauma require aggressive efforts to diagnose and treat potential life-threatening causes of otorrhea (basilar skull fracture, necrotizing otitis externa, infectious complications of AOM). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Life-threatening conditions'
         </a>

          Diagnostic approach
         </strong>
         – The diagnostic approach to the evaluation of otorrhea in children is summarized in the algorithms  (

         <strong>
          Specialist referral or consultation
         </strong>
         – Once a working diagnosis is established, prompt consultation with a pediatric ear, nose, and throat specialist is warranted for life-threatening conditions (eg, cerebral spinal fluid [CSF] otorrhea, mastoiditis or other infectious complications of AOM, necrotizing otitis externa, or neoplasm) and those that require biopsy for definitive diagnosis.
