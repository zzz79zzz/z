Recognition of physical child abuse, the orthopedic aspects of child abuse, and the evaluation of abusive head trauma are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6613.html" rel="external">"Orthopedic aspects of child abuse"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2461156"><span class="h1">RATIONALE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The identification of suspected abuse at the initial evaluation is critical to treat the injuries and to protect the child from a subsequent, perhaps more serious injury [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Children returned to their families/primary caregivers without intervention after an event of maltreatment have an 11 to nearly 50 percent chance of a second event [<a href="#rid4">4-9</a>]. The majority of both initial and recurrent events are neglect. In a study of children seen in an emergency department for accidents that were retrospectively determined to be physical abuse, 13 percent of patients suffered another physical abuse event in the subsequent five years [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p>Despite the urgency of identifying suspected child abuse and the existence of mandatory reporting laws throughout the United States and in many countries around the world, child maltreatment remains consistently under-identified and underreported [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. Multiple factors contribute to this problem, including the knowledge and expertise of health care practitioners as well as variation in interpretation of what constitutes a reasonable suspicion for reporting [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3880338855"><span class="h1">INITIAL STABILIZATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Traumatic injuries warrant assessment and management based upon the patient's level of stability and according to the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child", section on 'Initial approach'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6572.html" rel="external">"Approach to the initially stable child with blunt or penetrating injury"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2461149"><span class="h1">APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is rarely possible (and almost never necessary) to definitively conclude that physical abuse has occurred in the first few hours of an evaluation. When physical child abuse is suspected, clinicians should emphasize the need for further evaluation and avoid making accusations. Examples include: "Sometimes, when we see injuries like this, there are other injuries that can put a child at risk, and we need to test for them," or "This is more injury than we would normally expect from the event you are describing. We should be careful to determine whether there is something else medical going on, and to make sure that no one is hurting the child."</p><p>When questions of abuse arise, a thorough evaluation must assess the plausibility of the given history  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109401" href="/z/d/graphic/109401.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), findings on physical examination  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119441" href="/z/d/graphic/119441.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), the possibility of undiagnosed explanatory medical conditions, and the presence of additional occult injuries that further contribute to the diagnosis of abuse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition"</a>.)</p><p>Red flag injuries that raise suspicion for physical child abuse and warrant additional radiologic and laboratory evaluation vary according to the age of the child and the specific injury, as shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119441" href="/z/d/graphic/119441.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>When evaluating the child who is suspected of being physically abused, it is also important to remember that findings that appear to indicate abuse may result from other causes. Familiarity with the medical conditions and cultural practices that mimic child abuse and careful medical, laboratory, and radiologic evaluation can facilitate arrival at the correct diagnosis, initiation of appropriate therapy, and avoidance of the consequences of an unfounded report of suspected child abuse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6601.html" rel="external">"Differential diagnosis of suspected child physical abuse", section on 'Cultural practices'</a>.)</p><p>Ancillary studies recommended for the evaluation of physical child abuse, as elaborated below and in American Academy of Pediatrics policy statements [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], are complex with multiple contingencies, primarily the child's age and type of injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119442" href="/z/d/graphic/119442.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). As a result, compliance with best practices is inconsistent [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>]. </p><p>Use of a paper or electronic checklist has resulted in improved screening and increased reporting of suspected child abuse [<a href="#rid17">17,20-23</a>]. These interventions have directed actions from full examination and involvement of social services to complete order sets of occult injury and medical condition screening. For example, a standardized electronic order set for nonaccidental trauma based upon a best practice institutional guideline increased adherence to recommended testing from 47 to 69 percent [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In one trial, use of a physical abuse order set was associated with full compliance with institutional clinical guidelines for testing, although the automated alert system for activation of the order set did not increase overall compliance with recommended testing [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, compliance was 84 percent at baseline [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. As a result, while acceptance and use of the checklist was high in this study, it was not possible to document increased compliance with recommendations. Additional measures, such as a periodic multidisciplinary conference to assure understanding of and encourage compliance with standardized practices may yield additional benefits [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of suspected child abuse begins with obtaining a complete history, performing a physical examination, and observing the interactions between the parents/caregivers and the child.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once an injury is identified, the history should identify an explanatory trauma or an explicit denial of trauma. A detailed history of trauma events should include preceding activity elevation and motion, events leading to the trauma event, mechanics of the injurious circumstances, and subsequent actions and symptoms of the patient. This sort of detail is necessary for evaluating the plausibility of the reported history [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. While an accurate summary or paraphrasing of given answers may be adequate, when particularly important statements are made, quoting the exact words of the reporter will avoid concerns of inaccurate interpretation by the clinician and serve any subsequent legal proceeding better.</p><p>An acute injury presents the ideal reason for asking a child with adequate language skills to explain "what happened to you." Ideally, this would be done away from adults whose presence might influence the child. In the setting of acute trauma, separating the child might not be practical for a multitude of reasons. The choice of deferring child questioning or asking in the presence of others must be individualized as is further discussed below. Spontaneous comments by the child must, however, be accurately recorded along with the situation and statements that provoked them.</p><p>The desire to interview a child directly is often weighed against the risk that age-inappropriate questioning can yield misleading information. Children will attempt to answer questions they do not understand, and repeated questioning can be perceived to imply that the first answer was not correct. Coordination between medical providers to avoid repeated questioning and accurate "sign out" of earlier child statements may decrease repeated history-taking.</p><p>A well-prepared physician taking a medically oriented history is likely to obtain information not obtained in forensically oriented interviews, particularly in older children. Awareness of forensic interviewing principles and techniques is important preparation before clinicians embark on this task. Because a child's initial statements have critical importance to the medical evaluation, and because some children are never questioned by any investigator, clinicians should consider talking to children with well-developed linguistic capacity [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Because obtaining a clinical history from a child may create inconsistencies with forensic interviews, particularly in younger children, coordination between medical care systems, children's protective services, and local law enforcement, as exemplified by the Child Advocacy Center model, should be planned. When a child's history is taken, to the degree possible, it is best to report both the questions asked and the answers provided by the child as literally as possible and, ideally, in exact quotes.</p><p>Regardless of who obtains the history, the process should begin with open-ended questions about how the injuries were sustained and then proceed to more specific questions [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. The questions should be directed first to the child if they can speak. The author usually interviews the parents/caregivers and child together initially; if a significant suspicion of abuse is raised, permission is sought from the parents/caregivers to interview the child alone. Most parents/caregivers agree to this; whether or not it is permitted is documented in the medical record. Refusal to permit the child to be interviewed alone is considered a "red flag" for abuse. Social services personnel are helpful in this situation, both in assessing family dynamics and in facilitating the removal of the parents/caregivers from the examination room (to interview them separately).</p><p>Extensive research on interviewing children stresses the importance of using open-ended questions that do not introduce concepts of abusive acts or an abuser [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Requests for unstructured narrative are best (eg, "Tell me about your boo-boo") followed by "WH" questions. For example, following a child's statement that "they hurt me":</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"You said 'they' hurt you, <strong>who</strong> is 'they'?"</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"<strong>What</strong> did they do?"</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"<strong>Where</strong> did they do it?"</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"<strong>When</strong> did this happen?"</p><p></p><p>Interviews should consider a child's age and developmental ability. While children as young as three years old can often supply answers to "who" and "what" questions, "where" and especially "when" comprehension comes later. If a young child has difficulty answering "when" questions, other details can suggest timing. For example, a child who cannot tell you that the abuse occurred two weeks ago may be able to report that the abuse occurred when they visited a neighbor's house, or when Christmas decorations were still up, or when a particular show was on television.</p><p>Clinicians should <strong>avoid</strong> asking the child to select from lists or answer yes/no questions because these approaches are inaccurate [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>Historical factors that raise the suspicion of abuse include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109401" href="/z/d/graphic/109401.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition", section on 'Red flag history'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The history provided by the parent or caretaker is inconsistent with the injuries of the child (eg, a child with a history of falling from a sofa onto a carpeted floor who presents with multiple fractures, liver laceration, or traumatic brain injury).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The history is vague or lacking in detail.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The history changes in repeated versions given by the same caretaker to different health care workers, or conflicting histories are given by different household members (eg, infant was burned while bathing in the sink/infant was burned while bathing in the bathtub; mother was bathing infant/sister was bathing infant).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The injury is attributed to actions of young siblings; this account may be a cover story or may be true and related to sibling rivalry, inadequate supervision, or violence in the home. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6603.html" rel="external">"Child neglect: Evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/591.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Childhood exposure"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No history is offered (eg, "I don't know what happened; their leg was just suddenly broken").</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The history is inconsistent with the developmental stage of the child (eg, a four-month-old infant who turns on the hot water in the bathtub and is burned).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The history is implausible (eg, a child presents with swelling of the thigh, with a history given by the parents/caregivers that "a roach bit them"; radiographs reveal a spiral fracture of the femur).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is a history of prior bruising or orofacial injury in an infant who is not cruising.</p><p></p><p>If the patient is <strong>not</strong> known to the examining clinician, information about past injuries, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits should be obtained, as well as information regarding the child's regular source of primary care and past medical history, including illnesses or conditions that mimic child abuse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6601.html" rel="external">"Differential diagnosis of suspected child physical abuse"</a>.)</p><p>It is often helpful to contact the child's primary care provider to ascertain whether or not the child has received routine health care and immunizations as scheduled and whether there have been prior concerns of child abuse.</p><p>Some authors have stressed the importance of the social history and child indicators of past distress to increase sensitivity to child abuse [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. Such an approach must be tempered against the possibility of increasing social biases. In a study of consensus on best practices, child abuse pediatricians considered a history of child care settings to be a required element, and past history of abuse to the index child, intimate partner violence, past social services involvement, and abuse experience of the caregiver during childhood as "highly recommended" [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation of the general appearance of the child should include assessment of their clothing (eg, is it appropriate for the season? is it clean and in good repair?).

While this will differ based on equipment and technique, an estimate of 0.2 mSv for a high-quality survey has been published [<a href="#rid87">87,88</a>]. The risk from this degree of radiation exposure seems significantly lower than the risk of missing evidence of child abuse.

Subsequent evaluation should be directed toward a complete characterization of the extent and age of the injuries. Neuroimaging (CT or MRI) can be used to detect these injuries, to follow their evolution, and to evaluate the development of secondary complications. CT has the advantage of ready availability, speed, and cost, but delivers ionizing radiation to the brain. MRI obviates the radiation risk, but the risk of sedation to the developing brain is being increasingly appreciated. Rapid MRI sequences that may be obtained with neither radiation nor sedation are suggested for hemodynamically and neurologically stable children undergoing evaluation for child abuse as long as they can be performed in a timely manner and promptly interpreted by a pediatric neuroradiologist. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children", section on 'Neuroimaging'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Neuroimaging should be performed in all infants in whom nonaccidental head injury is suspected. We also suggest neuroimaging in children younger than twelve months of age in whom any type of physical abuse is suspected  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119442" href="/z/d/graphic/119442.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16,39,80,90,91</a>]. Evidence indicates that if neuroimaging is omitted, then skeletal survey and ophthalmologic evaluation alone are insufficient for discovering occult neurologic injury. For example, in one study, 51 children younger than two years who were admitted to an urban children's hospital with injuries suspicious for child abuse and a normal neurologic examination underwent neuroimaging if they met any of the following "high risk" criteria: rib fractures, multiple fractures, facial injury, or age less than six months [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Occult neurologic injury was detected in 19 patients (37 percent, 95% CI 24-50 percent) and would have been missed by skeletal survey alone in five children, all of whom were less than six months of age. Ophthalmologic examination was performed in 14 of the 19 children, but no retinal hemorrhages were detected. In a second study, 29 percent of neurologically normal children under one year old had positive screening neuroimaging. Only one (3 percent) had a positive ophthalmological exam [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Among infants less than six months old seen at one children's hospital with externally evident injury, only 52 percent had intracranial imaging, but 38 percent of imaged children had an intracranial hemorrhage identified. Again, the authors could not determine that the external injury was the presenting complaint [<a href="#rid86">86</a>]. </p><p>Other studies of occult intracranial injury prevalence have had variable results, with imaging yields ranging from a low of 4 to 5 percent to a high of 20 to 29 percent [<a href="#rid92">92-97</a>]. For example, in one study, 10 percent of 363 head CT scans had intracranial injury, but 97 percent of positives were accompanied by clinical indications of head trauma [<a href="#rid98">98</a>]. Even that one child with "occult" head injury had a history of head impact, a scalp injury, and a nonspecific intracranial finding for abuse. The wide variation in results is not easily explained by the studies' inclusion criteria and may be the result of regional variations in abuse prevalence or consultation practices. While some studies found a drop-off in positive return above age six months, others have found persistence of high return, though older children were imaged less often and may thus reflect a selection bias.</p><p>Unenhanced CT of the head (with brain and bone windows) is the preferred imaging study for initial evaluation in symptomatic patients with suspected inflicted head trauma. MRI is preferred to head CT in asymptomatic children if there is timely availability of the study and interpretation by a pediatric neuroradiologist. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children", section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Findings of abuse on neuroimaging include evidence of rotational acceleration/deceleration injury, diffuse subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, focal cortical contusions, and/or brain swelling. If the child has suffered impact to the head, contact injuries including skull fractures, scalp hematomas, and cerebral contusions may also be identified. Although head CT has the highest sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing acute hemorrhage, some studies have demonstrated that the initial head CTs of abused infants may appear normal with abnormalities appearing on follow-up scans. Nonetheless, emergency head CTs permit identification of any injury requiring rapid surgical intervention. In addition, certain findings are more consistent with intentional head trauma. Review by an experienced pediatric neuroradiologist is often helpful to diagnose abusive head trauma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children", section on 'Unstable patients'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6520.html" rel="external">"Intracranial subdural hematoma in children: Epidemiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology"</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, noncontrast brain MRI is superior in documenting the full extent of intracranial injuries and may demonstrate small extraaxial hemorrhages, parenchymal contusions, evidence of shearing injury, and posterior fossa abnormalities missed by CT. Diffusion-weighted imaging may detect cerebral ischemia not readily perceived on conventional CT and MRI. Even when injuries are identified with both CT and MRI, the enhanced visual clarity of the latter often makes for a better study. Furthermore, MRI is the preferred modality for identifying subacute and chronic injury because it has the highest sensitivity and specificity. However, many critically ill infants may not be able to undergo MRI. In addition, because MRI sometimes fails to identify acute subarachnoid or subdural hemorrhage, it is often obtained three to seven days after injury, rather than at the time of admission.

A four-view chest radiograph that includes oblique views increases the number of rib fractures detected in possible child abuse victims. However, in some cases, they may become evident only after callus formation develops 10 to 14 days into the healing process.

(See <a class="local">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Red flag history</strong> – Historical factors that raise the suspicion of abuse include (see <a class="local">'History'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The history provided by the parent or caretaker is inconsistent with the injuries of the child (eg, a child with a history of falling from a sofa onto a carpeted floor who presents with multiple fractures, serious intraabdominal injury, or severe head trauma).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The history is vague or lacking in detail.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The history changes in repeated versions given by the same caretaker to different health care workers, or conflicting histories are given by different family members/witnesses (eg, infant was burned while bathing in the sink/infant was burned while bathing in the bathtub; mother was bathing infant/sister was bathing infant).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The injury is attributed to actions of siblings; this account may be a cover story or may be true and related to sibling rivalry, inadequate supervision, or violence in the home. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6603.html" rel="external">"Child neglect: Evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/591.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Childhood exposure"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No history is offered (eg, "I don't know what happened; their leg was just suddenly broken").</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The history is inconsistent with the developmental stage of the child (eg, a four-month-old infant who turns on the hot water in the bathtub and is burned).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The history is implausible (eg, a child presents with swelling of the thigh, with a history given by the parents/caregivers that "a roach bit them"; radiographs reveal a spiral fracture of the femur).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There is a history of prior bruising or orofacial injury in an infant who is not cruising.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Red flag physical findings</strong> – Physical findings that raise the suspicion of child abuse include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119441" href="/z/d/graphic/119441.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) (see <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Injuries that are <strong>not</strong> consistent with the history, especially those with patterns that indicate a method of infliction</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Injuries commonly associated with abuse</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Multiple fractures in various stages of healing or different types of injuries coexisting (eg, bruises, burns, and/or fractures)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory studies and imaging</strong> – The laboratory and radiologic evaluation should be tailored to patient age and the clinical findings  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119442" href="/z/d/graphic/119442.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Initial physical abuse evaluation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management and reporting</strong> – After complete evaluation and treatment of the child's urgent medical needs, the evaluating clinician should determine the level of suspicion for child abuse (ie, whether the injuries appear to have been inflicted or unintentionally acquired). Whenever possible, this determination should be made in consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team (eg, social worker, nurse, and child abuse specialist). (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In many parts of the world, a report to appropriate governmental authorities is also required for cases of suspected abuse. Reporting of child abuse and neglect is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6604.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Social and medicolegal issues"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hospitalization may also be warranted for the treatment of certain conditions (eg, burns, ingestion, or intracerebral injury) and may also be indicated for the safety of the child. In addition, children currently sharing a household with an abused child require prompt evaluation for possible abuse. (See <a class="local">'Disposition'</a> above and <a class="local">'Identifying injuries in other children at risk'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Household contacts</strong> — Identifying and ensuring evaluation of all other children currently sharing a household with an abused child is an essential component of case management because of their significant risk of abuse. (See <a class="local">'Identifying injuries in other children at risk'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1616408292"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Erin Endom, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Saade DN, Simon HK, Greenwald M.
