The general approach to providing online medical direction and pediatric prehospital care considerations, including management, field triage, and transport decisions, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13870.html" rel="external">"Pediatric considerations in prehospital care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1232190942"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The concept of EMS encompasses many areas of emergency care, including the triage, evaluation, management, and transport of patients from the scene of an injury or illness to their arrival at an emergency care facility (the out-of-hospital or prehospital care), as well as the management within the emergency department. New areas of EMS have expanded the roles of prehospital providers to include community paramedicine (nonemergency care) and tactical EMS (emergency care in coordination with law enforcement in unsafe environments).</p><p>EMS systems date back to the 18<sup>th</sup> century when Napoleon's Surgeon-in-Chief, Barron Larrey, decreased mortality by transporting wounded soldiers rapidly to field hospitals [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In the United States, the EMS system formally began in 1966 with passage of the National Highway Traffic Safety Act that focused on the emergency care of trauma victims from motor vehicle crashes and tied federal funding for highway construction to development of state EMS systems.</p><p>Recognizing that children have unique anatomic, physiologic, developmental, and medical needs, the federal government passed legislation in 1984 that allocated funds for the purpose of improving the system for providing EMS for children, creating the Emergency Medical Services for Children program (EMSC; <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Femscimprovement.center%2F&amp;token=0YqtR9aDKTO7nCIdojnDTbdQ7sh4z2lPcIXM4oixJI78MC08tkuabZ3fr0qlwPGY&amp;TOPIC_ID=5796" target="_blank">website</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. EMSC is a collaborative program between the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and provides funding to all 50 states as well as United States territories [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>In the United States, all states have EMS legislation, providing the basis for statewide systems. However, state agencies and local jurisdictions (eg, municipalities or counties) have established local regulations regarding the extent of services that can be provided by prehospital personnel and the procedures that they may perform on children [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The epidemiology of United States pediatric EMS use has been described in a nationally representative sample taken from the National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) database of over 34 million EMS activations in 2019 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Children under the age of 19 account for approximately 30 million United States emergency department visits annually, with 5 to 10 percent arriving by ambulance. Children represent approximately 6 percent of all EMS activations [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. While a small percentage of children treated in emergency departments arrive by ambulance, they are more likely than those who arrive by other means (eg, private vehicle) to require immediate care, treatment for trauma or poisoning, and admission to the hospital ward or intensive care unit [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Race, urban environment, and lack of insurance are associated with EMS transport in the United States [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Compared with children arriving to the emergency department by other means, those arriving by EMS are predominantly infants or adolescents [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Infants require transport most often for acute illness, ingestions, and seizures, whereas adolescents are most often transported in association with trauma (including motor vehicle crashes, suicide attempts, and assault) or alcohol and drug intoxication [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p>Prehospital pediatric resuscitation is rare and most often occurs in children younger than four years of age. Thus, it is important that EMS systems provide appropriately sized equipment and personnel properly trained in management of pediatric emergencies [<a href="#rid4">4,10</a>]. However, the infrequency of prehospital pediatric resuscitation makes maintenance of skills challenging. As an example, of 1377 pediatric EMS transports in a Canadian system, only 2.4 percent involved life-threatening problems, and very few transports involved bag-mask ventilation (0.3 percent), endotracheal intubation (0.1 percent), or administration of intravenous medications (1.4 percent) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">ROLE OF THE LAYPERSON</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prehospital care of an injured or ill child is initiated by those who are present at the time of injury or acute illness, the "bystanders." They are the ones who access the EMS system and begin life-saving interventions, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until EMS arrival.</p><p>With involvement of the layperson, the crucial time between a life-threatening illness or injury and institution of emergency medical management can be reduced. Specific examples of the important role of bystanders include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a systematic review of four studies performed during the 2019 update of the American Heart Association pediatric basic life support guidelines [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) was associated with a significant improvement in the rates of bystander CPR and one-month post-cardiopulmonary arrest survival with DA-CPR [<a href="#rid13">13-16</a>]. The authors of the update recommended that emergency medical dispatch centers offer DA-CPR for presumed pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest, especially when no bystander CPR is in progress [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of bystander involvement in witnessed cardiac arrest [<a href="#rid17">17-22</a>]. With the introduction of automated external defibrillators, the role of the layperson has expanded beyond CPR into the management of ventricular fibrillation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bystander intervention has been effective for removing a foreign body from the airway. In a study that compared bystander intervention with EMS intervention for the management of 103 children (aged 0 to 15 years) with foreign bodies in the airway, the airways were cleared before EMS arrival in 85 percent of the children, either by a bystander (47 percent) or the child (38 percent) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. These findings support the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendation that new parents/primary caregivers and other laypersons who care for children (eg, teachers, day care providers) be trained in CPR [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">THE EMS SYSTEM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common method of requesting EMS transport in the United States and Canada is via the 911 system. As a general rule, access to 911 is provided to the consumer through the local telephone service and routed to public safety answering points (PSAPs). The city or local community contracts with an EMS service to provide medical response and transport to 911 callers. However, 911 is not a universal emergency telephone number in other countries. As an example, 112 is the common emergency medical call number for European Union countries, while 000 is used in Australia [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>].</p><p>Most emergency medical systems employ some version of enhanced 911, which provides the name, address, and phone number of the individual whose phone is used to place the emergency call. When cellular telephones are used to place 911 calls, the address and phone number of the cellular telephone company, rather than the caller, are provided to the public safety answering point and the dispatcher. This problem is addressed through the use of satellites that can pinpoint the exact location of the cellular telephone caller.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Types of EMS systems</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several types of EMS systems exist, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The three most common types are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>City or county</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Private</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Volunteer</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">City/county (regional)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This type of EMS system is operated by the city, county, or regional government and is usually, but not always, integrated within the fire department, wherein the fire chief often shares and, in some cases, controls the operations and budget for the EMS division. Municipal EMS systems that operate independent of the fire and police departments are referred to as "third service." Regional systems often are funded by the local municipality, providing at least a theoretical guarantee of service to the taxpayer. Higher than average salaries and benefits often result in the retention of experienced personnel. In addition, most police and fire departments are administrated through a municipal or county system, which allows for an integrated dispatch system that can be used by police, the fire department, and EMS. Such an integrated system can help coordinate the effort during an emergency. The disadvantages of the regional system include potential budgetary concerns and delays because of governmental bureaucracy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Private</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Private ambulance companies operate in urban, suburban, and rural communities. In some cities or counties, private companies provide 911 access, and in others, they have partnership agreements with the city or county EMS systems. As an example, the city may provide 911 service to the community, whereas the private ambulance company performs all inter-facility transports. A private company seldom operates 911 access if a city or county EMS system is already in existence. Cooperation among private companies is rare, and competition may be present. Salaries usually are based upon hourly wages, and job turnover is a frequent problem. Although emergency medical technicians (EMTs) may practice under the medical director's license, most patient care is predetermined by protocols rather than by direct contact with a physician. Although this is also true for some city/county EMS systems, it is more common among the privately run systems. Also, many of the EMTs are directly licensed to practice by their state or region. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Volunteer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In rural communities, 911 access is often contracted to volunteers. Because many volunteer prehospital providers have a personal interest in EMS, their level of training usually is equal to or greater than that of the EMTs in municipal and private systems. However, their experience and training may be limited unless they have opportunities to gain experience at second jobs or via larger EMS systems in neighboring communities. In volunteer systems, particularly in rural areas, the distance between hospitals may be great, transportation times prolonged, and scope of practice necessarily broad. Medical direction often is limited, and protocols commonly are employed to assist the EMT with patient care. Problems may arise as a result of budgetary constraints because funding typically is limited in rural communities.</p><p>The Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP), a division of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), provides a number of <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ruralhealthinfo.org%2Ftopics%2Femergency-medical-services%2Fresources&amp;token=xq%2BNxjqlWw55kQ%2Fj%2FqKfISyw7k6yl85mV7j0FTwBkNAKEAoJ%2FOxgdcwcpTQypd13rCdKeHJXQzAV2wmA%2BUoN460K7O9E79HiTCefmlYlius%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=5796" target="_blank">resources</a> for rural communities in recognition of their unique EMS needs and challenges [<a href="#rid27">27-29</a>].</p><p>Health care providers with pediatric expertise can play an important role in the development, implementation, and supervision of EMS for children in rural communities as follows [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Become an emergency department's or community's Pediatric Emergency Care Coordinator </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Help prehospital providers maintain their skills with pediatric emergencies by providing continuing medical education and pediatric office rotations</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Provide education about pediatric issues from prevention to rehabilitation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assist with protocol writing, hospital care, and pediatric data accumulation and interpretation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assure appropriate pediatric resuscitation equipment is available in physician offices, transport vehicles, and receiving facilities (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5797.html" rel="external">"Preparing an office practice for pediatric emergencies"</a>) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Performs pediatric care process improvement</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serve as advocates for community and state legislation to support the goals of Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10749933"><span class="h3">International EMS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The World Health Organization (WHO) regards EMS systems as an integral part of any functional health care system. However, less than half of the world's countries have a formal EMS system in place [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. If EMS exists in many poorer countries, these systems typically focus on trauma care. Implementation of an integrated trauma system has been shown to decrease mortality by 15 to 20 percent in high-income Western nations, and prehospital trauma life support programs in low- and middle-income countries improve survival rates by decreasing out-of-hospital mortality [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>In the developed world, despite national differences in organization and funding of comprehensive EMS systems, two main models for the delivery of prehospital care have emerged with distinct characteristics. The Anglo-American model (typified by the United States and British EMS systems but also used by South Africa, Canada, and some Asian countries) centers around the philosophy of rapid transport to definitive care ("load and go"). There is limited emphasis on prehospital interventions. Systems developed around the Anglo-American model are frequently associated with public safety (eg, fire departments), and care is provided by EMTs with medical oversight. In general, countries with this strategy have a well-developed specialty of emergency medicine, and patients are transported directly to emergency departments for further stabilization and definitive care [<a href="#rid34">34-38</a>].</p><p>By contrast, the Franco-German model of EMS (used by countries including France, Germany, Greece, Austria, the Nordic countries, Malta, some Asian countries, and some United Kingdom services) focuses on scene-based stabilization and treatment ("stay and treat"). Rather than the notion of bringing the patient to the hospital, this model essentially brings the hospital to the patient. In order to accomplish this, physicians are key members of the EMS team and have the authority to provide advanced care and determine disposition in the field. Some highly specialized teams provide advanced resuscitation in the field, including resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These systems are usually associated with the larger health system rather than public safety. After field treatment, patients may remain at home or, if further hospital care (inpatient) is needed, be transported directly to hospital wards rather than emergency departments [<a href="#rid34">34,38-40</a>].</p><p>Whether there is a benefit of one model of care over another is unclear. For example, A 2007 international comparison of trauma outcomes between five countries with technician-operated (advanced life support [ALS]-EMS staffed) and four countries with physician-operated (Doc-ALS staffed) systems using data from prospectively collected registries found that prehospital trauma systems that dispatch a physician to the scene had lower early trauma mortality rates, especially among patients with more severe injuries [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. More recently, in a meta-analysis of 22 retrospective and prospective observational studies (nearly 55,000 severely injured patients), adjusted analysis that accounted for helicopter versus ground transport found a nonsignificant trend towards lower mortality for individuals who received out-of-hospital management by EMS teams lead by physicians compared to EMS teams without physicians, which suggests that rapidity of transport to definitive care may be a more influential factor than EMS team composition [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p>An emerging model of EMS care being explored in the United Kingdom is that of the emergency care practitioner (ECP) [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. According to the National Health Service, an ECP is an allied health professional with special training who functions with significant autonomy and is capable of providing prehospital emergency care as well as community-based primary care. This model of EMS delivery is currently under consideration in other countries, including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H365214"><span class="h1">DISPATCH PERSONNEL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dispatch operations vary widely depending upon the EMS system and the city, county, or state in which it operates. For the purpose of this discussion, central dispatch, one of the most common methods of dispatch, will be used as the prototype.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the EMS system (eg, city/county, private, or volunteer) to assign personnel to central dispatch. As a general rule, all 911 calls go through central dispatch, where select personnel forward calls to the appropriate location based on the caller's request. As an example, when a 911 call is received, the individual who receives it determines if the call is for fire, police, or EMS. If the call is for EMS, it is forwarded to trained personnel who will gather the necessary information from the caller and dispatch personnel to the scene and/or offer advice to the caller.</p><p>Most dispatch systems use some form of computer-aided protocols, which are updated on a continuous basis. Each question on the protocol must be answered before the next question appears on the computer monitor. When a caller requests an ambulance, for example, they may be asked "Is the victim breathing?" The caller must respond before the dispatcher can move to the next step in the protocol. The protocol questions proceed through the airway, breathing, and circulation guidelines of basic life support (BLS). For children in cardiac arrest, dispatcher-assisted bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) can be performed and is associated with increased survival [<a href="#rid12">12-16</a>].</p><p>From the information that is obtained, the dispatcher determines the type of unit (advanced life support [ALS] or BLS, see below) to be dispatched and what advice should be given to the caller, including dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) instructions [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. For critical cases, the dispatcher may remain on the line until EMS personnel arrive on scene.</p><p>Emergency medical responders (EMRs) are frequently dispatched to the scene regardless of the level of emergency. In a "tiered" system, if the injury or illness appears life-threatening, additional advanced trained personnel are dispatched, and the EMRs remain at the scene to assist with the rescue. "Non-tiered" systems dispatch their most highly trained personnel to every emergency call. Once the EMS personnel arrive at the scene, radio or cell phone contact with the base station usually is attempted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H365267"><span class="h2">Base station personnel</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The base station typically is staffed with EMS providers who have advanced training and experience. They help the field personnel with decision-making and provide additional medical direction. Medical direction is provided by base station personnel in a variety of ways:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Offline medical direction refers to protocols that have been created by physicians and EMS providers for use by the field personnel in the absence of active physician direction. Many pediatric prehospital protocols exist but may vary from region to region [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. In the United States, peer-reviewed model pediatric prehospital protocols have been developed by the National Association of EMS Physicians [<a href="#rid46">46</a>] and more recently by the National Association of State EMS Officials [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. However, adoption is voluntary and has not occurred in many jurisdictions.

As a general rule, ground transport is more readily available if an emergency facility is within 20 to 30 minutes of the scene, and air transport is better if there is rough terrain or a long distance between the scene and the emergency facility.

Depending upon the severity of the child's illness or injury, the transferring hospital will coordinate with the receiving hospital about sending a mobile intensive care unit team to pick up the child. In such a situation, the receiving hospital usually provides advice to the referring hospital awaiting the transport team's arrival.</p><p>Stabilizing the critically ill or injured patient before transfer is necessary to assure a good patient outcome. Crucial stabilization and management interventions should not wait for arrival of a pediatric transport team but should be identified and performed with assistance and offsite direction from a pediatric transport medical command physician.</p><p>Most tertiary pediatric care facilities have access to or operate a pediatric/neonatal or general critical care transport team that can go to a referring facility and help with stabilization before initiating the transport [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. Pediatric critical care transport teams are often limited resources, however, and may not always be immediately available. The personnel that comprise the hospital transport team usually include a combination of two or more of the following transport-trained providers: physician, advanced practice provider (APP), critical care nurse or paramedic, and respiratory therapist. Most personnel are certified in pediatric and/or neonatal advanced life support (ALS) and may be current or previous staff members of the emergency department, pediatric intensive care unit, or neonatal intensive care unit.</p><p>Other circumstances that may result in an inter-facility transport include those initiated at the legal guardian/family's request or in accordance with insurance contract requirements. In these cases, involving the critical care transport team may not be necessary, and an EMS or private ambulance service with properly trained personnel can often fulfill the need.</p><p>As described above, preparation is essential to good patient care. Although most hospitals are not expected to provide tertiary pediatric care, they should be prepared to stabilize infants and children. That preparation includes having a prearranged transfer agreement that identifies the preferred tertiary pediatric care facility, mode of transport, and method of contact.</p><p>In some situations, the transport service is provided through the municipal EMS service; more commonly, the contract is assigned to a private company or hospital transport service. Large tertiary care facilities may operate their own ambulance service, including air transport, or contract for service with a private EMS company.

Medical control was provided by the same group of pediatric critical care specialists for all transports. The risk of unplanned adverse events was much higher for children transported by a nonspecialized team versus a pediatric team (20 percent versus 0.5 percent; adjusted relative risk [RR] 246, 95% CI 76-796). In addition, mortality was greater among children transported by a nonspecialized team than by a pediatric team (23 percent [15 patients] versus 9 percent [92 patients]; adjusted RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.3). In this study, for every seven transports by a nonspecialized team, approximately one unexpected death occurred [<a href="#rid82">82</a>]. These differences in unexpected outcomes during transport occurred despite a significantly longer transport time for the pediatric team versus the nonspecialized team (mean time 113 versus 81 minutes, p&lt;0.001).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2492206731"><span class="h1">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>EMS Agenda 2050</strong> – EMS Agenda 2050, a technical expert panel <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ems.gov%2Fassets%2FEMS-Agenda-2050.pdf&amp;token=NyRkA1K%2BEfcjom0B%2BqrukiGVeBmyXU%2FkKgdiG19TS7ZuwUa08C2dXydn2FyJN7yPPwrahG4nmvDX3jNMiOxfCg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=5796" target="_blank">report</a>, provides guidance for future directions and planning for EMS in the United States.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H799260743"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a class="local">'The EMS system'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Types of EMS systems</strong> – Globally, EMS systems are rudimentary in impoverished countries. In resource-rich nations, variable organization and funding strategies primarily focus around one of two delivery strategies (see <a class="local">'International EMS'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>"Load and go," with care provided by providers who are not physicians but who have medical oversight as exemplified by the Anglo-American model </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>"Stay and treat," typified by the Franco-German model with onsite care provided by trained physicians</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the United States, the organization of EMS occurs at the local and state levels with federal support from multiple agencies that provide limited funding for each state system as well as research funds targeting EMS issues. Considerable variation in prehospital provider training, certification, licensure, and continuing education as well as scope of practice currently exists, though federal efforts are underway to establish national standards. (See <a class="local">'Types of EMS systems'</a> above and <a class="local">'Transport personnel'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>EMS system components</strong> – Key components of the system include (see <a class="local">'The EMS system'</a> above and <a class="local">'Dispatch personnel'</a> above and <a class="local">'Transport personnel'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A universal telephone number to request EMS assistance (eg, 911 in the United States or Canada, 112 in European Union countries)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dispatch personnel to answer emergency calls and to send EMS personnel</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dedicated and licensed EMS personnel with a predefined scope of practice (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127490" href="/z/d/graphic/127490.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and standardized training or, in some countries, clinicians who provide prehospital care and rapid hospital transport</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Quality-improvement and safety programs to assess and advance the quality of care</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>EMS for children</strong> – About 10 percent of prehospital EMS transports involve children. Thus, it is essential that EMS systems provide equipment that is of the appropriate size to use in children of various ages (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131782" href="/z/d/graphic/131782.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), personnel properly trained in prehospital pediatric emergency care, and the support of a pediatric emergency care coordinator (PECC) with EMS and pediatric emergency care expertise. (See <a class="local">'Preparation and equipment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pediatric emergency care coordinators'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mode of transport</strong> – The decision to transport a child by air or ground depends upon the condition of the child, the severity of the emergency condition, the type and location of the emergency facility, the pediatric medical capability of the transporting personnel, local resources, safety, and weather conditions. Ground transport is more readily available if an emergency facility is within 20 to 30 minutes of the scene, and air transport is better if there is rough terrain or a long distance between the scene or transferring facility and the receiving facility. (See <a class="local">'Air versus ground transport'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interfacility transport</strong> – During inter-facility transport, critically ill or injured patients require stabilization and ongoing management before the actual physical transfer. These interventions should be identified and performed with consultation provided by a pediatric transport medical command physician. (See <a class="local">'Inter-facility transport'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During inter-facility transport, use of a pediatric-specialized team is associated with significantly improved survival and fewer adverse events. Thus, whenever possible, a pediatric transport team should be used for inter-facility transportation of critically ill or injured children. (See <a class="local">'Inter-facility transport'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3528192894"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Paul E Sirbaugh, DO, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Skandalakis PN, Lainas P, Zoras O, et al.
