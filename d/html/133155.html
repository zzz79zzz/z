         The table summarizes considerations for reviewing the report, including the importance of obtaining a hard copy, verifying the correct individual was tested, and reviewing which gene(s) and which variant(s) were analyzed  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Testing for clinical care should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory or other nationally certified laboratory. If not done initially and results will impact clinical decision-making (expected or unexpected positive results, negative results in an at-risk individual), testing should be repeated in a CLIA-certified laboratory.

         DNA variants are designated with a "c"; variants in protein sequence are designated with a "p" (as in p.Ala143Thr [p.A143T]). (See

        </p>
        <p>
         When cells cannot break down globoside, the metabolic intermediate globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its derivative lyso-Gb3 accumulate, producing inclusions that impair cellular function. Other potentially affected cell types include vascular smooth muscle, pericytes, autonomic and dorsal root ganglia, kidney (glomerular, tubular, and interstitial), cardiac (including conduction fibers), and cornea (vascular and lymphatic endothelium). Unexplained factors may contribute to pathogenesis.

         Over 1000
         <em>
          GLA
         </em>
         variants have been described. Most kindreds have specific (private) mutations; de novo mutations are rare. The clinical significance of a variant can be checked using the Fabry gene database (
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Ffabry-database.org%2F&amp;token=VDFnSGWNGRnK6DxG4QPVl1m3OR820Zc7FvL1okY1JD7lOu7wl%2FuTfGzKHJzWp2HG&amp;TOPIC_ID=133155" target="_blank">

        <p>
         Establishing genotype-phenotype correlations has been challenging, although some have been described. Variants that dramatically reduce or abolish alpha-Gal A activity usually cause the classic Fabry phenotype. Variants with some residual alpha-Gal A activity usually cause the later-onset (also called atypical) phenotype. Some variants prominently affect a single organ system. As an example, the p.Glu66Gln (pE66Q) variant appears to cause kidney-only manifestations. (See

         Routine genetic testing of
         <em>
          GLA
         </em>
         involves sequencing the coding region and intron-exon boundaries; this will detect nearly all disease variants. If a variant has not previously been described or is classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), clinical evaluation including alpha-Gal A activity (and biopsy of an affected tissue or organ in some cases) becomes especially important. Rarely, additional genetic analysis may be indicated including deletion/duplication analysis and/or evaluation for deep intronic variants. A Fabry specialist should be involved. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>

         One of the most common variants detected in newborn screening is p.Ala143Thr (p.A143T). This is generally considered a benign polymorphism; however, individuals with symptoms or positive biopsy findings may warrant additional evaluations [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The p.Asn313Tyr (p.D313Y) and p.Arg118Cys (pR118C) variants are also considered benign.

         is located on the X chromosome. Inheritance is X-linked with variable penetrance (likelihood of manifesting Fabry disease) and variable expressivity (specific constellation of clinical manifestations). (See

         Males with a

         variant are hemizygous and affected. They transmit the variant to all of their daughters, who are obligate heterozygous  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134340" href="/z/d/graphic/134340.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Father-to-son transmission does not occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         Females with a
         <em>
          GLA
         </em>
         variant are heterozygotes (with rare exceptions). Their clinical course varies from asymptomatic to severely affected. A high proportion of females will have some symptoms of Fabry disease (69 percent in one study) and should not be discounted [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. X-chromosome inactivation (lyonization) likely determines much of this phenotypic variation [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Mothers can transmit the disease-causing variant to sons or daughters  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134340" href="/z/d/graphic/134340.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). There is an equal likelihood of transmitting the X chromosome with the
         <em>
          GLA
         </em>
         variant or the X chromosome without the

         The prevalence of classic Fabry disease in the general male population is stated as 1:40,000, but this is likely an underestimate [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Many individuals remain undiagnosed, especially males with late-onset manifestations and females. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The likelihood of identifying a Fabry disease variant from newborn screening is 1:3200; however, the p.Alal143Thr variant is often included in these estimates, and this is considered a benign polymorphism [
         <a href="#rid6">

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         While Fabry disease is rare overall, the prevalence is much higher in individuals with certain types of organ dysfunction. Among males with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring dialysis, the prevalence is as high as 1 in 500 [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Prevalence may be even higher in males with unexplained stroke at a young age or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence in females with these conditions is also likely to be increased.

          Classic Fabry disease
         </strong>
         – Classic disease is defined based on findings in males. A typical presentation is a five-year-old male with burning pain in the hands and feet, with especially severe pain coinciding with fever ("pain crisis"). Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea and/or constipation) may start at approximately 10 to 11 years, along with proteinuria and CKD. Cerebral white matter lesions may be seen by late adolescence, with stroke and memory loss occurring in the fourth or fifth decade. Cardiac manifestations including PR interval shortening and left ventricular hypertrophy also occur during the third to fifth decades. Angiokeratomas are common, especially under the umbilicus  (

         – Measurement of alpha-Gal A activity from peripheral blood leukocytes. Undetectable activity (&lt;3 percent) is sufficient to diagnose classic Fabry disease. Males with suspected Fabry disease and higher enzyme levels (3 to 35 percent) can be evaluated with genetic testing and/or biopsy with histopathology of an involved tissue. If genetic testing is done first, establishing a baseline alpha-galactosidase enzyme activity level is recommended.

         If the diagnosis is uncertain (absent, mild, or nonspecific symptoms; variant of uncertain significance [VUS]), enzyme activity and/or biopsy with histopathology may be helpful to confirm or exclude disease and guide therapeutic decision-making. Histopathology can show classic Gb3 inclusions even prior to symptom development  (

         Management by a Fabry disease expert is ideal to determine indications for disease-modifying therapy, choice of therapy, appropriate administration (dosing, premedication if needed), and monitoring. If direct care by a Fabry expert is not possible, consultation or comanagement can provide essential guidance.

Intravenous administration is required, which may necessitate an implanted venous access device. Infusion reactions frequently occur and may need to be treated with premedications such as histamine receptor blockers and glucocorticoids if needed. Inhibitory anti-drug antibodies may develop and may interfere with efficacy [
