(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4845.html" rel="external">"Screening for melanoma in adults and adolescents", section on 'Clinician total body skin examination'</a>.)</p><p>When performing TBSE, skin lesions should be classified as patches, plaques, or tumors according to the following definitions [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patch – Any size lesion without induration or significant elevation above the surrounding uninvolved skin; poikiloderma (ie, mottled pigmentation, epidermal atrophy, and telangiectasia associated with slight infiltration), scale, and crusting may be present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Plaque – Any size lesion that is elevated or indurated; crusting, ulceration, or poikiloderma may be present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tumor – Any solid or nodular lesions ≥1 cm in diameter with evidence of deep infiltration in the skin and/or vertical growth.</p><p></p><p>Clinicians should make special note of signs of follicular/folliculotropic disease (eg, follicular prominence/accentuation, hair loss/alopecia, comedonal/cystic lesions), ulceration, and if any pigment alteration is due to active disease (eg, hypopigmented or vitiliginous variant of MF) or from postinflammatory discoloration associated with inactive disease.

MF and SS are PET avid [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Lymph node assessment is based on imaging findings according to the Lugano classification  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97480" href="/d/graphic/97480.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p>We generally perform a whole-body integrated PET/CT or diagnostic (ie, contrast-enhanced) CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis at initial diagnosis. Imaging can be repeated if the findings might change the choice of therapy or if required by a clinical trial. Care should be taken to limit radiation exposure, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns regarding the risk for second malignancies. </p><p>The preferred method of assessment of lymph nodes selected as a target lesion is the product of the perpendicular diameters (PPD) of up to six of the largest target nodes &gt;1.5 cm in longest diameter, preferentially from different body regions that are representative of the patient's overall disease burden.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Asymptomatic, early-stage disease</strong> – Decisions regarding imaging for asymptomatic, otherwise healthy patients should be individualized, but imaging is not required for early-stage MF without diffuse plaque disease (T<sub>1</sub>N<sub>0</sub>B<sub>0</sub> or T<sub>2a</sub>N<sub>0</sub>B<sub>0</sub>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptomatic or more advanced disease</strong> – Imaging is usually reserved for patients with ≥T<sub>2b</sub> skin lesions, palpable adenopathy, abnormal laboratory studies, or pathology that is consistent with large-cell transformed MF or folliculotropic MF [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p></p><p>In a case series of 13 patients with MF or SS who were at risk for secondary lymph node involvement, whole-body PET/CT was more sensitive in detecting lymph node involvement than physical examination or CT; the intensity of PET activity roughly correlated with the histologic grade of nodal involvement and was highest in those with large-cell transformation. [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Visceral disease is highly unusual in the absence of significant blood or nodal involvement [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3159567790"><span class="h3">Lymph node biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lymph node biopsy is generally reserved for patients in whom clinical examination or imaging suggests lymphadenopathy. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Selection of a node</strong> – Biopsy should involve a lymph node ≥1.5 cm in long diameter; a firm, irregular, clustered, or fixed lymph node; or a node with significant metabolic activity by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If there is more than one suspicious lymph node, preference is given to lymph nodes draining an area of involved skin or the node with the highest standardized uptake value (SUV) on PET/CT.
