The amount of alcohol that constitutes heavy use in adults is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Males</strong> – Heavy alcohol use is defined as chronic (daily) consumption of &gt;80 grams of alcohol.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This translates into a daily intake of approximately 250 mL of distilled spirits, more than 500 mL of fortified wine, one bottle (750 mL) of table wine, or 1.5 liters of beer (four 12-ounce cans or bottles).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Females</strong> – Heavy alcohol use is defined as chronic (daily) consumption of &gt;60 grams of alcohol.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This translates into a daily intake of approximately 190 mL of distilled spirits, more than 375 mL of fortified wine, three-fourths of a bottle (560 mL) of table wine, or 1 liter of beer (three 12-ounce cans or bottles).</p><p></p><p>The reasons for the difference between males and females is unknown; it may represent differences in body weight, body fat versus total body water content, or liver size. (See <a class="local">'Mitigating factors'</a> below.)</p><p>The amount of alcohol in grams can be calculated based on the volume of the drink and the percentage of alcohol it contains. As an example, distilled spirits have an alcohol content of approximately 35 percent (35 g/dL); thus, 250 mL (2.5 dL) of distilled spirits would have 35 g/dL x 2.5 dL = 87.5 grams of alcohol.</p><p>Fortified wine (eg, port, sherry) refers to wine with an alcohol content of approximately 20 percent; table wine generally has an alcohol content of 10 to 13 percent [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Some "supersized alcopops" (flavored drinks containing alcohol) have an ethanol content equivalent to 5.5 standard drinks or roughly 80 grams of alcohol [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The alcohol content of other alcoholic beverages is illustrated in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56818" href="/d/graphic/56818.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Intermittent binge drinking is common. The exposure and effect on hematologic parameters is challenging to define, but binge drinking does appear to have clinically significant affects in some individuals. </p><p>Additional information about alcohol use disorder and risky drinking, including amount of alcohol and other features, is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7809.html" rel="external">"Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, adverse consequences, screening, and assessment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14843.html" rel="external">"Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2795935786"><span class="h2">Effects on the hematopoietic system</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Alcohol use at concerning levels (&gt;80 grams of alcohol daily for males or &gt;60 grams daily for females) (see <a class="local">'Amount of alcohol consumed'</a> above) can cause a variety of hematologic complications, including anemia, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. </p><p>Alcohol can also cause macrocytosis without anemia and ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow (acquired sideroblastic anemia). In contrast, alcohol use does not appear to increase the risk for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or lymphoma [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>How alcohol exerts these effects is not completely understood. Direct toxic effects on hematopoietic cells, abnormalities in membrane phospholipids, and interference with folate utilization in metabolic pathways such as for DNA synthesis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79271" href="/d/graphic/79271.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) all may be involved [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p>The interaction between alcohol and folate is complex. Alcohol use does not induce folate deficiency per se, nor does it appear to impair folate absorption. However, serum folate levels will fall acutely after rapid alcohol intake. This is a consequence of alcohol effects on folate mobilization and utilization [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Chronic alcohol use can also be associated with poor nutrition, and folate deficiency is seen frequently in individuals with heavy alcohol intake and limited diets, along with other indicators of poor nutrition.</p><p>The individual's access to medical care can also profoundly impact the severity of these effects as more prolonged alcohol use without clinical intervention often allows the abnormalities to progress.</p><p>The adverse effects of alcohol on hematopoiesis may be mediated in part by metabolites of alcohol such as acetaldehyde [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Ingested alcohol (ethanol) is metabolized in the liver in part by alcohol dehydrogenase, which oxidizes alcohol to acetaldehyde while reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH. Acetaldehyde can produce red blood cell (RBC) protein-acetaldehyde adducts, which may generate immune responses against these modified proteins [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgM anti-acetaldehyde-protein adducts have been found in individuals with macrocytosis who consume excess alcohol [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3613.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease", section on 'Alcohol metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>Alcohol-induced liver disease, although a separate issue, may contribute to anemia through coagulopathy with or without concurrent gastrointestinal bleeding from portal hypertension that can be exacerbated by coagulation abnormalities. It may also contribute to anemia, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia by causing splenomegaly and hypersplenism. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13932.html" rel="external">"Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7134.html" rel="external">"Splenomegaly and other splenic disorders in adults", section on 'Hypersplenism'</a>.)</p><p>Other associated or complicating factors such as infection due to immunocompromise may also contribute. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3585.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis C and alcohol"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7809.html" rel="external">"Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, adverse consequences, screening, and assessment", section on 'Medical morbidity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3616388309"><span class="h2">Mitigating factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies of the impact of alcohol have been based on evaluations of individuals identified by the clinical history as heavy alcohol users or those stabilized medically following hospital admission [<a href="#rid4">4,11,12</a>]. These individuals may have other comorbidities, dietary deficiencies, and psychosocial behaviors that contribute to hematologic complications. It is possible that addressing these other conditions could mitigate the effects of alcohol.</p><p>Studies of healthy volunteers have demonstrated that the hematologic effects of approximately 160 grams of alcohol (500 mL of distilled spirits) per day could be mitigated by appropriate protein-calorie nutrition and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8475" href="/d/drug information/8475.html" rel="external">folic acid</a> supplementation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Aside from diet, other modifying factors may include the overall size of the individual, proportion of lean body mass, and other highly individualized heritable variations such as levels of alcohol dehydrogenase activity [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Abnormally low body mass index (BMI) may be associated with more pronounced alcohol effects.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3364222954"><span class="h1">CYTOPENIAS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Anemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anemia (hemoglobin or hematocrit below the age- and sex-specific reference ranges) is a common complication of excess alcohol use, especially when coupled with comorbidities, nutritional deficits, and reduced access to medical care.</p><p>The cause of anemia is often multifactorial and may include more than one of the following [<a href="#rid6">6,14-16</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Direct toxic effects of alcohol on red blood cell (RBC) production in the bone marrow</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Iron deficiency due to gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, alcoholic gastritis, ulcers, or other lesions</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nutritional folate deficiency from the effects of a poor diet</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic inflammation (also called anemia of chronic disease), which may be due to concurrent infection such as tuberculosis or chronic leg ulcers</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hemolysis caused by RBC membrane abnormalities or other causes [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypersplenism due to portal hypertension with sequestration of RBCs in the spleen</p><p></p><p>Even before anemia appears, approximately 90 percent of individuals with excessive alcohol intake have macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] above the reference range, typically in the range of 100 to 110 femtoliters [fL]) [<a href="#rid6">6,14,18</a>]. In some cases, this may be due to folate deficiency; this has become vanishingly rare in individuals who reside in countries with routine folate supplementation of foods, but it continues to occur in individuals with heavy alcohol use who are malnourished and have limited diets. Macrocytosis (and formation of target cells) can also occur as a consequence of liver disease and resulting changes to the lipid composition of RBC membranes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7088.html" rel="external">"Burr cells, acanthocytes, and target cells: Disorders of red blood cell membrane"</a>.)</p><p>Alcohol-induced macrocytosis can also occur in individuals who are folate and vitamin B12 (cobalamin) replete and do not have liver disease. The mechanism is unknown, but it may involve acetaldehyde adducts that accumulate in RBC membranes. It takes two to four months for the macrocytosis to disappear after the patient stops their alcohol intake. Macrocytosis may be blunted in individuals with concurrent iron deficiency, which causes microcytosis.</p><p>Hemolysis due to spur cell anemia (also a consequence of changes to RBC membranes) carries an extremely poor prognosis as it generally reflects severe liver disease. A case report described an individual with alcoholic cirrhosis and spur cell anemia who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation, which led to complete resolution of the spur cell anemia [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. However, the anemia recurred when the patient resumed alcohol intake and developed graft failure. Other reports are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7088.html" rel="external">"Burr cells, acanthocytes, and target cells: Disorders of red blood cell membrane", section on 'RBC changes in liver disease'</a>.)</p><p>Zieve syndrome, first reported in 1958, is a rare clinical syndrome comprising a triad of Coombs-negative hemolysis, cholestatic jaundice, and transient hyperlipidemia in heavy alcohol users, typically following an episode of acutely increased alcohol intake ("binge drinking"). The mechanism is unclear, but the hemolysis may be related to lipid accumulation in RBC membranes, and it will typically resolve with abstinence or, in the case of binge drinking, with return to baseline alcohol intake [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Iron handling in individuals with excess alcohol intake is complex. There may be iron deficiency due to bleeding, a functional block in iron incorporation (anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation), and/or excess liver iron (or total body iron) due to an incompletely understood mechanism involving increased iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, perhaps related to increase gastric acid secretion or suppression of hepcidin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7149.html" rel="external">"Anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation"</a>.)</p><p>Iron overload, in turn, can cause further hepatotoxicity, especially in individuals who are predisposed to increased iron absorption (eg, <em>HFE</em> mutation carriers). Details of iron absorption are discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Iron overload'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7105.html" rel="external">"Regulation of iron balance", section on 'Intestinal iron absorption'</a>.)</p><p>As discussed below, macrocytosis and/or anemia should not be attributed to alcohol unless or until other causes of macrocytosis and anemia have been excluded. (See <a class="local">'Testing for RBC abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Leukopenia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Leukopenia (reduced white blood cell [WBC] count) is typically due to a fall in the neutrophil count as neutrophils are the most abundant WBCs. It is unusual for leukopenia or neutropenia to be severe (ie, the absolute neutrophil count [ANC] is rarely &lt;1000/microL).</p><p>The cause of mild leukopenia or neutropenia may be multifactorial, similar to anemia, and many of the same conditions that contribute to anemia (folate deficiency, bone marrow suppression, and hypersplenism in patients with portal hypertension) may also cause some degree of leukopenia. (See <a class="local">'Anemia'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to the decrease in WBC count, there also appears to be a difficult-to-characterize defect in neutrophil function induced by alcohol use. Neutrophil mobilization and bacterial killing may be impaired, and this may contribute to the immunocompromised state and increased susceptibility to infections in individuals with heavy alcohol use [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8388.html" rel="external">"Laboratory evaluation of neutrophil disorders", section on 'Overview of causes (neutrophil dysfunction)'</a>.)</p><p>As long as hypersplenism is not the major cause, leukopenia from alcohol ingestion is typically transient and resolves in four to five days with cessation of alcohol intake.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Thrombocytopenia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mild thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count 70,000 to 149,000/microL) is extremely common in individuals with excess alcohol intake, with a prevalence as high as 80 percent of hospitalized adults in some series [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The platelet count rarely decreases below 30,000/microL, and serious bleeding due to isolated thrombocytopenia (without other coagulation abnormalities such as caused by severe liver disease) is rare in individuals with excess alcohol intake. However, other bleeding risk factors often co-occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13932.html" rel="external">"Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease", section on 'Impaired hemostasis'</a>.)</p><p>Contributing causes may include direct toxicity to platelet precursor cells (megakaryocytes), hypersplenism, and chronic liver disease-induced reductions in thrombopoietin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6673.html" rel="external">"Biology and physiology of thrombopoietin"</a>.)</p><p>In some patients, platelet function may also be abnormal leading to atraumatic bruising. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6675.html" rel="external">"Inherited platelet function disorders (IPFDs)", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Approaches to raising the platelet count in individuals with bleeding or those who require an invasive procedure are discussed below and in a separate topic review. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13932.html" rel="external">"Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease", section on 'Invasive procedures'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4221381179"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1757484138"><span class="h2">Clinical assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation depends on which cytopenia(s) are present and whether an alcohol use disorder is known or suspected.</p><p>All individuals with a history of alcohol use who have one or more cytopenias should have a detailed assessment of alcohol use and a dietary history. Excess alcohol use should be considered as a cause of unexplained cytopenias, especially if there are abnormalities of liver function testing or other suggestive findings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14843.html" rel="external">"Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care"</a>.)</p><p>Alcohol intake should be quantified, and responses such as "occasional drinking" or "social drinking" need to be defined. Screening tools for unhealthy alcohol use may provide clues when excess intake is unsuspected, but these focus primarily on behavioral aspects of dependence and cannot substitute for a quantitative history. Laboratory tests such as measurement of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin may have a role as biomarkers of alcohol use but are not widely available in the routine clinical setting [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14843.html" rel="external">"Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care", section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>.)</p><p>The history can also be used to identify features specific to a certain disorder (eg, limited diet suggestive of folate deficiency, melena suggestive of iron deficiency, medications that can cause hemolytic or megaloblastic anemia).</p><p>The physical examination should emphasize evaluating for signs of anemia, bleeding (eg, examination of the stool for occult blood), and evidence of portal hypertension (particularly splenomegaly).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2713055166"><span class="h2">Laboratory testing</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H497554158"><span class="h3">Initial testing (all patients)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laboratory evaluation of hematologic abnormalities in an individual with acute alcohol intoxication, a recent binge-drinking episode, or in the midst of alcohol withdrawal symptoms may be unproductive or misleading. An exception would be if red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is planned. If that is the case, red cell folate and serum vitamin B12 should be obtained prior to transfusion.</p><p>Leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and/or hemolysis will frequently resolve over several days to two weeks; bone marrow abnormalities also are likely to resolve with cessation of alcohol use.

(See <a class="local">'Mechanism of alcohol toxicity'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cytopenias'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation </strong>– The evaluation depends on which cytopenia(s) are present. All individuals with alcohol use who have one or more cytopenias should have a detailed assessment of intake and a dietary history. The physical examination should emphasize signs of anemia, bleeding (eg, examination of the stool for occult blood), and evidence of portal hypertension or liver decompensation (particularly splenomegaly). (See <a class="local">'Clinical assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory testing</strong> – Laboratory testing should be done when the person is at their baseline and at least two weeks after an acute episode of intoxication or binge drinking. Many abnormalities will resolve with abstinence. Those with persistent cytopenias should have a review of the complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet count; review of the red blood cell (RBC) indices, especially the mean corpuscular volume (MCV); reticulocyte count; blood smear review; chemistry panel; and liver function tests. (See <a class="local">'Initial testing (all patients)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Individuals with microcytosis or microcytic anemia are evaluated for iron deficiency, keeping in mind that thalassemia (including thalassemia trait), anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation (ACD/AI), and sideroblastic anemia can also cause microcytosis. Those with iron deficiency should have an evaluation for the cause. Individuals with macrocytosis or macrocytic anemia should have a reticulocyte count, serum folate and vitamin B12 levels, liver function tests, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), HIV testing, and/or serum protein electrophoresis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66772" href="/d/graphic/66772.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Hepatitis C virus testing is appropriate if transaminases are elevated. Hematologist consultation is appropriate for severe cytopenias, signs of dysplasia on the blood smear, or unexplained pancytopenia. (See <a class="local">'Testing for RBC abnormalities'</a> above and <a class="local">'When to consult'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Common causes of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia include folate, vitamin B12, and copper deficiencies, and hypersplenism. Evaluation for other causes may be indicated. Thrombocytopenia is rarely severe, but some individuals may require interventions to raise the platelet count for an invasive procedure or to treat thrombocytopenia-associated bleeding. (See <a class="local">'Testing for additional cytopenias'</a> above and <a class="local">'Interventions for severe thrombocytopenia or bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – The principal treatment is cessation of alcohol intake, which may require substantial investment of time and effort, possibly including counseling and other psychosocial interventions and in some cases medication. A varied diet is important, and iron, folate, vitamin B12, and copper should be replaced if deficient. Recovery occurs in two to four weeks. Macrocytosis may take months to resolve, and cytopenias due to hypersplenism may not improve. (See <a class="local">'Abstinence'</a> above and <a class="local">'Nutrient replacement'</a> above and <a class="local">'Expected resolution'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rebound thrombocytosis</strong> – Rebound thrombocytosis is common after recovery from alcohol-induced thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts as high as 600,000 to 900,000/microL. The platelet count generally returns to normal within 7 to 10 days, and further intervention or evaluation is not needed unless thrombocytosis persists for several weeks. (See <a class="local">'Rebound thrombocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Iron overload</strong> – Iron overload can occur with liver disease of any cause. Liver disease can cause increased serum ferritin independent of total body iron stores; most patients with chronic alcohol consumption and an elevated ferritin do not have increased total body iron stores. (See <a class="local">'Iron overload'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3992193903"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>UpToDate gratefully acknowledges Stanley L Schrier, MD (deceased), who contributed as Section Editor on earlier versions of this topic and was a founding Editor-in-Chief for UpToDate in Hematology.</p><p>The UpToDate editorial staff also acknowledges the extensive contributions of William C Mentzer, MD, to earlier versions of this and many other topic reviews.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-9/ (Accessed on October 22, 2019).</li><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">de Beukelaar MF, Janse ML, Sierksma A, et al.
