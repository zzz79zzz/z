Ulnar neuropathy, especially at the elbow, is a common focal neuropathy affecting the upper extremity and is second in frequency only to entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist (the carpal tunnel syndrome). Accurate and timely diagnosis is important for clarifying the presence and severity of nerve injury, determining prognosis, avoiding unnecessary investigation or surgery, and establishing a treatment plan.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow and wrist. Other focal neuropathies affecting the arm and hand are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5282.html" rel="external">"Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5266.html" rel="external">"Brachial plexus syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5288.html" rel="external">"Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19484189"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ulnar nerve is derived from the anterior rami of the C8 and T1 spinal nerves with a variable contribution from C7 (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50576" href="/z/d/graphic/50576.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). These contributing fibers are initially carried in the lower trunk and medial cord of the brachial plexus with the ulnar nerve arising in the proximal axilla.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Upper arm</strong> – In the upper arm, the ulnar nerve lies in close proximity to the brachial artery and the median nerve. It has no motor or sensory branches above the elbow (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75124" href="/z/d/graphic/75124.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). This anatomic feature can lead to challenges in localizing proximal ulnar nerve lesions in some cases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Midhumeral region</strong> – At the midpoint of the upper arm, the ulnar nerve pierces the medial intermuscular septum (the arcade of Struthers) and heads posteriorly where it lies close to the humerus and the medial head of the triceps brachii muscle and tendon. Distal to this segment, the ulnar nerve travels within the retrocondylar groove of the elbow, posteromedial to the medial epicondyle. As the nerve exits the groove, it passes under the aponeurotic arch of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, also called the humeroulnar arcade [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], which is formed by attachments of this muscle to the medial epicondyle and olecranon (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68935" href="/z/d/graphic/68935.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The proximal edge of the arcade lies approximately 1 to 2 cm distal to a line joining the medial epicondyle and olecranon. This is an important structure clinically because it is often implicated as the cause of compressive ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cubital tunnel</strong> – After passing underneath the arch, the ulnar nerve travels within the cubital tunnel through the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. The roof of the cubital tunnel is the humeroulnar arcade proximally, and the substance of the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle distally. The floor of the tunnel is composed of the medial elbow ligaments proximally and the deep fibers of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle more distally. The nerve then pierces the aponeurosis lining the deep heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and runs between the tendons and muscle planes of the medial forearm to the wrist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Forearm</strong> – The ulnar nerve gives off motor branches to the flexor carpi ulnaris in the proximal forearm, distal to the medial epicondyle and just proximal to or within the cubital tunnel (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75124" href="/z/d/graphic/75124.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The branch to the ulnar-innervated portion of the flexor digitorum profundus (supplying digits four and five) is given off more distally within the cubital tunnel. The palmar cutaneous branch arises in the midforearm and runs distally over the volar aspect of the forearm and wrist without passing through Guyon's canal. It supplies the cutaneous territory over the proximal border of the ulnar portion of the palm (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76075" href="/z/d/graphic/76075.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The dorsal cutaneous branch is given off more distally, approximately 5 cm proximal to the wrist, and courses dorsally around the ulna to supply the ulnar side of the dorsum of the hand and dorsal surfaces of the fifth and ulnar half of the fourth digit (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76075" href="/z/d/graphic/76075.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Guyon’s canal</strong> – At the wrist, the ulnar nerve passes through Guyon's canal (along with the ulnar artery), the floor of which is formed by the transverse carpal ligament and pisohamate ligament. The roof of Guyon's canal consists of the palmar fascia and the palmaris brevis muscle. The ulnar nerve then divides into the superficial and deep terminal branches (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57601" href="/z/d/graphic/57601.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). In the hand, after giving off a branch to the palmaris brevis muscle, the superficial terminal branch supplies the cutaneous ulnar border of the palm and then divides into two digital branches that innervate the palmar or volar surfaces of the fifth and ulnar half of the fourth digit (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76075" href="/z/d/graphic/76075.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The deep branch pierces and innervates the opponens digiti muscle and then gives off a branch to the remaining hypothenar muscles just after emerging from Guyon's canal. In the palm, the deep branch innervates all of the interossei and the third and fourth lumbricals (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75124" href="/z/d/graphic/75124.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). It then terminates in the thenar eminence where it supplies the adductor pollicis and variable portions of the flexor pollicis brevis muscles.</p><p></p><p>The anatomy of the ulnar nerve at the elbow requires special mention, given the close relationship between the musculoskeletal structures of this region and the ulnar nerve. With elbow flexion, the distance between the medial epicondyle and olecranon increases by up to 1 cm. This results in tightening of the humeroulnar arcade of the flexor carpi ulnaris over the nerve (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57076" href="/z/d/graphic/57076.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). Also upon flexion, the medial elbow ligaments bulge and flatten the floor of the normally deep retrocondylar groove, while the medial head of the triceps muscle pushes the nerve posteriorly. With complete elbow flexion the nerve is stretched taut around the medial epicondyle, whereas in extension there is redundant length in the nerve allowing for freedom of movement. Intraoperative pressure recordings in patients with ulnar neuropathy have documented increased pressure under the humeroulnar arcade during elbow flexion [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19484196"><span class="h1">LOCALIZATION AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common site of focal ulnar entrapment or compression is at the elbow, followed by the wrist.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H146324222"><span class="h2">Elbow</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow was first identified in 1878 within a description of operative treatment for ulnar neuropathy following remote elbow fracture [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Broca and Mouchet applied the term "tardy ulnar palsy" to this syndrome in 1899 [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This term has subsequently been used inappropriately to describe all cases of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, as opposed to only those following remote bony injury. Entrapment under the humeroulnar arcade was described in 1922 [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], in what later became known as the cubital tunnel syndrome [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. This term is also often used inappropriately to describe all causes of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. However, the clinical features of ulnar neuropathy and the available diagnostic tools are often incapable of localizing the exact site of lesions at the elbow precisely. Therefore, the more generic term "ulnar neuropathy at the elbow" is preferred, as it does not imply a specific site of compression (eg, the cubital tunnel). However, it is important to understand the anatomic structures around the elbow in terms of their role in the pathophysiology of ulnar nerve injury.</p><p>The etiology of ulnar nerve lesions at the elbow includes acute trauma (eg, distal humeral fracture, nerve lacerations, perioperative injury) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] and nerve compression, traction, or friction from leaning on the elbow or from prolonged elbow flexion [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. Intrinsic causes include elbow joint pathology such as osteophytes, arthritis, synovitis, anomalous muscles or fibrous bands, ganglia, and other mass lesions. Subluxation of the ulnar nerve laterally over the medial epicondyle is a potential cause of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, but its role is often unclear, since it occurs in a substantial proportion of asymptomatic individuals [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H146324216"><span class="h2">Wrist</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main distal trunk of the ulnar nerve and its two branches, the superficial sensory branch and deep motor branch (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57601" href="/z/d/graphic/57601.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>), can be injured around the wrist, although ulnar nerve injury at the wrist is less common than at the elbow. The etiology of distal ulnar lesions can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic causes. The extrinsic causes include bone fractures (eg, hook of hamate), lacerations, and direct, often repetitive trauma, such as repetitive use of tools in the workplace [<a href="#rid13">13</a>] or propulsion of a manual wheelchair [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. A number of cases have been reported in bicyclists as a result of direct pressure [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>], sometimes called handlebar palsy [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This is uncommon and is usually a mild neurapraxia. Intrinsic causes include ganglia arising from the wrist joint or intraneural ganglia [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Many cases are idiopathic [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H146324210"><span class="h2">Other</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ulnar nerve, sometimes in combination with the median and radial nerves, can also be compressed in the axilla or upper arm by external structures (eg, crutches, tourniquets, pressure during sleep). However, such injuries to the ulnar nerve are uncommon owing to its reasonably protected position in the upper arm. Compression of the ulnar nerve by internal structures (eg, aneurysms, hematomas, compartment syndromes, bony fragments from humeral shaft fractures) also can result in proximal ulnar nerve lesions. There are case reports of entrapment by the medial intramuscular septum (arcade of Struthers) as the ulnar passes through this structure when traversing from the anterior to posterior compartment of the upper arm, but these presentations are rare in clinical practice [<a href="#rid21">21-25</a>]. Because there are no motor or sensory branches given off by the ulnar nerve in the upper arm, the neurologic deficits related to proximal ulnar nerve injuries in the upper arm or axilla are identical to those caused by more distal ulnar nerve lesions at the elbow. Therefore, one is dependent on the clinical scenario, the presence of proximal pain or a mass, or the involvement of other nerves (median and radial) to aid in localization.</p><p>Distal to the elbow, the ulnar nerve rarely can be compressed within the body of flexor carpi ulnaris muscle or where it exits through the deep flexor-pronator aponeurosis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Ulnar nerve mononeuritis can occur with infectious causes (eg, leprosy), hereditary neuropathies, and vasculitis; acromegaly is a rare cause [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5282.html" rel="external">"Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes", section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26073271"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow is the second most commonly diagnosed focal neuropathy, surpassed only by median neuropathy at the wrist [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. In a study from Italy, the raw annual incidence of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow was 24.7 cases per 100,000 person-years, and the incidence in males was nearly double that of females (32.7 versus 17.2 per 100,000) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. In another study from the United Kingdom that analyzed a large general practice database, the annual incidence of ulnar neuropathy (including all anatomic locations) for males and females was 25.2 and 18.9 per 100,000, respectively [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for ulnar neuropathy are poorly defined because the available data are retrospective, limited, and conflicting. However, a positive association of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow with smoking is supported by two of the larger reports:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study that compared 324 subjects with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow with 832 matched control subjects, the condition was associated with smoking (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 2.4-7.6) but not with body mass index or alcohol consumption [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a hospital based case-control study that compared 110 patients who had surgical treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow with 192 control patients treated for cervical or lumbar herniated disc, risk factors for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow included smoking, educational level, and work experience; by contrast, sex, body mass index, alcohol consumption, elbow trauma, diabetes, and hypertension were not risk factors [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another retrospective study compared patients with electrodiagnostic studies confirming ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (n = 112) with patients whose studies excluded it (n = 104) and identified male sex and increasing age as risk factors [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p>The incidence and prevalence of ulnar neuropathy at the wrist are unknown, but the incidence is much lower than ulnar neuropathy at the elbow [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19484203"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ulnar lesions at the elbow typically present with numbness and tingling in the fourth and fifth digits, medial elbow pain, nocturnal numbness and paresthesia, and worsening of symptoms with elbow and/or repeated wrist flexion [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Ulnar lesions at the wrist typically present with hand weakness and atrophy, loss of dexterity, and variable sensory involvement as outlined below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H87963056"><span class="h2">Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical features of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow are understood based upon knowledge of the motor and sensory distribution of the ulnar nerve and its major branches. Sensory symptoms of numbness or paresthesiae in the ulnar nerve distribution are the most frequent initial complaints [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It is the author's impression that patients usually experience the sensory symptoms over the volar aspect of the fourth and fifth digits and ulnar aspect of the hand. The presence of sensory symptoms in the dorsal ulnar or palmar cutaneous territory (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76075" href="/z/d/graphic/76075.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) is helpful in localizing the lesion proximal to the distal forearm or wrist, but these complaints are not always present. As an example, in one study of 25 patients with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, sensory symptoms involved the digital terminal branches, the palmar cutaneous territory, and the dorsal cutaneous territory in 92, 80, and 72 percent of patients, respectively [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Some patients with severe and persistent numbness have sensory symptoms that split the ring finger. Medial elbow pain or aching is common, and many patients report referred pain along the medial forearm.</p><p>Sensory symptoms from ulnar neuropathy at the elbow are often brought on by sustained elbow flexion (eg, when talking on the phone or lying on one's side with the elbow flexed). Symptoms can also be provoked by leaning on the elbow or when performing activity that requires sustained or repetitive grip, or repeated forearm pronation and supination.</p><p>Motor symptoms in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow are less common than sensory symptoms, but range from mild weakness of intrinsic hand muscles to severe wasting and claw hand deformity (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65510" href="/z/d/graphic/65510.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Some patients will report only mild weakness and clumsiness of the hand during activities requiring dexterity and fine control such as buttoning or typing. Loss of dexterity due to ulnar neuropathy is usually indicative of weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles (ie, the lumbricals and interossei), in contrast to mild median nerve injury, where loss of dexterity is most often related to sensory loss. More significant involvement of the ulnar-innervated forearm muscles, primarily flexor digitorum profundus to the fourth and fifth digits, leads to complaints of grip weakness and difficulty lifting and carrying. In a report of 25 patients with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, weakness of the first dorsal interosseous, abductor digiti minimi, flexor digitorum profundus, and flexor carpi ulnaris was present in 84, 76, 56, and 20 percent of patients, respectively [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. This distribution is consistent with our clinical experience.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H87963063"><span class="h2">Ulnar neuropathy at the wrist</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ulnar neuropathy at the wrist typically presents with hand weakness and atrophy, loss of dexterity, and variable sensory involvement. The extent of clawing of digits four and five (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65510" href="/z/d/graphic/65510.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) can be worse with lesions at the wrist than at the elbow as a result of sparing of the flexor digitorum profundus and weakness of the third and fourth lumbricals, resulting in greater muscle imbalance.</p><p>Injury to the terminal branches of the ulnar nerve at the wrist (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57601" href="/z/d/graphic/57601.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) is often divided into four sites and their associated clinical scenarios:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(1) Injury to the main trunk of the nerve proximal to or within Guyon's canal.

However, the diagnosis can be challenging due to the potential for selective fascicular involvement of the motor and sensory fibers and the presence of comorbid conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, generalized polyneuropathy, radiculopathy, or referred pain from musculoskeletal problems such as tendonitis. Ulnar lesions in the upper arm can mimic ulnar lesions at the elbow or wrist, and one is often dependent on the clinical scenario or the presence of motor and sensory deficits secondary to coexisting median or radial nerve injuries to aid in localization. Therefore, further diagnostic tools are often required, as discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H170956430"><span class="h3">Examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physical examination should include a careful inspection of the limb for any evidence of muscle wasting, particularly in the interossei and hypothenar eminence. It is important to make side-to-side comparisons, looking for any asymmetry. Deformity of the elbow or wrist may be associated with previous trauma or degenerative or inflammatory arthritis. The ulnar nerve should be palpated along its course in the retrocondylar groove and above the elbow for any evidence of masses or swelling. In the author's clinical experience, it is useful to examine for the presence of ulnar nerve subluxation laterally over the medial epicondyle; this is especially relevant when present only on the affected side. Motor examination should focus on a careful assessment of the ulnar-innervated intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. An assessment of radial- and median-innervated forearm and hand muscles is necessary to exclude more proximal lesions of the C8 or T1 roots, the brachial plexus, or a more generalized motor neuron disorder.</p><p>Sensation should be tested to pinprick and light touch in all three major ulnar sensory territories, which are innervated by the following branches (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76075" href="/z/d/graphic/76075.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Superficial terminal branch (digital branch)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Palmar cutaneous nerve</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dorsal cutaneous nerve</p><p></p><p>The presence of deficits in the palmar and dorsal cutaneous territories is helpful in ruling in a lesion proximal to the distal forearm, but their absence does not rule out ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, as some patients may experience deficits in only the digital tips of the fourth and fifth digits or may have no demonstrable sensory loss resulting from selective fascicular injury.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H170956483"><span class="h3">Provocative tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are a number of provocative maneuvers for ulnar neuropathy, including Tinel test, elbow flexion, pressure (compression), combined elbow flexion with pressure, and palpation for local nerve tenderness and nerve thickening. Unfortunately, the sensitivity and specificity of these provocative tests for ulnar neuropathy appear to be suboptimal. Nevertheless, these tests may be helpful when interpreted in the proper clinical context. </p><p>The Tinel test at the elbow is performed by firm percussion over the ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove and a bit further distally over the cubital tunnel. Percussion over Guyon's canal can be performed for assessment of ulnar neuropathy at the wrist. In addition, percussion can be applied in the upper arm 7 to 10 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle to evaluate for ulnar neuropathy along the medial intermuscular septum [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The elbow flexion test involves sustained maximal elbow flexion for one minute with the wrist in a neutral position, while the pressure test is carried out by applying sustained manual pressure over the ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove. These tests are considered positive when they result in paresthesia or pain in ulnar-innervated regions of the hand, particularly the fourth and fifth digits (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76075" href="/z/d/graphic/76075.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p>The available data are limited and inconsistent but suggest that clinical utility of provocative tests for ulnar neuropathy is inadequate.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One of the highest-quality prospective studies evaluated 192 patients suspected of having ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, including 137 patients with a final diagnosis of the condition [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].

However, its presence unilaterally with light tapping of the nerve may suggest the presence of ulnar neuropathy.

Typically, motor nerve conduction studies are obtained, recording from either the hypothenar eminence or first dorsal interosseous muscles, with stimulation at the wrist, below the elbow, and above the elbow [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. The amplitude of the maximum compound muscle action potential in response to the distal site of stimulation at the wrist is a reasonable indication of the number of functioning motor axons, at least with acute or subacute presentations prior to reinnervation via collateral reinnervation. Focal slowing or conduction block across the elbow provides the most compelling evidence of a localized lesion (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67364" href="/z/d/graphic/67364.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>).

As an example, one such study reported that short-segment inching technique distinguished focal slowing in the retrocondylar groove from slowing in the humeroulnar arcade/cubital tunnel in 80 percent of cases based upon comparison with intraoperative electrodiagnostic studies [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p>Sensory nerve conduction studies that record the sensory nerve action potential from the ulnar-innervated fourth or fifth digits provide evidence of sensory axonal involvement. Segmental sensory studies can also be used to look for evidence of conduction slowing across the elbow.

In addition, we suggest surgical treatment for patients with ulnar neuropathy of less than six months' duration related to any cause who have moderate to severe continued or progressive signs and symptoms despite conservative measures.</p><p>In such cases, there should be convincing clinical and electrophysiologic evidence (eg, clear weakness, sensory loss, and significant axon loss on electrodiagnostic testing) of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.</p><p>The selection of patients for surgery is based on limited data from case series as there are no trials comparing surgical intervention with nonoperative conservative management or sham surgery for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H540566870"><span class="h3">Ulnar decompression for most patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest open in situ decompression over transposition for most patients who undergo surgery for severe or progressive ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Decompression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow may be more effective than transposition of the nerve [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. Additionally, some studies suggest that there is a higher complication rate with transposition, in part because simple decompression is a faster procedure that is technically less demanding [<a href="#rid61">61,73</a>].</p><p>In a network meta-analysis involving several open and endoscopic operative approaches to decompression or transposition, patient symptoms were likelier to improve with decompression techniques over transposition [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. For example, patients who underwent open in situ decompression with epicondylectomy were 13 percent more likely to improve compared with those who underwent subcutaneous transposition (95% CI 1.01-1.25). Overall, post-operative complications were uncommon, occurring in 3 percent of patients, but were least frequent among those who underwent in situ decompression. Additionally, open decompression was associated with the lowest risk of reoperation. </p><p>Decompression is usually performed by cutting the flexor carpi ulnaris aponeurosis (the humeroulnar arcade) to decompress the ulnar nerve [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. The procedure can be performed by open or endoscopic approaches [<a href="#rid72">72,74</a>]. Endoscopic decompression has some potential advantages over open decompression (smaller incision, earlier recovery); however, it is more costly and requires specific training. Small case series are encouraging, but a randomized controlled trial comparing the endoscopic approach with open decompression is required [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. Open decompression may also include medial epicondylectomy, which is performed by removing the humeral medial epicondyle after making an incision in the humeroulnar arcade [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. This has been the generally accepted approach in the setting of significant skeletal deformity or trauma.</p><p>Including epicondylectomy with open in situ decompression added modest benefits in efficacy and reduced complication rates compared with decompression alone but requires longer operative time and is a more complex procedure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H420765082"><span class="h3">Other surgical techniques</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transposition of the ulnar nerve</strong> – Transposition of the nerve at the elbow can be achieved by first slitting the humeroulnar arcade, mobilizing the ulnar nerve from the retrocondylar groove, and then moving the nerve anteriorly. This may be performed open or endoscopically with either submuscular or subcutaneous nerve transposition [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. As discussed above, this technique appears to be somewhat less efficacious than decompression techniques.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anterior interosseous-to-ulnar nerve transfer</strong> – In cases of severe ulnar nerve injury with substantial axonal loss and denervation of intrinsic hand muscles, there may be benefit of attempting to augment recovery with end-to-side anterior interosseous-to-ulnar nerve transfer [<a href="#rid77">77-79</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decompression at the ulnar tunnel</strong> – For the less common condition of ulnar neuropathy at the wrist, surgery consists of decompression of the ulnar tunnel (ie, Guyon's canal) by an experienced hand surgeon.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H146323857"><span class="h1">PROGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The natural history of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow is largely unknown, and the available data are sparse. This is not surprising given the complexity of case definition, lack of standardized outcomes, and variable electrodiagnostic approaches used. As an example, one retrospective study followed 22 patients who did not have surgical treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow involving 24 affected arms [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 13 months, the outcome was considered improved, unchanged, or worse for 12, 7, and 5 affected arms, respectively. The strength of this study is limited by methodologic issues that include small patient numbers and outcome assessment based entirely upon subjective reporting for approximately one-half of the subjects. The same investigators had previously shown poor correlation between subjective symptoms and electrodiagnostic criteria for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow [<a href="#rid81">81</a>].</p><p>Knowledge of the natural history of ulnar neuropathy is crucial, however, when considering the relative merits of various conservative treatments and surgery. Clinical experience suggests that patients with mild ulnar neuropathy, who typically present with intermittent sensory symptoms and electrodiagnostic features of conduction slowing across the elbow, often improve with conservative measures or remain stable over years. In all probability, many such patients do not seek medical attention for these symptoms.</p><p>Patients with persistent sensory loss and weakness without wasting often present acutely (sometimes with a preexisting history of mild intermittent symptoms) and commonly have features of both conduction block and slowing on electrodiagnostic testing. This group often improves over the course of three to six months, based upon clinical and electrodiagnostic measures.</p><p>Those with persistent symptoms of weakness and numbness beyond six months should be referred for consideration of surgical intervention (see <a class="local">'Surgery for refractory or severe symptoms'</a> above). Patients with severe weakness, wasting, and persistent sensory loss due to ulnar neuropathy at the elbow or wrist will typically show evidence of axonal injury on electrodiagnostic testing</p><p>The outcome with nonoperative management of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow may depend upon the clinical severity of the condition at presentation. This conclusion is suggested by the results of a prospective study of conservative treatment for 128 patients, including 43 with bilateral involvement [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 59 months, a successful outcome (defined as not having surgical treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow) for patients with mild, moderate, and severe presentations was reported for 89, 67, and 38 percent, respectively, and the differences between these groups were statistically significant. One weakness of this study was the limited use of electrodiagnostic tests, which were completed at baseline in only a portion of subjects and were not part of the longitudinal assessment. Moreover, these data may be most applicable to patients referred for surgery, who probably represent a more severe end of the clinical spectrum. Thus, the results may not be generalizable to all patients with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26073192"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Localization</strong> – The most common site of focal ulnar nerve entrapment or compression is at the elbow, followed by the wrist.
