         Chronic type B aortic dissection is defined as an intimal tear originating anywhere in the aorta distal to the innominate artery (zone 1 or greater  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef126986" href="/z/d/graphic/126986.html" rel="external">

         )) and which has been present for more than 90 days. Chronic type B aortic dissection is particularly challenging to manage, and the approach to treatment continues to evolve with advancements in endovascular techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to managing chronic type B aortic dissection is predominantly based upon clinical features. Patients with uncomplicated chronic type B aortic dissection are generally managed medically with periodic clinical and imaging surveillance [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Patients who develop complications (eg, aneurysmal degeneration, malperfusion) or have certain high-risk features require intervention. Some uncomplicated patients with clinical features that are predictive of the development of complications may benefit from earlier, rather than later, intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is the first-line treatment when anatomically feasible in patients without connective tissue disorders. For patients who are not candidates for endovascular repair, open surgical repair provides a durable option but is associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of chronic type B aortic dissection is reviewed. The clinical features and diagnosis of aortic dissection and the management of acute aortic dissection are discussed separately. (See

         Aortic dissection
         <strong>
         </strong>
         is defined as a tear in the innermost layer of the aortic wall (intima) that results in high-pressure flow of blood between the layers of the aorta, creating a true and false lumen. Aortic dissection is classified based upon the anatomic location of the entry tear (type A, type B), the clinical severity of the dissection (uncomplicated, complicated, high-risk features), and the duration of symptoms (hyperacute, acute, subacute, chronic), all of which impact the type and timing of treatment. Chronic type B aortic dissection involves an intimal tear that originates anywhere in the aorta distal to the innominate artery (zone 1 or greater  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef126986" href="/z/d/graphic/126986.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The etiology of aortic dissection can be sporadic (eg, hypertension, infection/inflammatory), genetically mediated (eg, Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos, Loeys-Dietz, bicuspid aortic valve, Turners), or traumatic (eg, blunt aortic injury, iatrogenic). (See

          Anatomic
         </strong>
         – The DeBakey and the Stanford aortic dissection classification systems  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100115" href="/z/d/graphic/100115.html" rel="external">
          figure 2

         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Both are relatively nonspecific regarding the precise extent of the dissection and are ambiguous regarding the involvement of the aortic arch. A task force commissioned by the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and Society for Thoracic Surgery (STS) has addressed these issues with a classification system that distinguishes type A from B by entry point  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef126986" href="/z/d/graphic/126986.html" rel="external">

         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Type A aortic dissection is classified as an entry tear in zone 0, and the distal extent can range from zone 1 to 12. Type B aortic dissection has an entry tear in zone ≥1, and the proximal and distal extent are noted. Approximately two-thirds of acute aortic dissections present as type A, and one-third are type B [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

          Clinical severity
         </strong>
         – The clinical severity of aortic dissection is described as complicated, uncomplicated, or dissection with high-risk features. Complicated type B aortic dissections have evidence of rupture and/or clinical malperfusion  (

         ). High-risk features include refractory or recurrent pain (&gt;12 hours), refractory hypertension (&gt;3 classes of antihypertensive medications at maximum doses), and radiographic features such as entry tear on lesser curvature, aortic diameter &gt;4 cm, false lumen &gt;2.2 cm, bloody pleural effusion, and radiographic-only malperfusion. Patients without rupture, clinical malperfusion, or high-risk features are considered uncomplicated [

         From the time of its occurrence, aortic dissection transitions from an acute to chronic state as the aorta remodels [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. This transition is complex and is described in terms of the dissection flap architecture, false lumen patency or thrombosis, and degree and rate of aortic expansion. The natural history aortic remodeling has implications on the optimal timing for treatment and clinical outcomes of thoracic endovascular aortic repair [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In an analysis from the VIRTUE Registry, differences in aortic remodeling were observed when comparing acute and chronic type B aortic dissections. Aortic morphology and plasticity were similar for various time points during the acute period [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The intimal flap/septum and aorta are thin and fragile in the acute period, and the risk for retrograde type A dissection is increased during endovascular repair; however, because the intimal flap/septum is more soft/flexible, thoracic endovascular aortic repair more fully expands the true lumen compared with chronic type B aortic dissection.

         Several studies have sought to identify risk factors associated with the need for intervention or adverse outcomes in patients with type B aortic dissection. In one review of 294 patients with an average follow-up of 3.7 years, predictors of intervention and mortality included age &gt;60 years, aortic diameter &gt;4.4 cm on presentation, and false lumen diameter in the proximal descending aorta &gt;2.2 cm [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. In a smaller review of 104 patients with a mean follow-up of 87.6 months, 46 had one or more dissection-related events [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The actuarial event-free rate for any dissection-related event was 95, 75, 53, and 13 at 1, 5, 10, and 20 years, respectively. Initial aortic diameter ≥4 cm and blood flow in the false lumen were significant risk factors for dissection-related events in univariate and multivariate analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review identified several predictors of aortic expansion in patients with uncomplicated type B aortic dissection. Predictors were separated into patient characteristics and radiographic signs [

         </span>
         Younger age at presentation was a clinical predictor of aortic expansion. Patient age &lt;60 years was significantly associated with increasing aortic diameter, which was thought to be due to a less rigid aortic wall, making the aorta more prone to dilation in younger patients. Other patient characteristics associated with increased aortic expansion rates were being a White person, Marfan syndrome, and heart rate &gt;60 beats/minute.

         Type B aortic dissection is primarily managed based upon the clinical severity of disease. Repair of chronic type B aortic dissection is generally reserved for those who progress from uncomplicated to complicated disease. For most patients with uncomplicated chronic type B aortic dissection, we suggest watchful waiting and ongoing medical treatment, rather than intervention. However, patients with uncomplicated type B aortic dissection and high-risk features for aortic expansion or other dissection-related events may benefit from early endovascular repair rather than awaiting the development of complications.

         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. For patients who have survived the acute period, chronic type B aortic dissection is managed similarly, with best medical therapy focused on chronic long-term management of blood pressure and heart rate. Beta-blockers  (

         ) reduce the contractility and HR to effectively reduce the blood pressure and aortic wall stress. In addition to beta-blockers, observational studies suggest that aortic expansion is reduced and survival is improved for patients with chronic type B aortic dissection who receive calcium channel blockers for maintenance therapy [

         Unfortunately, many patients with chronic type B aortic dissection do not adhere to their prescribed anti-impulse medications. In a small review of 47 patients, adherence was reported as "high" in 43 percent, "moderate" in 21 percent, and "low" in 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19

          Rupture or impending rupture
         </strong>
         – As with degenerative (true) aortic aneurysms, the risk of rupture increases with increasing aortic diameter. In a review of 571 patients with type B aortic dissection, the incidence of rupture was 0, 3.3, 15.3, 18.8, and 28.6 percent for aortic diameters of 4 to 4.4, 4.5 to 4.9, 5 to 5.4, 5.5 to 5.9, and 6 to 6.4 cm, respectively [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35

         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. However, the mortality associated with rupture is high, and therefore it is important to recognize signs of impending rupture and act quickly to treat these patients. Increases in periaortic hematoma and hemorrhagic pleural effusions in two subsequent CT exams during medical expectant management are findings suggestive of impending rupture [

          14

         Repair of the thoracic aorta can be accomplished using traditional open surgical techniques, or with thoracic aortic endovascular repair. For those with appropriate indications for repair (no connective tissue disorder), thoracic endovascular aortic repair is the first-line treatment, when anatomically feasible [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,13,14,23,24,37,38
         </a>
         ]. For patients who are not candidates for endovascular repair, open surgery provides a durable repair, but is associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Dissection repair techniques'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, open surgical repair was the "gold standard" for repair of chronic type B aortic dissection. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair was subsequently adapted to the treatment of aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes following the initial approval of stent-grafts in 2005 for the treatment for thoracic aortic aneurysms. Observational studies confirmed the feasibility, safety, and improved perioperative outcomes for endovascular repair of type B aortic dissection compared with open repair, similar to those for repair of abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,39
         </a>
         ]. While long-term survival rates are similar, long-term durability remains inferior for endovascular repair [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,24,27,33,40
         </a>
         ]. Although there are no randomized trials comparing open surgical repair with thoracic endovascular aortic repair for chronic type B aortic dissection, a randomized trial comparing outcomes for early endovascular versus best medical therapy for treatment of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection provides some indirect support for an endovascular approach for chronic type B dissection [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30
         </a>
         ]. In agreement with guidelines for thoracic aortic disease and an interdisciplinary expert consensus on the management of type B aortic dissection, we suggest endovascular repair in anatomically suitable patients who do not have a connective tissue disorder [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,14
         </a>
         ]. This recommendation places higher value on reducing early morbidity and mortality and less on the need for long-term surveillance and potential need for reintervention with endovascular repair. Open surgical repair remains the preferred approach for patients with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos, or Loeys-Dietz syndrome, given the poor results of endovascular repair in this setting [

        </p>
        <p>
         Endovascular repair is especially advantageous to patients with disease limited to the descending thoracic aorta because it avoids the morbidity of a thoracotomy incision and aortic cross-clamping required with open surgical repair. The endovascular approach also provides an opportunity to treat patients who would otherwise not be candidates for repair, such as older or frail patients. (See

Patients are at increased risk if extensive coverage or replacement of the aorta is planned, especially the T8 to L1 region. The artery of Adamkiewicz originates from this area in 75 percent of individuals  (

         The main objective of endovascular repair for chronic type B aortic dissection is to seal the primary entry tear to exclude flow into the false lumen, which restores the true lumen pressure and re-expands the true lumen  (

         ]. Critics of endovascular repair in the chronic setting argue that a thickened aortic septum and persistent false lumen pressurization from uncovered distal fenestrations impact the durability and success of thoracic endovascular aortic repair. However, several studies have reported successful false lumen thrombosis, depressurization, aortic remodeling, and sac shrinkage in the majority of patients [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68-72

          Vascular access
         </strong>
         – A significant calcium burden and/or tortuosity of the iliac arteries can prevent passage of the device or delivery sheath from the common femoral artery. In these cases, a conduit should be created by suturing a 10 mm Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene graft to the common iliac artery via a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal incision. If the common iliac arteries are not suitable, a conduit to the infrarenal aorta is another option. Following completion of the repair, the conduit can be ligated near the origin of the anastomosis, leaving a small stump, or the conduit can be used as an iliofemoral bypass to improve the inflow in cases of severe external iliac stenosis.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         An "endoconduit" for delivery of the device can also be created using endovascular methods such as the "pave and crack" technique, which involves angioplasty and controlled rupture of the iliac vessels followed by relining with covered stents. A novel technique for pretreatment of calcified vascular access vessels is using intravascular lithotripsy; however, further studies are needed to evaluate the short- and long-term results of this approach.

          Intravascular ultrasound
         </strong>
         – Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is recommended during endovascular repair of chronic type B aortic dissection. IVUS can confirm wire access within the true lumen and can help identify the location of the primary entry tear and fenestrations throughout the aorta, while also monitoring for dynamic occlusions of branch vessels in real time. IVUS can also be used to accurately measure the length of the proximal landing zone (zone 1 to 3  (

          Proximal and distal extent and landing zones
         </strong>
         – Graft-wall apposition, particularly in the proximal landing zone, is critical to prevent type 1 endoleak or device migration. A minimum of 2 cm is required at the proximal and distal landing zone to achieve an adequate seal. Because the proximal entry tear in type B aortic dissection is often just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, coverage of the left subclavian is often necessary to provide an adequate length landing zone to achieve an adequate seal. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although the primary objective of endovascular repair is to cover the proximal entry tear, the extent of distal coverage is important as well. Patients with chronic type B aortic dissection can have multiple fenestrations or reentry tears that can continue to pressurize the false lumen even after the proximal entry tear is covered [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. In general, all major distal fenestrations should also be covered, and to achieve this goal, extension of the graft to the level of the celiac artery may be necessary. Firm apposition of the graft to the aorta is rarely achieved distally in chronic type B aortic dissection.

          Device and diameter

         – The graft diameter is selected based on the diameter of the healthy aorta immediately proximal to the primary entry tear. Measurements can be obtained using preoperative CT scan and should be confirmed intraoperatively with IVUS. In contrast to graft sizing for degenerative (true) aneurysmal disease, which over-sizes the graft 10 to 20 percent, for repair of thoracic aortic dissection, care should be taken to limit graft oversizing to no more than 10 percent to avoid potential retrograde type A aortic dissection.

          Access-related complications
         </strong>
         – Access-related complications include hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, infection, and acute thrombosis causing limb ischemia. Access-related complications occur most often during removal of the sheath or use of closure devices but can also occur during initial vascular access. The use of ultrasound guidance and proper technique can decrease the incidence of access-related complications. A significant change in blood pressure following sheath removal, although potentially related to extremity reperfusion, should be attributed to bleeding until proven otherwise, and prior to sheath removal, anesthesia personnel should be alerted to closely monitor hemodynamics.

Depending on the extent of disease, open surgical repair may require circulatory arrest, left heart bypass, and/or deep hypothermia. Compared with thoracic endovascular aortic repair, open surgical repair has a significantly increased risk for stroke, spinal cord ischemia, and systemic complications, with longer intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay [

         )) with care to identify and preserve the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves. Careful dissection separating the descending thoracic aorta from the esophagus is critical to prevent aorto-esophageal fistula. An aortic clamp is placed proximally, and a second mid-descending aortic clamp is placed at the sixth or eighth intercostal space. The aorta is opened, and an appropriately sized woven Dacron graft is sewn into place proximally with running 3-0 polypropylene suture. The anastomosis is inspected for hemostasis, and any bleeding is reinforced with pledgeted sutures. After the proximal anastomosis is completed, the mid-descending aortic clamp is moved distally to the infrarenal aorta. The remainder of the aorta is opened, back bleeding is controlled, and the visceral and renal vessels are perfused. The distal thoracic intercostal arteries are reimplanted, and the graft is passed through the aortic hiatus into the abdomen.

Often the left renal artery cannot be included and is anastomosed separately to the graft as a Carrell patch or using a bypass graft. Once the visceral anastomoses are completed, the patient is placed in Trendelenburg position, the graft is flushed proximally, and the clamp is released and moved distal to the next visceral anastomoses. In patients with connective tissue disorders who are prone to patch aneurysm degradation, individual anastomoses to each of the visceral vessels and renal arteries are performed using a multibranched graft.

         The hybrid approach combines open surgical and endovascular techniques to reduce the extent of repair with the positive effects of lowering the morbidity of the procedure and improving overall outcomes [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78
         </a>
         ]. It typically involves open surgical debranching the aortic arch vessels to obtain an adequate landing zone for thoracic endovascular aortic repair, or open surgical debranching the visceral and/or renal vessels. The hybrid approach is especially useful for high-risk patients. Another advantage of the hybrid approach is the ability to stage the repair, which decreases overall morbidity, including spinal cord injury, as well as reducing perioperative mortality [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ]. In one review, perioperative mortality was 12.5 percent, and the incidence of spinal cord injury was 8.3 percent in patients who underwent hybrid endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysm. There was no mortality difference in patients who required a larger number of visceral vessel bypasses; however, patients requiring only one or two vessel bypasses had a shorter length of stay.

         Hybrid arch procedures are performed for patients with inadequate proximal landing zones for thoracic endovascular aortic repair. All commercially available thoracic endovascular devices require a minimum of 2 cm of proximal seal zone. If coverage of an arch branch is necessary, then an open surgical debranching procedure is necessary.

         The most common hybrid approach involves coverage of zone 2 (ie, just distal to the left common carotid artery  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef126986" href="/z/d/graphic/126986.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         )) and involving the origin of the left subclavian artery. If the proximal extent of the endovascular repair requires coverage of the left subclavian artery, the Society for Vascular Surgery suggests preoperative extremity revascularization [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80
         </a>
         ]. Debranching the left subclavian artery is accomplished by a left common carotid artery to left subclavian artery bypass or a left subclavian artery to common carotid artery transposition. A prosthetic graft is the preferred conduit when performing a carotid-subclavian bypass. Patency rates are significantly higher for grafts compared with autologous vein (94 versus 58 percent at five years in one review [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81
         </a>
         ]). Similar results were reported in a later review [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82
         </a>
         ]. When planning a transposition, it is important to screen the patient for previous coronary artery bypass graft; a prior left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending bypass is an absolute contraindication to a transposition. In this scenario, a carotid-subclavian artery bypass is performed, ensuring that the subclavian clamp is placed distal to the LIMA during the creation of the distal anastomosis to allow continued coronary perfusion.

         )) involves coverage of both the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery, and a debranching procedure involves a right common carotid artery to left common carotid artery bypass, typically tunneled retropharyngeal, combined with a left common carotid artery to left subclavian artery bypass or transposition. The origins of the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery should be ligated surgically or plugged using an endovascular device (eg, Amplatzer) to prevent type 2 endoleak after placement of the stent-graft.

A midline laparotomy incision is the preferred approach for visceral debranching, as it allows access to the four visceral vessels. An alternative is a left retroperitoneal approach, especially in the case of the "hostile abdomen"; however, it may be difficult to access the right renal artery.

         The availability of an adequate inflow vessel, commonly the distal infrarenal aorta or common iliac artery, should be confirmed prior to visceral debranching. The external iliac artery is avoided, as this artery is typically diseased or small.

          Approach to management
         </strong>
         – The approach to management of chronic type B aortic dissection depends on the clinical severity of the dissection (uncomplicated, complicated, high-risk features). (See

         <strong>
          Uncomplicated dissection
         </strong>
         – Patients with uncomplicated chronic type B aortic dissection are generally managed medically with periodic clinical and imaging surveillance, and monitoring for signs of progression to high-risk features. Medical management includes ongoing control of heart rate and blood pressure (ie, anti-impulse therapy) with a goal heart rate &lt;60 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure &lt;120 mmHg. Beta-blockers are continued as maintenance therapy in the chronic setting. The addition of calcium channel blockers in the chronic setting helps reduce aortic expansion and has been associated with a survival benefit. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Uncomplicated dissection'
         </a>
         above.)

         Our approach to intervention for uncomplicated disease is as follows:

          Patients without high-risk features

         – For patients without high-risk features, we suggest ongoing medical management, rather than intervention (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). However, the patient and clinician may reasonably choose endovascular intervention in addition to ongoing medical therapy to prevent malperfusion or other aortic complications, placing more value on potentially improved aortic outcomes in the long term over potential perioperative complications (eg, stroke, spinal cord ischemia). Factors that may influence decision-making include the age of the patient, life expectancy, medical risk, and the presence of certain anatomic factors that may increase the risk for future aortic events.

         ). High-risk features include intractable or refractory pain &gt;12 hours, refractory hypertension (&gt;3 classes of antihypertensive medications at maximum doses), and radiographic features such as entry tear on lesser curvature, aortic diameter &gt;4 cm, false lumen &gt;2.2 cm, bloody pleural effusion, and radiographic-only malperfusion.

          Complicated dissection
         </strong>
         – For patients with complicated chronic type B aortic dissection, which includes progression to clinically relevant malperfusion and/or rupture, repair is required. Nearly two-thirds of patients with chronic type B aortic dissection will develop complications. The frequency of these complications differs compared with acute type B aortic dissection, with aneurysmal degeneration being most common. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intervention for complicated disease'

          Type of repair
         </strong>
         – For patients with chronic type B aortic dissection (no connective tissue disorder) with indications for intervention and suitable anatomy, we suggest endovascular repair, rather than open surgical repair (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is associated with reduced perioperative mortality with lower rates of major perioperative complications (eg, stroke, spinal cord ischemia, systemic complications) compared with open repair; however, reintervention rates are higher for endovascular compared with open surgical repair. For good-risk surgical patients (normal renal and pulmonary function) treated at a high-volume center, open surgery provides a more durable repair. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Endovascular versus open repair'

         <strong>
          Prevention of spinal cord ischemia
         </strong>
         – For patients who undergo repair, measures should be taken to decrease the risk of spinal cord ischemia associated with thoracic aortic repair. A lumbar drain is used in all patients undergoing open surgical repair and for high-risk patients undergoing thoracic endovascular repair, which includes those with planned extensive endograft coverage of the distal thoracic aorta (T8 to L1), previous aortic surgery, pre-existing internal iliac occlusions, and/or planned coverage of the left subclavian artery without revascularization.
