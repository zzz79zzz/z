         Both insufficient and excessive iodine intake can result in thyroid disease. The term "iodine deficiency disorders" refers to all of the consequences of iodine deficiency, which depend on its severity and the age of the affected subject [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. When severe iodine deficiency occurs during pregnancy, it is associated with fetal hypothyroidism, mental impairment, and increased neonatal and infant mortality. In adults, iodine-induced hypothyroidism is rare, while the most common manifestation is goiter that progresses to nodular goiter and eventually to thyroid autonomy and hyperthyroidism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Iodine is an essential component of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), and it must be provided in the diet. Inadequate iodine intake leads to inadequate thyroid hormone production, and all the consequences of iodine deficiency stem from the associated hypothyroidism.
        </p>
        <p>
         In resource-limited countries, iodine deficiency has been identified as one of the modifiable factors that have an adverse effect on child development [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Iodide is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis. In order for the thyroid gland to synthesize adequate amounts of T4, approximately 52 mcg of iodide must be taken up daily by the thyroid gland. Severe iodine deficiency develops when iodide intake is chronically &lt;20 mcg/day. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7837.html" rel="external">
          "Thyroid hormone synthesis and physiology", section on 'Thyroid hormone biosynthesis'

        <p>
         Iodine can be obtained by consumption of foods that naturally contain it (fish, seafood, kelp, some drinking water, and vegetables grown in iodine-sufficient soil) or to which it is added (iodized table salt or foods enriched with iodine). Cow's milk is a source of iodine owing to iodine in cattle feed and the use of iodophor udder cleansers in the dairy industry. Sea salt naturally contains only a small amount of iodine. Dietary iodine is absorbed as iodide and rapidly distributed in the extracellular fluid, which also contains iodide released from the thyroid and by extrathyroidal deiodination of the iodothyronines. Iodide leaves this pool by transport into the thyroid and excretion into the urine.

         The iodine requirements are higher in pregnant women due to an increase in maternal T4 production required to maintain maternal euthyroidism. Severe maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy results in a reduction in maternal T4 production, inadequate placental transfer of maternal T4, and consequent fetal hypothyroidism with impairment of neurologic development.

         A system for classifying iodine deficiency and sufficiency has been developed based upon the median urinary iodine concentration in a population  (

         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The most usual survey group is school-age children, but their nutrition must reflect that of the community in order for the data to be meaningful [

         A median average daily iodine intake of 150 mcg corresponds to a median urinary iodine concentration of 100 mcg/L [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Pregnant women require special attention because their renal threshold for iodine is lower, dietary salt (including iodized salt) is often restricted, and the needs of the fetus and the consequences of iodine deficiency to the fetus are greater [

         <a href="#rid7">
          7,11
         </a>
         ]. The number of countries with adequate iodine intake has nearly doubled over the past 20 years from 67 in 2003 to 118 in 2020 [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Although there has been steady progress in many regions (Europe, Asia, Western Pacific), there has been less progress in Africa [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         European countries lacking specific iodine prophylaxis programs are also mildly iodine deficient [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. In an Italian survey of 26,913 school-aged children, urinary iodine was lower than 100 and 50 mcg/L in 64.3 and 34.9 percent of samples, respectively [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Median urinary iodine in nonurban areas was significantly lower than in urban areas (69 versus 79 mcg/L). There were no differences in urinary iodine excretion among children residing in lowland, coastal mountainous hilly, and mountainous hilly areas.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other countries appear to have sustainable iodine sufficiency at the present time: the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Bhutan, Peru, Panama, Macedonia, and Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
         Iodine intake in the United States has decreased slightly since 2007, with a median urinary iodine excretion of 144 mcg/L (1.1 micromol/L) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Among women of reproductive age, the median urinary iodine excretion was 129 mcg/L, with 37 percent of women having levels &lt;100 mcg/L (consistent with mild iodine deficiency). Iodine nutrition in the United States is mainly achieved by silent iodine prophylaxis, a natural increase in iodine intake because of higher consumption of iodine-rich products (eg, industrially prepared dairy products) associated with socioeconomic development [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The decline in iodine intake over the last decade may be related to a reduction in the iodine content of dairy products, removal of iodate dough conditioners in commercially produced bread, and increasing use of noniodized salt by the food industry [
         <a href="#rid7">

          —
         </span>
         Goiter is the most obvious manifestation of iodine deficiency. Low iodine intake leads to reduced T4 and T3 production, which results in increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion in an attempt to restore T4 and T3 production to normal. TSH also stimulates thyroid growth; thus, goiter occurs as part of the compensatory response to iodine deficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goiter is initially diffuse but eventually becomes nodular because the cells in some thyroid follicles proliferate more than others, and over time, nodules can enlarge and undergo cystic degeneration, hemorrhage, and calcification. Therefore, in regions of iodine deficiency, children and adolescents generally have diffuse goiters, while adults who lived in conditions of longstanding iodine deficiency have nodular goiter. Iodine deficiency favoring thyroid follicular cell replication also increases the chance of mutations in the TSH receptor gene that may lead to constitutive activation of the receptor and TSH-independent growth and function [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Hyperthyroidism'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Goiter has traditionally been assessed by palpation, particularly in field studies. In the last two decades, ultrasonography, which allows precise estimation of thyroid volume, has become the preferred method of assessment. In regions of iodine deficiency, the median thyroid volume at any age is considerably larger than that in regions of iodine sufficiency. For people living in iodine-sufficient regions, thyroid volume measurements standardized for age, sex, and body size are now available [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The volume in subjects living in the United States is smaller than that in Europe, many regions of which have a lower iodine intake than in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         For many individuals, iodine-deficiency goiter is only a cosmetic problem. In some, however, particularly older adults, the goiter may be large enough to cause compression of the trachea or esophagus or delay recognition of coexisting thyroid cancer. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7835.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults", section on 'Obstructive symptoms'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The role of iodine intake in thyroid cancer is still controversial [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of thyroid cancer is increased in the last decades; however, this increase does not appear to be influenced by the usual range of iodine intake from dietary sources, although increases in iodine intake may change the distribution of subtypes of thyroid cancer [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Correction of iodine deficiency in many countries has shown an increase in papillary thyroid cancer over anaplastic and follicular thyroid cancer. Thus, by reducing these more aggressive subtypes of thyroid cancer, iodine prophylaxis programs may be contributing to the decrease in thyroid cancer mortality [

         Iodine deficiency increases the incidence of diffuse and nodular goiter. Over time, autonomous growth and function may ensue, resulting in toxic goiter and hyperthyroidism if iodine deficiency is not extremely severe. In regions of mild to moderate iodine deficiency, toxic multinodular goiter is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in older adults [

For the developing fetus or infant, untreated maternal hypothyroidism due to severe iodine deficiency is a catastrophe because thyroid hormone is essential for normal maturation of the central nervous system, particularly its myelination. For the first 12 weeks of gestation, the fetus is completely dependent upon maternal T4. During the 10

         Approximately 90 percent or more of ingested iodine eventually appears in the urine.

As a result, iodine nutrition is often defined by the urinary iodine concentration in randomly collected urine samples. Mild iodine deficiency is defined as a median urinary iodine concentration of 50 to 99 mcg/L, moderate deficiency as 20 to 49 mcg/L, and severe deficiency as &lt;20 mcg/L  (

         Thyroid size is a sensitive marker for iodine deficiency because goiter, although not the most severe consequence of iodine deficiency, is the most clinically evident.

         The serum thyroglobulin concentration is a sensitive measure of thyroid activity and hyperplasia. In iodine-deficient infants and children, serum thyroglobulin concentrations are high more often than are serum TSH concentrations. Although a nonspecific test (since any type of thyroid stimulation or injury raises the serum thyroglobulin concentration), the values correlate well with the severity of iodine deficiency. Thyroglobulin has also been shown to be a sensitive measure of excess iodine intake in school-age children [

         Thyroid radioiodine uptake is increased in iodine deficiency because of both thyroid stimulation and the low iodine pool size, but it is not a practical field test. Serum T4, T3, and TSH concentrations are within their respective normal ranges in most children and adults with iodine deficiency; thus, these tests are not sufficiently sensitive for diagnosis of the disorder.

         Iodine deficiency is a global public health problem and, in combating it, emphasis should be placed on diagnosis and correction at the level of the community rather than the individual. Achieving sufficient iodine nutrition in the population would eliminate the need for specific supplementation during pregnancy and lactation. (See

          Iodization of salt

          —
         </span>
         Iodization of salt is the preferred method of increasing iodine intake in a community. Salt iodination is legally mandated in many countries. Salt is a dietary necessity and often the only one that communities cannot provide for themselves. Adding iodine during the packaging or processing of salt is an efficient means for distributing iodine on a mass basis. It is technically easy (and can even be done manually), and the cost is low, although the accompanying changes in salt processing may increase the price to the consumer. The usual "dose" is between 10 and 50 mg of iodine/kg salt (sodium chloride) as potassium iodide or iodate.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal amount to be added for a particular country or region can be calculated from the daily per capita salt consumption, the amount of iodine consumed from other sources, and any losses of iodine between production and consumption. Potassium iodide is added in the United States, Canada, and many countries in Western Europe. However, in hot tropical climates or suboptimal conditions of purity or storage, potassium iodate is preferred over potassium iodide because it is more stable. In Finland, iodization of animal feed resulted in a five- to sevenfold increase in the average individual's iodine intake [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The success of salt iodization programs relates to sources of salt within a country. Some countries, such as Congo, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe, import all their salt, making control of iodization fairly simple. In other countries with numerous scattered salt deposits and a complex distribution system, implementation of salt iodization has been more difficult. A determined international effort towards eliminating iodine deficiency by the year 2005 has resulted in major progress, with approximately 70 percent of households worldwide using adequately iodized salt. In Denmark, the use of iodized salt resulted in a 6 and 14 percent reduction in thyroid gland volume in individuals from areas of mild or moderate iodine deficiency, respectively [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58

         Alternatives are needed when salt iodization is impractical or delayed. Effective options are iodized oil (Lipiodol), iodized water, and iodine tablets or drops. Water is an occasional iodization vehicle because it is a daily necessity like salt. The technology can be as simple as adding a few drops of iodine to standing drinking water. Addition of molecular iodine (but not iodide or iodate) carries the additional benefit of sterilizing the water.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alternative methods of food iodine enrichment are currently under study. Iodine fortification of foods, beverages, condiments, or seasonings other than salt significantly increases urinary iodine concentrations [

          59

         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ] or other vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes. In one study, biofortification of vegetables with iodine increased urinary iodine concentration and, together with the habitual use of iodized salt, improved the iodine nutritional status of the study participants [

         every two to four weeks and daily administration of tablets containing from 100 to 300 mcg potassium iodide.

         Lipiodol, developed as a radiographic contrast agent, contains 480 mg iodine/mL. A single oral dose of 0.5 to 1 mL provides an adequate amount of iodine for six months to one year; intramuscular administration of the same dose provides an adequate amount for two to three years [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62

         ]. Iodized oil is more expensive than salt iodization and requires direct administration to each person. If given intramuscularly, it requires skilled administration and has a risk of infection if improper technique is used. Its main advantage is that it can be implemented promptly. It has been especially valuable for women of childbearing age and children in regions of severe iodine deficiency, such as Africa.

         Excessive iodine ingestion during pregnancy may also have adverse effects on fetal thyroid function. Sudden exposure to excess serum iodide inhibits organification of iodide, thereby diminishing hormone biosynthesis; this phenomenon is called the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. The fetal thyroid gland is particularly susceptible to the inhibitory effects of excess iodine during the third trimester, which can result in a prolonged inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis, an increase in TSH, and fetal goiter.

          Iodine requirements
         </strong>
         – Iodide is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis. Iodine can be obtained by consumption of foods that naturally contain it (fish, seafood, kelp, dairy products, some drinking water, and vegetables grown in iodine-sufficient soil) or to which it is added (table salt). (See
         <a class="local">

         The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a daily intake of iodine of 90 mcg for infants and children up to 5 years, 120 mcg for children 6 to 12 years, 150 mcg for children ≥12 years and adults, and 250 mcg during pregnancy and lactation. (See

          Classification of iodine status

         – A system for classifying iodine deficiency and sufficiency has been developed based upon the median urinary iodine concentration in a population  (

          table 1

         ). Pregnant women need special attention because their renal threshold for iodine is lower, the needs of the fetus are greater, and dietary salt (including iodized salt) is often restricted. In pregnant women, urinary iodine concentrations of 150 to 249 mcg/L are considered adequate. (See

          Impact of iodine supplementation
         </strong>
         – Iodine supplementation to severely iodine-deficient women prior to conception or during early pregnancy is associated with substantially better neurologic and developmental outcomes in children. There are insufficient good-quality data evaluating the effects of iodine supplementation on child development or other long-term outcomes in pregnant women with mild to moderate iodine deficiency.

         <strong>
          Assessment of iodine nutrition
         </strong>
         – Iodine nutrition at the community level can be assessed by measurements of urinary iodine, thyroid size, thyroglobulin, and neonatal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). In practice, urinary iodine is most often used to determine iodine nutrition  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74914" href="/z/d/graphic/74914.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The urinary iodine concentration indicates current iodine nutrition, while thyroid size and the serum thyroglobulin concentration reflect iodine nutrition over a period of months or years. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Prophylaxis and treatment
         </strong>
         – Iodine deficiency is a global public health problem and, in combating it, emphasis should be placed on diagnosis and correction at the level of the community rather than the individual. Iodization of salt is the preferred method of increasing iodine intake in a community. The usual amount is between 10 and 50 mg of iodine/kg salt (sodium chloride) as potassium iodide or iodate. Alternatives for when salt iodization is impractical or delayed include iodized oil (Lipiodol), iodized water, and iodine tablets or drops. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Iodine nutrition during pregnancy
         </strong>
         – Consuming an adequate amount of iodine during pregnancy is important for fetal development. The WHO recommends 250 mcg of iodine daily during pregnancy and lactation, whereas the National Academy of Medicine recommends 220 mcg during pregnancy and 290 mcg during lactation. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommends 150 mcg of iodine (in the form of potassium iodide) daily during pregnancy and lactation. This is the dose included in the majority of prenatal vitamins marketed in the United States, but expectant mothers should verify that the particular product being used actually contains iodine. (See
