This topic will discuss fertility treatment for individuals chronically infected with HIV or hepatitis C virus, as these individuals can transmit the infection to an uninfected partner during the process of conception. Counseling these couples about the safest methods for avoiding viral transmission to their partner involves discussion of adoption, child-free living, and use of donor sperm, in addition to natural or assisted conception with their own gametes.</p><p>Recommendations for reducing the risk of viral transmission during fertility treatment have been published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The basic principles underlying these recommendations are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduce viral load in the infected partner(s).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduce the noninfected partner's exposure and susceptibility to the infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Discuss the available scientific evidence and risk reduction strategies with both the patient and partner to provide a basis for informed consent.</p><p></p><p>We are not able to make an absolute recommendation for the best procedure for helping serodiscordant couples conceive because there are inadequate data to prove that any technique is significantly safer than any other and choice of treatment is based upon available resources and results of standard infertility tests, which are also part of the decision-making process. We evaluate and treat these patients on a case-by-case basis, with the understanding that safer conception services are a critical component to the care of HIV-affected couples [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">INFORMED CONSENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis; purpose of treatment; risks, benefits, alternatives to the suggested treatment; and the risks of no treatment must be discussed and documented.</p><p>Risks include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The transmission to partner (new virus or different strains of virus)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transmission to the child</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Side effects of infertility treatment on the underlying disease process</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complications that pregnancy may cause to the patient's condition</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychosocial implications of the child acquiring the infection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The parent(s) becoming unable to care for the child due to parental illness/death [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]</p><p></p><p>Benefits of assisted reproduction technology include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreasing the risk of transmission to the partner compared with unprotected intercourse</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreasing the possibility that the child will be infected</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early intervention with prenatal/intrapartum treatment that can reduce transmission to the child</p><p></p><p>Finally, alternatives such as adoption, not having children, and donor sperm if the female is unaffected or surrogacy if the female is affected should be discussed [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">HIV INFECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Increased longevity and quality of life have led HIV-infected individuals to think about long-term plans, such as childbearing. In a group of serodiscordant (male HIV-infected) opposite-sex couples, 70 percent of the couples expressed a desire to have children in the future if their fertility treatment was successful [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Predictors of couples' desires for additional children if fertility treatment was successful were: younger age, shorter relationship duration, being childless currently, and having the male partner diagnosis of HIV known prior to when the couple met. Thus, an understanding of overall fertility desires in this patient population is important, in combination with a discussion of various methods by which pregnancy can be achieved.</p><p>Men and women living with HIV may seek assistance in pregnancy planning so they can avoid unprotected intercourse with an uninfected partner when the couple is attempting to conceive. One survey reported that 12 percent of HIV serodiscordant couples concerned about transmission of HIV to their partner would still be willing to have unprotected timed intercourse if no other alternatives existed for achieving pregnancy [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Ideally, these couples should have an alternative to unprotected intercourse because even partners with undetectable plasma HIV levels can transmit HIV in semen, female genital secretions, and rectal secretions [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. However, the risk of transmission appears to be very low when the HIV-infected partner is receiving maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Natural conception in serodiscordant couples'</a> below.)</p><p>Factors affecting the risk and rate of male to female and female to male HIV transmission during sexual intercourse are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3724.html" rel="external">"The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents", section on 'Viral transmission'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Initial evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Managing HIV-infected patients with childbearing desires involves a multidisciplinary approach, ideally including maternal-fetal medicine specialists, HIV/AIDS specialists, neonatologists, pediatricians, psychiatrists, social workers, and reproductive endocrinologists. A team of providers knowledgeable in this area should review each case, including the couple's ability to tolerate the fertility evaluation, treatment, and pregnancy.</p><p>Access to an institution that can care for pregnant patients with HIV and the child delivered under these circumstances is also a prerequisite to beginning fertility treatment. In addition, the program's staff should have training in how to process specimens and separate freezing facilities for gametes/embryos from HIV-infected clients. While the 2015 American Society for Reproductive Medicine committee opinion found "no ethical reason(s) to withhold fertility services," access to assisted reproductive technology services for HIV-infected individuals remains variable and appears to differ based on who makes the inquiry [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In a survey of 140 United States infertility clinics, when a clinician inquired about assisted reproductive technology services for an HIV-infected individual, 63 percent of clinics offered services to a couple with an HIV-infected man and HIV-uninfected woman; however, when the caller was identified as a patient, only 40 percent offered services [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Of the clinics not providing services to patient callers, only half (51 percent) referred patients to other clinics, which further demonstrates the need to overcome barriers of access to assisted reproductive technology in this population.</p><p>HIV-infected couples seeking fertility treatment should undergo the following:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15557532"><span class="h3">Medical assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The medical status of both partners should be evaluated, appropriate preventive therapies should be initiated, and any problems that can be treated should be addressed by their primary care provider and/or HIV specialist before initiating fertility therapy. An overview of the evaluation and management of HIV-infected adults can be found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3745.html" rel="external">"Primary care of adults with HIV"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15557539"><span class="h3">Antiretroviral therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluating the need for antiretroviral and other medical therapies should be part of the initial assessment. Some issues that need to be addressed by the HIV/AIDS specialist are: Should the patient be started on antiretroviral therapy if he/she is not already taking these drugs? Is he/she on the optimum regimen? Should an HIV-uninfected female partner of an HIV-infected male receive prophylactic antiretroviral therapy during assisted reproductive technology?</p><p>In the United States, initiation of antiretroviral therapy is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals to reduce the risk of AIDS and non-AIDS morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Antiretroviral therapy may also be useful from a fertility, as well as a medical, perspective. Some experts believe it may improve the outcome of sperm washing/intrauterine insemination (IUI) (see below), while others do not [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>].</p><p>Although routine semen analysis may not be significantly different between HIV-infected and uninfected males, as HIV infection progresses, semen parameters show decreased concentration, motility, and number of morphological normal sperm and increased round cells with more viscous semen [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. There is likely a positive correlation between total sperm concentration and CD4 cell count [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. A retrospective study describing observations from 10 years of experience providing fertility care to HIV-infected men reported 76 of 181 such men (42 percent) had an abnormal semen analysis with at least one parameter in the subfertile range [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In a retrospective case-control study of 770 men using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the median values of all semen parameters were statistically lower for HIV-1 infected individuals compared with the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 reference group [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Semen analysis parameters below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the WHO reference group occurred for 26 percent of the group for volume, 32 percent for progressive motility, and 28 percent for normal morphology. Theories for sperm alterations include poor spermatogenesis, ejaculatory dysfunction, dysfunction of the prostate/seminal vesicles, increased reactive oxygen species, or Leydig cell dysfunction due to infected macrophage interaction with seminal epithelium degeneration.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15557546"><span class="h3">Preconceptional evaluation and counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The couple should receive preconceptional evaluation and counseling. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/448.html" rel="external">"The preconception office visit"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13972.html" rel="external">"Prenatal evaluation of women with HIV in resource-rich settings"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15557553"><span class="h3">Fertility assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before undergoing time-consuming, expensive, and involved treatments such as IUI or in vitro fertilization (IVF), we assess factors that could affect outcomes, even if the HIV infected patient or their partner is not known to be infertile. This assessment includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Semen analysis. Leukocytospermia should be evaluated. If present, it may increase the risk for transmission of HIV. Semen parameters affect the choice of treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7453.html" rel="external">"Approach to the male with infertility"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7452.html" rel="external">"Treatments for male infertility"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of ovulatory function and ovarian reserve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5445.html" rel="external">"Female infertility: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of fallopian tube patency. HIV-infected women are at risk of infertility from tubal disease, given the increased prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections in HIV-infected individuals [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. However, if IVF is planned, tubal patency evaluation is not necessary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of the uterine cavity. Uterine evaluation is performed if clinically indicated. Hysterosalpingography, sonohysterography, or hysteroscopy is performed before IVF to ensure that there is no abnormality that might interfere with pregnancy, such as a submucous fibroid or uterine septum.</p><p></p><p>Female and male infertility factors are addressed, as appropriate.</p><p>HIV infection appears to impact fertility parameters in women and men. A review of age-specific fertility rates (ASFR) from demographic and health surveys revealed a decreasing fertility rate among HIV-infected women compared with HIV-uninfected women [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. ASFR is calculated as the total number of births in the 36 months preceding the survey divided by the sum of woman-years at childbearing age during that 36 months multiplied by 1000 for every five-year bracket. The ASFR ratio (defined as a ratio of ASFRs of HIV-infected women divided by ASFRs of HIV-uninfected women) for each five-year bracket group from 15 to 49 years old was 1.2, 0.77, 0.71, 0.65, 0.59, 0.53, 0.47. In addition, a case-control study reported lower anti-Müllerian hormone levels for women with HIV compared with uninfected control women (3.0±2.8 versus 3.7±3.5 ng/mL, respectively) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. However, the clinical significance of this difference is not yet know. A different case-control study reported a lower clinical pregnancy rate per transfer, although the implantation and live birth rates per transfer were not significantly different between HIV-infected women compared with controls [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>For HIV-infected men, semen testing (especially those using antiretroviral therapy) has revealed a lower ejaculate volume, decreased sperm motility, and increased abnormal sperm morphology compared with controls [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15557583"><span class="h3">Counseling and evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients receive counseling about the psychosocial factors involved in pursuing fertility treatment and are evaluated to make sure they understand and accept these risks. The exact method by which to conceive should be decided after careful discussion with HIV and reproductive specialists [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Optimal candidates for fertility services</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Experts have suggested the following criteria to guide clinicians in selecting HIV infected patients who seek assistance with conception [<a href="#rid25">25-27</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High motivation for childbearing</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Well-controlled HIV with a stable CD4 count</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Undetectable virus in the serum and the semen (&lt;50 to 100 copies/mL)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antiretroviral medication adherence of &gt;90 percent</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">HIV-infected male and HIV-uninfected female</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal when the male is infected is to prevent transmission of infection to the female partner and the fetus. Options include use of donor sperm, IUI using prepared (washed) sperm from the infected male, or in vitro fertilization (with intracytoplasmic sperm injection [ICSI]) using prepared (washed) sperm from the infected male. The male partner should be receiving antiretroviral therapy and ideally demonstrate sustained suppression of plasma viral load below the limits of detection [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Oral periconception pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for the female partner.</p><p>Management of patients desiring natural conception is discussed elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Natural conception in serodiscordant couples'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Donor insemination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The use of donor sperm from an HIV-uninfected man and IUI is the safest option for HIV-uninfected women who desire conception [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. If the couple elects to use donor sperm, they should be informed that donor sperm samples are quarantined for at least 180 days (ie, six months) after the date of donation to allow testing and retesting of the donors for communicable diseases, such as HIV. Donor insemination is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7423.html" rel="external">"Donor insemination"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">IUI with processed sperm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For couples who do not wish to use donor sperm, sperm preparation techniques (ie, sperm washing) combined with IUI or IVF are options for limiting the risk of HIV transmission to the uninfected female partner. The rationale for this approach, even when there is no detectable virus in the male's serum, comes from data reporting that semen may contain a high viral load and transmission to a partner can occur [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The risk of female seroconversion is likely to be substantially reduced by utilizing medically assisted reproduction. In couples with a normal fertility evaluation, IUI with specially processed sperm is a safe and effective strategy [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. Some specialists also treat the female partner with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) at the time of IUI with washed sperm. In a study of 11 serodiscordant couples who underwent 28 cycles of IUI using washed sperm combined with PrEP, six cycles resulted in pregnancy (fecundability rate of 21 percent), and all of the women remained HIV seronegative at six months of follow-up [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. However, for couples in which the semen analysis is abnormal, IVF may be the best treatment option. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7452.html" rel="external">"Treatments for male infertility"</a>.)</p><p>It has been suggested that HIV is carried in the seminal fluid and white blood cells and that spermatozoa do not carry the virus because they do not have the necessary viral receptors, but this is controversial. Most authorities believe that the sperm do not have HIV on their surface or in the cell. However, it is easy to contaminate a sperm preparation with microscopic quantities of semen. Sperm washing prior to IUI eliminates the round cells, seminal plasma, and the majority of immotile sperm. Sperm are isolated by sequential density gradient and swim-up techniques and are then tested by PCR assays for the presence of HIV RNA. Using this method of sperm preparation, less than 1 percent of sperm samples from HIV-infected men test positive (typically, these "positives" are "low level" positive tests).</p><p>A Cochrane Review noted, however, that there were no relevant clinical trials identified in the literature to determine the benefits and risks of sperm washing to prevent HIV transmission in the setting of attempted conception [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Our current information base is derived from observational studies which demonstrate a need for further research with a multicenter randomized trial in this area. As there have been no documented transmissions of HIV through any processing methods currently used, it is unclear how randomization to treatment other than sperm washing could ethically be performed.</p><p>The goal of IUI is to place "virus free" sperm into the uterine cavity near the time of ovulation. If PCR assays are negative for HIV, the sperm are transferred into the uterine cavity via a flexible catheter. Using this protocol over several thousand cycles, there has been a zero rate of seroconversion in female partners and no documented births of HIV-infected children [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, couples should be counseled that the risk of acquiring HIV from insemination with prepared (washed) sperm from an HIV-infected partner has not yet definitively been proven to be zero.

Nevertheless, as with IUI, prevention of HIV viral transmission cannot be guaranteed. Even though IVF with ICSI theoretically reduces the female's exposure to the virus, there are several reasons that it is not the standard technique for all HIV discordant couples. For example, pregnancies conceived by IVF are associated with increased risks of multiple gestations, congenital anomalies, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and the complications associated with these outcomes.

Moreover, two out of three HIV-affected couples experience subfertility and may benefit from early recognition of fertility factors [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. Because of these uncertainties, it is prudent to continue to recommend safe sex practices (ie, condom use) and use of assisted reproduction techniques until more information on optimal management of these couples is available [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].

The use of peri-conception PrEP and subsequent continued use during pregnancy is acceptable and feasible to those desiring pregnancy. It offers autonomy as a use-controlled prevention technique in the peri-conception time frame for both women and men [<a href="#rid60">60</a>].</p><p></p><p>Beyond optimal medical suppression of the HIV-infected partner, serodiscordant couples should time unprotected intercourse to coincide with ovulation to maximize the chance of pregnancy and minimize the number of exposed sexual events [<a href="#rid61">61</a>].

Thirty-seven of the women were treated with two-dose pre-exposure tenofovir prophylaxis; nine of the women declined because they felt the risk of viral transmission was low. In general practice, if pregnancy is not achieved after three months of attempting for natural conception, then consideration of further evaluation and treatment should be considered.</p><p>Timed intercourse also appears beneficial for couples in whom the HIV-infected partner may have a detectable viral load. One study of HIV-uninfected women who had timed intercourse with HIV-infected partners (whose CD4 counts ranged from 7 to 1273/microL; viral loads were not available) reported that 4 of 92 (4.3 percent) seroconverted [<a href="#rid63">63</a>].

If the male partner has the unique mutation, then sperm washing or donor insemination may be used to reduce the female's risk of acquiring the mutated virus.</p><p>However, most couples do not know the subtype of HIV that they carry.

Under the ADA, "no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of … accommodations of any place of public accommodation" which includes the "professional office of a health care provider."

Wrongful life is similar to the ethical principle of nonmaleficence (first do no harm). Parents may claim wrongful birth against a health care professional who does not fully inform them of the possibility that the mother may have a child with a disease. This underscores the importance of an extensive informed consent process that allows for patient autonomy in the decision to proceed with treatment with the understanding of the possibility of transmission of HIV to the child.

When considering HIV, it is helpful to point out other disease processes for which we do not deny access to infertility evaluation/treatment. Many couples with autosomal recessive diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs, have a 25 percent chance of transmitting the disease to their child. These diseases may also lead to child mortality, but have a higher risk of transmission than HIV, and yet we allow these couples to proceed with infertility treatment after appropriate genetic counseling. Moreover, women with chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, where the pregnancy may have an effect on the mother's health, are not prohibited from engaging in infertility treatment [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beneficence – Beneficence is the health care provider's obligation to promote the health of his/her patients. Physicians can help patients decrease the transmission of HIV virus to their partner and can assist in providing a couple the psychological well-being that comes from the joy of having a genetically related child. The benefit of a supportive medical environment may encourage a woman to obtain medical and prenatal care and take precautions to prevent transmission to her child.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Justice – The principle of justice refers to the battle between the right to reproduce and the possibility of an affected infant who may suffer and whose care has economic and social implications for the society in which he lives [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Physicians cannot claim to be simply the "technical agents" who perform the procedures to achieve conception without acknowledging the risk of transmission of HIV to the child. The risk is best justified by the low rate of perinatal transmission (less than 2 percent with appropriate precautions), which is lower than the general population risk of congenital malformations of medical, surgical, or cosmetic significance (3 to 5 percent).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h1">HEPATITIS C</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many of the same principles discussed above also apply to couples discordant for other chronic, potentially serious infections where horizontal and vertical transmission can occur.

If IUI is unsuccessful or if there is severe male factor infertility, in-vitro fertilization or donor sperm insemination can be performed as per usual protocols. (See <a class="local">'HIV-infected male and HIV-uninfected female'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Successful antiretroviral therapy for the HIV-infected partner, and potentially periconceptional pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis (PrEP) for the uninfected partner, are important interventions to prevent HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples desiring natural conception. In addition to optimal medical management, serodiscordant couples should time unprotected intercourse to coincide with ovulation to maximize the chance of pregnancy and minimize the number of exposed sexual events. (See <a class="local">'Natural conception in serodiscordant couples'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When the female is HCV-uninfected and the male is HCV-infected, similar principles to HIV serodiscordant couples apply. We suggest IUI with specially processed sperm (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). IVF (with or without ICSI) and donor sperm are other options, depending on patient-specific factors. (See <a class="local">'Hepatitis C'</a> above and <a class="local">'HCV-infected male and HCV-uninfected female'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When the female is HCV-infected and the male is HCV-uninfected, IUI therapy will decrease the risk of transmission to the male partner.
