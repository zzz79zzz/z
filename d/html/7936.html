         Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is a blood conservation technique that entails the removal of whole blood from a patient shortly after induction of anesthesia, with maintenance of normovolemia using crystalloid and/or colloid replacement fluid. The amount of blood removed typically varies between 1 and 3 units (450 to 500 mL constitutes one unit), although 3 to 4 units may be withdrawn safely in selected patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         ANH can be used as the sole blood conservation technique, but for better results, it can be combined with other strategies to minimize or avoid transfusion, as discussed in separate topics:

         ANH can be considered for patients with normal or high initial hemoglobin (Hgb) levels (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7133.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnostic approach to anemia in adults", section on 'Caveats for normal ranges'
         </a>
         ), who are expected to lose more than 500 to 750 mL blood during surgery. This recommendation is based on the fact that most patients can safely tolerate intraoperative blood losses up to 2 units of red blood cells (RBCs) without need for intervention (eg, blood transfusion), so neither the cost nor the labor required to implement intraoperative hemodilution would normally be justified for lesser volumes of expected blood loss.
        </p>
        <p>
         ANH is the only autologous blood conservation strategy for patients who are unable to use other conservation methods due to factors such as or contraindications to intraoperative blood salvage. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7937.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         ANH is also a good option for patients who decline blood transfusions, including Jehovah's Witnesses who generally agree to ANH, However, one must inquire if ANH is acceptable for an individual patient. (See

         Typically, 1 to 3 (occasionally up to 4 but no more than 4 units) units of blood are removed although 2 units and no more than 4 would render better ANH results. As blood is withdrawn, it is essential to maintain normovolemia using crystalloid and/or colloid replacement fluid. Most anesthesiologists aim for a hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8 to 9 g/dL after ANH has been completed as this maintains an appropriate safety margin in the event of acute surgical blood loss. Although evidence suggests that healthy carefully monitored patients can tolerate a Hgb as low as 7 g/dL, targeting lower Hgb concentrations (usually by means of removing more than 4 units of whole blood) will yield dilute units of blood that may not have the desired effect when they are reinfused. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">
          "Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults", section on 'Orthopedic surgery'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The volume of blood that may be withdrawn during ANH is derived from the following formula:
        </p>
        <div class="formulaContainer">
         <div class="formula">
          <p class="bulletIndent1">
           V = EBV x ({Hgb-i - Hgb-f} ÷ Hgb-av)
          </p>
         </div>
        </div>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         where V is the volume of blood to be removed (liters), EBV is the baseline estimated blood volume (liters) of the patient, Hgb-i is the initial Hgb (g/dL), Hgb-f is the final desired Hgb (g/dL), and Hgb-av is the average Hgb (average of Hgb-i and Hgb-f). Blood volume in adults can be crudely estimated as 70 mL/kg in lean men and 60 mL/kg in lean women [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. However, it is important to recognize the imprecision of this estimate, and to realize that mass-based blood volume decreases in a non-linear fashion with increasing age and with increasing body mass [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, in a 70 kg male patient with an estimated blood volume of 4900 mL (rounded to 5 L), an initial Hgb of 14 g/dL, and a desired final Hgb of 9 g/dL, the volume of blood to be drawn is:
        </p>
        <div class="formulaContainer">
         <div class="formula">
          <p>
           V = 5.0 x ({14 - 9} ÷ 11.5) = 2.2 liters (approximately 4 units)

         Replacement of intravascular volume can be accomplished using either colloid or crystalloid solutions. The volume infused depends upon the solution used. Crystalloids are distributed through the extracellular (intravascular plus interstitial) volume. As a result, the volume of crystalloid infused usually exceeds the volume of blood withdrawn, and is typically replaced on a 1.5:1.0 volume basis. In comparison, colloids are initially restricted to the vascular space. Thus, the volume initially administered should approximate the volume of blood withdrawn on a 1:1 basis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14942.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of the solution used, monitoring of vital signs and intravascular volume status is necessary since replacement formulas are not precise. The actual volume of fluid administered is adjusted depending on factors such as hemodynamic stability, urine output, and indicators of volume responsiveness, such as pulse pressure variation. (See

         Blood is withdrawn into a commercially available blood collection bag which typically contains citrate for anticoagulation and additives to prolong the life of the stored blood. A scale is used to determine the amount of blood removed. Overfilled whole blood bags may develop clots as the effectiveness of anticoagulation may compromised when the ratio of the preservative to anticoagulant is reduced. Once clots are formed and propagated, the blood may no longer be used. This will result in more blood loss negating the goal of ANH.
        </p>
        <p>
         Preassembled hemodilution "kits" make ANH more convenient and may improve the safety of this procedure. Such kits contain two blood collection bags, a Y-type connector set with a Luer lock adapter, and a blood recipient identification band. Each unit of blood should be immediately labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, time of blood withdrawal, and sequential unit number (if more than one unit is removed).

         Bags containing the collected autologous blood should be placed on a mechanical agitator (ie, a rocker) unless gentle agitation of the blood bag can be accomplished by hand; this is particularly important during the collection period. Agitation prevents platelet aggregation thereby preserving platelet function.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is essential that the anesthesiologist consult the local blood bank for labeling and storage standards and recommendations. According to the 5
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         edition of the Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) Standards for Perioperative Autologous Blood Collection and Administration, blood units collected by ANH can be stored in the operating room at room temperature (approximately 22°C [72°F]) for up to eight hours [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, in some situations, the medical director of the intraoperative autologous blood service can prolong the room temperature storage time if necessary, for an individual patient. During reinfusion, warming the blood with a blood warmer may be appropriate to avoid hypothermia if a large number of units are transfused. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If withdrawn units of blood are not used within eight hours, they can be stored at 1 to 6°C (34 to 43°F) for up to 24 hours, provided that cold storage is begun within eight hours of initiating blood withdrawal [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>

         Generally speaking, ANH blood is infused when the patient requires a blood transfusion [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Reinfusion is guided by estimation of blood loss and serial Hgb determinations. The collected blood is reinfused after major blood loss has ceased, or sooner if indicated (eg, low Hgb level, hemodynamic instability).
        </p>
        <p>
         The units of blood are usually reinfused in the reverse order of collection. Thus, the first unit, which has the highest Hgb and contains the most platelets and undiluted coagulation factors, is reinfused last. This allows final infusion of the most concentrated unit, theoretically at the time when bleeding is least. Occasionally, it may be prudent to change the sequence to ensure that the first unit(s) is (are) not wasted and are administered within eight hours of collection (eg, development of unintended hypervolemia that does not respond to diuretic administration).
        </p>
        <p>
         Either Hgb or hematocrit levels should be monitored regularly during surgery, with the interval determined according to assessments of blood loss. Blood reinfusion is typically initiated when Hgb is approximately 7 to 8 g/dL (hematocrit approximately 21 to 24 percent) if there is no significant ongoing bleeding. However, the lowest safe Hgb (or hematocrit) level in patients undergoing ANH is unknown, and there is inter-individual variability. In some cases, reinfusion may be necessary before quantitative laboratory assessment of Hgb can be obtained (eg, when blood loss is rapid and extensive). Decision-making is based on the rate of bleeding, expected volume of ongoing blood loss, and the need to have an adequate margin of safety if additional severe bleeding is a possibility. Further discussion of evidence supporting selection of appropriate Hgb thresholds for intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is available in other topics:

         Challenges in demonstrating efficacy of ANH include heterogeneity among studies due to difficulties in selection of patents likely to derive benefit from the technique, inconsistencies in volume of blood removed (removal of a single unit may have little or no benefit compared with removal of 2 to 3 units), lack of standardization for patients in the control groups (who received usual care in some studies or another blood conservation method in other studies), and problems with blinding, randomization, and publication bias [

          10-12

         ANH included decreased exposure to allogeneic blood, thereby minimizing or avoiding possible risks associated with transfusions (eg, infectious disease, allergic reactions, allosensitization, immunomodulation) [

          1,2,11,12,14-19
         </a>
         ]. Also, ANH may decrease blood loss during surgery, since hemodilution lowers the concentration of RBCs, platelets, and plasma factors in the lost blood. Furthermore, ANH provides the opportunity to transfuse patients with their own fresh whole blood containing viable platelets and adequate levels of clotting factors. In addition, ANH is generally more cost-effective compared with allogeneic blood transfusion since testing, storage, and crossmatching costs are not incurred, and additional surgical personnel are not needed for processing the withdrawn blood. Notably, in most studies, reduction in blood loss and exposure to allogeneic blood units has been only modestly reduced. However, combinations of blood conservation strategies that have only modest individual efficacy may result in significant reductions or complete avoidance of transfusion [

          'Patient selection'

         adverse effect of ANH is dilution of coagulation factors, which may actually increase blood loss if significant surgical bleeding occurs [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,31
         </a>
         ]. One in vitro study noted that platelet function may be impaired in the blood collected and temporarily stored in standard bags containing citrate, phosphate, dextrose, and adenine (CPDA) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. However, reports in patients requiring cardiopulmonary bypass note that infusion of ANH blood is associated with improved coagulation (reduced activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] and increased fibrinogen) compared with patients not receiving ANH [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,33

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An additional concern is potential waste of the harvested blood if the expected blood loss does not occur. However, in practice, harvested blood is almost always returned in a slow and prolonged infusion. If necessary, a small dose of diuretic may be administered to reduce the volume effect. Notably, reinfusion of ANH blood should take place in the operating room or the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Transporting ANH units to other locations may create confusion and is a potential safety concern if mistaken for donor blood and wrongly infused into another recipient.

         Finally, technical considerations for the safe use of the ANH technique require committed anesthesia personnel trained in collection of autologous blood and the requisite intensive monitoring of patients who have been significantly hemodiluted. For these reasons, ANH use has remained largely limited to institutions with trained and committed teams of anesthesiologists and surgeons. (See

The technique is typically combined with other blood conservation strategies to minimize or avoid transfusion.
