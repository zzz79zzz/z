         Pregnant women with psychiatric illnesses are often treated with antidepressant drugs. As an example, studies of pregnant women in Europe have found that antidepressants were used by approximately 3 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ], in Quebec by 4 percent [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ], and in the United States by 8 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-9
         </a>
         ]. Compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), other antidepressants have been used and studied less frequently [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,6-13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Antidepressants cross the placenta and fetal blood brain barrier. Prenatal exposure thus involves potential risks of teratogenesis, pregnancy complications (eg, spontaneous abortion and postpartum hemorrhage), preterm birth, and low birth weight, as well as postnatal effects (eg, poor neonatal adaptation syndrome and disrupted behavioral development).
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews the potential adverse consequences that may be associated with the antenatal use of antidepressant drugs other than SSRIs. The potential adverse effects of using SSRIs during pregnancy, postnatal outcomes among infants exposed in utero to SSRIs or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, principles of teratology, choice of treatment for depressed pregnant patients, safety of antidepressants in lactating women, and treatment of postpartum depression are discussed separately:

         Information about the risks of antidepressant drugs during pregnancy comes from low to moderate quality studies. For some drugs (eg,

         ]. As an example, a study of an insurance claims database compared infants born to depressed mothers who received duloxetine or venlafaxine during the first trimester (n &gt;6,000) with infants whose depressed mothers were not treated with antidepressants (n &gt;180,000) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Propensity scoring was used to match the two groups for observed potential confounders (eg, maternal age, obesity, and substance use disorders; depression severity; chronic maternal illnesses; and use of other medications). The risk of congenital cardiac defects was comparable among infants exposed to duloxetine or venlafaxine compared with unexposed infants.

After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal age, prepregnancy body mass index, parity, prepregnancy medical complications, and smoking), the analyses found an increased risk for gestational hypertension in those who continued compared with those who discontinued SNRIs (14 versus 6 percent). However, the sample size was small, the analyses did not control for severity of depression, and the risk of preeclampsia was comparable among both groups (10 and 6 percent).

Postpartum hemorrhage occurred in more women who were exposed to SNRIs in late pregnancy (11 percent), but not in women exposed in mid-pregnancy (10 percent), relative to unexposed women (7 percent) [

          Postpartum hemorrhage
         </strong>
         – Exposure to tricyclics during second or third trimester of pregnancy may be associated with postpartum hemorrhage. A study of a nationwide insurance claims database identified pregnant women with mood or anxiety disorders (primarily depression), who were either treated with tricyclics at the time of delivery (n = 175) or were not treated with antidepressants in the five months before delivery (n &gt;69,000) [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. There was a trend for an association between exposure and postpartum hemorrhage (relative risk 1.8, 95% CI 0.9-3.5), and the risk was comparable to the statistically significant risk observed between exposure to all antidepressants and bleeding (relative risk 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6).

          Tricyclics
         </strong>
         – The risks of teratogenicity with tricyclic antidepressants as a group are generally regarded as low; however, one large study found that
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9283" href="/z/d/drug information/9283.html" rel="external">
          clomipramine
         </a>
         was associated with an elevated rate of severe malformations, including cardiovascular defects. Antenatal exposure to tricyclic agents is not associated with spontaneous abortion but is associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and may perhaps be associated with postpartum hemorrhage. In addition, exposure is not associated with preterm birth or abnormal motor and behavioral development. (See
