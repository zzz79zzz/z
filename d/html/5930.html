The cause of ITP remains unknown in most cases, but it can be triggered by a viral or environmental trigger or it may be secondary to an underlying immunologic defect [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. ITP was previously known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The current term <strong>I</strong>mmune <strong>T</strong>hrombocyto<strong>P</strong>enia preserves the widely-recognized acronym "ITP," while acknowledging the immune-mediated mechanism of the disorder and that patients may have little or no signs of purpura or bleeding [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of ITP in children will be reviewed here. The initial treatment of newly diagnosed ITP and management of chronic ITP in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5917.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89225.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Management of chronic disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2897845914"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following terms are used throughout this topic:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary ITP</strong> – ITP in the absence of other causes or disorders that may be associated with the thrombocytopenia is known as primary ITP and is the main focus of this topic review.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Secondary ITP</strong> – Secondary ITP refers to immune-mediated thrombocytopenia with an underlying cause, including drug-induced or associated with systemic illness, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), infection (eg, HIV), immune deficiency (eg, common variable immunodeficiency [CVID] or autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome [ALPS]), and other causes. Secondary causes of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia are outlined briefly below. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Primary ITP is categorized into three phases, depending on duration [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Newly diagnosed ITP</strong> – ITP within three months from diagnosis (ie, from the first low platelet count)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Persistent ITP</strong> – ITP between 3 and 12 months after diagnosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic ITP</strong> – ITP lasting for more than 12 months</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In ITP, autoantibodies (usually immunoglobulin G) are directed against platelet membrane antigens, such as the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa complex [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Antibodies may be directed against other targets such as GP Ib/IX, GP Ia/IIa, and GP VI. The antibody-coated platelets have a shortened half-life because of accelerated clearance by tissue macrophages, predominantly those in the spleen. In addition, the same antibodies may inhibit platelet production. The net effect is a decrease, often substantial, in the platelet count.</p><p>Approximately 60 percent of children with ITP have detectable antiplatelet antibodies. In patients without detectable antibodies, the mechanism is uncertain but is presumed to be immune-mediated. Thus, measurement of antiplatelet antibodies is generally <strong>not</strong> helpful in diagnosing ITP, because the test is neither sensitive nor specific. (See <a class="local">'No role for antiplatelet antibody testing'</a> below.)</p><p>In a subset of patients with ITP, whether or not antibodies are demonstrable, an alternative immunologic mechanism of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity may cause thrombocytopenia. These cytotoxic T cells may act upon megakaryocytes in the bone marrow rather than circulating platelets. It is not known how often this occurs, nor whether cytotoxic T cells play a role in the typical patient with ITP, nor whether their primary role involves platelet destruction during passage through the spleen or in the marrow.</p><p>Mechanisms rupturing self-tolerance appear to play a role as well. These mechanisms involve regulatory T cells (Tregs) and B cells (eg, checkpoint disruptions).</p><p>Our understanding of the pathogenesis of ITP is based largely on studies in adult patients; there is less information available specifically on ITP in children. The pathogenesis of ITP is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6676.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ITP is one of the most common causes of symptomatic thrombocytopenia in children. The annual incidence of ITP is estimated to be between 1 and 6.4 cases per 100,000 children [<a href="#rid3">3,6</a>]. This figure is probably an underestimate because it is based primarily upon patients that develop symptomatic thrombocytopenia, particularly those who require hospitalization.</p><p>Children with ITP can present at any age, but there is a peak in incidence between two and five years and a smaller peak in adolescence. In a prospective population-based study from the five Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland) between 1998 and 2000, the annual incidence of ITP was 4.8 per 100,000 children younger than 15 years of age [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. One-half of the patients were between one and four years of age, and approximately 80 percent were younger than eight years of age.</p><p>In childhood ITP, there is a slight predominance of boys to girls, especially in infants. This was best illustrated in the largest case series of children with ITP from the registry of the Intercontinental Childhood ITP Study Group that included &gt;2000 infants and children from 3 months to 16 years old. In infants between 3 and 12 months of age, the male-to-female ratio was 1.7:1 [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The male predominance was minimal in older children, such that the overall male-to-female ratio in this pediatric cohort was 1.2:1 [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. By contrast, there is a female predominance of ITP in adolescents and younger adults (eg, 18 to 45 years of age). One hypothesis to explain the female predominance in adolescents is that higher levels of estrogen may promote autoimmunity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6676.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Seasonal fluctuations have been reported, with a peak incidence of ITP occurring in the spring and early summer in temperate climates [<a href="#rid7">7,9</a>]. This observation supports the notion that viral triggers are an important cause of ITP; however, the finding has not always been consistent. An association with allergic diseases (eg, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis) has also been reported [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ITP typically presents with the sudden appearance of a petechial rash  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76671" href="/d/graphic/76671.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), bruising, and/or bleeding in an otherwise healthy child. Thrombocytopenia is occasionally detected incidentally if a complete blood count (CBC) with platelets is performed for another reason (eg, preoperatively or on a routine check-up).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Preceding illness or vaccination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 60 percent of children with newly diagnosed ITP have a history of a preceding viral illness within the past month [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Numerous viruses have been identified as triggers of ITP, including Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, varicella zoster virus, and HIV [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. ITP occurring in association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been described [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>There is a very small increased risk of developing ITP in the six weeks following a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination. MMR-associated ITP is rare, occurring in approximately 2.6 cases per 100,000 doses of vaccine. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101273.html" rel="external">"Measles, mumps, and rubella immunization in infants, children, and adolescents", section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p>Early childhood vaccines other than MMR do not appear to be associated with increased risk of ITP [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. There have been case reports of ITP following administration of varicella, hepatitis A, pneumococcus, and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccines in older children [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, because of the small number of exposed cases and potential confounding, the association of ITP with these vaccines has not been confirmed.</p><p>Vaccine-associated thrombocytopenia secondary to COVID-19 vaccination is very rare, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131333.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2035460624"><span class="h2">Lack of systemic signs and symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other than mucocutaneous bleeding, patients usually appear well and systemic symptoms are generally absent. The history should carefully explore systemic symptoms (eg, fever, anorexia, bone or joint pain, weight loss, gastrointestinal [GI] symptoms, headaches), exposure to thrombocytopenia-inducing drugs  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73618" href="/d/graphic/73618.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), prior history of bleeding, and family history of bleeding since these findings are generally absent in children with ITP at onset of their disease. Occasionally, children will have a history of bruising or bleeding stretching back one to six months, during which it appears that the ITP was already active. On physical examination, there is no significant enlargement of lymph nodes, liver, or spleen, although the spleen may be mildly enlarged in as many as 10 percent of cases.</p><p>If any of these features are present, including mild splenomegaly, other causes of thrombocytopenia should be carefully considered and appropriate testing pursued. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Further evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Bleeding symptoms</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2122802601"><span class="h3">Grading of severity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bleeding signs and symptoms in children with ITP can range from none or minimal (eg, several small groups of petechiae or small bruises) to severe and life-threatening (eg, intracranial hemorrhage [ICH] or severe GI or genitourinary bleeding) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The Buchanan and Adix bleeding score is commonly used to objectively characterize bleeding symptoms in patients with ITP  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89047" href="/d/graphic/89047.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>Most patients who present for medical attention have signs of cutaneous bleeding (eg, petechiae  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76671" href="/d/graphic/76671.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), purpura, and ecchymoses); serious hemorrhage is fortunately very infrequent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3552943489"><span class="h3">Mucocutaneous bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At presentation, more than one-half of affected children have only cutaneous bleeding (also referred to as "dry" purpura), including petechiae  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76671" href="/d/graphic/76671.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), purpura, and ecchymoses [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Mucosal bleeding (also referred to as "wet" bleeding) may be present in as many as 40 percent of children with newly diagnosed ITP and typically involves the nasal passages as well as buccal and gingival surfaces (as shown in panel B  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71480" href="/d/graphic/71480.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>)). Less often, mucosal bleeding may arise from the GI, genitourinary, or vaginal tracts. Conjunctival or retinal hemorrhages are infrequently seen [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>The severity of presenting symptoms is generally commensurate with the degree of thrombocytopenia, but many children have minimal bleeding even when platelet counts are very low. In one large cohort study, mucosal bleeding was more common with platelet counts &lt;10,000/microL compared with ≥15,000/microL (51 versus 19 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>In a large registry study of children with newly diagnosed ITP, the following bleeding manifestations were reported [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cutaneous (petechiae, purpura, or bruising) – 86 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Oral – 19 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nasal – 20 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No bleeding – 9 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Menstrual, GI, or urinary bleeding – &lt;3 percent</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4714177"><span class="h3">Serious hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serious bleeding (defined as epistaxis &gt;5 to 15 minutes duration, GI bleeding, other severe mucosal bleeding requiring hospital admission, and/or blood transfusions) develops in approximately 3 percent of children with ITP [<a href="#rid7">7,16-18</a>]. ICH occurs in approximately 0.5 percent.</p><p>Factors associated with increased risk of serious bleeding include [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count &lt;10,000/microL or &lt;20,000/microL, depending on the study). In most studies, nearly all severe bleeding events occurred in children with very low platelet counts; however, most patients with platelet counts in this range do not experience severe bleeding events. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5917.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management", section on 'Bleeding complications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Previous "wet" purpura bleeding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Trauma, especially to the head.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exposure to antiplatelet medications (eg, aspirin, ibuprofen, other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) and anticoagulants (eg, heparin, warfarin).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4714305"><span class="h4">Intracranial hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ICH is the most serious consequence of thrombocytopenia but is fortunately a rare complication of ITP in children, with reported rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 percent [<a href="#rid7">7,8,15,16,18-20</a>]. This was illustrated in reports of the Intercontinental Childhood ITP Study Group registry, which reported 10 cases of ICH among 1784 patients (0.6 percent) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], and from the Nordic registry, which reported no case of ICH among 501 patients during the first six months after diagnosis [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. A systematic review of 51 prospective clinical trials including 1965 children with ITP found that ICH occurred in 0.4 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.9) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. More than 90 percent of ICHs in children with ITP are intraparenchymal and supratentorial [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Children presenting with signs and symptoms concerning for ICH (eg, headache, persistent vomiting, altered mental status, seizures, focal neurologic findings, recent head trauma) require urgent evaluation (including neuroimaging) and treatment. The threshold for obtaining neuroimaging in children with ITP is substantially lower than for the general pediatric population, especially if the platelet count is &lt;10,000 to 20,000. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5917.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management", section on 'Life-threatening bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for ICH are the same as for severe bleeding in general (ie, very low platelet count, head trauma, exposure to antiplatelet medications, and signs of excessive bleeding [eg, wet purpura in the mouth, hematuria, prolonged epistaxis, GI bleeding, or other pronounced mucosal bleeding]) (see <a class="local">'Serious hemorrhage'</a> above). Children who present with these risk factors should be carefully assessed for signs or symptoms of ICH since the urgency and degree of treatment will be altered by presence of ICH. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5917.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management", section on 'Life-threatening bleeding'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4713815"><span class="h2">Laboratory findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Thrombocytopenia usually is the only abnormality detected. Other CBC parameters are generally normal, although there may be exceptions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89206" href="/d/graphic/89206.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Platelet count</strong> – A platelet count of &lt;100,000/microL is used to define thrombocytopenia in ITP [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, in most case series, the presenting platelet count is &lt;30,000/microL [<a href="#rid9">9,18</a>], probably because patients with mild disease are less likely to have bleeding, and may never come to medical attention. Approximately 80 percent of children with ITP have platelet counts &lt;20,000/microL at presentation, and approximately 45 percent of children have platelet counts &lt;10,000/microL [<a href="#rid8">8,15</a>]. Platelet counts in children are generally somewhat lower than in adults with ITP. If possible, it is helpful to determine if the patient has had a previously normal platelet count to exclude an inherited thrombocytopenia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5921.html" rel="external">"Causes of thrombocytopenia in children", section on 'Inherited platelet disorders'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other CBC findings</strong> – The white blood cell count and differential, hemoglobin concentration, and other red cell indices are generally normal. If a reticulocyte count is obtained, it should be normal as well. Anemia is occasionally seen in children with considerable ITP-related bleeding (eg, epistaxis or heavy menstrual bleeding). If ongoing for weeks, anemia in this setting is typically microcytic reflecting iron deficiency. Anemia without microcytosis should prompt consideration of other causes (eg, aplastic anemia, leukemia, Evans syndrome). The white blood cell count may be low or high if there has been an ongoing or recent infection.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5934.html" rel="external">"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Systemic autoimmune disease</strong> – Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia may be the presenting manifestation of an autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or ALPS.

However, it is now recognized that approximately one-quarter of children presenting with Evans syndrome (even without lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly) may actually have ALPS [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. The signature screening laboratory abnormality is increased numbers of alpha/beta double-negative T cells detected by flow cytometric immunophenotyping with triple color flow.

Thus, patients with ITP and recurrent infections should be evaluated for CVID and other immunodeficiency syndromes by measuring serum immunoglobulin levels. In our practice, we measure immunoglobulin levels in all children with ITP because patients with CVID, especially those with autoimmune disease, do not always have a notable history of infections [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

Some of these syndromes are associated with other abnormalities (eg, immunodeficiency, renal disease, sensorineural hearing loss, risk of malignancy). Historical platelet counts from children and their parents and ascertainment of the duration of bleeding symptoms can help distinguish between congenital and acquired causes. Inherited platelet disorders are discussed in greater detail separately.

This possibility is explored by a history of exposure to such drugs, including whether the drugs are present in the household and might have been accidentally ingested by the child. In a child on such a medication, it should be changed to an equivalent medication if possible, to see if the "ITP" resolves.

HUS is distinguished from ITP on the basis of the clinical history, presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (with fragmented erythrocytes [schistocytes] on peripheral smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851" href="/d/graphic/70851.html" rel="external">picture 9</a>)), and abnormal renal function (ie, oliguria, elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine).

Renal insufficiency also may be present, often with gross or microscopic blood in the urine and typically a very high lactate dehydrogenase. TTP is associated with absent or reduced ADAMTS13 activity: It can be hereditary or acquired. Graver systemic illness suggests that ITP is not the diagnosis.

(See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Preceding viral illness or vaccination</strong> – Many children with ITP have a history of preceding viral illness. ITP may also infrequently occur following measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination. (See <a class="local">'Preceding illness or vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Absence of systemic symptoms</strong> – Other than mucocutaneous bleeding, patients with ITP usually appear and feel well. Systemic symptoms (eg, fever, anorexia, bone or joint pain, weight loss, or any other sign or symptom suggestive of an underlying serious illness), exposure to thrombocytopenia-inducing drugs  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73618" href="/d/graphic/73618.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), prior history of bleeding, and family history of bleeding are all generally absent in children with ITP at onset of their disease. On physical examination, there is no significant enlargement of lymph nodes, liver, or spleen. If any of these features are present, other causes of thrombocytopenia should be considered. (See <a class="local">'Lack of systemic signs and symptoms'</a> above and <a class="local">'Further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding severity</strong> – Bleeding symptoms in children with ITP can range from none or minimal (eg, few petechiae or small bruises) to, rarely, severe and life-threatening (eg, intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], severe gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89047" href="/d/graphic/89047.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Patients with platelet counts &lt;10,000/microL are more likely to have mucosal bleeding and ICH. (See <a class="local">'Bleeding symptoms'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mucocutaneous bleeding</strong> – Most patients have signs of cutaneous bleeding (petechiae  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71480" href="/d/graphic/71480.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>), purpura, and ecchymoses). Approximately 40 percent of patients also have mucosal bleeding (involving the nasal passages, oral cavity, and genitourinary and GI tracts).
