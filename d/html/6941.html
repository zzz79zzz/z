These findings led to the development of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as a treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Although ADT is palliative, it can normalize serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in over 90 percent of patients and can produce objective tumor responses in 80 to 90 percent. This antitumor activity can improve quality of life by reducing bone pain as well as the rates of complications (eg, pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, ureteral obstruction). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6951.html" rel="external">"Initial systemic therapy for advanced, recurrent, and metastatic noncastrate (castration-sensitive) prostate cancer", section on 'Benefits and methods for androgen deprivation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Some males with advanced prostate cancer have evidence of metastatic disease at presentation, while others develop metastatic disease after definitive treatment of localized disease; in some cases this may be manifested only by an elevation in the serum level of PSA, termed an isolated biochemical recurrence. The majority of males in all three groups have not been receiving long-term ADT, and serum testosterone levels are typically &gt;50 ng/dL. These males are considered to have castration-sensitive (also termed noncastrate) prostate cancer (CSPC).</p><p>By contrast, males who relapse or recur while receiving ADT are considered to have castration-resistant prostate cancer, although they may still respond to some forms of hormone therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112896.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6942.html" rel="external">"Alternative endocrine therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Contemporary research has led to the development of multiple combined modality approaches for males with advanced CSPC that are associated with better outcomes than can be achieved with ADT alone. The goals of systemic therapy are to prolong survival, minimize complications, and maintain quality of life. In addition to systemic therapy, there are some patients who might benefit from local therapy to the prostate or to individual metastases to prolong survival. (See <a class="local">'Prostate-directed therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Metastasis-directed therapy for oligometastatic disease'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the approach to CSPC using both systemic and local therapy. The options for initial systemic therapy for advanced, recurrent, and metastatic CSPC are discussed elsewhere; there are also separate discussion of the diagnostic evaluation, local salvage treatments, and the role of systemic therapy for males with a rising serum PSA after definitive local therapy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6951.html" rel="external">"Initial systemic therapy for advanced, recurrent, and metastatic noncastrate (castration-sensitive) prostate cancer"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6950.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6952.html" rel="external">"Rising or persistently elevated serum PSA following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6932.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Salvage local therapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6933.html" rel="external">"Role of systemic therapy in patients with a biochemical recurrence after treatment for localized prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2359533513"><span class="h1">EVALUATING DISEASE EXTENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no consensus on the best imaging modality to detect distant disease. The frequency with which metastases are detected using conventional imaging studies (ie, bone scan, computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen and pelvis) is very low for males with early prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-only progression. Next generation imaging (NGI) techniques have improved sensitivity for disease recurrence. These modalities include positron emission tomography [PET] scanning using one of the newer prostate cancer-specific radiotracers and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]. Many factors influence the type of imaging ordered including the decision about whether the patient is a candidate for treatment, availability of NGI techniques, insurance coverage, life expectancy, PSA level, and presence of symptoms.</p><p>Our general approach to imaging is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We obtain NGI for males with a PSA that rises ≥0.2 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy or a PSA value ≥2 ng/mL above the post-radiation nadir for males treated with radiation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If patients are symptomatic or have a PSA above 10, we obtain conventional imaging studies initially, given the improved sensitivity in these patients. If conventional imaging is not definitive, we obtain NGI as a next step.</p><p></p><p>An accurate assessment of disease extent has implications for treatment. For instance, males who are confirmed to have only a local recurrence after definitive treatment may be candidates for local salvage therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6952.html" rel="external">"Rising or persistently elevated serum PSA following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: Management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6932.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Salvage local therapy"</a>.)</p><p>Although guidelines from expert groups support the use of NGI for certain males with recurrent prostate cancer, reimbursement issues and the lack of general availability (especially for gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT) have limited widespread use. Often, insurance companies will only pay for these tests if conventional imaging is negative. However, this is an evolving area. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6929.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Guidelines from expert groups'</a>.)</p><p>There may be a role for NGI even in males presenting with CSPC who have demonstrable metastatic disease on conventional imaging. The 2020 guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology suggest a role for NGI to clarify the burden of disease and potentially shift the treatment intent from multimodality management of oligometastatic disease to palliative systemic treatment, but note that prospective data to support this benefit are limited [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Metastasis-directed therapy for oligometastatic disease'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4043144955"><span class="h1">ISOLATED BIOCHEMICAL RECURRENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monitoring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after definitive treatment of localized prostate cancer with either radiation therapy (RT) or radical prostatectomy (RP) leads to the identification of males with a PSA-only (biochemical) recurrence. In this situation, increases in serum PSA are not accompanied by signs, symptoms, or radiographic evidence of locally recurrent or disseminated disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6950.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification", section on 'Definition of biochemical progression'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H763877046"><span class="h2">Local salvage therapy performed, if appropriate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Local salvage therapy may result in prolonged disease-free survival. Patients with a biochemical recurrence should be evaluated for local therapy such as RT or a RP. Patient-specific factors such as prior therapy, patient preference, and risk factors will determine the best treatment plan. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6929.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Diagnostic evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6932.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Salvage local therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6952.html" rel="external">"Rising or persistently elevated serum PSA following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3790524660"><span class="h2">Choice of systemic therapy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H183328327"><span class="h3">Definition of high-risk features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We use guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), which identify high-risk features for early metastases as:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For those who underwent RP: A PSA doubling time &lt;1 year or Gleason score 8 to 10; <strong>OR</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For those who underwent RT: An interval to biochemical recurrence &lt;18 months or a Gleason score of 8 to 10 [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]</p><p></p><p>However, the definition of high risk varies among trials and society guidelines. Others may reasonably define high risk to include a PSA doubling time of ≤9 months, based on a randomized trial that showed an overall survival (OS) benefit with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86370" href="/z/d/drug information/86370.html" rel="external">enzalutamide</a> and ADT in this population [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2922045797"><span class="h3">High-risk features present and local therapy performed for recurrence</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1767584720"><span class="h4">Androgen deprivation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In males who are able to receive salvage therapy and who have high-risk features, early ADT is used. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the cornerstone of systemic therapy for advanced CSPC. ADT can be accomplished either with bilateral orchiectomy (surgical castration) or by medical castration [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6951.html" rel="external">"Initial systemic therapy for advanced, recurrent, and metastatic noncastrate (castration-sensitive) prostate cancer", section on 'Surgical orchiectomy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6951.html" rel="external">"Initial systemic therapy for advanced, recurrent, and metastatic noncastrate (castration-sensitive) prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p>In most cases, prostate cancer that has not previously been treated with systemic therapy is dependent on androgen for its continued growth. Androgen production occurs primarily in the testes, which account for 90 to 95 percent of the total circulating testosterone; testicular production of androgen is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The adrenal glands produce the remainder of the circulating androgens.</p><p>These observations provide the rationale for ADT, which is a key component of initial therapy, either alone or in combination with other therapies.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Continuous versus intermittent</strong> – Although we typically suggest continuous ADT, intermittent treatment is an appropriate alternative. Many of the acute and chronic side effects of ADT are due to continued castrate levels of testosterone. Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (IAD) typically involves treatment for either a fixed interval of time or until a maximal response is achieved based upon serum PSA levels. It has been proposed as a less toxic alternative for those with isolated biochemical recurrence after definitive local therapy, although the effect on survival is unknown. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6933.html" rel="external">"Role of systemic therapy in patients with a biochemical recurrence after treatment for localized prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although cessation of ADT results in a gradual return toward normal testosterone levels, this return is very slow, particularly for long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. IAD can improve quality of life while reducing side effects, especially those associated with physical and sexual function. However, when ADT is then withdrawn, patients must be followed closely for evidence of recurrence. As testosterone production resumes, the risk of disease progression also increases. The patient is followed with PSA measurements, and ADT is reinitiated based on a predefined threshold level of serum PSA (which varies with different practices but is often between 10 and 20 ng/mL) or with evidence of new metastatic disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6951.html" rel="external">"Initial systemic therapy for advanced, recurrent, and metastatic noncastrate (castration-sensitive) prostate cancer", section on 'Intermittent versus continuous ADT'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6951.html" rel="external">"Initial systemic therapy for advanced, recurrent, and metastatic noncastrate (castration-sensitive) prostate cancer", section on 'Serum testosterone level'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing of treatment</strong> — For patients who undergo salvage therapy who have high-risk features for recurrence, we initiate early ADT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, ADT for those with isolated biochemical recurrence is debated. Proponents of early treatment argue that this approach can delay disease progression and may prolong survival. Others contend that treatment is best deferred until clinical metastases or symptoms develop since there is no consistent evidence for a significant survival benefit with ADT and ADT is associated with toxicity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6933.html" rel="external">"Role of systemic therapy in patients with a biochemical recurrence after treatment for localized prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Side effects</strong> — ADT is associated with a wide range of side effects that can significantly impair quality of life, including loss of lean body mass, sexual dysfunction, loss of bone mineral density, hot flashes, and fatigue. These and others are discussed elsewhere.

This study defined high risk as a PSA doubling time &lt;9 months, which is a slightly different definition than used by ASCO. The combination also improved five-year OS rates compared with ADT alone (92 versus 87 percent), with a nonsignificant trend towards improved OS compared with enzalutamide alone (92 versus 90 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.52-1.17). Enzalutamide alone is a reasonable alternative for males who wish to avoid toxicity from ADT therapy, but does not have regulatory approval as a single agent for biochemical recurrence.

In males who receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, there is a transient surge of luteinizing hormone before the luteinizing hormone levels fall. This surge can cause an increase in serum testosterone, which may rarely result in a worsening of disease in males with metastatic cancer. This "flare phenomenon" may be of particular concern in clinical settings such as impending epidural spinal cord compression or urinary tract outflow obstruction.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6929.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Ga-68 and F-18 PSMA PET/CT'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In another randomized phase II study (SABR-COMET) of 99 patients with cancer of a variety of primary tumors (16 with prostate cancer) and up to five metastatic lesions to any site (65 had bone metastases), when compared with palliative care alone (which included standard-fractionation RT with or without systemic chemotherapy), the use of SBRT for treatment of oligometastatic disease was associated with a significant improvement in five-year OS (42 versus 18 percent, p = 0.006) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A meta-analysis of 23 observational studies of SBRT for oligometastatic prostate cancer recurrence concluded that local control was excellent, with minimal severe or late toxicity, and among the five studies reporting this outcome, the average duration of ADT-free survival was approximately 20 months [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Several randomized trials exploring the benefit of SBRT for oligometastatic cancer, including prostate cancer, are ongoing or planned [<a href="#rid31">31-34</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6927.html" rel="external">"Side effects of androgen deprivation therapy"</a>.)</p><p>Serial evaluation of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the mainstay of testing. Consensus-based guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend testing PSA every three to six months during treatment for advanced prostate cancer [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Most clinicians make decisions about the need for radiographic evaluation based on changes in PSA values and/or the development of new symptoms. Therapeutic changes are usually not made based on a rising PSA alone.</p><p>If PSA levels do not fall in response to therapy or subsequently rise, the adequacy of testosterone suppression should be checked. We also routinely check serum testosterone levels every three months to ensure that they remain in the castrate range (&lt;50 ng/dL), although some advocate for lower levels [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p>PSA progression alone should generally not be the sole reason to change therapy in CSPC. Conventional imaging should be used to assess radiographic progression before making changes to the treatment approach. Assessment strategies during treatment for CSPC are the same as for castration-resistant prostate cancer and are discussed in more detail separately.
