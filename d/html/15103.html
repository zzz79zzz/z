The techniques for access to the peritoneal cavity, choice of access technique, placement locations, and port placement for single-incision surgery will be reviewed here. </p><p>Laparoscopic instruments and complications of laparoscopic access are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4874.html" rel="external">"Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88846.html" rel="external">"Complications of laparoscopic surgery"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H651891348"><span class="h1">ACCESS LOCATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laparoscopic port/trocars traverse the skin, subcutaneous fat, variable myofascial layers, preperitoneal fat, and parietal peritoneum. Knowledge of the anatomy of the abdominal wall is essential for the safe insertion of laparoscopic access devices. The fascial and muscular layers of the abdominal wall are variable depending upon specific location. Anatomy at typical laparoscopic access sites and related intra-abdominal anatomy are discussed below. Detailed anatomy of the abdominal wall is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3.html" rel="external">"Anatomy of the abdominal wall"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H376701638"><span class="h2">Midline abdomen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The midline abdominal wall is devoid of important vessels and nerves and is a preferred initial access site for many laparoscopic procedures. </p><p>The layers of the abdominal wall in the midline include skin, subcutaneous fat, and a fascial layer (the linea alba) that is a coalescence of the anterior and posterior rectus sheath  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77053" href="/d/graphic/77053.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The round ligament of the liver running within the falciform ligament attaches to the posterior aspect of the right rectus muscle in the upper midline abdominal wall as low down as the umbilicus. </p><p>Midline intra-abdominal structures from cranial to caudal include the liver, stomach, transverse colon, omentum, small intestine, sigmoid colon, and bladder. Decompression of the stomach with a nasogastric or orogastric tube and bladder decompression with a Foley catheter can maximize the view of the upper abdominal and pelvic operating fields and minimize risk for injury. Previous midline abdominal incision can be associated with significant underlying adhesions. Alternative access sites should be chosen. (See <a class="local">'Prior abdominal surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H376701645"><span class="h3">Umbilicus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transumbilical access is the most common location for establishing pneumoperitoneum with either the Veress needle or open (Hasson) technique. (See <a class="local">'Initial port placement'</a> below.) </p><p>The umbilicus is a fusion of fascial layers and is devoid of subcutaneous fat. The median umbilical ligament (ie, obliterated urachus) and paired medial umbilical ligaments (ie, obliterated umbilical arteries) are peritoneal folds that join together at the inferior margin of the umbilicus, forming a tough layer. A defect in the umbilical fascia with or without the presence of a mass suggests an umbilical hernia  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72970" href="/d/graphic/72970.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Anomalies of the urachus may also exist  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79324" href="/d/graphic/79324.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). If an umbilical hernia or urachal anomaly is suspected, alternative access sites may need to be considered. (See <a class="local">'Umbilical hernia'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H376701652"><span class="h2">Medial costal margin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laparoscopic access at the costal margin can be useful for a variety of upper abdominal laparoscopic procedures. The abdominal wall is better supported nearer the muscular attachments to the ribcage as the access needle or port passes during entry [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This typically provides less deformation of the abdominal wall during access. (See <a class="local">'Secondary port placement'</a> below.) </p><p>Along the medial costal margin, the layers of the abdominal wall include the skin, subcutaneous fat, anterior rectus fascia, rectus muscle, posterior rectus fascia, transversalis fascia, transversus abdominis muscle, preperitoneal fat, and parietal peritoneum  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77053" href="/d/graphic/77053.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The superior epigastric artery runs along the underside of the rectus muscle in its midline. The region where the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversalis fascia fuse immediately lateral to the rectus muscle (linea semilunaris) contains no vessels.</p><p>The liver descends below the rib margin 1 to 3 cm on the right, and a prominent left lateral segment may also be present on the left. The body of the stomach and transverse colon are in proximity. Decompression of the stomach with a nasogastric tube or orogastric tube should be performed to maximize the view of the upper abdomen. The presence of a subcostal incision(s) (eg, Kocher, chevron) is likely to be associated with significant underlying adhesions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4180978050"><span class="h2">Ninth left intercostal space</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ninth left intercostal space is another, although uncommon, site that is useful for primary insufflation of the abdomen when other sites are not available. (See <a class="local">'Special considerations for initial access'</a> below.)</p><p>The intercostal space is accessed in the anterior axillary line close to the superior margin of the tenth rib. This site approximates the inferior margin of the posterior spleen. The splenic flexure of the colon is also in proximity, making this access point more challenging than more medial sites.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H376701666"><span class="h2">Lateral abdomen/flank</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Palmer's point is located 3 cm below the left costal margin, just lateral to the rectus muscle in the midclavicular line. Like the left ninth intercostal location, Palmer's point can also be used as a site for initial insufflation of the abdomen with a Veress needle when a transumbilical site cannot be used or is not preferred [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A right-sided approach can be used as well. (See <a class="local">'Special considerations for initial access'</a> below.)</p><p>Lateral abdominal and flank access sites are also commonly used for the placement of retracting instruments. (See <a class="local">'Secondary port placement'</a> below.)</p><p>Lateral to the rectus muscle, the layers of the abdominal wall include the skin, subcutaneous fat, fascia and muscle of the external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis (outward to inward), preperitoneal fat, and parietal peritoneum  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77053" href="/d/graphic/77053.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66280" href="/d/graphic/66280.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The deep nerves and vessels of the abdominal wall run parallel to each other traveling along the posterior surface of the internal oblique  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71423" href="/d/graphic/71423.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81343" href="/d/graphic/81343.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H376701673"><span class="h2">Hypogastrium</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Access sites in the hypogastric region are used for laparoscopic surgery on pelvic structures. (See <a class="local">'Secondary port placement'</a> below.)</p><p>Many arteries and nerves traverse the hypogastric region to supply the abdominal wall, including the inferior and superficial epigastric arteries, superficial and deep iliac circumflex arteries, and iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71423" href="/d/graphic/71423.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81343" href="/d/graphic/81343.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). The location of port sites in the lower abdomen should be chosen to avoid these vessels and nerves. If the vessels are not obvious prior to laparoscopic access, the laparoscope can be used to transilluminate the abdominal wall and identify the vessels. Access just medial and superior to the anterior superior iliac spine avoids these structures [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H651891356"><span class="h1">INITIAL PORT PLACEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laparoscopic entry can be performed with an open (ie, Hasson) or closed (eg, Veress needle, optical entry trocar) technique. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and neither is suitable as an all-purpose method for laparoscopic access. Different approaches can be used for primary and secondary port placement during the same procedure. (See <a class="local">'Choice of technique'</a> below.) </p><p>Initial access for abdominal insufflation is most commonly performed at the umbilicus. Open access techniques can be performed anywhere on the abdominal wall. Alternative sites for Veress needle insufflation include the lateral border of the rectus muscle 3 cm below the left costal margin (ie, Palmer's point) and the lateral border of the rectus muscle at the level of the iliac crest. Sites that have not been previously instrumented are preferred for initial access, and mesh should be avoided. (See <a class="local">'Access locations'</a> above.)</p><p>Prior to peritoneal access, we decompress the stomach and/or bladder to minimize the likelihood of bowel or bladder injury, depending on the point of entry. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88846.html" rel="external">"Complications of laparoscopic surgery", section on 'Entry-related bowel injuries'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88846.html" rel="external">"Complications of laparoscopic surgery", section on 'Entry-related bladder injuries'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H651891364"><span class="h2">Open (Hasson)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Hasson technique refers to an open method in which an incision (usually periumbilical) is made through the abdominal wall under direct vision [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The advantage of the open technique is the direct visualization of all layers of the abdominal wall during entry [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p>Even though the Hasson technique is most commonly used in the periumbilical region, this method can be used anywhere on the abdominal wall and is particularly useful when there is a concern for abdominal wall adhesions in a patient with a prior laparotomy. (See <a class="local">'Prior abdominal surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>This technique generally adds to the length of the procedure, taking longer to perform at the beginning and the end of the procedure compared with a closed (Veress needle) technique. It also tends to create a larger fascial defect to close at the completion of the procedure. (See <a class="local">'Choice of technique'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H159864991"><span class="h3">Procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To access the abdomen using an open technique:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Make an incision in the skin. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bluntly dissect the subcutaneous fat with a clamp (tonsil, Kelly). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cauterize, or ligate and divide, any vessels that are encountered. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Place Kocher clamps on the fascia or umbilical stalk (if utilizing periumbilical region).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Incise the fascia until a small amount of preperitoneal fat is identified.

(See <a class="local">'Fascial closure'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H651891372"><span class="h2">Closed (Veress needle)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Veress needle technique refers to a closed method in which the Veress needle (named for Janos Veres) is used to puncture through the layers of the abdominal wall. This technique was popularized by Raoul Palmer in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>The Veress needle, originally developed to give patients with tuberculosis iatrogenic pneumothorax without damaging the underlying lung parenchyma, is a small-bore (2 mm) needle with a spring-loaded protective obturator that recoils to cover the end of the needle, allowing entry into a body cavity without traumatizing the underlying organs  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80571" href="/d/graphic/80571.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). </p><p>When the needle enters the peritoneal cavity, the clinician usually feels or hears the protective sheath/obturator "click" when it recoils, indicating that the needle tip no longer has resistance against its tip. This click generally indicates that the peritoneal cavity has been entered; however, this click can also be felt if the tip of the device is within a hollow viscus inadvertently, and one of several confirmatory techniques is generally used before insufflating through the needle.</p><p>The Veress needle technique allows for a quick entry into the peritoneal cavity since direct cutdown to the fascia level and suture closure of the access site are not needed, provided a ≤12 mm trocar is used. (See <a class="local">'Fascial closure'</a> below.)</p><p>The most common insertion site for the Veress technique is the umbilicus because there is no fat or muscle between the skin and peritoneum at this location. Transumbilical insertion is contraindicated when umbilical abnormalities (eg, umbilical hernia) are present or there is a concern for underlying adhesions from a prior surgery. (See <a class="local">'Umbilical hernia'</a> below.)</p><p>A disadvantage of closed umbilical access is an increased risk of major vascular complications compared with the open technique according to some studies [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. The distance between the base of the umbilical stalk and the aorta is generally less than 4 cm and as little as 2 cm in thin individuals. For this reason, some surgeons advocate using a site other than the umbilicus if the Veress technique for abdominal insufflation is chosen. If the midline is used, upward retraction is imperative to provide resistance and limit the amount of downward force exerted on the needle. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88846.html" rel="external">"Complications of laparoscopic surgery", section on 'Vascular injuries'</a>.)</p><p>Alternative sites to establish pneumoperitoneum when the umbilicus cannot be used or is not preferred for closed access include other points in the midline, the medial costal margin, the ninth left intercostal space, the lateral border of the rectus muscle 3 cm below the left costal margin (ie, Palmer's point), and the lateral border of the rectus muscle at the level of the iliac crest. (See <a class="local">'Access locations'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H159864998"><span class="h3">Procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To access the abdomen with a closed approach using a Veress needle:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Estimate the length of Veress needle needed to reach the peritoneal cavity. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Make a 5 mm incision in the skin and the subcutaneous tissue.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Place the needle through the incision to the level of the fascia, mark the depth on the needle, then remove the needle. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grasp the fascia (eg, manually, Kocher clamp) and elevate the abdominal wall, unless a subcostal site is used [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. It is important to note that grasping only the skin while not including the fascia may increase the rate of failed entry [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grasp the Veress needle just above the previously marked site and insert it through the incision at a 45 degree angle toward the hollow of the pelvis, or away from fixed viscera, with care not to deviate in laterally. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Feel for two "pops." The first occurs when the needle passes through the abdominal fascia and the second as it passes through the parietal peritoneum. More lateral access sites may have additional "pops" if more than one layer of fascia is traversed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When the needle enters the peritoneal space, the displaced hub of the needle will "click" as the protective sheath recoils to cover the end of the needle. An intra-abdominal needle will also move more freely than a needle within the abdominal wall.</p><p></p><p>Several methods are available for confirming Veress needle placement; however, no trials are available to suggest the use of one method over another. These include one of the following [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">Saline</a> aspiration and injection: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Attach a 10 mL syringe containing 4 mL of normal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> to the Veress needle hub. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Aspirate with the syringe.

Introduce the trocar perpendicular to the skin for 2 to 3 cm, and then increase the angle of introduction to between 45 degrees and approximately 60 degrees in the direction of the area of interest within the abdomen. Control of the force and depth of trocar/port should be maintained at all times. Excessive pressure to overcome skin or fascial resistance can lead to uncontrolled trocar entry, which increases the risk of injury to bowel or other abdominal or retroperitoneal structures. One useful technique is to gently twist the trocar while exerting firm downward pressure. We prefer to bluntly enlarge a narrow incision or, alternatively, to change to an open (Hasson) method, rather than increasing the force placed upon the instrument. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Yet another approach is to use a trocar system designed to maintain the Veress needle track. Commercially available Veress needles with a radially dilating expandable sleeve are available (eg, Versa Step).

A blunt, dilating trocar/obturator system can then be inserted along the sleeve track without change in direction from the initial needle entry. </p><p></p><p>Listen for a rush of gas from the peritoneal cavity, which indicates that the proper trocar depth has been reached.

Hyperdistention elevates the abdominal wall off the abdominal organs and provides better support for the trocar. This technique is useful for very thin patients and patients with obesity [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Clinically significant adverse effects on cardiopulmonary function have not been observed with brief periods of hyperdistention, provided the patient is not in Trendelenburg position [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].

The hernia can then be closed primarily at the completion of the case if the defect is small (&lt;2 cm). Larger defects may be associated with significant adhesions and will likely require mesh hernia repair to minimize the risk of recurrence. Under this circumstance, access away from the umbilicus is suggested (eg, subcostal location) to facilitate visualization of the hernia and to perform lysis of adhesions, if needed. The management of umbilical hernias is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Therefore, care should be taken when placing the initial port. There is interest in using bedside ultrasound imaging to detect abdominal wall areas free from critical adhesions in order to facilitate port placement in laparoscopic surgery [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. However, this technique requires further study before it can be recommended for general use.</p><p>Once the abdomen is insufflated and the primary port placed, the peritoneum should be inspected to determine whether adhesiolysis is needed prior to the placement of additional ports. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H376701758"><span class="h4">Obesity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with obesity, longer trocars and Veress needles may be needed due to the thickness of the abdominal wall.

The pannus can be retracted caudally, for better positioning and to thin the abdominal wall [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Skin folds on the abdominal wall should be avoided. During Veress needle placement, a 90-degree insertion angle is used to maximize the available needle length. The use of dilating trocars may reduce the incidence of postoperative hernia [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Choice of technique'</a> above.)</p><p>Instrument mobility may also be limited depending upon the depth of the subcutaneous fat.

Other gases have also been tried, including <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10086" href="/d/drug information/10086.html" rel="external">nitrous oxide</a> and helium; however, the safety of these agents has yet to be established [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. </p><p>CO<sub>2</sub> gas can be administered cold or heated, with or without humidification. Compared with cold gas, heated gas led to only a minimal, clinically insignificant rise in core body temperature of 0.31°C (95% CI 0.09-0.53) without any meaningful improvement in patient outcomes or ease of surgery. Thus, the extra cost of heating and/or humidifying gas used in laparoscopy cannot be justified, according to a Cochrane review of 22 randomized trials [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>The rate of CO<sub>2</sub> gas flow is set low initially. Furthermore, a Veress needle will only allow a maximum flow rate of 3 L/min if this is the technique used. The pressure will initially be &lt;10 mmHg but will slowly increase. If the pressure rapidly increases to the target pressure, then the needle/port may be displaced or occluded. The abdominal wall should be grasped and gently elevated. This will dislodge any omentum or bowel that may be blocking the opening of the needle or port. Changing the angle or rotating the trocar or Veress needle can also help free the opening. Ensure that the stopcock on the port is in the correct "open" position and that there are no severe kinks in the insufflation tubing. If none of these maneuvers reduce the increased pressure to an acceptable level, the needle or port should be removed and replaced.</p><p>After abdominal, and not extraperitoneal, insufflation is confirmed, the gas flow can be increased to its full flow rate while the intra-abdominal pressure is monitored automatically by the insufflator. The gas flows into the abdomen only if the abdominal pressure falls below the preset pressure. The target intra-abdominal pressure is usually preset to 12 to 15 mmHg per surgeon preference. A lower target pressure may be feasible for some patients undergoing some procedures, which may reduce postoperative pain. As an example, pressures lower than 12 mmHg have been used successfully in laparoscopic cholecystectomy without apparent increases in complications or conversion rates, but with lower rates of shoulder pain [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Minimizing access-related pain'</a> below.)</p><p>The necessary volume of gas needed for insufflation is dependent upon the depth of anesthesia, use of neuromuscular blockade, and the patient's size. Visual and manual examination (ie, tympany upon palpation) of the abdomen confirms that adequate pneumoperitoneum has been achieved. </p><p>During insufflation, increased intra-abdominal pressure stimulates the neurohumoral vasoactive systems, resulting in increased heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance while decreasing vital capacity, venous return, preload, and cardiac output. In otherwise healthy patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 1 or 2, these physiologic effects are not detrimental if intra-abdominal pressure does not exceed 15 mmHg and diminish as the patient's physiology accommodates. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88846.html" rel="external">"Complications of laparoscopic surgery", section on 'Physiologic effect of pneumoperitoneum'</a>.)</p><p>The CO<sub>2</sub> gas causes hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis due to absorption of the gas across the peritoneal surface [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Endogenous buffering systems and accelerated elimination of CO<sub>2</sub> via the lungs prevent clinically significant acidosis under normal circumstances. Monitoring end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is mandatory, and minute volume should be increased to maintain a normal CO<sub>2</sub> level [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Arrhythmias are a potentially serious consequence of hypercarbia [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Renal parenchymal compression and decreased renal blood flow may result in temporary oliguria, which typically resolves upon release of pneumoperitoneum [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H651891714"><span class="h1">SECONDARY PORT PLACEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Secondary ports should always be placed with the abdomen insufflated with direct observation with the laparoscope of the trocar entering the abdomen. A variety of trocar/port combinations are commercially available for laparoscopy. Each combines a tube with a sealing mechanism to maintain pneumoperitoneum and may be nondisposable or disposable, and visible or opaque.</p><p>The port locations for various laparoscopic surgeries depend upon the location in the abdomen where most of the surgical procedure is to take place. Typically, the operating surgeon should be standing opposite this location. Multiple access sites are chosen to maintain a comfortable operating position for the surgeon, with triangulation of the instruments around the surgical focal point within the abdomen, while minimizing collision between the surgeon's hands, or between the port and the patient's body (bony prominences, thigh) or the operating table. </p><p>Depending upon the largest instrument needed for a particular port, the appropriate-sized trocar should be used. A ≥12 mm trocar is needed for surgical staplers, and a ≥10 mm trocar is needed for other specialized surgical instruments (eg, Endo Stitch). In general, the smallest size port possible that still permits a safe operation should be used to minimize the risk of subsequent incisional hernia, seroma, and pain.

The resected sigmoid colon can be removed through a mini-laparotomy at the umbilicus, similar to the right colectomy, transrectally or through a small Pfannenstiel incision.

Review of preoperative imaging in cases of splenomegaly can be of great value in helping the surgeon determine the best location for initial port placement.</p><p>A port is placed in the left flank region in the anterior axillary line between the left subcostal margin and the left iliac crest under direct vision. This port is used to pass a stapler (12 mm) to transect the hilar vessels after dissection has been completed. Two other 5 mm ports are placed for dissection and countertraction.</p><p>After the hilum has been transected and the perisplenic attachments are divided, the spleen is captured into a large laparoscopic bag placed through the primary port site and is removed by morcellation (crushing and tearing with ring forceps).

Large defects may require bilateral port placement. A reasonable location for initial access is laterally within the quadrant furthest from the site of the hernia.

Primary access is obtained at the umbilicus using an open (Hasson) or Veress needle technique. For manipulation of pelvic structures, ports are placed, bilaterally as needed, in the lower quadrants, or, occasionally, lateral to the rectus muscle low in the abdomen at the level of the umbilicus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58323" href="/d/graphic/58323.html" rel="external">figure 19</a>).

Fascial defects at ports &lt;10 mm (mostly 5 mm ports) do not need to be closed [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>Fascial reapproximation can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Ideally, the fascia is directly visualized with the aid of retractors. The fascial edges are grasped and sutured closed with interrupted or continuous suture. A number of specialized instruments have been devised for port site fascial closure (eg, Grice suture needle, Carter-Thomason needle-point suture passer, Endo Close instrument, Reverdin suture needle) which can be used per surgeon preference.</p><p>Port sites established in a region of prior mesh should be closed with permanent suture. Otherwise, port sites can be closed with either permanent or absorbable sutures per surgeon preference. However, closure of the fascial defect does not guarantee that a hernia will not develop at that site. According to a 2020 systematic review, closed and open 5 and 10 mm ports had similar hernia rate [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Trocar site hernia is discussed elsewhere.

There is no consensus on the nomenclature for this approach; SILS (single-incision laparoscopic surgery) and LESS (laparoendoscopic single-incision surgery) are the most commonly used terms and were introduced by industry [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p>A specially designed single multichannel port provides access for the laparoscope as well as several other laparoscopic instruments. Multiple colocated trocars can also be used. Commercially available single port systems vary in diameter, which determines the length of fascial incision needed (1.2 to 7 cm), and in the number of channels and their diameters (three to four channels, ranging from 5 to 15 mm). </p><p>In general, these devices are all typically placed at the umbilicus with an open technique  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85541" href="/d/graphic/85541.html" rel="external">figure 20</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64522" href="/d/graphic/64522.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). The length of the incision is dictated by the diameter of the device, and the choice of a transverse versus vertical incision depends upon the anatomy of the umbilicus. The surgeon should select the orientation to maximize incision length within the umbilicus. To improve cosmesis, the incision should be kept within the umbilical ring as much as possible.</p><p>The indications and contraindications for a single-incision surgery are the same as for conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery. Single-incision surgery techniques are in development in many abdominal and pelvic surgery fields (eg, general surgery, surgical oncology, gynecology, urology, pediatric surgery) [<a href="#rid33">33-38</a>]. Robotic assistance or other novel platforms may be useful when performing single-incision surgery. </p><p>The main theoretical advantage of single-incision laparoscopy is a potentially "scarless" abdomen when the incision is placed within or around the umbilicus. However, studies have associated single-incision laparoscopy with an almost three-fold increase in the odds of postoperative incisional hernia compared with traditional multiport laparoscopy (2.2 versus 0.7 percent) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. This has led to a decline in the use of singles-site laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, the performance of single-incision versus multiport laparoscopy also vary by the procedure [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 14 trials of cholecystectomy, single-incision surgery had longer operative time, similar length of hospital stay, less early postoperative pain, better cosmesis, but more complications (especially hernias) than conventional multiport laparoscopy [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. In another meta-analysis which studied incisional hernias separately from other complications, single-incision laparoscopic surgery resulted in three times more incisional hernias than conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 17 trials of appendectomy, single-incision surgery had longer operative time, but better cosmesis than multiport laparoscopy.

All other outcomes, including pain and complications, were comparable [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 10 trials of colorectal cancer resection, single-incision surgery had fewer postoperative but a greater number of intraoperative complications, longer operative time, shorter hospital stay, and shorter abdominal incisions than multiport laparoscopy [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 13 trials of benign gynecologic surgery, single-incision surgery resulted in no significant reduction in postoperative pain compared with multiport laparoscopy. Cosmetic outcome was reported in six of the 13 studies; four of the six demonstrated a superior cosmetic satisfaction in the single-site surgery group. Additionally single-incision hysterectomy had a longer operating time and a higher conversion rate; single-incision myomectomy had a higher conversion rate [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Compared with conventional laparoscopy, single-incision laparoscopy is more challenging due to several technical factors, including loss of triangulation and depth perception because the camera and working instruments are parallel with each other, reduced range of motion for the instruments, limited extra-abdominal working space with creation of a "hand clashing" problem, and decreased field of view due to suboptimal instrument or camera position [<a href="#rid32">32,40</a>]. Specialized training is needed to overcome these challenges, which may be associated with a learning curve [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Specialized instrumentation and advances in laparoscopic techniques have helped minimize some of the problems inherent to single-incision surgery.

Alternative access can be laparoscopic unless the bleeding is significant, in which case open laparotomy is warranted. </p><p>Any failed entry site should be inspected to assess for any associated injury, which, when identified, is appropriately repaired.<strong> </strong>If entry fails but there is no complication, access can be reattempted at the same site. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H860569904"><span class="h2">Leaking port</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If a port or single-incision device leaks gas during a procedure, it is usually due to the fascial defect being too large or excess port angulation. Balloon-tipped trocars can be helpful. Leaks can also be mitigated with additional sutures or the placement of a towel clamp to cinch the tissue closed around the trocar. Petrolatum-coated gauze may also be used to reduce the flow of any air leak. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H860569911"><span class="h2">Sliding port</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If a port is sliding within the abdominal wall, the port may need to be repositioned and/or secured with additional sutures. Even ports not specifically designed to be sutured in place (ie, no rings or suture stays) can be easily secured using a drain or "sandal"-type stitch. The use of longer or larger-diameter trocars or balloon/expandable-tip trocars may also be helpful. Many Hasson trocars have an adjustable plug that permits the cannula to be secured to various depths with a lock mechanism to prevent the port from changing position.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H860569919"><span class="h2">Bleeding port</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The vessels of the abdominal wall can be injured during the access procedure. Access sites are carefully chosen to avoid these vessels. (See <a class="local">'Access locations'</a> above.)</p><p>Bleeding from the abdominal wall may not become apparent until after the port is removed, because the port may tamponade muscular or subcutaneous bleeding. In addition to visually inspecting the access site upon its creation, the site should also be inspected during and following removal of the port. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88846.html" rel="external">"Complications of laparoscopic surgery", section on 'Minor vessels'</a>.)</p><p>Bleeding points can usually be identified and managed with electrocautery. On occasion, the skin incision may need to be enlarged to control the bleeding. Alternatively, U-stitches can be placed into the abdominal wall under direct laparoscopic visualization using a suture passer with absorbable braided suture. Care must be taken to suture proximal and distal to the injured portion of the vessel. A number of specialized instruments have been devised for port site fascial closure, and these may also be useful for managing abdominal wall bleeding.

(See <a class="local">'Leaking port'</a> above.)</p><p>Under some circumstances, the established pneumoperitoneum may need to be temporarily released (eg, patient intolerance, hemodynamic instability, for portions of some surgical procedures) or is lost due to a leaking port or equipment malfunction. Most trocars have stopcock valves to easily release pneumoperitoneum if this is required. To reinstitute pneumoperitoneum, the stopcock can be turned back in line with the gas flow. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H860569933"><span class="h2">Extraperitoneal insufflation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Subcutaneous, preperitoneal, or omental insufflation can occur with any access technique. Intraperitoneal placement of the Veress needle or Hasson trocar may have initially been confirmed. However, if the device is inadvertently withdrawn out of the peritoneum, subcutaneous insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> gas will occur and insufflation pressure will quickly rise to ≥15 mmHg. The abdominal wall distends but is not tympanitic, and crepitus instead will be noted in the subcutaneous tissues. </p><p>Subcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation may increase the end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, and anesthesia personnel should be notified if extraperitoneal insufflation has occurred. Small amounts of extraperitoneal air are usually quickly resorbed once intraperitoneal insufflation is achieved. In older adults, and patients with compromised tissue integrity (eg, collagen, vascular, or mixed connective tissue disorders), subcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation can progress rapidly, quickly reaching the chest wall, neck, and face.

It is generally considered a referred pain due to irritation of the diaphragm (by fluid, blood, or the carbonic acid created from the mixing of carbon dioxide gas and intraperitoneal water) or stretching of the phrenic nerves during the procedure [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. </p><p>Pain from trocar placement is expected but can be minimized by using the least number of ports required to perform the procedure safely, minimizing the number of large ports (ie, ≥10 mm), and injecting local anesthetic at the port sites either before or at the end of the procedure [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p>The primary measure to reduce access-related pain relating to insufflation is to reduce the initial insufflation rate and insufflation pressure [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of 44 trials comparing low-pressure (&lt;10 mmHg) pneumoperitoneum with standard-pressure (≥10 mmHg) pneumoperitoneum in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy reported that the low-pressure group had significantly lower pain scores up to postoperative day two and a lower incidence of shoulder pain [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial port placement</strong> – Initial laparoscopic access can be performed with open (ie, Hasson) or closed (eg, Veress needle, visual entry) techniques. Overall complication rates are not significantly different between the open and closed techniques. Thus, surgeons can adhere to the technique with which they have the most experience. (See <a class="local">'Choice of technique'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Initial access for abdominal insufflation is most commonly performed at the umbilicus. Open access techniques can be performed anywhere on the abdominal wall. Alternative sites for Veress needle insufflation include the lateral border of the rectus muscle 3 cm below the left costal margin (ie, Palmer's point) and the lateral border of the rectus muscle at the level of the iliac crest. Sites that have not been previously instrumented are preferred for initial access, and mesh should be avoided. (See <a class="local">'Access locations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Establishing pneumoperitoneum</strong> – Once peritoneal access is established, the abdomen is insufflated, typically with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) gas to a standard pressure of 12 to 15 mmHg. A lower insufflation pressure is feasible in some patients for some procedures and may reduce postoperative pain. (See <a class="local">'Establishing pneumoperitoneum'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Secondary port placement</strong> – All secondary ports should be placed with the abdomen insufflated and the surgeon observing the trocar entering the abdomen laparoscopically. The locations for secondary ports are chosen to be in-line with the camera while maintaining triangulation and adequate spacing between the surgeon’s hands. (See <a class="local">'Secondary port placement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fascial closure</strong> – For ports placed with the open (Hasson) technique or ports ≥10 mm, we suggest closing the fascia with suture to reduce the risk of developing a port-site hernia (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Fascial defects at smaller port sites (&lt;10 mm) do not need to be closed. (See <a class="local">'Fascial closure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Single-incision laparoscopic surgery</strong> – Single-incision surgery refers to a laparoscopic access technique that uses a single multichannel platform, usually placed at the umbilicus with open technique, to accommodate the laparoscope and multiple instruments. Compared with conventional multiport laparoscopy, single-incision surgery can improve cosmesis and early postoperative pain, but may incur more incisional hernias and require specialized equipment and training. (See <a class="local">'Single-incision laparoscopic surgery'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trouble-shooting access issues</strong> – Access-related issues, including failed entry, extraperitoneal insufflation, leaking or bleeding ports, and loss of port position or pneumoperitoneum, are unique to laparoscopic surgery. Troubleshooting these issues should be approached in a systematic manner to minimize the loss of time and prevent the development of other complications.
