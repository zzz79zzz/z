         Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a widely available, reproducible, noninvasive ultrasound imaging modality for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of cardiac anatomy and function [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography provides tomographic or "thin slice" imaging of cardiac structures from multiple imaging planes. Comprehensive echocardiographic examination typically involves integrating imaging of the heart from multiple "viewing" orientations in order to fully visualize cardiac structures. Doppler imaging is utilized in TTE to obtain information about cardiac hemodynamics and valvular function (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5315.html" rel="external">
          "Principles of Doppler echocardiography"
         </a>
         ). TTE is often used as a first-line cardiac imaging modality owing to its wide availability, noninvasiveness, and lack of radiation exposure. In cases where additional imaging is needed to assess cardiac structure or function, modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and/or cardiac computed tomography may be utilized.
        </p>
        <p>
         Echocardiography machines equipped with three-dimensional (3D) capability have been developed to overcome the disadvantages of 2D imaging [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. These devices generally acquire a volumetric data set which can then be displayed in custom orientations. Due to the specific clinical advantages of 3D echocardiography, this modality has gained increasing clinical importance, particularly in the assessment of morphology in valvular disease. (See

         The nomenclature, standard protocol, and normal views associated with TTE are reviewed here. The instrumentation and physics associated with echocardiography, along with discussions of various echocardiographic techniques, are presented separately. (See

         Each tomographic view is defined by the transducer position (parasternal, apical, subcostal, suprasternal) and view (eg, long-axis, short-axis, four-chamber, five-chamber, two-chamber). Transducer position is altered by placing the transducer at various locations on the thorax, while the view is manipulated by a combination of angulation and rotation. Due to limitations imposed by the thoracic skeleton and lungs, not all permutations of both variables result in clinically useful images.

         While acceptance is not universal, most labs follow the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography with respect to image display [

          5

         ]. With this convention, the transducer position is depicted at the top of the screen, with anatomy more distant from the transducer depicted at progressively lower regions of the display, the lateral/left structures to the right, and medial/right structures to the left. A linear calibration scale is provided for all two-dimensional (2D) and M-mode measurements.

         Most echocardiography laboratories follow a fairly standard protocol for transducer orientation, beginning with parasternal views and progressing to apical, subcostal, and suprasternal positions. Almost all imaging is performed with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position during quiet respiration or extended expiration. A cutout in the examination table mattress is helpful for maintaining optimal imaging position. While right-handed scanning was initially more common, left-handed scanning has been shown to be better ergonomically and to have a reduced chance of sonographer orthopedic injuries. As a result, this form of scanning now predominates.

         With the transducer in the third or fourth left intercostal space, immediately adjacent to the sternum, a long-axis view of the heart is obtained that bisects the aortic and mitral valve  (

         The most anterior cardiac structure is the right ventricular outflow tract. Epicardial fat, sometimes mimicking an anterior pericardial effusion, can be detected.

         The proximal structures of the ascending aorta (aortic root, sinotubular junction of the right and noncoronary sinuses), and the right (anterior) and noncoronary (posterior) leaflets of the aortic valve can be visualized. The aortic leaflets may be seen opening during ventricular systole with central coaptation (if tricuspid) point with ventricular diastole.

         The anterior and posterior mitral leaflets are also well delineated with the anterior leaflet appearing "longer." During early ventricular diastole, the anterior leaflet extends anteriorly, towards the interventricular septum, while the posterior leaflet moves posteriorly towards the inferolateral left ventricular wall. The leaflets then "drift" closed in mid-diastole, followed by a reopening during atrial systole. Ventricular systole results in leaflet closure.

         Posterior to the ascending aorta, and normally equal in diameter, is the left atrium. The right pulmonary artery can be seen superior to the left atrium as it crosses under the ascending aorta. The coronary sinus, usually less than 1 cm in diameter, may be seen immediately posterior to the mitral annulus. It can be distinguished from the descending thoracic aorta as the latter is external to the pericardium.

At the basal (aortic valve) level, the atria and their interatrial septum, septal and anterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve, right ventricular free wall, right ventricular outflow tract, pulmonic valve, and main pulmonary artery can be seen "surrounding" the centrally oriented aortic valve  (

         The subcostal four-chamber view is a useful orientation for measurement of right ventricular dimensions and wall thickness as well as for visualizing anterior pericardial effusions.

         In cases in which parasternal views are inadequate, rotation of the probe from the subcostal four-chamber orientation will permit acquisition of a subcostal short-axis view at the base and midventricle.

         Right parasternal views may be helpful, particularly in patients with a dilated ascending aorta, and for assessment of aortic valve gradients in aortic stenosis patients.

         Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the primary noninvasive imaging modality for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of cardiac anatomy and function. Two-dimensional TTE provides tomographic or "thin slice" imaging, with each tomographic view defined by the transducer position (parasternal, apical, subcostal, suprasternal) and view (long-axis, short-axis, four-chamber, five-chamber). (See

         Most echocardiography laboratories follow a standard protocol for consecutive transducer positions, beginning with parasternal long- and short-axis views and progressing to apical four-, five-, two-, and three-chamber views, followed by subcostal, and suprasternal positions. Almost all imaging is performed with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position during quiet respiration or extended expiration. The subcostal views, however, are best obtained with the patient supine in full inspiration to bring the heart closer to the imaging probe and with the knees bent to relax the abdominal musculature.
