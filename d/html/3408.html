Acute toxicity develops during or shortly after the completion of treatment and is usually temporary. Late toxicity presents months to years after the completion of treatment and is often permanent. The term "complication" is used for a treatment toxicity that causes an important medical problem.</p><p>This topic will review the care of patients with head and neck cancer during their initial therapy, both to treat acute toxicity and to prevent late complications. The management of late complications is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3365.html" rel="external">"Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1057183973"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">Spectrum of issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract are in close proximity to organs vital to a patient's quality of life (eg, tongue, larynx, mandible), and they often emanate from such organs. The involvement of these structures with cancer and the steps needed to eradicate the malignancy can cause a wide spectrum of toxicities.</p><p>The most basic toxicities are impairments in the ability to maintain adequate oral intake, breathe, and communicate. Oral intake is compromised by swallowing problems (eg, dysphagia, odynophagia, and possible late esophageal stricture), poor taste (ie, dysgeusia), trismus, xerostomia, and mucositis. Respiration and communication can be compromised by bulky tumors, neuromuscular impairment secondary to tumor growth, or an edematous pharynx and/or larynx. In addition, patients can experience acute cutaneous toxicity from both radiation therapy (RT) and targeted therapy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9209" href="/d/drug information/9209.html" rel="external">cetuximab</a>), as well as more subacute or chronic toxicity, such as soft tissue necrosis, scarring, and fibrosis. </p><p>Other long-term treatment-related sequelae include neurotoxicity from both chemotherapy (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>) and RT, osteoradionecrosis, carotid artery injury, lymphedema, thyroid damage, and dental complications from RT to the mandible, maxilla, and salivary glands. The management of late complications is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3365.html" rel="external">"Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment"</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of these tumors is complex and best handled by a coordinated team involving surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, dentists, oral surgeons, speech pathologists, physical/occupational therapists, nutritionists, and skilled nurses.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h3">Surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most surgical complications are subsite specific. Common to any of the surgical procedures is the possibility of cosmetic deformities or functional impairment. With the development of soft tissue transfers, advances in surgical techniques, and organ preservation approaches, these are less common than they were in the past.</p><p>Nonetheless, major or even minor surgical defects in these areas may be very evident because of their location on the face and neck, resulting in emotional and psychological distress. (See <a class="local">'Anxiety and depression'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Radiation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most RT toxicity can be divided into acute toxicity, which is often unavoidable but transient, and late toxicity, which is generally long lasting and often permanent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3365.html" rel="external">"Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Acute toxicity is arbitrarily defined as events that happen during RT or within 90 days after the commencement of treatment, while intermediate to late toxicity develops beyond that point. Severe acute toxicity can evolve into late toxicity.</p><p>RT toxicity is governed by multiple factors, including cumulative dose and fractionation schedule, treatment volume, patient genetics (pharmacogenomics), and the use of concurrent systemic therapy. While a sophisticated understanding of dose-response relationships for normal tissues of interest (eg, parotid gland, larynx, pharyngeal constrictors) can reduce late toxicity, efforts to minimize acute toxicity have been less successful. The simplest and most important way to minimize acute toxicity is to deliver RT with precise targeting and timing, thus avoiding unnecessary overtreatment with excessively large target volumes or doses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3409.html" rel="external">"Definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Dose and fractionation considerations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3392.html" rel="external">"Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3406.html" rel="external">"General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, the complications of chemotherapy given for head and neck cancer are not unique to these patients. The most commonly used drugs include the platinum compounds (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a>), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a>, and the taxanes (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a>). Myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting are significant side effects with all of these agents. The acute and late toxicities of RT are exacerbated when chemotherapy is delivered concurrently [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Toxicities of particular note in the context of head and neck cancer treatment include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">Fluorouracil</a> commonly causes mucositis when given without RT. Fluorouracil is often given by prolonged infusion in head and neck cancer protocols; this regimen increases the incidence of mucositis and diarrhea, as well as cardiotoxicity and acral erythema (also called hand-foot syndrome or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), compared with daily intravenous bolus administration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1152.html" rel="external">"Oral toxicity associated with systemic anticancer therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2812.html" rel="external">"Cardiotoxicity of cancer chemotherapy agents other than anthracyclines, HER2-targeted agents, and fluoropyrimidines"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/142102.html" rel="external">"Toxic erythema of chemotherapy (hand-foot syndrome)", section on 'Hand-foot syndrome'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">Cisplatin</a> can cause peripheral neuropathy and ototoxicity during the initial course of therapy, and it is associated with significant nephrotoxicity if adequate hydration is not maintained.

Allergic reactions can usually be prevented by pretreatment with steroids. Fluid retention often occurs with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a>, and its onset can be delayed with concomitant treatment with corticosteroids [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].

All patients should receive counseling about the importance of smoking cessation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">"Overview of smoking cessation management in adults"</a>.)</p><p>As an example, one study evaluated 115 patients with head and neck cancer who were treated with RT with or without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The 53 patients who continued to smoke during RT had significantly lower rates of complete response and two-year survival compared with the 62 patients who did not smoke or who had quit prior to treatment (45 versus 74 percent and 39 versus 66 percent, respectively). Among nonsmoking patients, mortality rate was influenced by the duration since quitting smoking. Compared with patients who continued to smoke, the death rate was 40 percent lower in patients who had quit less than 12 weeks before and 70 percent lower in patients who had quit more than one year before diagnosis.</p><p>Although the epidemiology of head and neck cancer is changing with the emergence of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal cancer, the importance of smoking cessation has not changed. In an unplanned analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 01-29, the mortality in the HPV positive group was higher for those patients who were smokers compared with nonsmokers [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3378.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, staging, and clinical presentation of human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">SALIVARY GLAND DAMAGE AND XEROSTOMIA</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H722454123"><span class="h2">Acute injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The salivary glands would be expected to be a late responding tissue with little acute effects because of their slow cellular turnover (60 to 120 days). However, changes in the quantity and composition of saliva that occur shortly after the initiation of radiation therapy (RT) indicate that these glands exhibit both an acute response and a late response [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The etiology of the acute reaction of salivary gland cells is unclear [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. These effects are due to irradiation of both the major (parotid, submandibular, sublingual) salivary glands and the minor salivary glands that are scattered throughout the upper aerodigestive tract. Impaired oral intake due to mucositis or altered sensation of taste may also contribute to decreased saliva production. Comorbid conditions and the medications used to treat them may contribute significantly to the risk of both acute and long-term xerostomia. (See <a class="local">'Mucositis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Dysgeusia'</a> below.)</p><p>Temporary decreased saliva production becomes evident within one to two weeks after the initiation of RT, and permanent reduction can be noted with cumulative radiation doses as low as 10 to 15 Gy to the parotid gland [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. During and immediately after treatment, patients should be instructed to drink adequate fluids and to rinse and gargle with either a dilute solution of 25 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="113931" href="/d/drug information/113931.html" rel="external">hydrogen peroxide</a> and 75 percent water or a weak solution of salt and baking soda several times daily (one-half teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of baking soda added to one quart of water). This regimen can refresh the mouth, loosen thick, tenacious oral secretions, and alleviate pain due to mild mucositis. In our experience, the addition of timed-release formulations of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8503" href="/d/drug information/8503.html" rel="external">guaifenesin</a> can make the secretions thinner and more manageable.</p><p>Mean radiation doses to the parotid glands greater than 24 to 26 Gy cause permanent damage to the parotid glands, which typically results in more than a 75 percent reduction in salivary gland function [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. The radiation dose response of the submandibular gland and minor salivary glands of the oral cavity is less well defined than that of the parotid, but avoidance of these organs in a way that does not compromise target coverage and oncologic outcome is advised [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Xerostomia is the most prevalent late consequence of RT for head and neck cancer and can cause significant symptoms as well as contribute to other complications (eg, dental caries, nutritional issues).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H722454151"><span class="h2">Prevention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The use of contemporary conformal RT techniques to minimize exposure of the salivary glands to radiation is the most important factor in the prevention of permanent salivary gland damage. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8533" href="/d/drug information/8533.html" rel="external">Amifostine</a> and submandibular salivary gland transfer may have roles in appropriately selected patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H722454159"><span class="h3">Highly conformal RT technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The degree of xerostomia depends in large part upon the volume of salivary tissue irradiated. An important benefit of highly conformal RT approaches such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is decreased irradiation of the salivary glands and, therefore, less long-term damage. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3406.html" rel="external">"General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer", section on 'Intensity-modulated RT'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89528.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment", section on 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The importance of minimizing radiation to the salivary glands was demonstrated in the PARSPORT trial, in which 94 patients with pharyngeal cancer were randomly assigned to IMRT or conventional two-dimensional RT, with a dose of 60 to 65 Gy [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Grade 2 or worse xerostomia was less common with IMRT at both 12 and 24 months (38 versus 74 percent and 29 versus 83 percent, respectively). There were no significant differences in other toxicities or in tumor control.</p><p>Another prospective randomized trial also demonstrated improvements in observer-related severe xerostomia (39 versus 82 percent), stimulated parotid flow rate, and stimulated whole saliva flow rate among patients with nasopharyngeal cancer who were treated with IMRT rather than two-dimensional RT [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Unfortunately, patient-reported quality of life did not demonstrate a similar improvement.</p><p>It is unclear whether adjustments in the RT treatment volume during radiotherapy can further reduce the risk of xerostomia. A phase III trial that randomly assigned patients with oropharyngeal cancers who were receiving chemoradiotherapy to adaptive radiotherapy (ART) or IMRT did not find a significant decrease in xerostomia [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. A weekly replanning CT was acquired for patients treated with ART. Anatomical structures were adjusted but the clinical target volume 70 Gy (CTV70) largely was not (even in the setting of a complete imaging response). ART did not improve the primary endpoint of measured salivary flow, patient reported outcomes, or survival, although it increased a secondary endpoint of excretory function of the parotid gland measured using technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy at 12 months (48 versus 41 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H722454217"><span class="h3">Amifostine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8533" href="/d/drug information/8533.html" rel="external">Amifostine</a> is an organic thiophosphate that is thought to act by donating a protective thiol group that is a scavenger of free radicals generated in tissues exposed to radiation. Amifostine is the only pharmacologic agent with established efficacy in the prevention of xerostomia. Its role in patient management is uncertain secondary to the concerns listed below. Currently, the routine use of amifostine in patients receiving modern combined modality chemoradiation (CRT) is not justified.</p><p>The benefit of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8533" href="/d/drug information/8533.html" rel="external">amifostine</a> in the prevention of xerostomia was demonstrated in a trial of 315 patients with head and neck cancer who received definitive or adjuvant postoperative RT (60 to 70 Gy in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy daily fractions) without chemotherapy [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].

The edentulous patient should be evaluated for retained root tips, alveolar hyperplasia, maintenance of oral hygiene, and assessment for prosthodontics.</p><p>Indications for tooth extraction prior to RT are compromised teeth in an area that is expected to receive a dose of at least 50 Gy or a tooth that is out of the radiation treatment volume, but has a hopeless prognosis or is symptomatic. Extraction of healthy teeth does not appear to prevent the development of osteoradionecrosis [<a href="#rid92">92</a>].</p><p>All indicated extractions and/or restorative work should be completed prior to RT. A delay of approximately two weeks is ideal between extractions and the beginning of RT to permit proper healing.

Primary closure is preferred, if possible. Postponing needed dental extractions of teeth that will be within the treatment volume until after treatment is associated with an increased risk of non-healing and osteoradionecrosis.
