They are used medically for pain relief, can be lethal in overdose, and are highly addictive. Patients can develop an opioid use disorder through misuse of pharmaceutical opioids (either prescribed or not) and through use of illicitly obtained heroin. Opioid use disorder is typically a chronic, relapsing illness, associated with significant morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Medication for opioid use disorder, consisting of treatment with an opioid agonist or antagonist and of multiple psychosocial services, is first-line treatment for most patients with the disorder, after medically supervised withdrawal, if needed. Some patients prefer psychosocial treatment alone, also known as nonmedication treatment, typically consisting of multiple psychosocial services.</p><p>This topic reviews psychosocial interventions for opioid use disorders. The epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of opioid use disorder is reviewed separately. Pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder, medically supervised opioid withdrawal, and misuse of prescription drugs are also reviewed separately. Prevention of lethal opioid overdose in the community is also reviewed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7804.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, health consequences, screening, and assessment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Pharmacologic management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7808.html" rel="external">"Opioid withdrawal: Medically supervised withdrawal during treatment for opioid use disorder"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15236.html" rel="external">"Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99945.html" rel="external">"Prevention of lethal opioid overdose in the community"</a>.)</p><p></p><p><strong>APPROACH TO TREATMENT</strong> — Our approach to selecting treatment for opioid use disorder is described separately.

In this context, psychosocial interventions can also be used to encourage and target initiation of medication and adherence to treatment.</p><p>Despite its lesser efficacy compared with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), some patients prefer to receive psychosocial treatment alone or nonmedication treatment. (Other more problematic names include drug-free or abstinence-based treatment.) Nonmedication treatment typically consists of multiple psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral treatment, motivational interviewing, or contingency management, along with addiction counseling and participation in a mutual help group.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3620550062"><span class="h2">Regulatory requirements in the United States</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Regulatory requirements in the United States and other countries encourage patients engaging in MOUD to receive adjunctive psychosocial treatment. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9623" href="/z/d/drug information/9623.html" rel="external">Methadone</a> treatment programs (known in the United States as opioid treatment programs) are required to provide addiction counseling. Clinicians treating patients with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/z/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> are required to have the capacity to provide or refer patients to psychosocial treatment.

Randomized clinical trials that take place in these settings, and are reported on in the topic, may not be generalizable to other settings such as office-based <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/z/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> MOUD settings.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2606067275"><span class="h1">SELECTING PSYCHOTHERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our selection of psychosocial intervention is influenced by the patient’s clinical presentation, treatment history, preference, and the treatment availability. We often use the framework of the readiness to change model [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], whereby interventions are selected to address patient stage of change. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115659.html" rel="external">"Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Goals and components"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For individuals in the precontemplation or contemplation stages of change, we typically offer motivational interviewing to enhance motivation to change.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16753.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Psychosocial management", section on 'CBT-based therapies'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16753.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Psychosocial management", section on 'Community reinforcement approach'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For individuals in the action or maintenance stages of change, we typically offer mutual help groups or other forms of peer-supported recovery. These individuals may develop a sense of “giving back” and mentoring those whose recovery is less stable. (See <a class="local">'Mutual help groups'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Treatment overview", section on 'Adjunctive psychosocial intervention'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Variability in stage of change is common. We manage changes in motivation (eg, return to use in individuals who are abstinent) collaboratively with the patient. Furthermore, psychosocial treatments (eg, motivational interviewing, contingency management), can be conducted at any point in the individual’s treatment trajectory.</p><p>Due to the heterogeneity of treatments and small sample sizes, there is limited empirical evidence on the specific type of psychosocial treatment that is most effective in combination with specific medication treatments. Further research is needed regarding differential effectiveness of the various psychosocial approaches combined with medical treatments and their effects on different patient populations and in different settings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Treatment overview", section on 'Adjunctive psychosocial intervention'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H504637093"><span class="h1">CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Across substance use disorders, contingency management is the psychosocial treatment that consistently shows the best evidence for producing positive outcomes including reduced substance use [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Contingency management is a behavioral intervention that uses therapeutically applied incentives and other reinforcements to increase one or more target behaviors (eg, reductions in drug use, medication compliance, or treatment attendance). There is a large and robust body of research that has tested contingency management for substance use disorder, with a variety of reinforcement schedules, contingency types, and other variations. The majority of the studies testing contingency management use 12 weeks of weekly contingency management as a standard for treatment. We typically use this intervention when a specific patient population can be identified to target (eg, individuals exhibiting ongoing opioid use) and the setting has appropriate infrastructure to implement it in an adherent way. While it is effective in the treatment of substance use disorders, it is not universally available, can be difficult to implement in office-based settings, and is subject to regulatory oversight. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14849.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Principles, components, and monitoring during treatment with contingency management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103550.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Training, implementation, and efficacy of treatment with contingency management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H697131997"><span class="h2">Implementation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Contingency management can be applied as adjunctive programming to ongoing individual or group counseling. Compared with other psychosocial interventions, contingency management principles and associated clinical skills are relatively easy to learn, and the intervention can be conducted adherently by counselors or case managers with relatively little training [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. One contingency management implementation trial among patients dispensed <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9623" href="/z/d/drug information/9623.html" rel="external">methadone</a> at an opioid treatment program demonstrated intervention sustainability after an initial trial period [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Technology-enhanced delivery of contingency management may be a mechanism for addressing implementation barriers. As an example, in a large, urban outpatient substance use disorder program, 85 adults with opioid use disorder used a smartphone-based application facilitating contingency management over four months [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. These individuals were retrospectively compared to matched controls. Individuals in the smartphone application group had a greater percentage of negative urine drug screens (18 percent greater at four months) and higher treatment attendance (20 percent greater at four months) than individuals in the control group. Additionally, participants using the smartphone application reported high levels of acceptability and usability of the application.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H261656877"><span class="h2">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Meta-analyses of clinical trials generally support the efficacy of contingency management for enhancing clinical outcomes in treatment of substance use disorders [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103550.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Training, implementation, and efficacy of treatment with contingency management", section on 'Efficacy'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment with contingency management is associated with improved attendance, improved adherence, and reduced use of other substances (eg, stimulants) among those receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) [<a href="#rid2">2,10-17</a>]. As examples, in a meta-analysis that included 60 randomized clinical trials and 10,444 adults receiving MOUD, contingency management was associated with medium to large effect sizes for abstinence from illicit opioid use (Cohen’s d measure of effect size 0.58, 95% CI 0.3-0.86) and medication adherence (Cohen’s d 0.75, 95% CI 0.3-1.21) and small to medium effect size for improved therapy attendance (Cohen’s d 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.65) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In another trial involving 256 individuals with opioid use disorder, individuals randomized to contingency management had a higher rate of retention (82 versus 68 percent) and more negative drug tests for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/z/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">morphine</a> (68 versus 58 percent) than those in treatment as usual group [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1974856688"><span class="h1">MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Motivational interviewing is a psychotherapeutic approach designed to explore and resolve ambivalence to behavior change. Principles of motivational interviewing include expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Other tenets of motivational interviewing, including accurate empathy, a nonjudgmental stance, the use of reflections and open-ended questions, are foundational in building rapport and collaboratively working towards change. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16752.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Motivational interviewing", section on 'Motivational interviewing'</a>.)</p><p>Motivational interviewing can be brief (one to four sessions). Conversely, it can be applied as needed within longstanding therapeutic relationships. Instead of a prescribed number or frequency of sessions, motivational interviewing is best applied when there is an identified behavior (eg, substance use) that can be targeted for change. Several features of patients with opioid use disorder are well suited to motivational interviewing:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Opioid use disorder is typically a chronic and progressive disease, characterized by cycles of abstinence and relapse. These cycles often reflect vacillations in patients’ levels of motivation to change/maintain change. Clinicians benefit their patients by understanding the ebb and flow of motivation. In times of active drug use, clinicians skilled in motivational interviewing can nonjudgmentally redirect patients towards contemplating change.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with opioid use disorder receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in an opioid treatment program can have therapeutic relationships lasting years or decades. During a lengthy course of treatment, opioid use disorder-specific problems may stabilize, leaving open the opportunity for clinicians to apply motivational interviewing towards other behaviors (eg, polysubstance use, smoking cessation, or seeking appropriate medical care for the plethora of health-related concerns that arise from years of drug use).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Motivational interviewing can be easily integrated into the various settings and modalities involved in opioid use disorder and can be used by the diverse types of providers (eg, counselors, clinicians, nurses). As an example, motivational interviewing is a component of behavioral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9679" href="/z/d/drug information/9679.html" rel="external">naltrexone</a> treatment [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1186714615"><span class="h2">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Motivational interviewing has been found to be efficacious in substance use disorder generally; evidence in opioid use disorder is positive but more limited. A meta-analysis of 59 randomized trials with a total of 13,342 adult participants with substance use disorder found that, compared with no treatment, motivational interviewing resulted in a significant reduction in substance use postintervention (standardized mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.48-1.09) and at subsequent follow-up for as long as 12 months (standardized mean difference 0.15, 95% CI 0.04-0.25) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16752.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Motivational interviewing"</a>.)</p><p>Furthermore, motivational interviewing appears to be efficacious as an adjunct to MOUD. For example, in a clinical trial including 256 individuals receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9623" href="/z/d/drug information/9623.html" rel="external">methadone</a> maintenance, participants were randomized to either individual motivational interviewing, group motivational interviewing or a nurse-led hepatitis health promotion program. While no group differences were noted during the intervention period, at six-month follow-up the motivation interviewing groups (individual and group treatment) showed improvements in drug use behavior versus the health promotion program [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In another trial, motivational interviewing as an adjunct to MOUD (methadone) led to longer periods of abstinence and fewer opiate related problems [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H517199753"><span class="h1">COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is based on the perspective that thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations can affect behaviors such as opioid use, and vice versa. As examples, CBT can help people develop an awareness of their cognitive distortions that negatively impact the person’s mood and likelihood of relapse. CBT focuses on building awareness of these aforementioned domains and development of skills to modify or accept them. These therapies are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16753.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Psychosocial management"</a>.)</p><p>Components of CBT include combinations of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychoeducation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional analysis – Helping patients better understand the function of their substance use, including factors precipitating use.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identifying triggers to drug use and coping skills that help patients manage emotions without drugs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Enhancing interpersonal functioning.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing recovery-focused activities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Promoting behavioral activation – Engagement in activities that improve mood and increase pleasure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Enhancing drug refusal and problem solving skills.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Teaching skills designed to improve management of negative emotions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification of maladaptive thinking patterns that may precipitate or increase the likelihood of returning to substance use.</p><p></p><p>Clinicians receive training in order to provide CBT for substance use disorder, guided by detailed manuals [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. In published studies, the duration of CBT was an average of 18 sessions, typically delivered weekly [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Since opioid use disorder is chronic and progressive, and medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) can be of an indefinite length, clinicians can individualize use of CBT.</p><p>As an example, clinicians may choose to frontload treatment with weekly CBT, then draw from CBT material and encourage the use of learned skills throughout the duration of treatment. Alternatively, clinicians may want to wait until patients have stabilized in treatment to begin weekly CBT.</p><p>Mindfulness-based relapse prevention and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) are variants of CBT. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention includes the teaching and practice of mindfulness meditation to help patients change their relationship to drug cravings and other negative emotional states [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. ACT emphasizes acceptance (eg, acceptance of aversive internal experiences) to increase cognitive flexibility and reduce experiential avoidance. ACT includes a mindfulness component as well.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2783362747"><span class="h2">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical trials of CBT for opioid use disorder as adjunct to MOUD have found mixed results [<a href="#rid22">22,24,25</a>].</p><p>Several trials have suggested efficacy of CBT (eg, treatment retention or lower rate of drug-positive urine tests) [<a href="#rid24">24,26,27</a>].</p><p>As an example, in a clinical trial, 73 individuals with opioid dependence who were treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9623" href="/z/d/drug information/9623.html" rel="external">methadone</a>, were randomly assigned to group CBT (20 weekly one-hour sessions) or treatment as usual (weekly counseling) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. After 20 weeks of treatment, no difference was found between groups in their rate of negative urinalyses.
