         Emphysematous urinary tract infections (UTIs) are infections of the lower or upper urinary tract associated with gas formation. They may involve the bladder (cystitis), renal pelvis (pyelitis), or kidney (pyelonephritis). Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for these infections [

         This topic discusses emphysematous UTIs. Acute complicated UTIs not complicated by gas formation and renal abscesses are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Emphysematous UTIs are usually due to

         or
         <em>
          Klebsiella pneumoniae

         . These two organisms account for 65 to 100 percent of the isolates described in various retrospective reports [

         The pathogenesis of emphysematous UTIs is poorly understood. Among patients with diabetes mellitus, elevated tissue glucose levels may provide a more favorable microenvironment for gas-forming microbes. However, bacterial gas production does not fully explain the pathologic and clinical manifestations of emphysematous UTIs [

         Diabetes mellitus and urinary tract obstruction are the major risk factors for emphysematous UTIs. They occur more commonly in females. Emphysematous pyelonephritis has also been rarely reported in renal transplant recipients [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, in one of the largest single retrospective series, which included 48 patients in Taiwan who were diagnosed with either emphysematous pyelonephritis or emphysematous pyelitis, 96 percent had diabetes mellitus and 22 percent had urinary tract obstruction [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The mean patient age was 60 years (range 37 to 83 years) and females outnumbered males 6:1.
        </p>
        <p>
         In other case series, diabetes mellitus was documented in more than 80 percent of patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,6,13-15
         </a>
         ], at least 50 percent of patients with emphysematous pyelitis, and 60 to 70 percent of patients with emphysematous cystitis [

          6,14,15

         <a href="#rid4">
          4,15

         ]. The main causes of urinary tract obstruction were papillary necrosis and, less often, ureteral calculi [

         – The clinical features of emphysematous pyelonephritis and pyelitis are indistinguishable from those seen in severe, acute pyelonephritis. Most patients complain of fevers, chills, flank or abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The onset of symptoms may be abrupt or evolve slowly over two to three weeks. (See

         The diagnosis of emphysematous pyelitis or pyelonephritis is typically made when computed tomography (CT) is performed in a patient with acute complicated UTI (ie, UTI with fever or signs of upper tract involvement) and demonstrates air in the collecting system (pyelitis) or in the renal parenchyma and/or the surrounding tissues (pyelonephritis).
        </p>
        <p>
         CT is the preferred imaging modality as it is more sensitive than other modalities and can delineate the extent of gas formation and any obstructing lesions in the urinary tract [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. CT findings have also been used for prognostic classification of emphysematous pyelonephritis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prognosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Air associated with emphysematous UTI can also be detected on plain films of the abdomen, with a reported sensitivity ranging from 50 to 85 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6,20
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, one systematic review reported that the accuracy of renal ultrasound for detecting emphysematous pyelonephritis was 68 percent [

         The clinical presentation of emphysematous pyelitis or pyelonephritis is similar to that of severe, acute pyelonephritis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, renal abscess, or acute papillary necrosis. These conditions have distinct imaging findings and are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16109.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The differential diagnosis for the presence of air either in or adjacent to the renal parenchyma includes the following conditions: reflux of air from the bladder, air in a renal abscess, entero-renal or cutaneo-renal fistula formation, retroperitoneal perforation of abdominal viscus, psoas abscess with gas-forming organisms, or recent urologic or radiologic intervention such as nephrostomy insertion. CT findings can help differentiate between these possibilities.

         Patients with emphysematous pyelitis or pyelonephritis should be managed by or in concert with a urologist and with a specialist in infectious diseases. Many such patients warrant urologic intervention for obstruction and drainage of gas and purulent material. As drainage can typically be done percutaneously, interventional radiology is also often involved in the care of these patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who are severely ill may need medical management of sepsis or septic shock. (See

         For patients with gas limited to the collecting system, antimicrobial therapy alone is likely sufficient to treat the infection, unless obstruction is also present, in which case intervention to relieve the obstruction is also warranted (see

          'Relief of obstruction, if present'

         Although data are limited on the management of such cases, case series that included small numbers of patients with isolated emphysematous pyelitis treated with antibiotics alone (in addition to management of obstruction, if needed) have reported good outcomes (resolution of infection without need for further intervention) [

         The management of emphysematous pyelonephritis includes antibiotic therapy, relief of any urinary tract obstruction, and drainage of gas and purulent material. We suggest reserving nephrectomy for persistent or worsening infection despite these interventions.

         Antibiotic therapy is warranted for all patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis or pyelitis. Given the severity of infection, we suggest hospitalization and initial therapy with parenteral antibiotics. Empiric antibiotic selection  (

          table 1

         The optimal time to transition from intravenous to oral antibiotics and the total duration of antibiotic therapy are unknown. In general, we administer parenteral antibiotics until the patient is stable and has clinically improved (eg, normalizing temperature and white blood cell counts, improved sense of wellbeing). Then, we transition the patient to oral antibiotics tailored to culture results to complete a two-week course. (See

         If the emphysematous infection is associated with urinary tract obstruction (eg, as evidenced by hydronephrosis), correction of the obstruction is warranted. In case series and retrospective studies of patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis and obstruction, both percutaneous nephrostomy catheters and ureteral stents have been used [

         For individuals who have emphysematous pyelonephritis, with gas in the renal parenchyma, with or without extension of gas into the extrarenal space, we suggest percutaneous drainage of the gas and purulent material in addition to antibiotic therapy. For patients who are not severely ill and whose infection is limited to a single kidney without extrarenal extension or discrete abscess, deferring drainage is a reasonable option. One small, retrospective case series found that 10 of 14 patients with such limited disease without obstruction responded well to antibiotic treatment alone without any drainage procedures [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. We generally reserve surgical management (nephrectomy or open drainage) for patients who do not respond to this initial nonsurgical treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring and management of poor response'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         When drainage is performed, we submit drainage specimens for culture to help guide antibiotic therapy; the urine culture results do not always correlate with culture of drainage or surgical specimens [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. The drainage catheter generally stays in place until the patient is clinically improving and there is no longer significant drain output despite confirmation of correct positioning.
        </p>
        <p>
         High-quality evidence to inform the optimal management of emphysematous pyelonephritis is unavailable, as data are mainly limited to retrospective reviews and case series. Historically, treatment of emphysematous pyelonephritis usually involved nephrectomy or open drainage along with systemic antibiotics [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,14,15,28,29
         </a>
         ]. However, more recent reports have described successful outcomes with percutaneous drainage in addition to antibiotics [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,6,7,23,25,30-32
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a systematic review of 10 retrospective studies including 210 patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis, mortality associated with medical management plus percutaneous catheter drainage was lower than that with either medical management alone or medical management plus emergency nephrectomy (13.5 versus 50 and 25 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         More extensive disease (ie, extrarenal extension of infection or involvement of both kidneys) and features of sepsis are associated with a higher risk of treatment failure with percutaneous drainage. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prognosis'
         </a>

         For patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis, we reassess after 48 hours with clinical evaluation and repeat imaging to confirm position of the percutaneous drain and to evaluate the need for additional drainage. We also adjust the antibiotic regimen based on urine and drainage culture results. If the patient has lack of improvement or clinical deterioration despite optimizing antibiotic therapy and catheter drainage, consideration of nephrectomy is the next step.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach was evaluated in a prospective study of 39 patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis in India [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. In this study, patients were treated with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. Repeat imaging was performed after three days, with additional drainage catheters placed if needed. If there continued to be no improvement despite additional drainage, early nephrectomy was performed. Patients who improved with percutaneous drainage but developed recurrent pyelonephritis or had poor function kidney on nuclear imaging underwent delayed nephrectomy. The overall mortality rate was 13 percent. Three of the seven patients who received early nephrectomy for lack of improvement died compared with 2 of the 24 patients who were treated with percutaneous drainage alone. There were no deaths among the four patients who underwent delayed nephrectomy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Persistent infection (and need for nephrectomy) following initial nonsurgical management is more likely in individuals with more extensive disease or septic complications. As an example, in a retrospective study of 43 patients treated conservatively with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage, treatment failure occurred in 33 percent and was associated with hypoalbuminemia, need for emergency hemodialysis, and polymicrobial infection [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         A higher class (ie, more extensive disease) has been associated with an increased risk of poor outcomes. In the systematic review mentioned above, the pooled mortality rate associated with class 1 and 2 disease was 7.2 percent compared with 22.8 percent with class 3 and 4 [

          4

         ]. Among the 28 patients with class 3 disease, 6 (21 percent) died and 11 (39 percent) had percutaneous drainage procedures that were considered unsuccessful due to progressive or persistent lesions. Of the 11 who had unsuccessful percutaneous procedures, 7 underwent subsequent nephrectomy and 6 (86 percent) of those survived.

         Emphysematous cystitis is a rare type of acute complicated UTI characterized by gas formation in the wall and lumen of the bladder. Emphysematous cystitis is usually an isolated process but can rarely occur in patients who have concurrent emphysematous pyelonephritis [

In that review, the classic symptoms of acute cystitis (dysuria, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency) occurred in only about one-half of patients, as did fever, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, and gross hematuria.

          Diagnosis

         <strong>
          and differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis is generally made in patients found to have air within the bladder wall  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94106" href="/z/d/graphic/94106.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ), with or without intraluminal air, on abdominal imaging. The diagnosis is typically made with abdominal computed tomography (CT), although radiographs demonstrating a curvilinear area of radiolucency outlining the bladder wall are also diagnostic. Intraluminal air alone is less specific for emphysematous cystitis and can also occur following bladder instrumentation (eg, cystoscopy or catheterization) or in the setting of an enterovesical, colovesical, or rectovesical fistula (which, in turn, may be due to diverticulitis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94107" href="/z/d/graphic/94107.html" rel="external">
          image 3
         </a>
         ), inflammatory bowel disease, or colorectal carcinoma). If only intraluminal air is identified on imaging, we reserve the diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis for individuals who have other consistent features (abdominal pain or other symptoms referable to the bladder, pyuria, and bacteriuria) and do not have evidence of or concern for a fistulous connection to the gastrointestinal tract and have not had recent instrumentation.

          Management
         </strong>
         – Emphysematous cystitis can usually be successfully treated with antibiotic therapy alone [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,16
         </a>
         ]. Given the potential for complicated infection, particularly among patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, we suggest initial therapy with parenteral antibiotics. However, outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics may be reasonable for select individuals with mild or no symptoms and well-controlled comorbidities. Empiric antibiotic selection  (

         – Emphysematous urinary tract infections (UTIs) are infections of the bladder (cystitis), renal pelvis (pyelitis), or kidney (pyelonephritis) that are characterized by gas formation. (See

          Risk factors
         </strong>
         – The major risk factors are diabetes mellitus and urinary tract obstruction. These infections primarily occur in females at a mean age of about 60 years.

          Clinical presentation and diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Clinical features are indistinguishable from those seen in severe, acute pyelonephritis (fever, flank or abdominal pain, nausea). The diagnosis is made in a patient with UTI (symptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria) who has air in the collecting system, renal parenchyma, and/or perirenal tissue on computed tomography (CT). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical features'

         <strong>
          Management of isolated pyelitis
         </strong>
         – For patients with gas limited to the collecting system, antimicrobial therapy, with relief of any urinary tract obstruction, is generally sufficient to treat the infection. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Isolated emphysematous pyelitis'

         <strong>
          Management of renal or perirenal involvement
         </strong>
         – For patients with involvement of the kidneys or extrarenal space, we suggest percutaneous drainage of gas and purulent material rather than no intervention (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ), in addition to antimicrobial therapy and relief of any obstruction. The drainage catheter generally stays in place until the patient has clinically improved and there is no significant drain output despite confirmation of correct positioning. Patients who are not severely ill and have limited involvement of a single kidney may reasonably forgo initial drainage. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Renal or perirenal involvement'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For patients with renal or perirenal involvement, even those with extensive or bilateral disease, we also suggest percutaneous drainage rather than nephrectomy as the initial strategy to remove renal or perirenal gas and purulent material (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). We reserve nephrectomy for patients who have no improvement or have clinical deterioration despite optimized antibiotic therapy and catheter drainage.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Data are limited to small observational studies but suggest that percutaneous drainage is associated with lower mortality than either medical management alone or initial nephrectomy.

         <strong>
          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – Overall mortality is estimated at 12 percent but varies widely. Extensive extrarenal or bilateral disease and septic complications, including thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, confusion, hyponatremia, and shock, have been associated with mortality and failure of percutaneous management.

          Emphysematous cystitis
         </strong>
         – This typically presents with abdominal pain; the classic symptoms of cystitis (dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency) occur in about one-half of patients. The diagnosis is made in patients with UTI (symptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria) who have air within the bladder wall  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94106" href="/z/d/graphic/94106.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ), with or without intraluminal air, on abdominal imaging. Antimicrobial therapy alone is typically sufficient. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Emphysematous cystitis'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Antimicrobial therapy
         </strong>
         – For patients with emphysematous UTI, we suggest initial therapy with parenteral antibiotics (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ) given the potential for severe infection. Outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics is a reasonable alternative for selected individuals with emphysematous cystitis who have mild or no symptoms and well-controlled comorbidities. Empiric antibiotic selection  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131022" href="/z/d/graphic/131022.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) and selection and duration of directed antibiotic therapy are the same as those for acute complicated UTI and are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
