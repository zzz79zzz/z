         Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease that frequently results in scarring [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Scars secondary to acne can lead to physical disfigurement and the psychosocial impact can be profound [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Early and effective treatment of acne is the best means to minimize and prevent acne scarring. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/42.html" rel="external">
          "Acne vulgaris: Overview of management"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although a variety of therapies may reduce the prominence of acne scars, no therapy removes acne scars completely. A multimodality approach to scar treatment is usually necessary to achieve the best cosmetic results. The selection of an approach to treatment is based upon factors such as the type and degree of acne scarring, patient preference, side effects, cost, and treatment availability.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of scarring secondary to acne vulgaris will be reviewed here. The therapeutic approach to active acne is reviewed separately. (See

         Acne scarring represents an altered wound healing response to cutaneous inflammation that leads to an imbalance in matrix degradation and collagen biosynthesis. Although scarring is a common consequence of inflammatory acne vulgaris, not all patients develop scarring [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The reasons for discrepancies in the propensity to scar are not clear.
        </p>
        <p>
         One theory focuses on a role for the nature of the inflammatory response in determining which patients develop scarring. This concept is supported by an immunohistochemical study of 8 patients not prone to acne scarring and 11 patients prone to acne scarring [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Specimens from early lesions from patients who were not prone to acne scarring demonstrated a large, active, nonspecific immune response that subsided with lesion resolution. In contrast, patients prone to acne scarring had a smaller, more specific immune response in early lesions that was increased and activated in resolving lesions. This persistent inflammation in healing tissue may contribute to scarring.

         Acne scars can be divided based upon morphology into atrophic scars and hypertrophic scars. An individual patient may have more than one type of scar:

         <strong>
          Atrophic scars
         </strong>
         – Atrophic scars, the most common type of acne scars, are caused by destruction and loss of collagen in the dermis and present as indentations in the skin. Destructive inflammation in the deep dermis and subsequent contraction is thought to result in the indented appearance [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Atrophic scars may be subclassified into ice pick, rolling, and boxcar scars [
         <a href="#rid6">

         <strong>
          Ice pick scars
         </strong>
         – Ice pick scars are usually narrow (&lt;2 mm), deep, sharply demarcated tracts that can extend into the deep dermis or subcutaneous tissue. Ice pick scars are typically wider at the epithelial surface and taper as they go deeper [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         <strong>
          Rolling scars
         </strong>
         – Rolling scars are usually wider (4 to 5 mm) and more shallow than ice pick scars and produce an undulating appearance in otherwise normal-appearing skin. The rise and fall of the skin surface is due to abnormal fibrous attachment of the dermis to the subcutis [
         <a href="#rid6">

         <strong>
          Boxcar scars
         </strong>
         – Boxcar scars are wider at the base than ice pick scars and do not taper. These round- to oval-shaped skin dimples have sharp margins and can be either shallow (&lt;0.5 mm) or deep (&gt;0.5 mm) [
         <a href="#rid6">

         <strong>
          Hypertrophic scars and keloids
         </strong>
         – Hypertrophic acne scars and keloids are less common than atrophic acne scars and are characterized by collagen gain subsequent to the resolution of an acne lesion, resulting in a firm, raised papule or plaque. Hypertrophic scars do not extend beyond the margin of the original wound [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, keloids extend beyond the margin of the original wound. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5569.html" rel="external">
          "Keloids and hypertrophic scars"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical appearance of both atrophic and hypertrophic acne scars may be accentuated by erythema. The treatment of erythema in acne scars is an important (and often initial) component of treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment of erythema'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients often use the term acne scars to refer to the persistent postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58817" href="/z/d/graphic/58817.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ) that is a common side effect of acne, particularly in individuals with dark skin (skin phototype IV to VI (

          table 1
         </a>
         )). Unlike the permanent textural changes that result from true scarring, pigmentary changes tend to slowly improve over time. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/42.html" rel="external">

         We begin our evaluation by eliciting the specific concerns and expectations of the patient and the patient's medical history. This discussion helps the clinician to identify treatments that will best address the patient's concerns and helps the clinician to begin to assess risk for side effects of treatment.

While some patients may be willing to tolerate the discomfort, risks, and long recovery period associated with an aggressive and often very effective procedure, such as traditional ablative laser resurfacing, other patients may be willing to accept lesser benefit in exchange for less aggressive treatment.

         An in-depth discussion with the patient about expected treatment outcomes and side effects is essential prior to proceeding with treatment. A clinician who does not have a clear understanding of the patient's desired outcome and tolerance for side effects may select a treatment regimen that is overly or insufficiently aggressive. In addition, poor communication between the clinician and patient about the expected degree of improvement from a procedure may result in a dissatisfied patient despite an outcome that the clinician perceives as excellent for a particular procedure.

         In general, patients receiving treatment of acne scars should be informed that:

        <p>

        <p>
         The side effects of each procedure being considered should be discussed in detail with the patient. Infection, hyperpigmentation, prolonged erythema, swelling, poor wound healing, and scarring are risks associated with many acne scar procedures. Because acne scar therapy is an elective procedure, knowledge of expected side effects and risks strongly influences the willingness of patients to undergo specific procedures. Patients who are educated about the characteristics, risk, and expected outcomes are empowered to make informed decisions regarding treatment. Financial considerations also may limit the ability of patients to proceed with certain treatments.

There is no point in treating acne scars if acne is not under control because new scars will continue to form after scar treatment.

         Overall, high-quality trials of interventions for acne scars are lacking. A systematic review of randomized trials found insufficient evidence to recommend any particular intervention as first-line treatment [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15

        <p>
         The ideal treatment regimen for acne scars is efficacious for the types of acne scars present and reflects the level of patient tolerance for transient side effects. In the clinical setting, clinicians must work with patients to identify a treatment regimen that is consistent with the relative importance of these factors for the patient. A patient who is very uncomfortable with treatment risk may prefer a regimen that may be less effective because it is low risk.

         Frequently, patients who present for the treatment of facial acne scars have multiple scars, a presentation that is best managed with a field approach to treatment. Patients who require treatment of only a few specific scars can be managed with some of the same treatments. (See

         Because no single treatment completely removes acne scars, a multimodality approach to generalized facial acne scars is most likely to provide the best results from treatment. Our ideal result-focused approach to generalized atrophic facial acne scars can be summarized in three key steps:

         However, this result-focused regimen usually is not feasible because it requires high patient tolerance for invasive and time-consuming procedures and long recovery periods.

         The treatment of scar erythema is an important component of acne scar treatment because erythema accentuates acne scars and makes scars more noticeable to the observer. Treatment of erythema can improve the appearance of acne scars even without improvement in the more difficult to correct textural abnormalities. Pulsed-dye laser (PDL) therapy is the treatment of choice for scar erythema.

         Pulsed-dye laser therapy improves erythema in scars by targeting oxyhemoglobin within vascular structures in the skin. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Efficacy of this treatment for acne scars is supported by a split-face, observer-blinded study in which 22 patients with erythematous and/or hypertrophic facial acne scars had one cheek treated with one or two treatment sessions with a 585 nm flashlamp-pumped dye laser (0.45 ms pulse, average fluence 6.5 J/cm

         ]. Six weeks after an initial treatment, the mean reduction in clinical erythema/scarring compared with the appearance of surrounding normal skin was 68 percent for treated areas. In contrast, significant clinical improvement was not observed in the scars on the untreated areas.
        </p>
        <p>
         Successful treatment of acne scar erythema with a pulsed-dye laser usually requires three to four or more treatments given at approximately one-month intervals.

A punch biopsy tool that is exactly the size of the inner surface of the scar is used to incise the scar to the depth of the subcutaneous tissue. Rather than removing the tissue as is done in punch excision, the tissue is elevated and sutured at a position that is slightly higher than the surrounding skin. Contraction during wound healing leads to uniform elevation of the scar surface and surrounding skin.

         Atrophic acne scars result from a loss of collagen in the dermis. Our second phase of treatment for generalized facial atrophic acne scars consists of a procedure to induce collagen remodeling. Examples of procedures that can achieve this endpoint include traditional ablative laser resurfacing, nonablative fractional laser resurfacing, ablative fractional laser resurfacing, chemical peels, dermabrasion, and skin needling.

         Traditional ablative laser resurfacing is the most effective method to achieve this endpoint, but is an aggressive procedure that is not tolerated by all patients. Patients typically do not need more than one treatment, but the treatment has a significant recovery period. Nonablative fractional laser resurfacing, a less aggressive and less risky procedure, is our preferred alternative to traditional ablative laser resurfacing. Disadvantages of nonablative fractional laser therapy include lesser efficacy and the requirement for multiple treatments.

The treatment plan includes important preoperative (eg, antiviral prophylaxis), intraoperative, and postoperative measures to promote the best outcome of treatment. General preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative measures for ablative laser resurfacing are reviewed separately. (See

         Expert training is required to perform ablative laser resurfacing. The target endpoint that determines the number of laser passes during each treatment session (initial visualization of the sebaceous glands in the dermis) can be difficult to appreciate. In addition, this portion of the procedure can become disorienting secondary to bleeding. To mediate this, we laser the most dependent region first during each laser pass and proceed superiorly.

         Each laser pass leaves a layer of eschar. We leave the eschar in place after the last laser pass, rather than wiping it away. This allows the eschar to act as a biologic dressing until it gently sloughs over the subsequent three to five days. Clinicians vary on preferred post-treatment wound care. Our post-treatment care consists of daily to twice daily soaks with acetic acid (1:10 dilution with water) followed by application of petrolatum;

         Potential adverse effects of ablative laser resurfacing include persistent erythema, hypopigmentation (an expected effect), hyperpigmentation, infection, and scarring. Erythema is common and usually resolves within several weeks, but occasionally persists for longer. In young patients, dyspigmentation often improves over the course of 3 to 12 months. The risk for dyspigmentation is greatest in patients with skin phototypes III to VI (

         Nonablative fractional resurfacing (NAFR) is a frequently used alternative to traditional ablative laser resurfacing because of the lesser recovery time required after this procedure (typically one to three days [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]). Most commonly, the 1550 nm or 1540 nm NAFR lasers are used. Rather than ablating a continuous area of skin, fractional lasers emit narrow microscopic columns of laser light, which allows for the treatment of a fraction of the area of skin in the treatment area while leaving intervening areas of unaffected skin (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53757" href="/z/d/graphic/53757.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>

         ]. (See

         However, multiple treatments with a nonablative fractional laser are typically required to achieve satisfactory effects on scarring. Compared with traditional ablative lasers, the efficacy of nonablative lasers on dermal collagen remodelling is more limited [

          Efficacy

         – Benefit from NAFR has been reported in randomized trials; however, most of these trials have compared NAFR to other modalities rather than to placebo or no treatment [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,33
         </a>
         ]. The first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of nonablative fractional laser resurfacing on atrophic acne scars was a split-face trial that compared the efficacy of three treatment sessions with a 1540 nm erbium-glass fractional laser at four-week intervals on one side of the face in 10 patients with no treatment on the contralateral side [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. The response to treatment was assessed by a single blinded evaluator after 4 and 12 weeks. Statistically significant reductions in acne scar severity scores were seen on the laser-treated side but not on the untreated side. Of the 10 patients, 5 reported that the appearance of acne scars was moderately or significantly improved after treatment, 3 noted slight improvement, and 2 reported no improvement after treatment. Uncontrolled studies also suggest a beneficial effect of nonablative fractional laser treatment [
         <a href="#rid34">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In comparison to ablative fractional laser resurfacing, available data suggest that patients treated with nonablative fractional laser resurfacing will experience a shorter duration of post-treatment erythema, a lower likelihood of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and less pain during the procedure, with minimal loss in the efficacy of treatment [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31
         </a>
         ]. More trials that directly compare nonablative and ablative fractional laser therapy for acne scars are necessary to confirm this conclusion. We find that most of our patients prefer nonablative fractional laser treatment because of the expected shorter recovery time after treatment. (See

Additional treatment options include ablative fractional laser therapy, chemical peels, dermabrasion, and skin needling. An advantage of skin needling is the minimal risk for the postinflammatory hyperpigmentation that is a potential side effect of other collagen remodeling treatments.

Caution is necessary, as excessive density settings may increase risk for hypertrophic scarring [

         Because of limited depth of penetration, superficial chemical peels may improve the appearance of only very superficial acne scars [

         ] and are more useful for the treatment of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Medium-depth and deep chemical peels are typically required to achieve more than minimal improvement in the appearance of scars.

         An example of a study supporting efficacy of chemical peeling for acne scars is an uncontrolled study that reviewed the effects up to three treatments with a Jessner solution and 35%

         ]. Of the 15 patients who returned for at least one follow-up visit, all but one demonstrated clinical improvement. One patient had &gt;75 percent clearance of lesions, eight had moderate improvement (51 to 75 percent clearance), four had mild improvement (26 to 50 percent clearance), and one had minimal improvement (1 to 25 percent clearance). Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation followed in nine patients, but resolved within three months. Healing time after this type of chemical peel is usually between 7 and 10 days.
        </p>
        <p>
         Risk for side effects of chemical peels increase with the depth of the peel. In addition to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, potential side effects of chemical peels include infection and scarring. Phenol chemical peels are associated with the additional risk of excessive systemic absorption resulting in cardiac toxicity [

        </p>
        <p>
         Dermabrasion involves the use of tools (eg, high-speed brush, diamond cylinder, fraise, or silicon carbide sandpaper) to remove the epidermis or epidermis and part of the dermis [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. An advantage of the procedure is that it allows the clinician to etch scar edges precisely without thermal injury. However, dermabrasion is highly operator dependent, requires meticulous intraoperative assistance, and has the potential for severe postoperative scarring, dyspigmentation, and milia formation.

         Based upon reports of severe scarring in patients treated with dermabrasion during

         Microdermabrasion is a more superficial procedure in which abrasive crystals (eg, aluminum oxide crystals) are propelled onto the skin within a controlled vacuum suction system. The depth of abrasion during microdermabrasion remains in the epidermis. Thus, improvement in acne scars after microdermabrasion is minimal.

          56

         ]. Similar to fractional lasers, needling procedures induce small columns of damage in the epidermis and dermis, leaving intervening skin untouched. A needling device typically consists of a cylinder that is circumferentially studded with 1 to 2.5 mm long needles. The device is rolled over the surface of the skin to form numerous perforations in the epidermis and dermis with a goal of stimulating neocollagenesis. Advantages of skin needling include low cost, a relatively short recovery period (two to three days) and a very low risk for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation [

         The efficacy of needling for atrophic acne scars was evaluated in a split-face trial in which patients with facial acne scars were randomly assigned to treatment with a needling device on one side of the face and no treatment on the contralateral side [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. The needling regimen consisted of three treatments separated by two weeks, each preceded by the application of a topical anesthetic. Only the assessors of treatment response were blinded to treatment. Analysis of 15 patients who received treatment revealed a significant decline in the scar score on the treated areas but not in the control areas six months after treatment. The mean improvement in overall scar appearance on the treated side was 41 percent. Treatment was well tolerated by patients and pain was minimal. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal regimen for skin needling and to compare the efficacy of the procedure with other acne scar treatments.

         After performance of a collagen remodeling procedure, the patient is followed to assess for the response and to determine whether additional treatments would be beneficial for augmenting the response to treatment. Because collagen remodeling is a slow process, we wait at least six months prior to performing additional treatments. An exception is the treatment of persistent erythema after laser resurfacing, which we often treat with a vascular laser if present three months after the resurfacing procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who have undergone traditional ablative laser resurfacing and are willing to receive additional treatment, we often administer a series of four nonablative fractional laser treatments at four to eight week intervals beginning six months after ablative laser resurfacing in an attempt to augment the response to treatment. If there are resistant scars, we often replace one of the nonablative fractional laser treatment sessions with an ablative fractional laser treatment (

         In some cases, direct treatment of specific areas of residual scarring can be greatly beneficial. Injectable soft tissue fillers are commonly used and effective treatment options for select acne scars that do not respond adequately to collagen remodeling procedures. (See

         Injection of an atrophic scar with a soft tissue filler can result in instantaneous and dramatic improvement in the appearance of the scar. The optimal scars for soft tissue filler treatment are broad, rolling scars that are soft and distensible [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ], meaning they disappear when the surrounding skin is stretched. Ice pick scars, tethered scars, and scars with an atrophic center and hypertrophic border are unlikely to respond well to soft tissue filler injection. Injection of the filler beneath these scars may make the scar more prominent or result in an unnatural appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
         High-quality trials evaluating the efficacy of soft tissue fillers for the treatment of acne scars are limited. A systematic review of randomized trials found moderate-quality evidence to support this intervention but also identified a paucity of long-term studies [

         A wide variety of soft tissue fillers are available with varying properties. The duration of effect, clinician familiarity and experience with products, and location of scar influence choice of filler. Temporary soft tissue fillers, fillers that slowly degrade within tissue over time, are most commonly used for acne scars. With temporary fillers retreatment is usually necessary. Liquid injectable silicone, an example of a permanent filler, is a cost-effective treatment that yields long-term results, but should only be used by experienced and expert clinicians (

         Atrophic acne scars are most commonly found on the face, but may also occur in other areas prone to acne vulgaris, such as the shoulders, back, and chest. Studies to determine the best approach to the treatment of nonfacial atrophic acne scars are lacking.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonfacial atrophic acne scars and facial atrophic acne scars are similar in appearance; however, the treatment of nonfacial scars warrants additional considerations. Although many of the same therapies can be attempted, nonfacial scars are more resistant to treatment [

        </p>
        <p>
         Moreover, the lower density of skin appendages in nonfacial skin compared with facial skin results in lesser capacity for skin regeneration after skin resurfacing procedures, a feature that may increase risk for postprocedure scarring [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,44

         – Pulsed-dye laser therapy can improve hypertrophic scars and keloids. The technique requires a series of adjacent nonoverlapping laser pulses delivered across the entire scar breadth. The scar's size, thickness, location, and color, as well as the patient's skin type, determine the fluence that should be used. After an initial treatment, the fluence is maintained, increased, or decreased based upon response and side effects. Thick or dark scars usually require higher fluences than thin and light scars.

         The most common adverse effect of pulsed-dye laser treatment is postoperative purpura, which often persists for several days. Pulse durations shorter than 6 ms are almost certain to cause bruising. Edema of treated skin may also occur but usually subsides within 48 hours. Treated areas should be gently cleansed daily with water and mild soap. Strict sun avoidance and photoprotection should be advocated between treatment sessions in order to reduce the risk of pigment alteration. (See

          Silicone gel sheeting
         </strong>
         – Application of silicone gel sheeting to hypertrophic scars and keloids can result in clinical improvement. The mechanism through which benefit occurs is not fully understood. One theory is that a combination of pressure and hydration from the occlusive dressing may be responsible rather than the silicone itself. Hydration inhibits fibroblast production of collagen [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. Other proposed mechanisms include prevention of bacteria-induced collagen production and modulation of expression of the profibrotic cytokines fibroblast growth factor-beta

         Scarring is a common consequence of acne vulgaris. Acne scars can lead to physical disfigurement and significant emotional distress. (See
         <a class="local">

         Acne scars may be atrophic, hypertrophic, or keloidal. Atrophic acne scars constitute the most common presentation of acne scars. Atrophic acne scars can be divided into ice pick, rolling, and boxcar scars based upon morphology. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Classification'

         A thorough pre-treatment assessment is critical prior to acne scar treatment. In addition to a medical history and physical examination, a thorough discussion with the patient is essential to ensure that the treating clinician and patient have similar treatment expectations and treatment goals. Patient tolerance for treatment side effects and recovery time strongly influences the selection of treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pretreatment assessment'

         There is a wide variety of treatment options for atrophic acne scars, including therapies designed to remove or release fibrotic tissue, therapies to induce collagen remodeling, and therapies to fill defects. In patients with generalized atrophic facial acne scars, the best results are usually obtained through a multi-faceted approach to treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Generalized atrophic facial acne scars'

         Our first step for the treatment of generalized atrophic facial acne scars consists of the treatment of scar erythema, which can often accentuate acne scars, and focal therapies to improve deep ice pick scars, deep boxcar scars, and other scars that are likely to be resistant to other treatments. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Step 1: Treatment of erythema and challenging scars'
         </a>
         above.)

         </span>
         Our second step for the treatment of generalized atrophic facial acne scars is a procedure designed to induce collagen remodeling in the dermis. Traditional ablative laser resurfacing is a highly effective collagen remodeling procedure (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96513 graphicRef96512 graphicRef96514" href="/z/d/graphic/96513.html" rel="external">
          picture 2A-C
         </a>
         ). For patients who are willing to tolerate the risks, side effects, and recovery time associated with traditional ablative laser resurfacing, we suggest treatment with this therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Step 2: Collagen remodeling procedure'
         </a>
         above.)

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For patients who cannot tolerate traditional ablative laser resurfacing, nonablative fractional laser resurfacing is our preferred procedure. Medium-depth or deep chemical peels, dermabrasion, and skin-needling are additional examples of collagen remodeling procedures. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Step 2: Collagen remodeling procedure'
         </a>
         above.)

         Patients may benefit from additional treatments following a collagen-remodeling procedure, such as additional laser treatments or injectable soft tissue fillers. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Step 3: Adjunctive therapies'
         </a>

         Patients who desire treatment of isolated atrophic acne scars may benefit from a variety of focal procedures. The morphology of the scar dictates the appropriate procedure. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Individual atrophic acne scars'
         </a>
         above.)

         The management of hypertrophic or keloidal acne scars differs from the management of atrophic acne scars. For these lesions, intralesional corticosteroid injection is the first-line treatment. (See

          'Hypertrophic acne scars and keloids'
