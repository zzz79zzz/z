For the purposes of this topic, we adopt the definition provided in the United States Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) in which child neglect refers to any action or failure to act which causes serious physical or emotional harm or death or puts the child at imminent risk for such harm [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, specific types of neglect are defined as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical neglect</strong> – Physical neglect refers to the caregiver's failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or hygiene.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Supervisory neglect</strong> – Supervisory neglect means that inadequate supervision puts the child at major risk for physical, emotional, or psychological harm [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Emotional neglect</strong> – Emotional neglect describes the caregiver's failure to do any one of the following [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Provide love, affection, security, and emotional support</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Obtain psychological care when needed</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Protect the child from exposure to domestic violence or substance use</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Educational neglect</strong> – Educational neglect consists of failure to do any one of the following [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Enroll the child in school or homeschool</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ensure regular and prompt attendance at school</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Address special education needs</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nutritional neglect</strong> – Nutritional neglect can either mean failure to provide adequate nutrition to maintain physical growth and development [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] or failure to prevent overnutrition leading to serious medical complications [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medical neglect</strong> – Medical neglect refers to either failure to provide prescribed medical care or treatment or failure to seek appropriate medical care in a timely manner [<a href="#rid5">5,9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dental neglect</strong> – Dental neglect describes failure to provide adequate dental care or treatment despite adequate access to care [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p>Neglect definitions are impacted by the accepted standards of care for children and the role of the community in families' lives.

It accounts for more than one-half of reported cases analyzed yearly by the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS). Each year in the United States, child maltreatment results in more than 1800 child fatalities [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The majority of fatalities involve vulnerable children under three years of age and are strongly associated with poverty [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Multiple forms of child maltreatment often coexist, and more than 70 percent of reported cases involve neglect [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The following risk factors place children at a greater risk of being harmed or experiencing neglect [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poverty</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Domestic violence</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family stress</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mental health or substance use problems</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Young maternal age</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of social support</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A caregiver's lack of understanding of child development or behavior</p><p></p><p>By contrast, protective factors include [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Healthy nurturing by the caregiver with normal child attachment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Caregiver who is knowledgeable about parenting and child development</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Parental resilience (ie, cognitively, emotionally, and physically able to manage hardship)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Social connections (family and friends) for caregiver and child</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Concrete supports (eg, adequate shelter, food, transportation, and finances)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Social/emotional competence of the child</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1098288810"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Child neglect can be attributed to the complex interaction of cultural and socioeconomic factors related to the child, caregiver(s), environment, and resources [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].

Additional history, for example, may include screening for access to firearms or medications, use of car seats or bicycle helmets, supervision during bathing, safety plans used when the child is left home alone, and childcare arrangements when the caregiver is away from home or working.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Emotional neglect may manifest as a lack of a nurturing positive relationship between a child and a caregiver providing that sense of emotional security as well as in a caregiver's inability to follow through with recommendations for psychological care or services.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Educational neglect may arise due to chronic truancy, poor attendance, or reported homeschooling without an educational plan or activities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nutritional neglect encompasses all malnutrition, including undernutrition (starvation, failure to thrive) and overnutrition, such as obesity with significant medical complications [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dental neglect results in untreated dental caries or oral infections and pain [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medical neglect has multiple presentations but may include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A seriously ill child where signs of illness were not recognized, or care not sought.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Serious or life-threatening exacerbation of chronic health conditions in children with a lack of adherence to treatment plans and/or recommended follow-up.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lack of primary care visits for vulnerable children, such as premature infants or children with complex medical needs.

In addition to the typical medical history, evaluation for neglect should include an assessment of barriers and strengths impacting the child’s proper nurturing (psychosocial risk factor screening). Most caregivers do not intend to harm their children, so the focus should be on the circumstances surrounding the child's presentation and care rather than on intent. Practitioners should give families an opportunity to provide information about possible neglect by asking them open-ended questions. The questions should be phrased in a way that allows the health care provider to maintain a good relationship with the patient and family.</p><p>The goal of the caregiver history includes learning:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How healthy is the child?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How is the child's behavior and development?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How does the caregiver view the relationship with the child?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How are the child's needs being met?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are the caregiver's needs being met?</p><p></p><p>Although obtaining useful information from a child may be challenging, even children as young as three years of age can answer "how did you get this bruise?" or "what happened here?" when the medical provider points to an injury of concern. It may be more difficult for a child to answer questions on how well their needs are met. The goal of the history from the child may include learning:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How is the relationship between the caregiver and child?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does the child see a doctor?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does the child have enough to eat or drink?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does the child feel safe?</p><p></p><p>Examples of questions for caregivers, children, and families are provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117411" href="/d/graphic/117411.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Additional elements of the medical history may be related to the presentation and concerns noted on comprehensive physical examination for the type of neglect:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical neglect may arise from a lack of financial resources, caregiver knowledge, or other risk factors. Additional history may include screening for food insecurity, safe housing, and the source of financial supports.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Supervisory neglect or inadequate caregiver supervision can result in serious injury (eg, ingestion, injury from a firearm, dog bite, near drowning, or burns) and may be caused by a combination of barriers including caregiver knowledge, supervision, and/or resources. Additional history, for example, may include screening for access to firearms or medications, use of car seats or bicycle helmets, supervision during bathing, safety plans used when the child is left home alone, and childcare arrangements when the caregiver is away from home or working.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Emotional neglect may occur in the setting of caregiver depression or other mental health diagnoses, substance use, or domestic violence. As noted in caregiver history, the provider should ask about caregiver-child interactions and observe whether there is a nurturing or negative relationship between caregiver and child during the examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Educational neglect involves determining whether the child is enrolled in school, regularly attending school, and receiving needed services. This information may require conversations with additional professionals such as teachers, principals, school nurses, or guidance counselors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nutritional neglect, like physical neglect, may be due to combination of factors and requires assessment of financial resources, food insecurity, and access to supplemental nutrition programs. Both undernutrition (failure to thrive) and overnutrition (severe obesity) require a detailed history of dietary intake and feeding behavior and a psychosocial assessment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56603" href="/d/graphic/56603.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2864.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children younger than two years in resource-abundant settings: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medical neglect is perhaps the most complex form of neglect to identify. Medical neglect is not as simple as whether a caregiver fails to take a child for medical care or to administer a recommended treatment. Medical neglect occurs on a continuum based on both (1) risk of harm and (2) role of the caregiver in the neglect. This determination requires assessment of whether the child has been harmed or is at risk of harm, whether the neglect occurred repeatedly or is at risk to recur, and whether there are risk factors that increase the risk of harm or if there are protective factors that decrease the risk of harm [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. When considering medical neglect, the following questions are important [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Is the child harmed or at risk of harm because of a lack of health care?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Is the recommended health care likely to have a significant benefit?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>What are the barriers to care?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Are there cultural or religious factors that would contribute to an understanding of health care or adherence to the treatment plan?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Was the treatment plan clear and education provided to the caregiver?

This may or may not be associated with neglect depending on the time of day and the last time the child has eaten, but an important part of the examination is asking the child about hunger and their last meal. Next, an assessment of overall nutritional status is important. Ideally, nutritional status includes review of prior growth charts, but at a minimum it includes height, weight, weight-for-height or body mass index (BMI), and, in children younger than two years of age, head circumference. A child who is under- or overnourished may have concerns for nutritional neglect and need further medical evaluation for associated complications such as refeeding syndrome with starvation or inadequate nutrition, or for diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea with overnutrition or obesity [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

The psychosocial assessment is an important tool to help the health care provider determine the next steps.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The following scenarios provide examples of how key factors in the history help to identify social determinants of health and child neglect:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A child consistently presents to clinic looking unkempt and wearing clothes that appear to be dirty. The child often states that he is hungry and asks for a snack.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Social determinants – After further evaluation and assessment, you learn that the primary caregiver has lost their job, has been unable to pay rent, and has been "couch hopping." For this family, the clinician can talk with the primary caregiver about community resources such as homeless shelters, food pantries, and clothing distribution centers. Whenever possible, connecting the family to a social worker would be a key step in addressing these ongoing needs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Child neglect – After further evaluation and assessment, you learn that parent is struggling with substance abuse issues and that they recently lost their job and apartment due to drug use. The parent informs you that they had been in recovery for six months, but that they recently relapsed. They state that they have spent all money on drugs. While this is also a good time to talk with parent about resources, particularly for substance use treatment, it would also be warranted to make a report to child protective services.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>When a child presents to clinic, you notice that they have missed three appointments with a specialist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Social determinants – After further evaluation and assessment, you learn that the parents' car recently broke down and that they have no transportation. They tell you that they have tried to find rides but not been successful. This visit would be a good opportunity to talk with the parents about community resources to assist with transportation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Child neglect – You learn that they missed the appointments because they were scheduled too early in the morning and parents/primary caregivers do not like to wake up early. This visit would be a good time to talk with the family about the importance of the medical appointments and the potential consequences if their child does not get medical care from the specialist. If this behavior continues, a report to CPS would be warranted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A parent comes to clinic with their eight-year-old child for a well-child visit. The child, when asked if she feels safe, states "no."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Social determinants – You learn that the child is often home alone for several hours in the evening when the parent works due to lack of access to childcare after hours. This situation may represent a struggling single parent's/primary caregiver's limited resources and job requirements without a safer alternative for childcare while they work. In some jurisdictions, this situation will require a report to child protective services. However, this is a good opportunity to talk with the parent/primary caregiver about family and community resources to assist with childcare.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Child neglect – The child reports not feeling safe has been caring for herself and three younger siblings while the caregiver stays out all night with friends at parties. The child reports worrying about strangers coming to the door and also says she hides with her siblings while the caregiver is out. This is demonstrating supervisory neglect and would require a report to child protective services.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Failure to thrive</strong> – In children with failure to thrive, the presence of findings for possible child neglect can create a cognitive bias that prevents the identification of underlying medical illnesses. By definition, failure to thrive always involves inadequate nutritional intake, which negatively impacts normal growth. However, in addition to psychosocial assessment of the family, the cause of failure to thrive requires careful evaluation and may require supportive studies or specialty consultation to evaluate for medical illness including inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic disease, or other medical conditions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2864.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children younger than two years in resource-abundant settings: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other medical disease</strong> – Just as child abuse and neglect can be underrecognized and identified, the presence of findings of possible child neglect and even the identification of risk factors on the psychosocial assessment can create additional anchoring bias such that medical diseases that may mimic neglect are not considered. Perhaps the child does not have extensive skin infection from untreated scabies but instead has severe eczema, an undiagnosed generalized skin condition such as guttate psoriasis, or an immune disorder. At the same time, it is important that medical providers entertain a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating children and also remember that neglect and medical disease may coexist.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1705508303"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR CHILD ABUSE TEAM CONSULTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Consultation with a child abuse team, whenever available, is warranted if the medical care provider is not sure about assessment or diagnosis of child neglect or if, after full evaluation, the provider suspects that child neglect has occurred.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H53438722"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Partnership with caregiver(s) is crucial to the development of a multidisciplinary approach.

A general rule of thumb is to take an image of the child's name, date of birth, and medical record number (eg, medical label), followed by (1) images of the child's face and body (to document appearance and age at the time of the medical visit) and (2) images of the areas of concern with a ruler.

However, in circumstances in which the clinician believes that parental religious convictions interfere with appropriate medical care that is likely to prevent substantial harm, suffering, or death, the medical professional should consult with hospital legal services or risk management and request court authorization to override parental authority, or, under circumstances of imminent threat to a child's life intervene over parental objections [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In many jurisdictions, legal statutes support this approach but typically require that the medical professional provide sufficient evidence that, in the judgement of the professional, there is a risk to the minor's life or health <strong>and</strong> that the requirements of consent would result in a delay or denial of treatment. When faced with this situation, the medical professional should also consult with their hospital risk management for additional guidance. A report to child protective services (CPS) is also indicated.</p><p>If the need for treatment is not as immediate, the medical professional should contact hospital risk management, ensure a psychosocial assessment occurs, and consider a referral to child protective services (CPS) as temporary custody and/or court orders may also be needed for treatment.</p><p>Most states have exemptions to the child neglect laws for religious objection to medical care [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. However, the AAP views such exemptions as potentially harmful to children and advocates that all children, regardless of parental religious beliefs, deserve effective medical treatment when such treatment is likely to prevent substantial harm, suffering, or death [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In one review of 172 childhood fatalities associated with religion-motivated medical neglect, all but three of the cases would likely have had some benefit from clinical help [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. In 140 cases (81 percent), the deaths were due to conditions for which survival rates with medical care would have exceeded 90 percent; in another 18 cases (10 percent), the expected survival rates would have been &gt;50 percent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4102967596"><span class="h1">SEQUELAE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the impact of child neglect may not seem as obvious as physical or sexual abuse, the consequences of child neglect are just as serious [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Child neglect has a negative impact on all domains of child development: physical, cognitive, emotional, and social. Observational evidence also indicates that, similar to victims of physical and sexual abuse, neglected children demonstrate signs and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. During childhood, child neglect is associated with serious effects on emotional learning, behavior, caregiver-child interaction, and academic performance [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>], as well as high-risk behavior and criminal activity in adolescence [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>].</p><p>Neglect appears to predict negative outcomes in adulthood as well. For example, longitudinal studies of adults with adverse childhood experiences, including child abuse and neglect or being exposed to violence, mental illness, suicide, or substance abuse by members of the household have found that such adverse experiences are associated with serious health conditions (eg, heart disease, chronic lung disease, obesity, cancer, and depression) and, on average, a shorter life expectancy [<a href="#rid32">32-34</a>].</p><p>Child neglect can lead to childhood traumatic stress, the intense fear and stress response occurring when children are exposed to potentially traumatic experiences that overwhelm their ability to cope with what they have experienced [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Symptoms of childhood traumatic stress include difficulty with sleep, hypervigilance, intrusive thoughts, and changes in mood and cognition. Some may also experience suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts. When working with children who have experienced neglect, consider screening them for symptoms of trauma and suicidal ideation by using tools such as the PTSD Reaction Index Brief Form [<a href="#rid36">36</a>] or the recently developed Pediatric Traumatic Stress Screening Tool in the Intermountain Care Process Model [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Identifying childhood traumatic stress allows us to recommend trauma-focused therapeutic services to children and adolescents [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2845807293"><span class="h1">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect provides additional information and <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.childwelfare.gov%2F&amp;token=%2BnVJmPhZ7CoZ6P5TTscsQLsBZ2ecbmsXAe8YwBD4b1gKlfJ%2FQBKewcIFfn5dvpZr&amp;TOPIC_ID=6603" target="_blank">resources</a> regarding prevention, management, and statutes regarding the reporting of child abuse and neglect  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57326" href="/d/graphic/57326.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p>The following tools may be useful for psychosocial risk factor screening:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fviolenceprevention%2Faces%2F&amp;token=R4Uiw8%2FbmPVaqNHRDqpXLFvbQPQZlSZmQaVBi1DCIhgcvbxinIb8VjLejj3JSd%2FwmrzbF4wy4dY%2Bf3xwJtuW7A%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6603" target="_blank">Adverse childhood experiences questionnaire</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Safe environment for every kid (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekwellbeing.org%2Fabout-the-training%2F&amp;token=%2FOreZJGhTs9TBadFmdLpgvY5aMbHxH1vcXyUEUv9%2Fo81y5YwAalvj6Dh%2B%2FJVI4SuAsyw%2F%2BrHJXNojyM2dL948w%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6603" target="_blank">online training</a>) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthleadsusa.org%2Fresources%2Fthe-health-leads-screening-toolkit%2F&amp;token=j0GZ1kNQ6raYI%2B0T8ZyO67jLDNe4TulH0LmNL6GOJXdaJJfeQInUH%2Bqswjcp%2BVKYsD1TUKRe8dyaNLAgl07dfnuKphbQCow%2F0iNYp%2FMWNlE%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6603" target="_blank">Social needs screening toolkit</a> (screening for social needs including housing and food insecurity)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2301959305"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Specific types of neglect include physical, supervisory, emotional, educational, nutritional, dental, and medical neglect. (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong> – The manifestations of child neglect include any or all of the following (see <a class="local">'Clinical presentations'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Undernutrition or overnutrition</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Poor hygiene of child's body, clothes, or diapers</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Severe, untreated dental caries</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Injuries due to exposure (eg, frostbite, hypothermia, or heat illness)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>School truancy</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Injuries caused by lack of supervision (eg, ingestions, burns, near-drownings, or other "accidental" injuries)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lack of adherence to medical treatment plans with serious or life-threatening exacerbation of chronic health conditions in the child</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Inappropriate delay in seeking medical care for a seriously ill or injured child</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Proper evaluation for child neglect in the primary care setting requires a careful medical history, including psychosocial screening and assessment for risk factors for neglect  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117411" href="/d/graphic/117411.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), and a physical examination focused on findings that suggest neglect or abuse. (See <a class="local">'Medical history'</a> above and <a class="local">'Psychological assessment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients in emergency or urgent care settings, evaluation for neglect may need to be tailored to the presenting injury or medical disease as well as the concern for abuse or neglect. This concise approach includes:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History of current presentation and review of systems </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Past medical history of chronic health conditions </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medications (dose and knowledge of administration) </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nutrition</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Development (important for assessment of injury and supervision)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Family medical and social history. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Whenever possible, social work assessment and discussion with the primary care provider can be invaluable to identify psychosocial risk factors and, based upon caregiver resources and barriers to care, to clarify further the level of concern for neglect. (See <a class="local">'Children seeking urgent or emergency care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – Child neglect is a clinical diagnosis based upon a careful history, psychosocial assessment, physical examination, and, when appropriate, ancillary studies. Identifying child neglect can be challenging because it often results from caregiver inaction rather than caregiver infliction of physical or sexual abuse. Consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team and child abuse specialist can be helpful when the clinician is uncertain about the diagnosis and is warranted, whenever available, for all cases where child neglect is identified. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Indications for child abuse team consultation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – Child neglect must be differentiated from social determinants of health including poverty, food insecurity, housing insecurity, and lack of affordable childcare. In addition, the clinician must differentiate neglect from medical illnesses that may impact growth and development. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Once neglect is diagnosed, the health care team must first make a determination as to whether the child is being adequately supported by the caregiver such that voluntary interventions are appropriate or, because of harm that has already occurred or is very likely to occur, a report to child protective services (CPS) is needed. In addition, the team should determine if hospitalization is needed for medical treatment or to prevent further harm to the child. (See <a class="local">'Ensure child safety'</a> above and <a class="local">'Indications for hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because child neglect encompasses both actual and potential harm and can be attributed to factors related to the child, caregiver, environment, or resources, it is sometimes difficult to know when to involve CPS and other appropriate government agencies. The author's guidelines for reporting include, but are not limited to, the following (see <a class="local">'Notification of child protective services'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Child at risk of imminent harm</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Significant trauma or serious medical illness caused by the caretaker's failure to provide appropriate supervision or treatment</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Continuing neglect despite removing barriers, offering resources and support, and providing necessary education</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Gross failure to provide adequate food, shelter, clothing, protection, or education</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The management of child neglect is enhanced through the use of multidisciplinary teams, which at minimum should include the medical provider and a social worker with a medical home provided for children with special healthcare needs. (See <a class="local">'Assemble a multidisciplinary team'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Partnership with caregiver(s) is crucial to the development of a multidisciplinary approach. Caregivers rarely intend to harm the child. The provider should convey concern to the caregiver about the child's overall health and development, well-being, and safety.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A treatment plan should be developed that engages the caregiver and includes measurable outcomes. This plan should be written in conjunction with the caregiver at the caregiver's literacy level and signed by the provider and caregiver. (See <a class="local">'Assemble a multidisciplinary team'</a> above and <a class="local">'Engage the caregiver'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Children's Bureau.
