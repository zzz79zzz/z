         Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders diagnosed in childhood and adolescence [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Anxiety disorders that may begin in childhood include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder (collectively known as the “child anxiety triad”), in addition to selective mutism, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and specific phobia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pediatric anxiety disorders are associated with functional difficulty in childhood and tend to persist into adulthood, where they are associated with functional impairment and co-occurring psychiatric disorders [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. The development and testing of psychotherapies for pediatric anxiety disorders has largely been limited to cognitive-behavioral therapy and more recent advances in parent-child therapy in very young children.

         Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on the interplay between cognitions, behaviors, and emotions, helping patients to recognize and modify maladaptive anxiety-provoking thoughts and to change patterns of avoidance. The content of CBT programs can vary but typically includes psychoeducation and exposure to anxiety producing stimuli and situations, couched within an active and collaborative patient-therapist relationship, and reinforced by the use of patient-centered homework assignments.

         CBT is indicated for all of the childhood anxiety disorders, including separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia in adolescents and children age seven and older [

         Children younger than seven typically do not possess the developmental abilities needed to understand and apply cognitive-behavioral strategies to their symptoms, but CBT has been adapted for delivery to parents of children with anxiety disorders, or to parents and children together [

         CBT conceptualizes anxiety as a tripartite construct that involves interaction between physiological, cognitive, and behavioral components. Change in one of these three components sets up a process of change in one or more of the other two. CBT includes several key treatment components, such as psychoeducation, somatic management skills, cognitive restructuring, exposure to feared situations, and relapse prevention. Each component targets mechanisms that are believed to maintain maladaptive anxiety.

         Patients learn, for example, that the experience and sensations of anxiety are normal, but that maladaptive levels of anxiety interfere with their functioning (eg, leading to poor grades at school, few friendships, or poor work performance). Through self-monitoring of their daily lives and reactions, patients learn to recognize their individual patterns of responding to anxiety-provoking events and triggers with avoidance, increased negative thinking, and greater subjective feelings of distress.
        </p>
        <p>
         Self-monitoring may be in the form of paper-and-pencil diary forms or through commercially available software applications (eg, MindShift) [

         Somatic management skills, including diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, are intended to teach the patient to identify and effectively manage physical symptoms of anxiety.

        <p>
         Diaphragmatic breathing involves breathing slowly and deeply from the diaphragm, and is intended to facilitate a parasympathetic response. Progressive muscle relaxation involves systematically tensing and relaxing muscles throughout the body to relieve muscle tension associated with anxiety. Patients are encouraged to use these strategies when facing anxiety-provoking situations.

         Cognitive restructuring is a process of logically identifying and challenging maladaptive thoughts (eg, cognitive distortions) that may be contributing to or perpetuating anxiety. Common cognitive distortions, often labeled as “thinking traps,” are reviewed with patients and may include:

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Cognitions serve the same function across the anxiety disorders, to increase anxiety while prompting the child to avoid a situation or to act out with much distress. The focus of the thought varies according to the nature of the anxiety (social fears, general worries, separation concerns, fear of body sensations in panic), yet the process of restructuring these thoughts are the same across the disorders.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients are taught to identify these distortions and challenge them with alternative, coping-focused thoughts, such as:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         “What is the worst thing that can happen, and can I handle that?”
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         “What are the chances my fear will come true?”

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         “I have handled this situation before and I can do it again.”
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These strategies can be modified for each specific anxiety disorder and to match the age and developmental level of the child. As an example, a therapist may help a child with social anxiety disorder identify his thought, that no one will talk to him at an upcoming party, as “fortune telling” and help him identify a more adaptive alternate thought, such as, “If I’m invited, someone wants me there, and I might end up with a new friend.”
        </p>
        <p>
         A child with separation anxiety typically thinks the parent will not make it home from an evening out due to a catastrophe. The child is taught to address his or her inner thoughts with realistic challenges, “How many times has Mom gone out at night and not come home? She’s always returned! I can go to sleep and she’ll be happy to see me at breakfast!”

          Exposure
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Exposure treatment is central to all efficacious CBT for pediatric anxiety disorders; this involves the child gradually but repeatedly experiencing the feared situation with the intent of reducing the associated anxiety or learning to tolerate and manage normal, expected levels of anxiety [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Exposure directly targets the mechanism of avoidance, which allows symptoms of anxiety to perpetuate and often worsen. Through exposure, patients are guided in repetitions of facing anxiety-provoking situations, which typically causes the anxiety to diminish and in some cases remit. As an example, initial exposure treatment for a child with a specific phobia of dogs might begin with looking at pictures of dogs. Exposure proceeds to being physically near a dog, and then to petting a dog. Of note, exposure treatment of specific phobias is effective in one session, usually two to three hours in length.
        </p>
        <p>
         For some youth and situations, the goal of exposure would be learning to tolerate the associated anxiety as opposed to the goal of extinguishing it [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. This would be for situations where anxiety is typical and normal in magnitude(eg, when the child gives an oral report in class or asks someone on a date).
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients typically complete exposures in session with the therapist, and are then encouraged to complete exposures regularly between treatment sessions. The process of exposure is very similar across pediatric anxiety disorders, with only the content of exposures changing based on the child’s fears.
        </p>
        <p>
         For younger children, it is typically helpful to involve caregivers during in-session exposures so that they can lead their children in exposures at home. Older children and adolescents are often more able to complete exposures independently and may not want their caregivers’ involvement.

         Relapse prevention helps to sustain the effects of treatment by working with the patient to establish a contingency plan in the event that symptoms or functioning worsen after termination. The return of symptoms can be due to a setback, to external events (such as a return to school), or to taking on new, challenging developmental tasks. Further treatment might involve additional “booster sessions” of CBT, check-in calls, or other types of intervention.

At 12-month follow-up, treatment gains were maintained for both CBT groups. A statistically insignificant trend found greater efficacy for the combination of CBT plus parent involvement compared with CBT alone (81 versus 53 percent).

         Most trials evaluating CBT in children and adolescents involved individual treatment rather than group therapy. Participants typically received CBT over 12 to 20 weekly sessions of 45 to 60 minutes each. However, individualized treatment may not be available for all patients. In cases where individual treatment is unavailable or ineffective, we suggest the following treatments options. They may also be useful as augmentation of individual treatment for specific diagnosis (eg, social anxiety disorder):

         Cognitive- and behavioral-based therapies are the only psychotherapies that have been tested in randomized clinical trials in children and adolescents. (See

         Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on the interplay between cognitions, behaviors and emotions, helping patients to recognize and modify maladaptive anxiety-provoking thoughts and to change patterns of avoidance. The content of CBT programs can vary but typically includes psychoeducation and exposure to anxiety producing stimuli and situations, couched within an active and collaborative patient-therapist relationship, and reinforced by the use of patient-centered homework assignments.

         Exposure treatment is central to all efficacious CBT for pediatric anxiety disorders; this involves the child gradually but repeatedly experiencing the feared situation with the intent of reducing the associated anxiety, or learning to tolerate and manage normal, expected levels of anxiety. (See

         Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of individual CBT to treat separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder in children as young as seven years. CBT for panic disorder has empirical support in adolescence. Smaller trials suggest that CBT may be efficacious for selective mutism, separation anxiety disorder and comorbid anxiety and depression.

         A growing body of research suggests that clinical interventions with parents or parent and child may be efficacious for treating anxiety disorders in children and for children with separation disorder, both between age four and seven. These treatments are primarily adaptions of CBT strategies applied to older children and adolescents, but with greater parental involvement. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Adaptations for young children'

         We suggest CBT as a first-line treatment of children with an anxiety disorder of mild to moderate severity rather than an SSRI or other treatment (

         For children with a severe pediatric anxiety disorder, we suggest first-line treatment with a combination of CBT and an SSRI (
