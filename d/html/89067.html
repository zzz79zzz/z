As an example, studies of pregnant patients in Europe have found that antidepressants were used by approximately 3 percent [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>], and in the United States by 8 percent [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>]. The most commonly used and studied drugs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [<a href="#rid7">7,9-14</a>].</p><p>SSRIs and other antidepressants cross the placenta and fetal blood brain barrier. Prenatal exposure thus involves potential risks of teratogenesis, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and postnatal effects.</p><p>This topic reviews the potential adverse consequences that may be associated with using SSRIs during pregnancy, including teratogenicity, pregnancy complications, and other adverse outcomes. The potential adverse antenatal effects of antidepressants other than SSRIs, postnatal outcomes among infants exposed in utero to antidepressants, principles of teratology, choice of treatment for depressed pregnant patients, safety of antidepressants in lactating patients, and treatment of postpartum depression are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/100334.html" rel="external">"Antenatal use of antidepressants and risks of teratogenicity and adverse pregnancy outcomes: Drugs other than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5007.html" rel="external">"Antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Neonatal outcomes"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2940.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies: Approach to evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1703.html" rel="external">"Severe antenatal unipolar major depression: Choosing treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1720.html" rel="external">"Safety of infant exposure to antidepressants and benzodiazepines through breastfeeding"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88582.html" rel="external">"Severe postpartum unipolar major depression: Choosing treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H957822"><span class="h1">QUALITY OF EVIDENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Information about the risks of antidepressant medications during pregnancy comes from low- to moderate-quality studies. In the absence of randomized trials, the evidence is based upon observational studies that can yield associations confounded by measured and residual (unmeasured) factors [<a href="#rid10">10,13,15</a>]. Observational studies include retrospective case-control studies, which carry the risk of recall bias. In addition, population-based registry studies typically rely upon prescription databases that may misclassify exposure, given that patients may not take a prescribed drug. Some studies do not precisely define outcomes, or group together different types of malformations across a range of severity from mild to severe. Other studies do not specify the antidepressant dose or timing of use during the antenatal period. Some observed associations between exposure and outcome are based upon a small number of exposed and affected infants, and some associations may occur by chance due to an excessive number of comparisons.</p><p>Specific confounding factors that can lead to spurious associations between fetal exposure to antidepressants and adverse outcomes include the following [<a href="#rid10">10,11,13,16-18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confounding by indication – Anxiety, depressive, and other disorders are indications for using antidepressants. Pregnant patients who are psychiatrically ill and take antidepressants are often compared with pregnant patients who are healthy and do not take antidepressants; thus, observed associations between prenatal exposure to antidepressants and pregnancy outcomes may be confounded by exposure to maternal psychiatric illness. The association between the antidepressant and outcome may be spurious because it is the illness that is associated with the outcome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severity of illness – Among pregnant patients with depression or anxiety, the mental disorder is typically more severe in patients who are prescribed antidepressants than in patients not prescribed antidepressants.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other potential confounds in patients prescribed antidepressants for a particular disorder include sociodemographic factors such as age and socioeconomic status, comorbid general medical and psychiatric illnesses, and use of other medications (eg, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ascertainment (surveillance) bias may exist such that congenital defects, which might have otherwise gone undetected, are discovered in offspring of patients using antidepressants because they are more likely to undergo prenatal and postnatal ultrasonography, echocardiography, and thorough postnatal physical examination. Thus, there may be a greater likelihood that malformations are detected, especially mild defects, such as small ventricular septal defects that often close during childhood.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91002142"><span class="h2">Teratogenicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Observed associations that are inconsistent across studies are less likely to represent a true effect. Teratogens are thought to consistently cause similar types of malformations across studies [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, studies of antidepressant exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes often yield conflicting results and fail to show a pattern.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H260269969"><span class="h1">SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8874" href="/d/drug information/8874.html" rel="external">citalopram</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9046" href="/d/drug information/9046.html" rel="external">escitalopram</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8474" href="/d/drug information/8474.html" rel="external">fluvoxamine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9743" href="/d/drug information/9743.html" rel="external">paroxetine</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9886" href="/d/drug information/9886.html" rel="external">sertraline</a>. The adverse pregnancy risks of antidepressants have been more widely studied in SSRIs than other antidepressant medications because SSRIs are used more often [<a href="#rid13">13,19-22</a>]. Across multiple studies of patients who used antidepressants during the first trimester (total n approximately 110,000), SSRIs were prescribed for approximately 70 to 80 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,6,8,11,14,23</a>]. One prospective observational study of pregnant patients (n &gt;4000) found that among the 20 medications prescribed most often during the first trimester, three were SSRIs (sertraline, fluoxetine, and escitalopram) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Although SSRIs differ in their pharmacologic properties, the pregnancy outcomes observed for each drug (usually from underpowered analyses) are comparable, suggesting that the impact of SSRIs is likely a class effect of the SSRI drugs. Thus, studies that examine the antenatal risks of SSRIs primarily evaluate the drugs collectively rather than individually.</p><p>The pharmacology, administration, and side effects of SSRIs are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14675.html" rel="external">"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H260269993"><span class="h2">Teratogenicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In studies that analyzed birth defects collectively across different organ systems, most studies found that SSRIs as a drug class were not associated with congenital anomalies, indicating that SSRIs are not major teratogens [<a href="#rid5">5,10-12,16-18,24-32</a>].</p><p>Evidence that suggests SSRIs are not teratogenic includes the following observational studies [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of 12 observational studies compared infants of mothers who used antidepressants during pregnancy (n &gt;50,000; largely SSRIs) with unexposed infants (n &gt;1,200,000) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. The risk of congenital malformations was comparable in the two groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A subsequent national registry study (nearly 1,300,000 births) compared infants who were exposed to SSRIs in early pregnancy (n &gt;10,000) with infants not exposed [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. After adjusting for potential confounds (eg, maternal age, smoking, and body mass index [BMI]), the analyses found that the risk of severe congenital malformations was comparable in the two groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of three national registries included pregnancies that were exposed to SSRIs (n &gt;12,000) or not exposed (n &gt;500,000) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The incidence of major congenital anomalies in the exposed and unexposed offspring was comparable (3.1 and 2.7 percent).</p><p></p><p>In studies that have observed an association between SSRI exposure and congenital anomalies, the magnitude of the increased risk was small, and the analyses did not account for relevant confounding factors, such as depression or other indications for the SSRI [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of national registries from multiple countries identified infants who were exposed to SSRIs or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10042" href="/d/drug information/10042.html" rel="external">venlafaxine</a> during the first trimester (n &gt;36,000) and infants who were not exposed (n &gt;2,100,000); the analysis controlled for several potential confounding factors, such as maternal age, smoking, diabetes, and use of other medications (eg, antiepileptics) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The incidence of major birth defects was modestly greater for exposed infants than unexposed infants (odds ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.20). However, this clinically small increase was not observed in analyses that adjusted further for potential family-related confounding factors by analyzing siblings (2288 infants) discordant for both exposure and birth defects. The sibling-controlled analysis found that exposure was not associated with an increased risk of major birth defects (odds ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.91-1.24); this suggests that the increased risk observed in the initial analysis was the result of residual confounding due to other unmeasured factors that were not controlled for in the analysis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of nine studies included pregnant patients who received SSRIs in the first trimester and pregnant patients in the general population [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. The risk of major congenital anomalies was modestly greater in the offspring of patients treated with SSRIs (relative risk 1.11, 95% CI 1.03-1.19). However, some of the studies had limited control for potential confounders. In a second analysis that was restricted to the four studies that included only pregnant patients with psychiatric diagnoses, who either received SSRIs or did not, the risk in the two groups was comparable (relative risk 1.04, 95% CI 0.95-1.13). By including only pregnant patients with psychiatric diagnoses in both exposed and unexposed groups, the second meta-analysis controlled for confounding by indication.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H282408774"><span class="h3">Cardiac defects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is not known whether antenatal SSRIs are associated with congenital heart defects. Although multiple studies have reported that SSRIs are associated with a small increased risk of cardiovascular defects [<a href="#rid35">35,38</a>], several other studies have found no association between antenatal exposure to SSRIs and heart defects [<a href="#rid11">11,12,16,23,29,36</a>]. Also, in some studies that found antenatal SSRIs were associated with cardiac defects, the analyses failed to adjust for potential confounding factors [<a href="#rid33">33,39</a>]. </p><p>Observational studies that have found an association between prenatal exposure to antidepressants and a small increased risk of cardiovascular defects include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of 13 studies compared infants of mothers who used antidepressants (n &gt;20,000; largely SSRIs) during pregnancy with infants who were not exposed (n &gt;1,500,000) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Adjustment for potential confounding factors varied across studies and included maternal age, smoking, and psychiatric disorders. The risk of congenital cardiac malformations was increased in the group that was exposed to antidepressants (relative risk 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.7). Given that the baseline risk for cardiovascular malformations in the general population of infants is approximately 1 percent or 10 in 1000 [<a href="#rid40">40</a>], a relative risk increase of 1.4 would result in an absolute risk of 14 in 1000 live births.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of 10 studies found that the risk of congenital cardiac malformations was greater in infants exposed to SSRIs in utero (n &gt;22,000), compared with unexposed infants (n &gt;2,300,000; odds ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.01-1.73) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. For every 1000 children in each group, there were two more cases of cardiac defects in the exposed group (absolute risk difference). However, heterogeneity across studies was moderate to large.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A subsequent, national registry study included infants who were either exposed in utero to SSRIs (n = 845) or not exposed (n &gt;70,000) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. After adjusting for potential confounds (maternal age, year of conception, and use of antiepileptics or insulin), the analyses found an increased risk for “severe congenital heart defects” in the exposed group compared with unexposed infants (0.71 versus 0.17 percent). However, this result was based upon only six positive cases in the exposed group (limiting estimate precision), and adjustment for confounding was limited. More so, the overall risk for congenital heart defects was not elevated for SSRI exposure (1.30 versus 0.75 percent of infants), nor was there an elevated risk for ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, or pulmonary valve stenosis.</p><p></p><p>Observational studies that found antenatal SSRI exposure was not associated with an increased risk of cardiac defects include the following [<a href="#rid29">29,37</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of four studies included nearly 2 million pregnant patients who either used or did not use SSRIs; three studies relied upon electronic health records and one study used self-report questionnaires to assess SSRI use [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. The mean duration of follow-up ranged from discharge after delivery to six years. Adjustment for potential confounding factors varied across studies and included maternal depression, risk factors for congenital heart disease, and use of other psychotropic drugs. The risk of congenital heart defects in the exposed and unexposed offspring was comparable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A subsequent study of national registries from multiple countries identified infants who were exposed to SSRIs or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10042" href="/d/drug information/10042.html" rel="external">venlafaxine</a> during the first trimester (n &gt;36,000) and infants who were not exposed (n &gt;2,100,000); the analysis controlled for several potential confounding factors, including family-related confounding factors by analyzing siblings (2288 infants) discordant for both exposure and birth defects [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The incidence of cardiac defects was not increased in babies exposed to antidepressants.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of a national primary care database identified three groups of pregnant patients: those who were treated for depressive and anxiety disorders with SSRIs during the first trimester (exposed, n &gt;2700), patients who were treated for depressive and anxiety disorders with SSRIs before but not during pregnancy (discontinued medication, n &gt;5100), and those who were not treated with antidepressants before or during pregnancy (unexposed, n &gt;200,000) [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal age, alcohol and/or drug use, and use of antipsychotics), the analyses found that the risk of congenital heart anomalies within five years of birth was:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Comparable in the exposed offspring and unexposed offspring</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Comparable in the exposed infants and discontinued medication group of infants (this analysis controlled for confounding by indication)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The study also found that independent of antidepressant prescriptions, several covariates were associated with an increased risk for cardiac defects: increasing maternal age, diabetes in pregnancy, problematic alcohol and illicit drug use, and obesity. This suggests that the estimates of studies that fail to account for these variables may not be valid because of residual confounding.</p><p></p><p>The inconsistent results regarding the association between antenatal SSRI exposure and the risk of congenital heart defects may be explained at least in part by genetic factors that modify the risk [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>]. One study examined this hypothesis in mother-infant dyads that included 1180 infants with cardiac defects and 1644 control infants with no major cardiac defects [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. The investigators focused upon genetic variants related to the folate, homocysteine, and glutathione/transsulfuration metabolic pathways, which are implicated in the risk of cardiac defects, and may also be affected by SSRIs because they are involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as serotonin. Analysis of genetic samples found that in SSRI users, common maternal and infant genotypes associated with these metabolic pathways increased the risk of cardiac defects to varying degrees, depending upon the specific gene (relative risks ranging from 1.8 to 8.0). Among nonusers of SSRIs, the same genetic variants did not increase the risk.

Moderate to severe maternal major depression poses risks to both the mother and fetus that often outweigh the possible risks associated with antidepressants.

These low- to moderate-quality studies can yield associations confounded by indication, severity of illness, and unmeasured factors. (See <a class="local">'Quality of evidence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</strong> – SSRIs are used more widely for antenatal depression than other antidepressants, and more is known about the antenatal risks of SSRIs. Studies that examine the risks of SSRIs primarily evaluate the drugs collectively rather than individually. (See <a class="local">'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Teratogenicity</strong> – First trimester exposure to SSRIs is associated with a low risk of teratogenicity, and individual SSRIs as well as SSRIs as a group are not considered major teratogens. Although some data suggest that SSRIs (particularly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9743" href="/d/drug information/9743.html" rel="external">paroxetine</a>) may be associated with a small absolute increase in congenital heart defects, several studies have found no such association. (See <a class="local">'Teratogenicity'</a> above and <a class="local">'Teratogenicity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy complications</strong> – SSRIs are associated with little to no risk of miscarriage and gestational diabetes, and a small increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. It is possible that SSRI exposure during the third trimester is associated with an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preterm birth</strong> – In-utero exposure to SSRIs is associated with preterm birth (eg, &lt;37 weeks gestational age), and a small reduction in gestational age at birth that is probably not clinically significant. (See <a class="local">'Preterm birth'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low birth weight</strong> – It is not clear if SSRIs are associated with low birth weight. (See <a class="local">'Low birth weight'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Apgar scores</strong> – It remains unknown whether antenatal exposure to SSRIs is associated with low Apgar scores. (See <a class="local">'Apgar score'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Perinatal death</strong> – SSRIs do not appear to be associated with perinatal death.
