These criteria for the severe spectrum of disease are widely used and based on consensus expert opinion and clinical experience.</p><p>Most patients who have preeclampsia with severe features are delivered promptly to prevent maternal and fetal complications. Since the disease is progressive and no medical treatment to prevent progression exists (other than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9585" href="/z/d/drug information/9585.html" rel="external">magnesium sulfate</a> to prevent eclampsia), delivery is always in the mother's best interest. However, because preterm birth may not be in the newborn's best interest, delaying delivery to increase fetal maturity and thereby reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality can be considered under certain circumstances.</p><p>The risk of delaying delivery is that worsening maternal endothelial dysfunction and continued poor perfusion of major maternal organs may lead to severe injury to these end-organs, including the brain, liver, kidneys, hematologic and vascular systems, and placenta. Fetal risks include progressive growth restriction and demise from placental abruption or uteroplacental insufficiency. Therefore, when the clinician and patient choose to delay delivery, the specific circumstances prompting this approach rather than prompt delivery should be clearly documented and the decision revisited at regular intervals.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues that should be considered in selecting patients with preeclampsia with severe features for delayed versus prompt delivery. The overall management of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia is reviewed separately.

This topic will use the term preeclampsia with severe features as defined by ACOG, but it should be noted that studies published before the change in terminology used different features to characterize the severe end of the preeclampsia spectrum. The diagnosis of severe preeclampsia in these studies was sometimes based on hypertension with fetal growth restriction or proteinuria &gt;5 grams/day, which ACOG no longer considers features of severe disease. There is minor variation in terminology worldwide; for example, some guidelines consider uteroplacental dysfunction (including fetal growth restriction) a defining characteristic of preeclampsia since preeclampsia is a primary placental disorder [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6814.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Definitions/diagnostic criteria'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6814.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Typical presentation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6814.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Rare and atypical presentations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5979863"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a database of hospital discharge data for approximately 300,000 births in the United States from 1988 to 1997, the overall incidence of preeclampsia with severe features was approximately 1 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Studies limited to nulliparous patients report a 2 to 2.5 percent incidence of preeclampsia with severe features [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>Approximately 30 percent of cases occur before 34 weeks of gestation [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2262698"><span class="h1">MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Maternal</strong> – Serious maternal complications of preeclampsia with severe features include pulmonary edema, hypertensive encephalopathy, stroke, kidney failure, liver failure or rupture, retinal detachment or cortical blindness, disseminated intravascular coagulation, placental abruption, seizures (eclampsia), myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and death [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In studies of delaying delivery of preeclampsia with severe features with onset in the second trimester, 25 to 63 percent of patients developed serious complications, including HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), renal insufficiency, placental abruption, pulmonary edema, and eclampsia [<a href="#rid8">8-11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fetal</strong> – Serious fetal complications of preeclampsia with severe features include growth restriction and death. The frequency of these complications depends, in part, on the gestational age at onset: Early onset (variably defined as either second trimester or &lt;34 weeks of gestation) has a poorer prognosis than late onset (variably defined as either third trimester or ≥34 weeks of gestation). In one series, three neonatal deaths occurred among the 81 patients with early onset preeclampsia and none among the 511 patients with late-onset preeclampsia [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The frequency of a small for gestational age birth in patients with preeclampsia with severe features giving birth before versus after 34 weeks was 55 and 33 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Perinatal mortality</strong> – Studies of delaying delivery of preeclampsia with severe features with onset in the second trimester describe high perinatal mortality (PNM) [<a href="#rid8">8,11</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Onset &lt;22+6<sup> </sup>weeks – PNM 98 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Onset 23+0 to 23+6 weeks – PNM 87 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Onset 24+0 to 24+6 weeks – PNM 67 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Onset 25+0 to 26+0 weeks – PNM 40 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A limitation of these data is that fewer than 100 cases were available at each gestational age range. PNM varies among hospitals and is impacted by factors other than gestational age, such as sex, birth weight, and receipt of antenatal corticosteroids, and these factors should be considered when counseling individual patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13511.html" rel="external">"Periviable birth (limit of viability)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurodevelopment</strong> – Surviving infants are at high risk of short- and long-term morbidity, largely related to gestational age and weight at birth. For example, in a Dutch study that assessed neurodevelopmental outcome at age 4.5 years among 216 children of mothers with severe hypertensive complications of pregnancy, mean gestational age at delivery 31.4 weeks, and 91 percent incidence of growth restriction, only 54 percent had normal results on all tests of developmental outcome and 7 percent were attending special education classes, which is approximately sevenfold higher than the nationwide rate of 1 percent in the Netherlands [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4965.html" rel="external">"Overview of short-term complications in preterm infants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5062.html" rel="external">"Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3043391347"><span class="h1">INITIAL PATIENT EVALUATION AND CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with suspected preeclampsia should be admitted to the hospital to confirm the diagnosis, assess severity, monitor maternal and fetal status, and initiate supportive therapy or begin the process for delivery. Transfer to a tertiary care center should be considered, if necessary, to optimize care of the mother and the newborn in an intensive care setting and to access adequate ancillary support services (anesthesiology, blood bank, laboratory services) in the event of severe complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6814.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6825.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Antepartum management and timing of delivery"</a>.)</p><p>The following synopsis describes our initial assessment and management of pregnancies with preeclampsia with severe features:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Admission to the labor and delivery unit</strong> <strong>(or similar unit with equivalent monitoring and resources)</strong> – The patient may need to be monitored in an intensive care type setting for 48 hours or more.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Administration of antenatal corticosteroids</strong> to preterm pregnancies of appropriate gestational age if delivery is not imminent.

In this trial, which was conducted in countries with limited resources:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Expectant management resulted in an eight-day prolongation of pregnancy (10.3 versus 2.2 days for pregnancies delivered in 24 to 72 hours after a course of antenatal corticosteroids).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>However, perinatal mortality was similar in both groups (9.4 versus 8.7 percent), as was composite neonatal morbidity (56.4 versus 55.6 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Expectant management increased the risk of small for gestational age (21.7 versus 9.4 percent, relative risk [RR] 2.27, 95% CI 1.21-4.14) and abruption (7.6 versus 1.5 percent, RR 5.07, 95% CI 1.13-22.7).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The lack of newborn benefit from delaying delivery in this trial compared with the previous two trials may have been due to selection of patients at the most severe end of disease spectrum. Forty percent of patients in the expectant management group were delivered for uncontrollable hypertension (compared with 6 percent in an earlier trial [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]), which suggests that more aggressive attempts at blood pressure control might have resulted in greater prolongation of pregnancy and, in turn, less neonatal morbidity from preterm birth.
