         Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by fluctuating weakness involving ocular, bulbar, limb, and/or respiratory muscles. The weakness is due to an antibody-mediated immunologic attack directed at proteins in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction (acetylcholine receptors or receptor-associated proteins). MG is the most common disorder of neuromuscular transmission.

         Fluctuating muscle weakness is the core clinical feature of MG. Weakness may be focal or widespread, but specific patterns of weakness are characteristic of MG. Isolated ptosis and/or diplopia are most common, followed by bulbar presentations (eg, dysarthria or dysphagia). Other presentations such as limb or neuromuscular respiratory muscle weakness are uncommon. (See

         Weakness due to dysfunction in cranial nerves other than those controlling ocular functions may present as dysphagia, dysarthria, and/or facial drooping.

         Progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are forms of motor neuron disease that, like MG, can present with facial weakness, dysarthria, or dysphagia. PBP is characterized by bulbar symptoms of motor neuron disease  (

         <strong>
          not

         features of ALS. Other manifestations that distinguish ALS from MG on clinical grounds are the presence of both upper motor neuron signs (hyperreflexia, jaw jerk, and Babinski signs) and lower motor neuron signs (muscle and tongue atrophy and fasciculations), together with the progressive nature of ALS. In addition, electrodiagnostic studies are useful in differentiating these disorders. (See

         Some acute immune-mediated polyneuropathies are characterized by acute onset of cranial nerve impairment, often associated with seropositivity to antibodies against GQ1b, a component of myelin. These variant forms of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) include the Miller Fisher syndrome, which is characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, and the pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant syndrome, which features dysphagia with weakness in oropharyngeal, neck, and shoulder muscles. These polyneuropathies may be clinically distinguished from MG by the progressive nature of acute symptoms and the presence of reduced deep-tendon reflexes. The GQ1b syndromes are typically diagnosed by characteristic findings on cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electrodiagnostic studies. (See

         </span>
         Botulism can be confused with MG because it often presents with bulbar dysfunction due to symmetric (often multiple) cranial nerve palsies. Dysarthria, dysphagia, and diplopia are common. Patients may subsequently develop respiratory symptoms as well as limb weakness that typically progresses from upper to lower extremities and from proximal to distal muscles. Many patients require intubation for respiratory symptoms. Botulism may be distinguished from MG by its rapid progression and its usual association with ingestion of food contaminated by
         <em>
          Clostridium botulinum
         </em>
         . In addition, the botulinum toxin produces pupillary paralysis in approximately one-half of affected patients, whereas pupillary function is spared in MG. The presynaptic localization of the abnormality in botulism can be confirmed by an incremental response during high-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation or after brief exercise, similar to that seen in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).

         Isolated limb weakness is an uncommon presenting feature of MG but may also accompany ocular or bulbar symptoms or develop during the course of the condition. Many cerebral or spinal conditions can be distinguished from MG by the presence of sensory impairment in addition to weakness. However, some conditions in the differential diagnosis of MG feature limb weakness without sensory involvement.

         LEMS presents with muscle weakness and involves pathophysiologic impairment of neuromuscular transmission, similar to MG. LEMS is often a paraneoplastic manifestation of small-cell lung or other cancers but also may occur in the setting of autoimmune conditions. LEMS frequently presents with proximal leg muscle weakness. Patients may report difficulty standing from a seated position or climbing stairs. Proximal arm weakness at presentation is more common in MG, but shoulder girdle weakness eventually develops in many patients with LEMS. Initial involvement of the bulbar muscles or diplopia is uncommon in LEMS, but ptosis may be seen. Symptoms in LEMS are more likely to be present in the morning and to improve with exercise, while MG symptoms are likelier to be worse at the end of the day or following exertion or exercise. LEMS may also feature autonomic dysfunction or dry mouth. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5174.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Characteristic findings of LEMS on electrodiagnostic testing that help discriminate from MG include a marked increase in the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude with repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) at high rates (20 to 50 cycles per second) or after exercise (an incremental response). By contrast, RNS testing in patients with MG shows a decremental response of CMAP amplitude. In addition, a high titer of serum antibodies to the presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium channels are associated with LEMS. Less than 5 percent of patients with MG have such antibodies, typically at low titer. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5174.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ]. Distinction from MG in this setting is made by the presence of small-cell lung cancer (in half), antibodies directed against the P/Q-type calcium channels, and the electrophysiologic features of a presynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Rarely, a patient will have the clinical, immunologic, and electrophysiologic features of both disorders [

         ALS and some other forms of motor neuron disease, such as the flail arm and flail leg syndromes, feature prominent limb involvement at presentation. Similarly, patients with primary lateral sclerosis may present with limb symptoms due to impaired gait. Unlike those with MG, patients with motor neuron disease have both upper as well as lower motor signs and symptoms  (

         The typical clinical features of GBS and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (CIDP) include progressive symmetric muscle weakness and hyporeflexia. Ocular and bulbar symptoms may also be present in many patients. These immune-mediated polyneuropathies may be distinguished from MG by the progressive nature of symptoms, the presence of reduced deep-tendon reflexes, autonomic dysfunction, and by characteristic findings on cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electrodiagnostic studies.

          Stroke

However, weakness due to stroke is frequently accompanied by additional speech, sensory, or brainstem symptoms. The onset of stroke symptoms is typically sudden. Diagnosis is by brain and vascular imaging. (See

         Although fatigable weakness may be a major aspect of MG, it is important to differentiate this from complaints of generalized fatigue or tiredness. This lack of energy, often described as overwhelming fatigue, is not part of MG and is never the sole manifestation. This symptom is generally due to an underlying medical disorder (eg, anemia), progressive deconditioning, or psychologic etiology. The symptoms of MG usually include specific complaints of fatigable weakness. Examples include diplopia or ptosis that develop late in the day, difficulty with prolonged chewing, development of dysarthria or hypophonia with prolonged speech, or neck extensor weakness late in the day with the inability to keep the head upright.
