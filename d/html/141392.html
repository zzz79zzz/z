Lack of blanching is often best appreciated by diascopy which involves the use of a clear glass slide or drinking glass to apply pressure to the skin. They arise from bleeding into the skin from small capillaries. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Infection and thrombocytopenia are important causes of petechiae, although they may arise in other conditions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Purpura</strong> – Purpura are hemorrhagic lesions that are larger than petechiae and result from bleeding within the skin or mucous membranes from capillaries and other small blood vessels. Purpura can appear as nonblanchable dark red to dark purple macules, papules, patches, or plaques  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101339 graphicRef94772" href="/z/d/graphic/101339.html" rel="external">picture 2A-B</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52107" href="/z/d/graphic/52107.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53920" href="/z/d/graphic/53920.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). In some cases, purpura may be tender or painful.

In addition to direct trauma, they can be associated with coagulation disorders and severe thrombocytopenia. </p><p></p><p>Skin color can influence the appearance of purpuric skin lesions; darker skin pigmentation can reduce the visibility of purpura  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101339 graphicRef94772" href="/z/d/graphic/101339.html" rel="external">picture 2A-B</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4156623412"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Purpuric skin lesions may result from disruptions in vascular integrity (eg, infection, vasculitis, collagen disorders, trauma), abnormalities in primary or secondary hemostasis (thrombocytopenia, abnormal platelet function, clotting factor deficiency, or abnormal clotting factor function), or both (eg, disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by sepsis) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Careful evaluation of any child with petechiae and purpura is important to facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment, particularly in children who are ill-appearing. The type, location, and extent of the lesions, along with the overall appearance of the child, will help guide the initial evaluation and suggest the underlying cause. In children with fever and purpuric skin lesions, especially petechiae and/or purpura, serious infection with sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation require rapid recognition and treatment.

Clinically, these patients are ill-appearing and have fever, hypotension, and bleeding.

Erythema is followed by central areas of blue or black hemorrhagic necrosis with a surrounding erythematous border. The lesions are painful and indurated.

The patient may be uncomfortable and refuse to walk. Palpable purpura with or without petechiae is an essential finding for the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72094" href="/z/d/graphic/72094.html" rel="external">picture 12</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101339" href="/z/d/graphic/101339.html" rel="external">picture 2A</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79783" href="/z/d/graphic/79783.html" rel="external">picture 13</a>). The purpura tend to be concentrated in dependent areas such as the buttocks and lower extremities. The face, trunk, and upper extremities may be involved in nonambulatory children. Other clinical manifestations include periorbital and pedal edema, arthritis (commonly of the knees and ankles), abdominal pain with or without gastrointestinal bleeding, scrotal swelling, and nephritis. A normal platelet count and coagulation studies distinguishes IgAV from other causes of vasculitis including infection, Kawasaki disease, infection, leukemia, lymphoma, and rheumatologic disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6406.html" rel="external">"IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6430.html" rel="external">"Vasculitis in children: Evaluation overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3720304197"><span class="h3">Drug-induced vasculitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Numerous drugs have been associated with vasculitis and purpura.

It may occur in individuals with severely restricted diets (anorexia, neurodevelopmental delay, and/or hyperalimentation without vitamin C supplementation). Vitamin C deficiency results in impaired collagen synthesis.</p><p>The typical pathologic manifestations of vitamin C deficiency are noted in collagen-containing tissues and in organs and tissues such as skin, cartilage, dentin, osteoid, and capillary blood vessels. Scurvy may present with gum bleeding, petechiae or ecchymoses. In addition, the prominence of hair follicles on the thighs and buttocks and the eruption of coiled, fragmented hair with a characteristic corkscrew appearance are specific features of vitamin C deficiency. Petechiae found on the skin have a characteristic pale halo ring around a central erythematous core  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64172" href="/z/d/graphic/64172.html" rel="external">picture 14</a>). These lesions heal rapidly after the administration of vitamin C.

This heterogeneous group is characterized by joint hypermobility, cutaneous fragility, and hyperextensibility. Fragility of dermal skin is common, with frequent bruises and delayed wound healing. In some cases, abnormal blood vessel structure causes capillary hemorrhage.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1734194988"><span class="h3">Pigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPDs)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The PPDs, also known as capillaritis, purpura simplex, and inflammatory purpura without vasculitis, are a group of chronic, benign, cutaneous eruptions characterized by the presence of petechiae, purpura, and yellow to brown pigmented patches caused by hemosiderin deposition within the dermis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88990" href="/z/d/graphic/88990.html" rel="external">picture 15</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88997" href="/z/d/graphic/88997.html" rel="external">picture 16</a>). PPDs most commonly occur on the lower extremities and may be asymptomatic or pruritic. PPD is not painful and is not associated with bleeding or systemic illness . The diagnosis is usually made through clinical inspection and the recognition of classic clinical features. A skin biopsy is useful when the diagnosis remains uncertain following clinical examination. Biopsies may help to distinguish PPD from disorders in the differential diagnosis, such as cutaneous vasculitis. There are several different subtypes of PPD, although Schamberg disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67127" href="/z/d/graphic/67127.html" rel="external">picture 17</a>) is the most common.
