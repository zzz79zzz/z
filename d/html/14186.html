Pelvic surgery requires a comprehensive knowledge of the pelvic anatomy to safely attain access, maximize exposure, ensure hemostasis, and avoid injury to viscera, blood vessels, and nerves.</p><p>The anatomy of the female lower genital and urinary tract that is clinically pertinent to the pelvic surgeon when operating from a vaginal or perineal approach is reviewed here. Also included is a discussion of the contemporary understanding of female pelvic organ support, with an emphasis on the functional and surgical anatomy of the vagina, urethra, and pelvic floor. The anatomy of the female genital tract and lower urinary and gastrointestinal tracts relevant to the surgeon performing laparotomy or laparoscopy is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14185.html" rel="external">"Surgical female pelvic anatomy: Uterus and related structures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7744471"><span class="h1">SURGICAL PEARLS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anatomic features that are clinically applicable to female pelvic surgery are indented and bulleted throughout the text.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26037966"><span class="h1">PELVIC BONES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At birth, the bones that make up the pelvis are the ilium, ischium, pubis, sacrum, and coccyx. The ilium, ischium and pubis fuse by age 16 to 18 years to form a single bone, referred to as the pelvic bone. Thus, in an adult, the bones of the pelvis consist of the right and left pelvic bones, the sacrum and the coccyx (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87086" href="/z/d/graphic/87086.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87087" href="/z/d/graphic/87087.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The bony pelvis is the rigid foundation to which all of the pelvic ligaments and muscles are anchored.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26037973"><span class="h2">Ilium</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most superior component of the pelvic bone is the ilium. The upper part of the ilium expands to form a flat fan-shaped "wing," which provides support for the lower abdomen, and is also called the false pelvis. The medial surface of the ilium has two concavities forming the lateral borders of the pelvic outlet (the inferior opening of the pelvis). The superior and larger of these two concavities is the greater sciatic notch (boundaries are the sacrum, ilium, and ischial spine).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26037980"><span class="h2">Ischium</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ischium is the posterior and inferior part of the pelvic bone. The posterior margin of the bone is marked by prominent projection called the ischial spine, an important surgical landmark. (See <a class="local">'Ischial spine'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26037987"><span class="h2">Sacrum</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The sacrum is composed of five sacral vertebrae that are fused together. Nerve foramina are positioned anterior and laterally, through which run the sacral nerves. Overlying the middle of the sacrum is a rich neurovascular bed. The coccyx is attached inferiorly and is the posterior border of the pelvic outlet.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26037994"><span class="h2">Pubis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The anterior and inferior part of the pelvic bone is the pubis. The superior and inferior pubic rami are located anteriorly and articulate in the midline at the pubic symphysis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During pregnancy, there is increased mobility at the pubic symphysis, which may result in pain. Pubic symphysis is an uncommon peripartum complication. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/427.html" rel="external">"Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Musculoskeletal changes and pain", section on 'Pelvic girdle pain'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038043"><span class="h2">Orientation of the bony pelvis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although pelvic surgeons often visualize the orientation of the pelvis in the supine or dorsal lithotomy position, it is important to understand and discuss the bony pelvis from the perspective of a standing woman. In the standing woman, the pelvis is oriented such that the anterior superior iliac spines and the front edge of the pubic symphysis are in the same vertical plane, perpendicular to the floor (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87092" href="/z/d/graphic/87092.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). As a consequence, the pelvic inlet is tilted anteriorly and ischiopubic rami and urogenital hiatus (the gap between the anteromedial borders of the pubococcygeus muscle through which the vagina and urethra pass) (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62230" href="/z/d/graphic/62230.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) are parallel to the ground. In the upright position, the bony arches of the pelvic inlet are oriented in an almost vertical plane. This directs the pressure of the intraabdominal and pelvic contents toward the bones of the pelvis instead of toward the muscles and endopelvic fascia attachments of the pelvic floor. Thus, in the standing position, the bony pelvis is oriented such that forces are dispersed to minimize the pressures on the pelvic viscera and musculature and transmit the forces to the bones that are better suited to the long-term, cumulative stress of daily life. Where the pubic rami articulate in the midline, they are nearly horizontal. Much of the weight of the abdominal and pelvic viscera is supported by this bony articulation inferiorly.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H527753"><span class="h2">Surgical landmarks of the bony pelvis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The bones of the pelvis provide a number of important fixed anatomic landmarks that are important to the pelvic surgeon, including the ischial spine, coccyx, pubic arch, pectineal line, and obturator foramen.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H527761"><span class="h3">Ischial spine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ischial spine is a sharp bony projection on the medial surface of the ischium that separates the greater sciatic notch from the lesser sciatic notch. The ischial spine is important clinically and anatomically, as it can be palpated easily via the vagina, rectum, or retropubic space and serves as a point of fixation for many structures that are important for pelvic organ support. The tendinous lateral attachments of the levator ani muscle (arcus tendineus levator ani) and the vagina (arcus tendineus fascia pelvis) insert posteriorly onto the ischial spine (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62230" href="/z/d/graphic/62230.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>); these tendinous structures overlap, but are distinct structures. Similarly, the ischial spine represents the lateral attachment site of the sacrospinous ligament (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87086" href="/z/d/graphic/87086.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Arcus tendineus levator ani'</a> below and <a class="local">'Endopelvic fascia'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The sacrospinous ligament attaches to the ischial spine, and the spine is an important landmark during sacrospinous ligament suspension for the repair of prolapse of the vaginal apex. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8073.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Surgical repair of apical prolapse (uterine or vaginal vault prolapse)", section on 'Sacrospinous ligament suspension'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When performing a paravaginal repair, either vaginally or retropubically, the ischial spine can be palpated to identify the proximal location of the lateral vaginal attachment (arcus tendineus fascia pelvis), which is also the most proximal location of the repair.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When a pudendal block is administered, the ischial spine is palpated and the anesthetic is injected medial and posterior to it (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57711" href="/z/d/graphic/57711.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5404.html" rel="external">"Pudendal and paracervical block"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During labor and delivery, the ischial spine is palpated to determine the station of the presenting fetal part.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H527790"><span class="h3">Coccyx</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The coccyx is the terminal portion of the sacrum and consists of four fused coccygeal vertebrae. It is palpable transvaginally or transrectally and is a useful landmark surgically during sacrospinous ligament suspension for repair of prolapse of the vaginal apex, since it marks the inferior-medial border of the sacrospinous ligament (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87086" href="/z/d/graphic/87086.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H527798"><span class="h3">Pubic arch</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The two pubic bones form an arch beneath the pubic symphysis. The pubic arch serves as the upper and lateral borders of the urogenital triangle under which the distal urethra and vagina exit (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87091" href="/z/d/graphic/87091.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). The mean pubic arch angle is 75 degrees (plus/minus 12 degrees); however, wide variability can be seen (range 44 to 110 degrees) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A narrow pubic arch is a recognized risk factor for failed vaginal hysterectomy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3308.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy: Vaginal"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H527806"><span class="h3">Pectineal line</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ridge along the superior, medial surface of the superior pubic rami is called the pectineal line. Anteriorly, this line is continuous with the pubic crest. Overlying the pectineal line is the pectineal ligament, also called Cooper's ligament. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The pectineal ligament is an important point of attachment for the Burch colposuspension procedure, a surgery to correct female stress urinary incontinence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8070.html" rel="external">"Female stress urinary incontinence: Choosing a primary surgical procedure"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H527814"><span class="h3">Obturator foramen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The obturator foramen is bordered superiorly by the grooved obturator surface of the superior pubic ramus, medially by the body and inferior ramus of the pubis, inferiorly by the ramus of the ischium, and laterally by the anterior border of the body of the ischium. In women, its shape is nearly triangular. The area of the obturator foramen is on average 12.2 cm<sup>2</sup>, but can vary considerably (range 7.4 to 18.2 cm<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The obturator vessels and nerve pass through the obturator foramen. </p><p>Transobturator midurethral slings for treatment of stress urinary incontinence are inserted through the obturator foramens bilaterally and exit through the skin of the groin area. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14218.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in females: Transobturator midurethral slings"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038050"><span class="h1">PELVIC LIGAMENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two major ligaments link the pelvic bones to the sacrum and coccyx, the sacrotuberous ligament and the sacrospinous ligament (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87086" href="/z/d/graphic/87086.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). These ligaments also convert the two notches on the pelvic bones into foramina on the lateral pelvic walls, the greater and lesser sciatic foramen. The ligaments of the sacro-iliac joint are rarely encountered during pelvic surgery and are not addressed here.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038057"><span class="h2">Sacrospinous ligament</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The sacrospinous ligament is a strong, triangular-shaped ligament; the apex attaches to the ischial spine laterally and the base attaches to the distal sacrum and coccyx medially. Its average length is 5.3 cm (range 4.4 to 6.6 cm) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This ligament divides the lateral pelvic outlet into two foramina, the greater sciatic foramen superiorly and the lesser sciatic foramen inferiorly. The coccygeus muscle is located on the superior surface of the sacrospinous ligament. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The sacrospinous ligament is a common attachment point for the vaginal apex for procedures that treat prolapse of the vaginal apex (ie, sacrospinous ligament fixation). Similarly, several commercially available "mesh kits" for treating apical vaginal prolapse place trocars or other fixation devices through the sacrospinous ligament. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8073.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Surgical repair of apical prolapse (uterine or vaginal vault prolapse)", section on 'Sacrospinous ligament suspension'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8077.html" rel="external">"Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Use in pelvic organ prolapse", section on 'Transvaginal mesh kits'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>There are a number of neurovascular structures in close proximity to the sacrospinous ligament. These must be avoided when placing sutures or trocars in the ligament (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87093" href="/z/d/graphic/87093.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). The pudendal neurovascular bundle passes behind the ischial spine and lateral aspect of the sacrospinous ligament as it exits the pelvis and enters the ischioanal fossa (see <a class="local">'Pudendal neurovascular bundle'</a> below). The S3 sacral nerve root and/or the pudendal nerve course parallel over the superior border of the sacrospinous ligament. The inferior gluteal artery, a branch of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, is located, on average, 2.4 cm from the ischial spine and a mean vertical distance of 3.4 mm (range 1 to 5 mm) above the superior border of the sacrospinous ligament [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>Given the close proximity of these structures, the recommended location for suture or trocar placement is at least two fingerbreadths medial to the ischial spine and ideally in the lateral one-third of the ligament safely below its superior border (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87094" href="/z/d/graphic/87094.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8073.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Surgical repair of apical prolapse (uterine or vaginal vault prolapse)", section on 'Sacrospinous ligament suspension'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8073.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Surgical repair of apical prolapse (uterine or vaginal vault prolapse)", section on 'Iliococcygeus suspension'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038064"><span class="h2">Sacrotuberous ligament</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The sacrotuberous ligament is also a triangular-shaped ligament (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87086" href="/z/d/graphic/87086.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). It has a broad base that extends from the posterior superior iliac spine along the lateral margin of the sacrum and coccyx. The apex of the ligament is attached to the medial margin of the ischial tuberosity. The sacrotuberous ligament forms the lateral-inferior border of the lesser sciatic foramen. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038071"><span class="h1">PELVIC MUSCLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pelvic muscles include the muscles of the pelvic sidewall and of the pelvic floor.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038078"><span class="h2">Muscles of the pelvic sidewall</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The obturator internus and piriformis are the muscles of the pelvic sidewalls (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62230" href="/z/d/graphic/62230.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038085"><span class="h3">Obturator internus muscle</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The obturator internus muscle lies on the superior (intrapelvic) side of the obturator membrane. The obturator internus origin is on the inferior margin of the superior pubic ramus and the pelvic surface of the obturator membrane. Its tendon passes through the lesser sciatic foramen to insert onto the greater trochanter of the femur to laterally rotate the thigh. The obturator internus is innervated by the obturator nerve, which originates from L5 to S2.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038092"><span class="h3">Piriformis muscle</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The piriformis muscle is part of the pelvic sidewall and is located dorsal and lateral to the coccygeus. It extends from the anterolateral sacrum to pass through the greater sciatic foramen and insert on the greater trochanter. Lying on top of the piriformis is a particularly large neurovascular plexus, the lumbosacral plexus.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038099"><span class="h2">Muscles of the pelvic floor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The skeletal muscles of the pelvic floor include the levator ani muscles, the coccygeus muscle, the external anal sphincter, the striated urethral sphincter and the deep and superficial perineal muscles (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62230" href="/z/d/graphic/62230.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The levator ani muscle complex consists of the pubococcygeus (also called pubovisceral), the puborectalis, and iliococcygeus muscles [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. </p><p>The fusion of levator ani in the midline creates the so-called "levator plate." The urogenital hiatus is the space between the levator ani musculature through which the urethra, vagina, and rectum pass.</p><p>The muscles of the pelvic floor, particularly the levator ani muscles, provide support to the pelvic visceral organs and play an integral role in urinary, defecatory, and sexual function.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038106"><span class="h3">Arcus tendineus levator ani</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is a linear thickening of the fascial covering of the obturator internus muscle called the arcus tendineus levator ani.

This activity serves to close the urethral and anal sphincters, narrow the urogenital hiatus, and provide a constant support for the pelvic viscera.

In a woman with normal pelvic floor function, the levator ani muscle complex is in a tonically contracted state and has an intricate three-dimensional structure. The anterior portion of the muscle complex (pubococcygeus and puborectalis muscles) is oriented vertically as a sling around the mid-urethra, vagina and anorectum, and the posterior portion (iliococcygeus muscle) has a horizontal upwardly biconvex shape resembling the appearance of a "butterfly wing" (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87156" href="/z/d/graphic/87156.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Thus, the anterior portion of the levator ani complex serves to close the urogenital hiatus and pull the urethra, vagina, perineum and anorectum toward pubic bone, while the horizontally oriented posterior portion (levator plate) serves as a supportive diaphragm or "backstop" behind the pelvic viscera. </p><p>Loss of normal levator ani tone, through denervation or direct muscle trauma, results in a more open urogenital hiatus, loss of the horizontal orientation of the levator plate, and a more bowl-like configuration.

Within the vestibule, the ducts of the Skene (paraurethral) glands open on each side of the lateral margin of the urethra.

The longitudinal shape of the vagina resembles a trapezoid, narrowest at the introitus and becoming progressively wider as it approaches the vaginal apex and cervix. In the transverse plane, the vagina has a box-like configuration at its distal end (toward the introitus) and is flattened proximally. In the sagittal plane, the vagina has a distinct angulation. The upper two-thirds of the vagina angles toward the third and fourth sacral vertebrae and is almost horizontal in the standing position (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87164" href="/z/d/graphic/87164.html" rel="external">figure 19</a>). In contrast, the lower one-third is nearly vertical as it passes through the perineal membrane to the vestibule. The angle between the upper and lower axis of the vagina is approximately 130° [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>There is considerable variability in the length, size, and width of the vagina among women. Based on magnetic resonance imaging studies of women with normal support, the average length of the anterior vaginal wall is 6.3 cm with a wide range: 4.4 to 8.4 cm. Similarly, the average length of the posterior vaginal wall is 9.8 cm with a range of 5.1 to 14.4 cm [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The vaginal width is largest at its cranial portion and decreases as it passes through the pelvic diaphragm to be smallest at the introitus. There are large variations in transverse dimensions, and, in one study, as much as a fivefold variation seen in total vaginal surface area (34 to 164 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Histologically, the vaginal wall is composed of three layers: mucosa, muscularis, and adventitia [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. The vaginal mucosa is the inner layer and consists of stratified squamous epithelium and a lamina propria. The lamina propria contains no glands. Coursing through the lamina propria are small blood vessels. Vaginal lubrication is via a transudate from the vessels, cervix, and from the Bartholin and Skene glands. The vaginal muscularis is a well-developed fibromuscular layer consisting primarily of interdigitating smooth muscle bundles with smaller amounts of collagen, elastin, and vascular tissue [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. The outermost adventitia is a mixed layer of collagen, elastin, and adipose tissue containing blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The adventitia represents an extension of the visceral endopelvic fascia that surrounds the vagina and adjacent pelvic organs and allows for their independent expansion and contraction.</p><p>The terms pubocervical fascia and rectovaginal fascia have been used to describe the layer separating the vagina from the bladder and rectum, respectively. Although these terms are widely used, the use of the term "fascia" is a misnomer, as it does not accurately reflect the histology of the vagina. Numerous histological analyses of the vaginal wall have failed to identify a distinct "fascial" layer [<a href="#rid18">18,24,25</a>]. Between the adjacent pelvic organs is primarily vaginal muscularis. The "fascia" often noted by pelvic surgeons during vaginal dissection, in fact, refers to layers that are developed as a result of separating the vaginal epithelium from the muscularis, or by splitting the vaginal muscularis layer [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The only area in which there does appear to be dense connective tissue separating the vagina from an adjacent organ is the distal posterior vaginal wall. The connective tissue of the perineal body extends 2 to 4 cm cephalad from the hymenal ring along the posterior vaginal wall between the smooth muscle layers of the vagina and the rectum [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].

It averages approximately 2 to 3 cm in length and 6 mm in diameter. The junction of the urethra to the bladder is called the bladder neck, or vesical neck. The urethra then continues its course fused to the vagina for its distal two-thirds, and terminates at the external urethral meatus in the vulvar vestibule directly above the vaginal introitus. The female urethra is slightly curved as it passes from the bladder in the retropubic space, through the perineal membrane, to the vestibule.</p><p>Histologically, the urethra has four distinct layers: mucosa, submucosa, internal urethral sphincter (smooth muscle) and striated external urethral sphincter. The submucosal layer is highly vascular. The blood supply of the urethra derives from extensions of the pudendal vessels and the vesical vessels [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. These vascular cushions, along with the urethral mucosa, account for approximately a third of the urethral resting tone, while the internal and external urethral sphincters account for the remainder [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. </p><p>The internal urethral sphincter is primarily composed of oblique and longitudinal smooth muscle fibers, with a few circularly oriented outer fibers. The precise function of this longitudinal smooth muscle is not known, however, it has been suggested that these longitudinal fibers serve as "filler volume" within the circular smooth muscle and striated urethral sphincter, whose presence improves the efficiency of the sphincter mechanism by allowing closure of the urethral lumen with only a small amount of circular muscle shortening [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>The skeletal muscle component of the urethral sphincter consists of the external urethral sphincter (also called sphincter urethrae), as well as the compressor urethrae and the urethrovaginalis muscle described previously (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87165" href="/z/d/graphic/87165.html" rel="external">figure 22</a>). These three muscles, which function as a single unit, have been called the striated urogenital sphincter [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Together, they are approximately 2.5 cm in length and encircle the urethra in its mid-portion from just below the bladder neck to the perineal membrane within the deep perineal space. The striated urogenital sphincter provides approximately one-third of urethral resting tone and is responsible for the voluntary and reflex increases in intraurethral pressure needed to maintain continence. The smooth muscle portion of the urethra is innervated by the autonomic nerves of the pelvic plexus, while the striated urethral sphincter is innervated by branches of the pudendal nerve [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>Normal urethral function depends upon normal support of the urethra, as well as its intrinsic sphincter mechanism. As with vaginal support, dynamic interaction between the levator ani muscle complex and the connective tissue supports of the urethra is essential. The urethra lies on a hammock-like supportive layer composed of periurethral endopelvic fascia and anterior vaginal wall [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Increased intraabdominal pressure, as with a cough or sneeze, causes compression of the urethra against this hammock-like layer thereby compressing and closing the urethral lumen. The stability of the suburethral layer depends upon the intact connection of the anterior vaginal wall and its connective tissue attachments to the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis and levator ani muscles. These attachments allow the pelvic floor muscle's normal resting tone to maintain the position of the urethra and bladder neck. They are also responsible for the posterior movement of the vesical neck seen at the onset of micturition (when the pelvic floor relaxes) and for the elevation noted when a patient is instructed to arrest the urinary stream. Defects in these attachments can result in proximal urethral support defects (urethral hypermobility) and anterior vaginal prolapse (cystocele), and contribute to stress urinary incontinence.

Inferiorly, the peritoneum sweeps off the bladder into the vesicouterine pouch. The remainder of the bladder is retroperitoneal. </p><p>The bladder is quite distensible. When empty, the bladder is pyramid-shaped, with the apex pointed toward the pubic bone. When full, the bladder is spherical, with normal capacities ranging from 400 to 500 mL, and can transform from being a pelvic organ to an abdominal one, rising above the pubic bone. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When the bladder is distended, the musculature of the dome can become relatively thin. Thus, prior to initiating a pelvic surgical procedure, decompression of the bladder using a bladder catheter can help avoid injury. </p><p></p><p>The regions of the bladder include the dome, superiorly, and the base, inferiorly. The base of the bladder lies directly on the anterior vaginal wall and consists of the trigone and detrusor loop, a thickening of the detrusor muscle, the thickness of which does not vary with filling of the bladder. </p><p>The bladder trigone is a triangular area at the base of the bladder bounded by the internal urethral meatus and the two ureteric orifices. The ureteric orifices and the internal urethral meatus are equidistant from each other with each side of the trigone measuring approximately 3 cm (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87167" href="/z/d/graphic/87167.html" rel="external">figure 23</a>) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The superior border of the trigone between the ureteric orifices is raised and known as the intraureteric ridge. During hysterectomy, inadvertent bladder injury may occur during dissection of the vesicovaginal space. Such injuries are commonly located just superior to the intraureteric ridge in the midline.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Injury to the bladder dome may occur during peritoneal entry for laparotomy or suprapubic port placement during a laparoscopy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Injury to the inferior regions of the bladder may occur during hysterectomy when the bladder is dissected off the lower uterine segment and cervix. The most common site of injury during this dissection is in the midline just superior to the intraureteric ridge. Risk factors for this type of injury include conditions that cause scar tissue in the vesicouterine pouch, such as cesarean delivery, bladder surgery (eg, anterior colporrhaphy), pelvic infection, endometriosis, distorted anatomy from fibroids or malignancy, or prior pelvic radiation. An elongated cervix may also predispose the patient to bladder injury, as the surgeon may not dissect the bladder as far caudally as necessary prior to performing the colpotomy or placing the vaginal cuff sutures, or by necessitating repeat dissections of the vesicovaginal space. </p><p></p><p>Histologically, the bladder is lined by three layers: mucosa, muscle, and adventitia. The bladder mucosa consists of a transitional cell epithelium and underlying lamina propria, and is also known as the urothelium. The muscular layer, or the detrusor muscle, consists of interlacing bundles of smooth muscle. This plexiform arrangement of detrusor muscle bundles is ideally suited to reduce all dimensions of the bladder lumen on contraction. The outer adventitial layer primarily consists of adipose tissue and loose connective tissue.</p><p>The blood supply to the bladder includes the superior and inferior vesical arteries, which are branches of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac artery. Bladder innervation is provided by the parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic fibers of the pelvic and hypogastric nerve plexuses, respectively.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H574355"><span class="h2">Ureters</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ureters are retroperitoneal structures that run from the renal pelvis to the bladder. They are approximately 25 to 30 cm in length from the renal pelvis to the trigone of the bladder. The pelvic brim divides them into abdominal and pelvic segments, each of which is approximately 12 to 15 cm in length.</p><p>The pelvic ureters can be injured during pelvic surgery (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76515" href="/z/d/graphic/76515.html" rel="external">figure 24</a>).

The ureter then courses medially as the uterosacral ligament is traced from the sacrum toward the vagina. At the level of the ischial spine, the ureter is approximately 2.3 cm lateral to the uterosacral ligament [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

Histologically, it is composed of collagen, elastin, adipose tissue, nerves, vessels, lymph channels, and smooth muscle. This connective tissue network tethers the vagina and uterus in their normal anatomic location, yet allows for the mobility of the viscera to permit storage of urine and stool, coitus, parturition, and defecation.</p><p>Several areas of the endopelvic fascia (and its associated peritoneum) have been named by anatomists. These are really condensations of the endopelvic fascia and not true ligaments: uterosacral ligament, cardinal ligament, broad ligament, mesovarium, mesosalpinx, and the round ligament. The broad ligament, mesovarium, mesosalpinx, and round ligament do not play a role in support of the pelvic organs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038241"><span class="h3">Level I support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Three levels of connective tissue supports of the vagina have been described (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60888 graphicRef61643" href="/z/d/graphic/60888.html" rel="external">figure 28A-B</a>) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The uterosacral/cardinal ligament complex, which comprises level I support, is an intricate three-dimensional connective tissue structure that originates at the cervix and upper vagina and inserts at the pelvic sidewall and sacrum. Magnetic resonance images of healthy women reveal that the uterosacral ligament inserts in the area of the coccygeus muscle and sacrospinous ligament in most women, with only 7 percent actually inserting into the sacrum [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. The uterosacral/cardinal ligament complex suspends the uterus and upper vagina in its normal orientation. It serves to maintain vaginal length and keep the vaginal axis nearly horizontal in a standing woman so that it can be supported by the levator plate. Loss of Level I support contributes to prolapse of the uterus and/or vaginal apex.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038248"><span class="h3">Level II support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Contiguous with the uterosacral/cardinal ligament complex at the location of the ischial spine is Level II support, the paravaginal attachments. The anterior vaginal wall is suspended laterally to the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis (ATFP) or "white line," which is a thickened condensation of fascia overlying the iliococcygeus muscle. The ATFP originates on the ischial spine and inserts on the inferior aspect of the pubic symphysis. The ATFP overlaps the arcus tendineus levator ani proximally from the ischial spine, but they diverge distally as they approach the pubic symphysis. The anterior Level II supports suspend the mid-portion of the anterior vaginal wall creating the anterior lateral vaginal sulci. Detachment of these lateral supports can lead to paravaginal defects and prolapse of the anterior vaginal wall.</p><p>Similar to the anterior paravaginal supports, there are posterior lateral supports at Level II, as well. The posterior vaginal wall is attached laterally to the pelvic sidewall in a slightly more complex arrangement than the anterior vaginal wall. The distal half of the posterior vaginal wall fuses with the aponeurosis of the levator ani muscle from the perineal body along a line referred to as the arcus tendineus rectovaginalis. It converges with the ATFP at a point approximately midway between the pubic symphysis and the ischial spine [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Along the proximal half of the vagina, the anterior and posterior vaginal walls are both supported laterally to the ATFP. Thus, in the proximal vagina, the lateral supports for the anterior and posterior vaginal wall are identical. This arrangement accounts for the H-shape or box-like configuration of distal vagina when viewed in cross-section and the flattened tube configuration seen in upper vagina (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60888 graphicRef61643" href="/z/d/graphic/60888.html" rel="external">figure 28A-B</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038255"><span class="h3">Level III support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Level III support is provided by the perineal membrane, the muscles of the deep perineal space and the perineal body. These structures support and maintain the normal anatomical position of the urethra and distal one-third of the vagina, which, in a standing woman, is perpendicular to the floor. Anteriorly, the vagina fuses with the urethra at Level III, and posteriorly, with the perineal body. Disruption of Level III support anteriorly can result in urethral hypermobility and stress incontinence, and disruption posteriorly may result in distal rectoceles and/or perineal descent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26038262"><span class="h2">Interactions between the muscular and connective tissue supports</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Normal pelvic organ support and function depend upon dynamic interaction between the pelvic floor musculature and the endopelvic fascia. In a standing woman, the endopelvic fascia suspends the upper vagina, the bladder, and the rectum over the levator plate while the pelvic floor muscles close the urogenital hiatus and provide a stable platform on which the pelvic viscera rests. Intraabdominal and gravitational forces are applied perpendicular to the vagina and pelvic floor while the pelvic floor musculature counters those forces with its constant tone by closing. With proper tone of the pelvic floor muscles, stress on the connective tissue attachments is minimized. Furthermore, in times of acute stress, such as a cough or sneeze, there is a reflex contraction of the pelvic floor musculature countering and further stabilizing the viscera.<strong> </strong>The urogenital hiatus also responds by narrowing to maintain Level III support. With pelvic floor weakness, such as neuropathic injury or mechanical muscular damage, there is loss of the horizontal orientation of the levator plate, the urogenital hiatus opens, and pelvic floor assumes a more bowl-like configuration. The endopelvic fascia then becomes the primary mechanism of support. Over time, this stress can overcome the endopelvic fascial attachments and result in loss of the normal anatomical position through breaks, stretching, or attenuation of these connective tissue supports. This can result in changes in the vector forces applied to the viscera and may lead to pelvic organ prolapse and/or dysfunction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H576197"><span class="h1">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pelvic surgery in women requires a comprehensive knowledge of the pelvic anatomy to safely attain access, maximize exposure, ensure hemostasis, and avoid injury to viscera, blood vessels, and nerves.
