Both develop from the embryonic cloacal membrane and are sites of fusions of endodermal and ectodermal tissue to form a squamocolumnar epithelial junction. Both areas may display normal metaplastic change and abnormal change related to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82322" href="/d/graphic/82322.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8031.html" rel="external">"Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer"</a>.)</p><p>HPVs are the most common sexually transmitted agent in the United States. The biology of these viruses has been studied extensively and their link with malignancies is well established, especially with cancers involving the anogenital (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal) tract. Anal neoplasia caused by HPV can manifest as preinvasive (squamous intraepithelial lesions [SIL]) or invasive (anal cancer) disease. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment of anal SIL are discussed here. Topics related to invasive anal cancer are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2474.html" rel="external">"Classification and epidemiology of anal cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2469.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and staging of anal cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/123063.html" rel="external">"Treatment of anal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H519506419"><span class="h1">HISTOPATHOLOGY AND NOMENCLATURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anal SIL and other histopathologic manifestations of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are most commonly detected at the anal transition zone (ATZ), where the rectal columnar epithelium and anal squamous epithelium meet  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539" href="/d/graphic/62539.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Both cytology and histology are used to identify anal SIL. Anal cytology involves the use of a swab to collect a sample of cells without direct visualization of the anal canal. High-resolution anoscopy (HRA), a method of examining the anal canal that uses application of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9277" href="/d/drug information/9277.html" rel="external">acetic acid</a>, Lugol iodine, and magnification, is performed to obtain a histologic specimen [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Anal cytology'</a> below and <a class="local">'High-resolution anoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p>Cytologically, anal SIL shares features with cervical SIL (also termed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN]), and both anal and cervical cytology are described using the Bethesda classification system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef102346" href="/d/graphic/102346.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3205.html" rel="external">"Cervical cancer screening: The cytology and human papillomavirus report"</a>.)</p><p>Cytology is reported, in order of increasing severity, as negative for SIL, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), low-grade SIL (LSIL), atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade SIL (ASC-H), and high-grade SIL (HSIL) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Anal cytology'</a> below.)</p><p>Prior histologic classification of HPV-associated lesions reflected a morphologic continuum in which infection was accompanied by a gradual progression towards invasive cancer [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Lesions were termed intraepithelial neoplasia (IN) grades 1, 2, or 3 depending on the severity of the morphologic changes. The nomenclature for IN was further modified depending on the anatomical site of infection. Thus, IN from the anal canal was termed anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grades 1, 2, or 3.</p><p>However, it is now known that a substantial proportion of anal SIL are transient and do not progress to invasive cancer. (See <a class="local">'Natural history'</a> below.)</p><p>Therefore, terminology that reflects a morphologic continuum may be outdated. The College of American Pathologists and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) have developed more updated guidelines for terminology via the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology project. These recommendations reflect the distinction between benign and precancerous SIL and include the use of a two-tiered nomenclature in which LSIL and HSIL are used for both cytology and histopathologic grading across all anogenital sites [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Histopathologic lesions that were previously classified as AIN 1 correspond to anal LSIL. LSIL is diagnosed when abnormal basaloid cells, characterized by squamous cells with abnormal nuclei and increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, extend less than one-third of the thickness of the epithelium above the basal layer [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The superficial layers may also show HPV cytopathic effect with koilocytes, enlarged cells with a cytoplasmic halo surrounding the nucleus; their presence is an indication of active HPV replication.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lesions previously classified as AIN 3 correspond to anal HSIL. A biopsy is diagnosed as HSIL when the abnormal basaloid cells extend into the upper layers of the squamous epithelium  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82322" href="/d/graphic/82322.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The classification of lesions previously described as AIN 2 is dependent on the results of p16 staining, a biomarker of cellular proliferation [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Lesions previously classified as AIN 2 that are p16-negative are downgraded to LSIL and lesions previously classified as AIN 2 that are p16-positive are classified as HSIL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For lesions in the cervix, it is strongly recommended to qualify a histologic HSIL result by either CIN 2 or CIN 3. Per the 2019 ASCCP guidelines for the management of cervical cytologic and histologic abnormalities, this distinction remains both biologically and clinically important in the cervix [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3216.html" rel="external">"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention", section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similarly, anal LSIL and HSIL may be further classified by the applicable IN subcategorization (eg, LSIL [AIN 1], HSIL [AIN 2], or HSIL [AIN 3]).</p><p></p><p>The biologic consequences of anal SIL are analogous to those of cervical SIL. Anal HSIL (corresponding to p16-positive AIN 2 and AIN 3) is considered to be premalignant and may progress to invasive anal cancer [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], whereas anal LSIL [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] (corresponding to AIN 1 and p16-negative AIN 2) is not considered a direct precursor of anal cancer, but it may occur in patients who are also at high risk for concurrent or incident HSIL in the anus and/or other anogenital locations [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3179.html" rel="external">"Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of risk factors have been identified in the development of anal SIL. The most important of these are anal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>], sexual behavior [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>], and HIV, especially in the setting of lower cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts [<a href="#rid9">9,14-16</a>]. (See <a class="local">'HIV'</a> below.)</p><p>Approaches to screening for anal SIL in high-risk groups are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Who should be screened for anal SIL?'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">HPV infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary but insufficient for the development of SIL, including high-grade SIL (HSIL). HPV are a family of nonenveloped DNA viruses that infect epithelial cells. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8314.html" rel="external">"Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations"</a>.)</p><p>About 40 HPV types are sexually transmitted and specifically infect the anogenital and upper digestive tract. Of these, 15 to 20 are oncogenic or high-risk (hr-HPV) strains, and are associated with invasive squamous cell carcinoma at their site of infection. More than 90 percent of cases of anal cancer are associated with hr-HPV infection of the anal canal and/or perianal tissues. In the general population, the association between hr-HPV and anal cancer is primarily with hr-HPV type 16 [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Low-risk HPV types are mainly associated with low-grade SIL (LSIL), including genital warts or condyloma acuminata. The low-risk types 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90 percent of genital warts [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99981.html" rel="external">"Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Given that anal HPV infection is needed for the development of anal SIL, it is unsurprising that the prevalence of anal SIL correlates well with observed patterns of anal HPV infection [<a href="#rid12">12,17,19-22</a>]. A large meta-analysis of studies evaluating the prevalence of HPV in individuals with a variety of cytopathologic and histopathologic specimens noted a clear association between HPV prevalence and the presence of SIL, with the strength of the association increasing according to lesion severity [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The strongest association existed between the prevalence of HPV type 16 and HSIL [<a href="#rid17">17,23</a>]. This observation is consistent with the strong association between HPV type 16 infection and invasive anal cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2474.html" rel="external">"Classification and epidemiology of anal cancer", section on 'Human papillomavirus infection'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the strength of this association, not all cases of anal HPV infection, including with hr-HPV types, result in anal SIL. A randomized trial of HPV vaccination in 235 males living with HIV (MLWH) identified anal HSIL in only 38 percent of participants with anal HPV 16 infection [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The mechanisms determining whether or not HSIL develops in the presence of hr-HPV infection are incompletely understood.</p><p>The spectrum of HPV types with both low-risk and high-risk phenotypes in the anal canal is similar to that described in the cervix. In addition to HPV 16, one group identified 29 individual HPV types and 10 HPV groups from the anal canal of males who have sex with males (MSM), both with and without HIV [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3216.html" rel="external">"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention", section on 'Types'</a>.)</p><p>Some individuals, particularly people living with HIV (PLWH), are more frequently infected with multiple HPV types [<a href="#rid12">12,25</a>]. This has been associated with both the presence of anal SIL, and an increased risk for HSIL compared with infection with a single HPV type or the absence of detectable infection [<a href="#rid22">22,25-27</a>].</p><p>Among females, there is significant concordance between cervical and anal HPV infection, particularly at the HPV type-specific level [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. In a systematic review of studies with paired cervical and anal samples, for females older than age 45 years with cervical HPV 16 infection, the prevalence of HPV 16-positive anal HSIL was as high as 25 percent [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. This suggests that different anatomical areas can serve as potential reservoirs of infection for each other. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8314.html" rel="external">"Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations", section on 'Anal infections'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1116102"><span class="h2">Sexual behavior</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following sections describe the impact of sexual behavior on the risk of anal SIL in males and females without HIV. The available information on individuals living with HIV is presented further below. (See <a class="local">'HIV'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Males</strong> – In men, studies on anal SIL have focused primarily on MSM because they are considered at increased risk of developing anal cancer compared with males who do not have sex with men. Both the number of sexual partners and a history of anal receptive intercourse are associated with anal SIL in MSM:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a study of 1262 MSM without HIV, anal SIL, as detected by anal cytology, was present in 20 percent of the population (5 percent with HSIL and 15 percent with LSIL) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The presence of more than five sexual partners as well as the presence of five receptive anal intercourse partners in the previous six months were associated with anal SIL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the same study, the prevalence of SIL did not vary with age, which is consistent with the observation that the prevalence of anal HPV infection is also stable with age [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. This contrasts with the epidemiology of cervical HPV and SIL, where age-related declines are well documented (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3216.html" rel="external">"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention"</a>). The stable prevalence of anal HPV and SIL over time was postulated to reflect multiple, new, transient infections occurring due to the ongoing presence of multiple sexual partners across different age groups in the urban population studied.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Although anal cytology can provide relevant information, the gold standard for SIL diagnosis is high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) with targeted biopsies. The Study of the Prevention of Anal Cancer (SPANC), a three-year cohort study in Sydney, Australia, reported a prevalence of LSIL and HSIL of 26.4 and 32.3 percent, respectively, among 396 MSM without HIV who underwent baseline HRA at enrollment [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. (See <a class="local">'High-resolution anoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The prevalence of anal SIL in males without HIV who have sex with females (MSW) is unknown</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Females</strong> – While anal HPV infection is known to be common in young, healthy females [<a href="#rid32">32</a>], data on the prevalence of anal SIL in the general female population are more limited since the majority of available studies have focused on females with risk factors for anal cancer, such as HIV. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8314.html" rel="external">"Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations", section on 'Females'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Existing data, however, suggest that despite the high prevalence of HPV infection, anal SIL is relatively rare within the general female population, implying that infections are often transient:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In female adolescents without HIV, the rate of SIL as detected by abnormal anal cytology was 5.7 percent [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The prevalence of abnormal anal cytology in a somewhat older population of healthy females was 4 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Two small studies from Brazil used HRA to evaluate the prevalence of anal SIL in females without risk factors for anal cancer. In the first study of 74 healthy females with negative cervical cytology, 1.4 percent had LSIL and none had HSIL [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. The second study was comprised of 76 healthy females and similarly found an LSIL prevalence of 2.6 percent and no cases of HSIL [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p></p><p>In addition to anal HPV infection [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], risk factors for anal SIL in females include a history of anal receptive intercourse [<a href="#rid33">33,35</a>], number of partners [<a href="#rid33">33</a>], as well as HPV infection and a history of SIL at other genital sites (cervical, vaginal, vulvar) [<a href="#rid11">11,34,35</a>].</p><p>Practices unrelated to sexual behavior may also result in anal HPV infection through spread of HPV from the cervicovaginal tract. In a study from Australia, wiping from front to back post-toilet may result in higher rates of anal HPV infection and anal SIL than patting or wiping in the other direction [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4219443740"><span class="h2">HIV</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H467709143"><span class="h3">High-risk HPV and SIL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PLWH are at elevated risk for anal hr-HPV, as well as for anal SIL, including HSIL [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Males</strong> – For MLWH the following data are available:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A meta-analysis reported a significantly increased prevalence of anal SIL by HRA (63 versus 37 percent), including LSIL (29 versus 11 percent) and HSIL (29 versus 15 percent), in MSM living with HIV (MSMLWH) compared with MSM without HIV [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

More recent work, however, does suggest a modest protective effect of ART [<a href="#rid52">52-55</a>].

Swabs with scored or wooden shafts that can break off should be avoided [<a href="#rid87">87</a>]. Collection of anal cytology should occur prior to digital anorectal examination or anoscopy to avoid loss of cellular yield and morphology associated with lubrication. It is most commonly performed without direct visualization of the anal canal. The patient is typically positioned in the left lateral position. Next, the moistened swab is gently inserted until it cannot be advanced any further because it has reached the wall of the rectum, thus positioning the swab proximal to the anorectal transformation zone. The swab is then withdrawn with lateral pressure, using a spiral motion to sample the entire circumference of the anal canal.

The sensitivity and specificity rates of anal cytology to detect biopsy-proven anal HSIL were 83 and 45 percent, respectively in a meta-analysis of studies evaluating techniques for anal HSIL detection in MSMLWH [<a href="#rid93">93</a>]. PPV and NPV were 36 and 87 percent, respectively. These results are consistent with previous studies [<a href="#rid92">92,94-96</a>], and reflect the use of any cytologic abnormality, including atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), as the threshold for HRA referral.

Therefore, while a negative cytologic evaluation will not entirely exclude anal HSIL, it is considered acceptable for most patients given the slow progression of anal HSIL, and that fact that overall NPV is expected to increase with serial cytology samples over time. Also worth noting is that 59 percent of MSM and 42 percent of females had abnormal cytology in the above studies, reflecting the large number of HRA referrals that are generated by screening anal cytology [<a href="#rid93">93,97</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While the use of any abnormality on anal cytology as the threshold for HRA referral decreases the overall specificity of anal cytology, any report of HSIL on anal cytology is fairly specific for the presence of histologic (biopsy-documented) HSIL.

These diagnostics may perform better in other at-risk populations where the prevalence of anal hr-HPV is lower. In this setting, a substantial proportion of individuals would test negative for hr-HPV and would forego additional work-up.</p><p>There has been substantial interest in the application of molecular techniques to detect anal HSIL given some of the limits associated with anal cytology. Testing for hr-HPV subtypes has been studied fairly extensively in MSMLWH even though this test has not been explicitly approved for use in the anal canal. Unfortunately, due to the ubiquitous nature of anal hr-HPV in MSMLWH, the use of hr-HPV testing as an alternative to anal cytology appears to add little benefit [<a href="#rid93">93,99</a>]. In these studies, similar to the performance of anal cytology, sensitivity and NPV using molecular diagnostic tests were reasonably high while specificity and PPV remained limited. While some studies that evaluated testing for hr-HPV or HPV 16 in conjunction with anal cytology found improved performance relative to cytology alone [<a href="#rid100">100,101</a>], but this has not been a consistent finding [<a href="#rid99">99,102</a>].
