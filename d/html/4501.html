CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm SLL. The term CLL is used when the disease manifests primarily in the bone marrow and blood, while the term SLL is used when involvement is primarily nodal (ie, absolute B lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood &lt;5000/microL [5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L]). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4716.html" rel="external">"Classification of hematopoietic neoplasms"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4513.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p>Treatment is indicated when there are disease-related symptoms or evidence of progression (ie, "active disease"  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96185" href="/d/graphic/96185.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)). Except for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), treatment options for CLL are not curative. The International Workshop Group on CLL (iwCLL) published a revised version of the guidelines for evaluating disease response that were published in 1996 by the National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCI/WG)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99325" href="/d/graphic/99325.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. These efforts in developing standardized criteria for the evaluation of response have also allowed comparison of results from different therapeutic trials.</p><p>The response evaluation and criteria will be reviewed here. The initial treatment of CLL/SLL, the treatment of relapsed or refractory disease, and the management of the complications of CLL/SLL are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4545.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4520.html" rel="external">"Treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4504.html" rel="external">"Overview of the complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">RESPONSE ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3751833341"><span class="h2">Evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should be evaluated before each treatment cycle to determine how their disease is responding to therapy. The specific evaluation performed to assess the response to therapy differs depending on whether the patient is enrolled in a therapeutic research protocol (clinical trial) or is being treated in general practice [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For those treated in general practice, response evaluation should always include a history, physical examination, and complete blood count with differential. The history should include questions regarding constitutional symptoms such as unintentional weight loss, fatigue, fevers, and night sweats. The physical examination should pay particular attention to the evaluation of lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although bone marrow biopsy with absence of CLL infiltrates on histology is required to confirm a complete remission (CR), it is not always recommended in general practice as it may not impact management. Bone marrow evaluation is indicated in patients with cytopenias of uncertain cause.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the above clinical and hematologic parameters are compatible with a CR and the clinician chooses not to perform a bone marrow biopsy, the documented response can be either "partial remission" or "clinical CR, bone marrow biopsy not performed." The latter is not an official response category and is not used in clinical trials. However, this phrasing allows the patient to avoid bone marrow evaluation, limits ambiguity, and allows for more accurate data capture in registry studies or upon enrollment on a future clinical trial.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For those treated as a part of a research protocol, the evaluation includes all that was just discussed. In addition, occult involvement is evaluated using computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Patients should also undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsy two months after all other findings are found to be compatible with CR. Assessment for measurable residual disease (MRD, also called "minimal residual disease") is often performed using four to eight color flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. A lymph node biopsy should be obtained if transformation into an aggressive lymphoma is suspected (ie, Richter transformation). Richter transformation is suspected in patients who develop rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy or extranodal sites of disease, systemic symptoms, or elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase. (See <a class="local">'Measurable residual disease'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4728.html" rel="external">"Richter transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma", section on 'Clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4728.html" rel="external">"Richter transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma", section on 'Image-directed biopsy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The use of imaging studies is reserved for the research setting because it has not demonstrated a clinical benefit and is unlikely to change the management of most patients. This was demonstrated in a meta-analysis that included 1372 patients receiving initial therapy for CLL [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Of the 481 episodes of progressive disease, 77 percent were detected by clinical symptoms or changes in the blood counts. A decision to treat relapsed disease was made based on the results of CT or ultrasound alone in only two patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H938716289"><span class="h2">Timing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients treated with a therapy for a defined treatment duration, response assessment should be performed at least two months after the completion of therapy [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

If a hypocellular marrow is found, the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be repeated in four to six weeks provided the peripheral blood counts have recovered. The marrow should be at least normocellular for age and free of clonal CLL cells by morphology and immunohistochemistry. If nodules (lymphoid aggregates) are found on bone marrow biopsy, these may represent residual disease (ie, nodular PR) and so should be assessed by immunohistochemistry to determine if they are principally comprised of CLL cells or of lymphocytes other than CLL cells or T cells. If nodules are not composed of CLL cells, a CR can be documented provided all other criteria are met.

MRD testing uses multicolor flow cytometry, real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and/or next-generation sequencing to look for small malignant clones in patients following chemotherapy [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>]. While the sensitivity depends on the technique used, modern assays for MRD can reliably detect approximately one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Those who have less than one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes have undetectable MRD.</p><p>Clinical trial data suggest that patients who have high levels of detectable MRD have inferior clinical outcomes when compared with those with low levels of MRD or with undetectable MRD [<a href="#rid9">9,11-17</a>]. As an example, in an analysis of data from three trials of first-line chemoimmunotherapy, MRD detection was associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. A greater treatment effect on MRD correlated with a larger impact on PFS. Similarly, a correlation between MRD status and PFS was also seen in another study of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL treated with fixed duration <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="107696" href="/d/drug information/107696.html" rel="external">venetoclax</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Prospective trials are necessary to determine whether there is a significant clinical benefit from adjusting treatment based on MRD status (eg, additional therapy to convert a response from a CR with MRD to a CR with undetectable MRD).</p><p>Conversely, studies are investigating whether MRD can be used to identify patients who may have good outcomes after less therapy. In a single institution prospective study evaluating a planned six courses of FCR (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8452" href="/d/drug information/8452.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>) as initial therapy in 237 patients with CLL, undetectable MRD was achieved after three courses in 17 percent and by the end of therapy in 43 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Among those achieving undetectable MRD, there was no apparent difference in progression-free survival according to the time to undetectable MRD (after three courses or by the end of therapy) or the number of treatment courses received (three or fewer courses versus more). Randomized trials are needed to verify that no clinical benefit is lost by stopping therapy after achieving undetectable MRD.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">PR categories</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H327183"><span class="h3">Partial remission</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A PR requires demonstration of response both clinically and hematologically  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99325" href="/d/graphic/99325.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>At least two of these <strong>clinical criteria</strong> must be documented [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A decrease in the peripheral absolute lymphocyte count by at least 50 percent from the level prior to therapy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A reduction in previously enlarged nodes by at least 50 percent with no increase in the size of any single lymph node and no new enlarged lymph nodes.

For patients treated with these drugs, the label "progressive disease" should be reserved for cases that demonstrate other definitive signs of progression (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly) in addition to increased lymphocytosis. Lymphocytosis alone should not interfere with the identification of a partial response. (See <a class="local">'Progressive disease'</a> below.)</p><p>While not included as an official response category in the iwCLL, the term "nodal response" has been used to describe a reduction in lymphadenopathy in the setting of persistent lymphocytosis [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This term was initially designated for use in trials of B cell receptor and adhesion-related kinase inhibitors (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="91587" href="/d/drug information/91587.html" rel="external">ibrutinib</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96416" href="/d/drug information/96416.html" rel="external">idelalisib</a>). Treatment with these agents commonly results in tumor mobilization from tissues into the peripheral blood characterized by the rapid development of lymphocytosis, often with a concomitant shrinkage of involved lymph nodes. The lymphocytosis usually resolves with continued treatment but may be persistent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H327448"><span class="h3">Nodular partial remission</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Persistent bone marrow nodules on bone marrow biopsy in patients achieving a CR or PR are classified separately as a nodular PR [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Lymphoid aggregates should be evaluated with immunohistochemistry to determine whether they are comprised of CLL cells, lymphocytes other than CLL cells, or T cells. Nodular PR is confirmed when the lymphoid aggregates are clonal lymphocytes with an immunophenotype consistent with CLL (monoclonal light chains, expression of B cell antigens, and CD5 expression). If nodules are not composed of CLL cells, a CR can be documented provided all other criteria are met. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4513.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma", section on 'Immunophenotype'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Progressive disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Progressive disease (PD) is defined by the presence of one or more of the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99325" href="/d/graphic/99325.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The appearance of a newly enlarged lymph node (≥1.5 cm), splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or other organ infiltration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An increase of 50 percent or more in size of a previously involved site (eg, lymph nodes, spleen, or liver) measuring ≥1.5 cm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An increase of 50 percent or more in the total circulating lymphocyte count with at least 5000 lymphocytes per microL.

Conclusions from a Lymphoma Research Foundation-sponsored workshop highlight the need to consider the following caveats with regard to PD [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tumor flare</strong> – Tumor flare is a reaction to drug treatment predominantly characterized by the rapid development of painful and swollen lymphadenopathy with or without fever, bone pain, rash, and lymphocytosis [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. It is most commonly seen in patients with CLL treated with immunomodulatory drugs such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10095" href="/d/drug information/10095.html" rel="external">thalidomide</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9822" href="/d/drug information/9822.html" rel="external">lenalidomide</a>. Symptoms may resolve after a drug holiday and/or be mitigated by pretreatment with other agents (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>). For patients receiving an immunomodulatory drug, clinicians should reserve the label PD for cases that demonstrate symptoms of PD not typical of tumor flare or that fail to resolve after the introduction of interventions known to mitigate tumor flare.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tumor mobilization</strong> – Tumor mobilization from tissues into the peripheral blood is characterized by the rapid development of lymphocytosis frequently persisting over months, often with a concomitant shrinkage of involved lymph nodes. It is most commonly seen in patients with CLL treated with B cell receptor and adhesion-related kinase inhibitors (eg, Bruton tyrosine kinase [BTK] and Pi3K inhibitors) [<a href="#rid20">20-23</a>]. The lymphocytosis usually resolves with continued treatment but may be persistent. For patients receiving a drug associated with tumor mobilization, clinicians should reserve the label PD for cases that demonstrate other definitive signs of PD (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly). Lymphocytosis alone should not interfere with the identification of a partial response.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
