         </span>
         Abnormal movements and behaviors during sleep are part of a larger group of nocturnal events that may occur during sleep, wake, or the transitions into or out of sleep. These events are most common early in life, affecting approximately 15 to 20 percent of children and 4 percent of adults [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Nocturnal events are typically divided into simple behaviors (eg, single movements, repetitive or periodic movements, rhythmical movements) and complex behaviors (eg, sleep talking, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, dream enactment) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103094" href="/z/d/graphic/103094.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         A detailed history, including a clear description from the patient and ideally a bed partner or caregiver witness, is the cornerstone of establishing clues about the underlying etiology. The challenge for the clinician is to recognize when certain nocturnal events signal an underlying, treatable disorder, an emerging neurological abnormality, or a benign age-appropriate episode.
        </p>
        <p>
         An approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of abnormal movements and behaviors during sleep is presented here. Additional topics on the diagnosis and treatment of specific parasomnias, sleep-related movement disorders, and other paroxysmal neurological events in both children and adults can be found elsewhere.

         Although classification and nomenclature of sleep-related movements and behaviors have varied over time, most schema attempt to classify behaviors according to the type of movement (ie, simple or complex) and the underlying sleep physiology, ie, whether movements are associated with transitions of sleep and wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM), or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103094" href="/z/d/graphic/103094.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Most simple movements occur during the transition from wake to sleep or sleep to wake or during light, NREM sleep (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104210" href="/z/d/graphic/104210.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Complex behaviors can result from disruption of the control mechanisms of the three normal states of being: wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
         Occasionally, simple or complex motor patterns during sleep are a manifestation of seizures, dissociative psychiatric events, or even physiological states such as hypoglycemia. Therefore, clinicians should be aware that nocturnal events may be a manifestation of specific neurologic, medical, psychiatric, or sleep disorders. On the other hand, some of these behaviors, specifically the disorders of arousal and nightmares, may be normal in childhood.

         Simple movements during sleep are typically quick, single movements involving only one body area (

          figure 1

          Hypnic jerks
         </strong>
         – Hypnic jerks are a common example of simple sleep-related movements. They consist of a sudden, brief jerk of the whole body or one or more segments at sleep onset, often associated with the sense of falling. Hypnic jerks can occur at any age and are a benign phenomenon, sometimes related to sleep deprivation or excessive caffeine or other stimulant intake.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Some hypnic jerks are accompanied by sensory phenomena, most commonly a kinetic sensation of falling but sometimes a brief visual, auditory, or tactile sensation. These sensory starts or sleep-related hallucinations can also occur without a motor accompaniment. Such symptoms can be distressing to patients and may lead to sleep avoidance or delayed sleep onset.

          Exploding head syndrome
         </strong>
         – A more dramatic, multisensory phenomenon that also occurs at sleep onset is called exploding head syndrome, consisting of a painless sensation of head explosion [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-9
         </a>
         ]. The ICSD-3-TR classifies this event under "other parasomnias," but due to its clinical features, it is sometimes confused with a headache syndrome or even subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is typically no actual movement associated with this phenomenon, but in one case series, two-thirds of individuals noted muscle jerks or twitches, and over 80 percent noted tachycardia or sense of fear [

          Propriospinal myoclonus
         </strong>
         – Propriospinal myoclonus at sleep onset consists of flexion or extension jerks in the abdomen, trunk and/or neck during relaxed wakefulness and drowsiness, as an individual attempts to fall asleep. Propriospinal myoclonus that persists throughout the day has been linked to spinal cord pathology in a minority of patients; however, there is no evidence that propriospinal myoclonus that is limited to sleep onset is associated with structural nervous system damage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is usually normal, but approximately one fifth of patients may show focal lesions of unclear significance [

          Epileptic myoclonus

         – Sudden jerks of the limbs that occur with waking or soon after waking in children or adolescents may represent epileptic myoclonic jerks, a type of seizure that is common in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). These patients usually have other types of generalized seizures as well; with careful history taking, nearly all patients with JME have myoclonic seizures, but almost never in isolation. (See

          of infancy
         </strong>
         – Benign sleep myoclonus of infancy, also called benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, refers to brief jerks of the limbs during NREM sleep in young infants. The jerks are usually bilateral and symmetric. They typically occur during the first few weeks of life and resolve by two to three months of age. The movements are benign but can be confused with seizures. However, unlike the jerks of myoclonic seizures or severe myoclonic epilepsy syndromes of infancy, benign myoclonus occurs exclusively during sleep, does not continue when the infant is awoken, and is associated with normal neurologic development.

          Bruxism

         – Bruxism (teeth grinding) consists of quick jerks or grinding movements involving the muscles of mastication. Bruxism typically occurs at sleep onset or in association with arousals from sleep and may recur multiple times per night. Primary consequences include abnormal tooth wear, transient morning jaw muscle pain or fatigue, and morning headaches. (See

          Nocturnal leg cramps

         – Nocturnal leg cramps are painful, sustained muscle contractions, most commonly in the calf, foot, or thigh, that may occur at any time during the night. They typically last from seconds to minutes and are relieved by forceful stretching of the affected muscles. The main differentiating feature compared with other sleep-related leg movements is the presence of sustained muscle contraction. (See

          Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder
         </strong>
         – Rhythmic movements involving large muscle groups at sleep onset (eg, body rocking and rolling, head rocking and rolling) may occur in early childhood as the child is trying to fall asleep. In most cases, the movements are not associated with significant clinical consequences and are considered developmentally normal.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When the movements or behaviors significantly interfere with normal sleep or daytime function, or result in self-harm or injury, they are classified as a sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder [

         – Hypnagogic foot tremor is a rapid, rhythmic movement of one foot that occurs at the onset of sleep or during light NREM sleep. It is believed to be a physiologic phenomenon; in one series of 375 consecutive adults undergoing polysomnography for other reasons, hypnagogic foot tremor was noted in 8 percent of patients and was not associated with disrupted sleep [

          Periodic limb movements of sleep
         </strong>
         – Periodic limb movements of sleep are episodes of repetitive and highly stereotyped limb movements occurring every 5 to 90 seconds, primarily during the first half of the night and during NREM sleep. Most people who have periodic limb movements do not have any symptoms associated with them. They occur with increased frequency in older adults with and without other sleep or neurologic disorders. In particular, most patients with RLS have evidence of these movements in sleep. (See

          Disorders of arousal
         </strong>
         – Sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and sleep terrors are a mixture of NREM sleep and wake states, such that the features of the two states are combined [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. These disorders represent a continuum of behaviors evoked from deep NREM sleep, possibly related to compromised ability to inhibit or fully permit arousal from sleep [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. All three are characterized by minimal cognitive functioning, amnesia for the events, and features of appearing awake, such as eyes open. Some patients report a memory of vague, visual imagery and auditory impressions.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Events are often triggered by stimuli, occur after acute sleep deprivation or psychosocial stressors, and involve a variety of nonstereotyped behaviors. Sleep-disordered breathing events such as an apnea or other sleep disorders may also serve as a trigger. Disorders of arousal occur most commonly in children and adolescents. (See

          (SRED)
         </strong>
         – SRED is similar to other disorders of arousal and occurs due to a mixture of wake and NREM sleep. SRED is characterized by episodes of recurrent involuntary and amnestic eating during the sleep period. Patients often consume peculiar forms of food (eg, raw hamburger, cake mix) with partial or no memory of the event. In many cases, SRED may be related to treatment with a hypnotic agent or a comorbid sleep disorder such as RLS. (See

         Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis is characterized by the intrusion and persistence of REM sleep-related atonia into wakefulness [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,15
         </a>
         ]. Patients with sleep paralysis experience partial or complete inability to move or call out, and many will have a dramatic sense of impending doom or urgency to flee. Individuals may remember these events for years. Some events are accompanied by hallucinations, often visual or a sense of a presence in the room.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although sleep paralysis can occur as part of the classic narcolepsy tetrad, in most cases, sleep paralysis is an isolated symptom and is related to sleep deprivation. Approximately 7 to 15 percent of adults report having had one or more episodes of sleep paralysis [

          Nightmare disorder
         </strong>
         – Complex visual imagery during REM sleep is the hallmark of nightmare disorder. Nightmares are distressing dreams that have an emotional carryover into wakefulness. While nightmares usually do not have a motor component, they may end abruptly with the patient screaming or, less frequently, experiencing a sudden jerk or brief movement [

          REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)
         </strong>
         – RBD is characterized by complex movements or behaviors during REM sleep ("dream-enactment behavior") that occur due to a pathologic loss of muscle paralysis (atonia) that normally occurs during REM sleep (associated with REM sleep without atonia [RSWA] on polysomnography). The movements often correspond to a dream in which the individual is being attacked or needs to defend him/herself [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21
         </a>
         ]. Movements range from relatively brief limb or chin movements to more complex, violent movements such as punching, leaping out of bed, or yelling. Associated vocalization is common, and language may be laden with expletives. (See

         Vocalization during sleep is a common nocturnal event. Vocalization can be simple or more complex and can be associated with a variety of sleep-related movements and behaviors, both physiologic and pathologic.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most vocalizations are utterances or short phrases, such as those seen in the normal variant of sleep talking. Talking can also be a feature of the disorders of arousals (sleepwalking, sleep terror, or confusional arousals) or RBD. The key distinction between physiologic sleep talking and disorders of arousal or REM sleep is the inclusion of other motor behaviors.

         Monotonous expiratory groaning during sleep may indicate a sleep-related breathing disorder called catathrenia. Catathrenia is characterized by prolonged expirations, primarily during REM sleep, that can be very distressing to the bed partner and caregivers [

         The differential diagnosis of abnormal movements or behaviors during sleep includes nocturnal seizures. While a generalized tonic clonic seizure out of sleep is usually obvious by history and not easy to confuse with a sleep disorder (bilateral tonic clonic movements, often with tongue biting and/or urinary incontinence, postictal drowsiness and confusion), some patients have focal seizures involving stereotyped, complex behaviors that occur predominantly or exclusively at night.
        </p>
        <p>
         Behaviors associated with epileptic seizures can range across a wide spectrum and they can be difficult to distinguish from parasomnias. The main clue that events are seizures rather than parasomnias is the stereotyped nature of seizures [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26
         </a>
         ]. Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, previously called nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, is one example of an epilepsy syndrome involving predominantly nocturnal seizures with complex behaviors [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Onset of seizures is typically in late childhood or adolescence but can occur in adulthood. These events can be very complex and appear volitional or bizarre, and patients may have more than one type of event, each with stereotypic behavior. Electroencephalography (EEG) is often normal during wakefulness. (See

         Eye witness descriptions are of fundamental importance to the diagnosis. Patients presenting for an evaluation of nocturnal events should be encouraged to bring an observer of the events with them, or the observer should be available for a conference call during the visit.
        </p>
        <p>
         An event description should be obtained from a bed partner when possible, as many nocturnal events cannot be recalled by the individual. The witness should be asked to describe or even act out the behaviors that occur during the events to help identify important features such as eyes being open or closed, posturing of one hand, specific facial posture, or stereotypic behavior. Patients and witnesses also should be asked if the events have caused injury or near-harm to self or others.

         Variable versus stereotyped behaviors – Events that have the same behavior each time (stereotypic and monomorphic), especially at the start of the events, are more likely to be seizures, with some exceptions (eg, rhythmic movement disorder, periodic limb movements). Events that vary in behavior (polymorphic) from one event to the next are less likely to be seizures.

         Memory recall – Most patients with RBD have reasonable dream recall that is congruent with the semiology of the behaviors performed. Patients with disorders of arousal have either partial recall or no recall of the events. Patients with seizures may have recall if the events are brief, the patient awakens, and the seizure does not involve both hippocampi; once both hippocampi are involved, however, the patient may not have complete memory for the event.

         Neuroimaging is not necessary in the majority of patients presenting with abnormal movements or behaviors during sleep. One exception may be when the nocturnal behavior was temporally related to a neurologic event (eg, stroke or multiple sclerosis exacerbation).

         A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the brain and referral to neurology is indicated in patients diagnosed with nocturnal seizures as part of a broader evaluation to determine the underlying etiology. When the diagnosis of seizure is in doubt, sleep-deprived EEG and ambulatory or inpatient video EEG monitoring may be useful. (See

         Neuroimaging should also be considered when the onset of a parasomnia is associated with abnormal neurologic signs or symptoms, as rare cases of secondary RBD or narcolepsy related to pathologic processes in the diencephalon or rostral pons have been described. (See

         As RBD may be a prodromal symptom of neurodegeneration, patients with events consistent with the disorder should undergo a careful neurologic examination and may require additional studies depending upon the clinical context (eg, structural and/or metabolic neuroimaging, neuropsychological testing, formal neurology consultation).

         Simple sleep-related movements such as hypnic starts and infrequently occurring disorders of arousal (eg, sleepwalking, confusional arousals, sleep terrors) rarely need to be treated. Patients should be educated about triggers for events, including sleep deprivation, and counseled about ensuring a safe sleep environment. Medications that may be implicated in the behaviors (eg, serotonergic antidepressants for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), short-acting hypnotics for complex sleep-related behaviors) should be discontinued if possible. RBD tends to be very responsive to either melatonin or

         For most parasomnias and abnormal movements, however, patients will continue to have minor occurrences, despite medication or behavioral modification. The overarching goal of therapy is to keep the patient and others safe from current and future harm. If there are minor residual movements that do not impact safety, patients should be reassured and clinicians should resist the urge to over-treat.
        </p>

         Treatment of patients with ongoing, frequent abnormal nocturnal movements or behaviors can be challenging. Clinicians may find themselves baffled as to how to proceed or what metric to use to determine success. One simple tool is the event diary. Patients or caregivers can keep a log of the events, including the timing of the event during the night, duration, and substances used. In this way, potential provocative factors can be examined for possible linkage. The patient or bed partner can be asked to grade the severity of the event, noting if the patient was at risk for harm, or if the event was disruptive to the bed partner or caregiver. This simple mechanism connects the patient as an active participant in the process of guiding therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients do not respond to therapy. For these patients, the event calendar may also provide further clues leading to an alternative diagnosis or underlying treatable sleep disorder. The history described above should be repeated in order to identify additional clues (see

          Timing in relation to sleep
         </strong>
         – Abnormal movements and behaviors during sleep are part of a larger group of nocturnal events that may occur during wakefulness, the transition into or out of sleep, or during sleep itself. Most sleep-related movement disorders and parasomnias have a relationship with a particular sleep stage or transition period in the sleep-wake cycle (

          Classification of events
         </strong>
         – Events can be initially characterized into brief or simple events versus events that contain more complex behaviors such as talking, multipart movements, and emotional expression (

         Complex events typically require further investigation to determine the underlying etiology and possible link to other sleep, medical, neurologic, or psychiatric disorders (

         <strong>
          History
         </strong>
         – A clear description of the events is key to the evaluation of all abnormal movements and behaviors during sleep. The history should include a detailed description of the witnessed movements or behaviors, timing during the night (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104210" href="/z/d/graphic/104210.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Bed partners and patients may also note certain provocative factors such as sleep deprivation, alcohol, medications, or stimuli associated with the events. Other key characteristics include age of onset, family history for similar events, and symptoms of other neurologic, medical, psychiatric, or sleep disorders. (See

          Indications for polysomnography
         </strong>
         – Video polysomnography with extended electroencephalography (EEG) is useful when the history is atypical, when there are symptoms suggestive of an underlying sleep or neurologic disorder, or the patient or bed partner is at risk for injury (
