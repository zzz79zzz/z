Cough as a symptom is sometimes trivialized by health professionals but is often distressing to a child's family or caregivers, irrespective of whether the cough is acute [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] or chronic [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Careful assessment of children with chronic cough is important to identify any underlying disease. The approach outlined in this topic review is designed for use in all patients up to 18 years of age. However, for adolescents 15 years and older, it is reasonable to use adult guidelines and algorithms since the etiologies of chronic cough in adolescents are fairly similar to those in adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1460.html" rel="external">"Causes and epidemiology of subacute and chronic cough in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1428.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and treatment of subacute and chronic cough in adults"</a>.)</p><p>An approach to the diagnosis and management of chronic cough in children is presented here, preceded by a brief overview of the epidemiology, physiology, and pathophysiology. Approaches to wheezing and stridor in children are presented separately, although these symptoms may present concurrently. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5752.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of wheezing in infants and children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6380.html" rel="external">"Assessment of stridor in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H937094814"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H651262326"><span class="h2">Chronic cough</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic cough in children 14 years and younger usually is defined as a daily cough lasting four or more weeks [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. This definition is based upon expert consensus, as expressed in guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians and Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] and the European Respiratory Society [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The rationale is that most acute respiratory infections in children resolve within this interval and that the presence of chronic cough impairs quality of life [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] and may represent sinister underlying etiologies [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The four-week threshold was selected to permit relatively early diagnosis of serious underlying illness such as missed foreign body [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] and bronchiectasis [<a href="#rid10">10</a>] to prevent future respiratory morbidity. However, these guidelines also envision watchful waiting for certain patients with chronic cough when specific symptoms and/or signs (specific cough pointers) are absent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>In contrast, the British Thoracic Society utilizes a threshold of eight weeks duration [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], which is the threshold used to define chronic cough in adults [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, the guideline also encourages individualized management by including the caveat that a "relentlessly progressive prolonged acute cough [&gt;three weeks]…may warrant investigation before eight weeks" [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H260106217"><span class="h2">Specific cough</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Specific cough refers to a chronic cough that is ultimately attributable to an underlying physiologic cause (which is usually but not always of pulmonary origin). The most important causes of specific cough in children are outlined in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206" href="/z/d/graphic/113206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In most cases, an initial work-up consisting of a focused history, physical examination, chest radiography, and spirometry will identify features that serve as clues to the underlying disease (sometimes termed "specific cough pointers") (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208" href="/z/d/graphic/113208.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). These include classically recognized cough sounds and characteristics, such as whooping, honking, or absence of cough during sleep, which point to a specific cause (these are sometimes termed "classical" cough characteristics) (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113265" href="/z/d/graphic/113265.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3730936623"><span class="h2">Nonspecific cough</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conversely, a "nonspecific" cough is defined as a chronic cough that does <strong>not</strong> have an identifiable cause after a reasonable evaluation. A chronic cough is more likely to be nonspecific if it is dry and there are no abnormalities identified on initial evaluation (ie, no "specific cough pointers" and likely to resolve without medications (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208" href="/z/d/graphic/113208.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1562359855"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are many causes of cough. The majority originate in the lungs, but there are also nonpulmonary etiologies, some proven and others controversial. The causes are presented in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206" href="/z/d/graphic/113206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and further discussed in another topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6356.html" rel="external">"Causes of chronic cough in children"</a>.)</p><p>Etiologies of chronic cough in children are different from those of adults and, thus, clinicians should use pediatric-specific cough guidelines [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. As an example, gastroesophageal reflux and upper airway cough syndrome (formerly known as postnasal drip syndrome) are thought to be common causes of chronic cough in adults but are controversial as common causes of chronic cough in children [<a href="#rid5">5,13,14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2177378393"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H429169008"><span class="h2">Prevalence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The reported prevalence of chronic cough varies depending on many factors, including the definition of chronicity used in the studies, age of children, and how cough is determined. Epidemiology questionnaires on isolated chronic cough are generally poorly reproducible; reproducibility is generally better for chronic cough associated with other symptoms [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The reporting of cough severity depends upon the population characteristics [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. As an example, the accuracy of cough reporting by urban Australian parents is excellent compared with an objective measure [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. By contrast, the accuracy of parent-reported cough is worse if the parent smokes [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], is a member of an indigenous Australian population living in a remote area [<a href="#rid19">19</a>], or if the cough is nocturnal [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Because of the considerations outlined above, the accuracy and generalizability of prevalence studies are limited and it is often impossible to compare results across different studies. In one community-based study in which persistent cough was defined as &gt;3 weeks duration, the prevalence in children aged 5 to 11 years was approximately 10 percent [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The study found that reported persistent cough was higher in Australia than Nigeria [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], possibly reflecting a reporting bias. Another questionnaire-based study reported a prevalence of chronic cough of 22 percent among preschoolers without colds [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3065593694"><span class="h2">Burden</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The burden of chronic cough is substantial for children [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] and their parents or caregivers [<a href="#rid4">4,8</a>]. Their quality of life is impaired [<a href="#rid4">4,7</a>], and in affluent countries, parents often seek recurrent consultations until their child's cough resolves [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. An Australian multicenter study found that 75 percent of parents sought ≥5 doctor visits (14 percent sought ≥15 consultations) for their child's cough [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The study also reported that the children's mean generic pediatric health-related quality-of-life score (using the PedsQL tool) was in the realm of children with other chronic illness (eg, cardiac, diabetes) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Their quality of life significantly improved when the cough resolved [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. At a societal level, expenses for clinician visits, medication expenses, and absenteeism are substantial. Thus, it is not surprising that various prescription and nonprescription medications are reported to be widely used (sometimes inappropriately) [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>] in an attempt to ameliorate cough. The use of these medications may result in adverse events (eg, Cushing's disease and accidental poisoning) [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1209379139"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An intact cough mechanism (afferent and central limb) and apparatus (efferent limb) is essential to maintain respiratory health. Cough also enhances mucociliary clearance in both healthy individuals and those with lung disease [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1910492527"><span class="h2">Normal cough mechanisms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cough pathway, a complex reflex arc, can be simplified into the afferent, central, and efferent pathways (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113194" href="/z/d/graphic/113194.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid27">27-30</a>]. The cough pathway may be self-initiated (eg, voluntary cough) or a reflex mechanism. The central pathway involves the nucleus tractus solitarius, the brainstem respiratory network (sometimes known as the "cough center") [<a href="#rid31">31</a>], the subcortex, and cortex. The afferent arm (from cough stimulus to the central pathway) and efferent arms (from central pathway to respiratory muscles, larynx, and pelvic muscles) are likely to be influenced by a multidirectional feedback loop mediated through the cough center [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>Cough has three mechanical physiologic phases: inspiratory, compressive, and expiratory [<a href="#rid27">27,32</a>], although some include a preceding irritation phase. The duration of inspiratory, compressive, and expiratory phases and magnitude of the respiratory muscles are regulated by the brainstem network [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. This same network also regulates these respiratory muscles for breathing [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>The entire respiratory structure and system undergoes a maturation process from infancy to adulthood [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>]. The cough reflex is weak in premature infants and develops with maturity [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Whilst the laryngeal chemoreflex in young infants result in swallowing, apnea, and laryngeal closure, cough becomes increasingly prominent with maturation [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Exactly when the cough reflex is fully matured is unknown, but critical windows of exposure in utero and early childhood have long been appreciated [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. The immune system (which has its own developmental physiology) affects the degree and frequency of respiratory infections and hence presentations to doctors for cough. Other general physiology that influences the pathophysiology and management of chronic cough in children compared with adults includes differences in cognitive function and ability to self-express.</p><p>The differences between the pathophysiology of chronic cough in children compared with adults are exemplified in child-specific diagnoses such as protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB). Thus, it is not surprising that different strategies are required to evaluate and manage chronic cough in children compared with adults, manifested in different evidence-based guidelines [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1075018974"><span class="h2">Pathologic cough</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Upregulation of the cough reflex, resulting in increased cough</strong> – As the stimulus for cough is multimodal, a variety of stimuli or combination thereof can result in increased coughing. In children, the most common cause of cough is respiratory infections. The infections are associated with inflammatory mediators that stimulate the various nociceptors in the airway walls, thus activating the cough pathway. Studies in animal models suggest that the increased cough can be related to neuromodulation; some viruses likely induce plasticity in the cough neural pathways, sometimes causing the cough to persist after the infection is cleared [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. While the cough reflex cannot be stimulated from some areas like the nasal mucosa, diseases in the area may sensitize the cough reflex in animals and in adults [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Other possible mechanisms include enhancement of cough sensitivity through intrathoracic pressure effects, suggesting that cough may also perpetuate the chronic cough cycle through the intrathoracic pressure effects generated by cough [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The understanding of cough receptors and targeting it with therapeutic agents in adults with chronic cough is expanding [<a href="#rid38">38</a>], but there are no pediatric data.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Human neurocellular data describing mechanisms for increased coughing are scarce. The mechanisms underpinning chronic cough have been likened to that of chronic neuropathic pain [<a href="#rid40">40</a>], and increased neurogenic markers have been described in children with increased cough receptor sensitivity [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. In children, cough sensitivity is increased in conditions where chronic cough occurs and the sensitivity tends to normalize when cough resolves [<a href="#rid42">42-44</a>]. Thus, the concept of "cough hypersensitivity" as a diagnostic entity of chronic cough is not relevant in children and should be avoided. In contrast, this concept is likely beneficial in adults, where idiopathic cough is common and likely involves mechanisms similar to neuropathic pain, in which there are considerable differences between children and adults [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Similarly, the concept of "urge to cough" widely described in the adult literature is also not an issue in young children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Downregulation of the cough reflex, resulting in ineffectual cough</strong> – A variety of abnormalities that interfere with the cough reflex arc result in ineffectual cough (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113194" href="/z/d/graphic/113194.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). An abnormal afferent neural pathway, usually associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities, can result in decreased airway sensitivity and consequent silent aspiration [<a href="#rid46">46</a>], which can ultimately lead to chronic lung disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The efferent limb of the cough pathway may be impaired by:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Abnormalities in the airway (larynx or trachea), including tracheostomy or vocal cord palsy.

Our approach is outlined in two algorithms (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691" href="/z/d/graphic/113691.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139571" href="/z/d/graphic/139571.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>) and detailed in the following sections. This algorithm is similar to the guideline from the American College of Chest Physicians [<a href="#rid5">5,47</a>], which was shown to improve clinical outcomes in multicenter randomized trials [<a href="#rid48">48</a>] and is the best validated among several similar algorithmic approaches [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>]. Remaining uncertainties about this and other algorithms are whether testing or management should depend on the duration and/or severity of chronic cough [<a href="#rid47">47,49</a>] and the age at which adult guidelines should be used.</p><p>The approach outlined below is designed for use in all patients up to 18 years of age. However, it is also reasonable to use adult guidelines and algorithms for adolescents 15 years and older, consistent with the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, since the etiologies of chronic cough in adolescents are fairly similar to those in adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1460.html" rel="external">"Causes and epidemiology of subacute and chronic cough in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1428.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and treatment of subacute and chronic cough in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1999926302"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The systematic evaluation of a child with chronic cough starts with a targeted detailed history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and (if the child is able) spirometry [<a href="#rid47">47,49</a>]. The information obtained is then used to categorize the cough as specific (ie, underlying disease likely present) or nonspecific (no evidence of an underlying disease, so the cough is more likely to resolve spontaneously) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. However, this initial evaluation does not definitively distinguish specific cough from nonspecific cough, as depicted by area of overlap in the figure (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113195" href="/z/d/graphic/113195.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).

As examples, previous response to antihistamines suggests a component of rhinitis and postnasal drip, while a response to inhaled bronchodilators suggests possible asthma. However, the history of a prior response to medication needs to be interpreted with great caution since cough symptoms can spontaneously remit. Previous response to antibiotics and asthma therapies should be interpreted with special caution as the antibiotics may have been prescribed for a self-limited viral illness and the cough may have resolved spontaneously regardless of treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Any current medications also should be reviewed carefully; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are well-established causes of chronic cough.

Most cases of nonspecific cough are related to a viral illness (postviral cough) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]; the underlying physiology is thought to be due to increased sensitivity that gradually resolves over time (two to four weeks) [<a href="#rid40">40</a>] (see <a class="local">'Pathologic cough'</a> above). One study showed that most such children are very unlikely to have underlying disease (negative likelihood ratio 0, 95% CI 0.00-0.03) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. The child and family can be reassured and should be followed and reevaluated in two to four weeks if the chronic cough does not resolve or if new symptoms emerge.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medication trials</strong> – Some cases of nonspecific cough probably represent a cough-dominant asthma; this is more likely if the child has other signs of allergic disease or a family history of asthma. Therefore, if the cough is troublesome and if there is clinical evidence supporting asthma or if other specific causes have been excluded, it is reasonable to perform an empiric trial of bronchodilators (short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists) or low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (&lt;400 micrograms <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13096" href="/z/d/drug information/13096.html" rel="external">budesonide</a> equivalent daily). High doses of inhaled corticosteroids should be avoided. If empiric treatment is undertaken, the trial should be time-limited (two to four weeks) and the medication should not be given chronically unless the underlying diagnosis is firmly established.

Nonetheless, in selected children with nonspecific cough and other symptoms suggestive of GERD (such as recurrent regurgitation, dystonic neck posturing in infants, and heartburn in older children), it is reasonable to do an empiric trial of treatment for GERD for four weeks, using acid-suppressing medications such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Longer duration of PPIs should not be used without objective confirmation of GERD [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Similarly, a guideline for adults advises a trial of PPIs only in patients with heartburn or regurgitation symptoms [<a href="#rid68">68</a>], although in the past, PPIs were often used as empiric treatment for adults with chronic cough. In children with growth failure, GERD and eosinophilic esophagitis should also be considered as possible associated diseases [<a href="#rid69">69</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We do not use <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13178" href="/z/d/drug information/13178.html" rel="external">codeine</a> or other antitussive agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13220" href="/z/d/drug information/13220.html" rel="external">dextromethorphan</a>) for the treatment of cold-related cough in children [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. They have potential harms with no proven benefit.

However, ascribing etiologies for the cough based on treatment trials has an inherent high risk of bias related to the placebo and "period effects" (the natural resolution of cough over time, which is evident in cough-related intervention studies [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]). Thus, when the cough resolves, a trial of ceasing the medications should be undertaken. If the chronic cough relapses, the medication could be recommenced, typically with further investigation to confirm the provisional diagnosis of asthma or GERD.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If formally assessing response to therapy, child-specific assessment tools are required in children [<a href="#rid17">17,71</a>] as the adult assessment tools have limited applicability in children.

A number of studies have documented the frequent consultations for children with chronic cough, with three-quarters of families consulting a doctor more than five times [<a href="#rid4">4,8</a>]. In addition, several studies report reduced quality of life that normalizes as the cough resolves [<a href="#rid8">8,72</a>]. This significant burden and worry for parents/caregivers should be considered, and they should be counseled appropriately about the prognosis and expected course for their child, in particular the excellent prognosis and outcome for children with chronic nonspecific cough [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Among other issues, a worried parent/caregiver may administer nonspecific medications to the child, which may not be suitable due to lack of efficacy and safety concerns [<a href="#rid73">73,74</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cough suppressants</strong> – Over-the-counter cold and cough suppressants are <strong>not</strong> recommended for the treatment of chronic cough in children [<a href="#rid5">5,11</a>]. There is no evidence that they improve symptoms in this age group, and significant safety concerns have been raised about their use in young children [<a href="#rid73">73,74</a>]. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a public health advisory against the use of these drugs for young children [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. In addition, we recommend against the use of opioid drugs such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13178" href="/z/d/drug information/13178.html" rel="external">codeine</a> that may be effective in suppressing cough as evidence is limited, and these drugs are associated with serious side effects and the potential for abuse [<a href="#rid5">5,76,77</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Avoidance of tobacco smoke</strong> – There is evidence that environmental exposure to tobacco smoke increases respiratory infections and thus the risk for chronic cough in children [<a href="#rid5">5,78</a>]. Household members who smoke should be counseled to stop smoking and guided to support for smoking cessation. Until the adult is able to completely stop smoking, they should not smoke in the presence of children, including in a car, even with the window open. The clinician should also ask adolescent patients about the possibility of tobacco use and provide strong support for smoking cessation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6375.html" rel="external">"Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">"Overview of smoking cessation management in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alternative therapies</strong> – In the absence of specific treatments for the chronic symptom, many families will try alternative therapies, including honey and echinacea.

Most authorities suggest that this is not a common cause [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In children with neurologic abnormalities, GERD may be associated with aspiration (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6356.html" rel="external">"Causes of chronic cough in children", section on 'Aspiration'</a>). In selected children, esophageal monitoring may be undertaken to determine if the episodes of coughing are associated with reflux events, but results are often inconclusive.

Historical series in which sinusitis was diagnosed on the basis of response to antibiotics may have included cases of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), which would also respond to the same antibiotics recommended for chronic sinusitis, or patients who would have improved even without antibiotics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6356.html" rel="external">"Causes of chronic cough in children", section on 'Upper airway pathology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients with clinical features strongly suggestive of sinusitis (eg, mucopurulent drainage, chronic nasal obstruction, or facial pain or pressure), imaging of the sinuses and/or an empiric trial of treatment for sinusitis may be undertaken. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because there is poor correlation between sinus radiography or CT and clinical disease [<a href="#rid5">5,79</a>]. Imaging reveals some sinus abnormality in 20 to 80 percent of asymptomatic patients [<a href="#rid80">80</a>].

If a vascular abnormality is also suspected (eg, sling or ring), contrast may be indicated concurrently with the CT scan. As this involves radiation, seeking advice prior to undertaking a CT scan in a young child is advocated. MRI may be more appropriate in selected circumstances such as for concurrent cardiac and cardiac vessel evaluation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tests for tuberculosis</strong> – In settings where tuberculosis is endemic or has a high prevalence [<a href="#rid81">81</a>], particularly if the child is at high risk for exposure, standard tests for tuberculosis should be considered [<a href="#rid82">82</a>], including tuberculin skin testing or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). This may be relevant even in the absence of obvious signs and symptoms in the child because tuberculosis infection can be subtle. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8020.html" rel="external">"Tuberculosis infection (latent tuberculosis) in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8007.html" rel="external">"Tuberculosis disease in children: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Allergy testing</strong> – Tests for atopy include skin prick testing or radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease"</a>). However, this is usually not recommended in the assessment of children with chronic cough [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Presence of atopy does not increase cough sensitivity [<a href="#rid83">83</a>].
