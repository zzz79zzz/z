Affected patients present with single or multiple inflammatory and sclerotic plaques, findings considered manifestations of active disease. These plaques eventually resolve, leaving permanent dermal or soft tissue atrophy and pigmentary changes (skin damage). Disease activity typically persists for three to six years, although some patients develop more persistent periods of activity or recurring episodes of activity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13776.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults"</a>.)</p><p>There are multiple treatment options for active morphea; however, evidence in support of many of these therapies is limited. The majority of patients are managed with observation, topical medications, phototherapy, or systemic immunosuppressive therapy. The level of disease activity, depth of involvement, body surface area involved, and the presence of functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement determine the most appropriate approach to treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef130272" href="/z/d/graphic/130272.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Systemic therapy is often warranted for patients with extensive, active morphea that is rapidly progressing or causing significant cosmetic disfigurement, joint contractures, or other functional impairment. Occupational and physical therapy are important interventions for patients who have or are at risk for disability. </p><p>The management of morphea in adults will be reviewed here. Pediatric morphea and the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea in adults are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6399.html" rel="external">"Juvenile localized scleroderma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13776.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1934782167"><span class="h1">GOALS OF TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The definition of successful treatment of morphea is not the return to completely normal skin, although this may occur in very early, inflammatory lesions. Therapeutic success for active lesions is defined first by improvement or resolution of erythema and later by softening of sclerotic lesions or hair regrowth on affected skin. Successful treatment of spreading disease inhibits lesion expansion and new lesion formation. Additional treatment goals for active and inactive disease include improvement of associated functional impairment and disfigurement. (See <a class="local">'Active disease'</a> below and <a class="local">'Inactive disease'</a> below and <a class="local">'Functional impairment'</a> below and <a class="local">'Disfigurement'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3086098544"><span class="h1">SELECTION OF THERAPEUTIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evolving and often self-limited course of morphea and the varied clinical presentations warrant individualized approaches to treatment. The level of disease activity (active versus inactive), depth of tissue involvement (dermal versus deep morphea), body surface area involved (few lesions versus widely distributed lesions), and the presence or potential for functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement determine the most appropriate approach to treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1933315836"><span class="h2">Disease activity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment to alter the course of morphea is considered most effective for patients with active disease. Active lesions can occur both in recent-onset morphea and long-standing morphea [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, inactive disease is unlikely to respond to the immunomodulatory and ultraviolet light therapies utilized for this purpose. Interventions for inactive morphea are primarily focused on improvement of functional impairment and disfigurement. (See <a class="local">'Inactive disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Disease activity can be identified through the physical examination. Findings consistent with active disease include inflammatory, erythematous patches or edematous plaques that progressively develop sclerotic features. Other indicators of active disease include peripheral induration accompanied by erythema, lesion expansion, and the formation of new lesions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13776.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Lesion evolution'</a>.)</p><p>Serial clinical photographs are helpful for identifying progressing disease [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The Localized Scleroderma Assessment Tool (LoSCAT), a scoring method that assesses skin thickness, inflammation, lesion extension, and damage, has also been used for this purpose but has limitations and is primarily employed in clinical studies [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of response'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6399.html" rel="external">"Juvenile localized scleroderma", section on 'Evaluation of progression or response to therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Inactive disease characteristically presents as sclerotic plaques with a hyperpigmented border that eventually become hypopigmented or hyperpigmented, atrophic plaques. Telangiectasia may also be present. Atrophy of morphea plaques may demonstrate finely wrinkled skin or shallow "cliff drop-like" depressions. Atrophy of deep morphea may present as deep indentations with loss of soft tissue or muscle and, sometimes, bony changes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13776.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Lesion evolution'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3271956344"><span class="h2">Depth of involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with active deep morphea, morphea that involves subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle, require a more aggressive approach to treatment than patients with involvement limited to the dermis, as deep morphea often leads to functional impairment. Systemic immunosuppressive therapy is often needed for these patients. (See <a class="local">'Deep morphea'</a> below and <a class="local">'Functional impairment'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical findings supportive of deep tissue involvement include poorly circumscribed, indurated, and tethered plaques and linear depressions (groove sign). Functional impairment and pain may also suggest deep involvement. Imaging studies can be used to confirm deep involvement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13776.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Deep morphea'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13776.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3520494207"><span class="h2">Extent of skin involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Topical or intralesional therapy may be sufficient for the management of disease involving a relatively small proportion of the body surface area. In contrast, these interventions are often impractical and insufficiently effective for more extensive morphea, such as generalized morphea. Phototherapy or systemic therapy is typically necessary for extensive disease. (See <a class="local">'Extensive dermal plaques'</a> below and <a class="local">'Deep morphea'</a> below.)</p><p>Given the often asymptomatic and self-limited nature of morphea, forgoing therapy is a reasonable alternative for patients with morphea that involves a relatively small area of skin, particularly when deep involvement is absent, risk for functional impairment appears minimal, and lesions are not located in cosmetically sensitive areas. Close clinical follow-up for progressing disease is still necessary for these patients. (See <a class="local">'Decision to treat'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2993971874"><span class="h2">Risk for functional impairment and disfigurement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Morphea causing functional impairment (eg, contractures, reduced range of motion) or significant disfigurement or that exhibits features that suggest impending risk for these events (eg, facial involvement, tethered or deeply sclerotic lesions that overly joints) may require treatment with systemic immunosuppressive drugs. Involvement of a multidisciplinary team is also often indicated to maximize function and minimize risk for further disability. Moreover, patients with lesions in locations that are at risk for disabling contractures should be referred to physical and occupational therapy <strong>before</strong> movement deficits appear. (See <a class="local">'Functional impairment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3923053715"><span class="h1">ACTIVE DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Persistent disease activity may result in lesion expansion, involvement of new sites, increasing functional impairment, or worsening disfigurement. Thus, treatment of active morphea is often initiated in an attempt to minimize the development of these features; however, not all patients require treatment. (See <a class="local">'Goals of treatment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Decision to treat'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4104427084"><span class="h2">Decision to treat</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because disease activity in morphea often spontaneously ceases within several years, the decision to treat is based upon consideration of a variety of factors, such as the potential for functional impairment and disfigurement, the need for relief from associated symptoms (eg, pain, pruritus), and patient preference. In general, we initiate treatment in all patients who have functional impairment or appear to be at risk for functional impairment or significant disfigurement, as these features may worsen with continued disease progression and can persist following the resolution of disease activity. This typically includes patients with generalized morphea, deep morphea, or linear morphea. (See <a class="local">'Risk for functional impairment and disfigurement'</a> above.)</p><p>Deferring treatment is considered of lesser consequence for patients with milder presentations of morphea, such as limited skin involvement that spares deep tissues. This often includes patients with circumscribed morphea, the most common subtype of morphea. Although our experience is that many of these patients elect to try at least topical or intralesional therapy, deferring treatment is a reasonable alternative. Patients who do not initiate treatment still require close clinical follow-up to facilitate early detection of disease progression that may benefit from treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13776.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Subtypes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1117710689"><span class="h2">Treatment groups</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In our experience, an algorithmic approach to active morphea that is based upon disease extent, disease depth, and risk for complications is more helpful than outlining approaches based upon the clinical subtype. (See <a class="local">'Selection of therapeutic approach'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13776.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Subtypes'</a>.)</p><p>We utilize the following categories to outline suggested approaches to treatment:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Single or few dermal plaques</strong> – Single or few morphea plaques involving a limited area of skin that spare deeper tissues, such as subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle. This category typically includes patients with circumscribed morphea. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13776.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Circumscribed (plaque) morphea'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Extensive dermal morphea</strong> – Morphea involving more than a limited area of skin (multiple lesions involving more than one body site or large plaques) that spares deeper tissues, such as subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13776.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Generalized morphea'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited deep morphea</strong> – Morphea involving a limited area that includes involvement of deep tissues, including subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle.

The physical examination is the primary method of assessing the response.</p><p>There is a lack of consensus on the definition of an optimal response to treatment. We consider the resolution of clinical signs of disease activity (resolution of erythema and edema plus cessation of both new lesion formation and lesion expansion) achievement of an optimal response. Improvement of sclerosis is not mandatory. In our experience, improvement of sclerosis and progression to the atrophic stage of morphea occurs gradually over time following successful resolution of signs of disease activity [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Adjunctive response assessment measures include scoring tools (eg, the Localized Scleroderma Cutaneous Assessment Tool [LoSCAT]) and radiologic imaging. The LoSCAT, a scoring system based upon the physical findings, is primarily used in clinical studies and is composed of an activity index, a damage index, and the physician's global assessment of disease activity and damage [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Calculation of the indexes involves division of the body surface area into 18 anatomic sites and application of a score between 0 and 3 for various features related to disease activity and skin damage. In a prospective study of 120 adults and children with morphea, the LoSCAT appeared effective for identifying clinically significant improvements in disease activity [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6399.html" rel="external">"Juvenile localized scleroderma", section on 'Evaluation of progression or response to therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The role of radiologic imaging in assessment of treatment response is unclear. Data from an uncontrolled study of 22 adults with morphea involving deep tissues suggest that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The study found reductions in mean MRI scores for subcutaneous septal thickening, fascial thickening, and fascial enhancement after treatment among patients who met clinical criteria for a response to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9808" href="/z/d/drug information/9808.html" rel="external">prednisolone</a> therapy. Other radiologic techniques have also been utilized. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6399.html" rel="external">"Juvenile localized scleroderma", section on 'Evaluation of progression or response to therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1000315603"><span class="h2">Cessation of treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An individualized approach is typically taken to determine the appropriate therapeutic course following the resolution of signs of disease activity. Treatments may be stopped abruptly or continued or tapered for a period of time. </p><p>Factors such as the treatment type, the duration of treatment already received, and disease severity influence our approach to treatment cessation. Suggested approaches for specific treatments are reviewed below. Close clinical follow-up is advised for all patients because of the potential for recurrence of disease activity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3291232977"><span class="h2">Single or few dermal plaques</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with limited dermal morphea who desire treatment usually can be managed with topical therapy, intralesional therapy, or phototherapy. We favor phototherapy for patients with unstable, spreading lesions. Systemic immunosuppressive drugs are usually reserved for select patients with refractory disease and functionally limiting or disfiguring presentations. (See <a class="local">'Spreading or topical therapy-resistant lesions'</a> below and <a class="local">'Refractory disease'</a> below and <a class="local">'Functional impairment'</a> below and <a class="local">'Disfigurement'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2555953067"><span class="h3">Stable lesions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Topical corticosteroids, topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9971" href="/z/d/drug information/9971.html" rel="external">tacrolimus</a>, topical vitamin D analogs, and intralesional injection of corticosteroids are often used as first-line therapies for patients with limited, stable dermal morphea who proceed with treatment due to the relative safety of these interventions [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Data to support these therapies are limited, and the relative efficacy of these therapies is unclear. We primarily utilize topical corticosteroids.</p><p>One of the challenges of topical therapy for morphea is achieving sufficient penetration of medication to the site of inflammation. In our experience, lesions that exhibit associated epidermal changes, such as lichen sclerosus-like features overlying indurated plaques, seem to respond best to topical therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82529" href="/z/d/graphic/82529.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Intralesional corticosteroid therapy allows for delivery of corticosteroids directly into the dermis; however, use is limited to relatively small lesions because of the need to administer injections throughout lesions.</p><p>Patients presenting with lesions associated with worsening functional impairment or worsening disfigurement may benefit from a more aggressive approach to treatment. (See <a class="local">'Functional impairment'</a> below and <a class="local">'Disfigurement'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20781884"><span class="h4">Topical and intralesional corticosteroids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Topical and intralesional corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects that may be beneficial in morphea (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5565.html" rel="external">"Topical corticosteroids: Use and adverse effects", section on 'Mechanism of action'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Administration</strong> – High-potency topical corticosteroids (groups 1 or 2  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402" href="/z/d/graphic/62402.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)) are typically applied to affected skin once or twice daily. Use of an occlusive dressing over the site of application may help to augment benefit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Signs of response are expected within 12 weeks. In our experience, if there is no response within this period, benefit is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of response'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Upon resolution of clinical signs of disease activity, we attempt to taper the frequency of corticosteroid application as well as the potency of the topical corticosteroid, as tolerated. If signs of disease activity recur during tapering, we return to daily application of the high-potency topical corticosteroid until disease activity ceases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Intralesional corticosteroid injections involve periodic injection of a corticosteroid (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10015" href="/z/d/drug information/10015.html" rel="external">triamcinolone</a> acetonide 5 to 10 mg/mL) directly into the dermis in affected areas. Injections of approximately 0.1 mL are placed approximately 1 cm apart within lesions. Our experience suggests that injections into the periphery of active lesions may be particularly helpful for reducing clinical signs of inflammation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The status of disease should be closely monitored.

Immunomodulatory effects and stimulatory effects on collagen breakdown may contribute to benefit of phototherapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Selection of regimen</strong> – Phototherapy options for morphea include devices that emit UVA or UVB light. UVA1 (340 to 400 nm), narrowband UVB (311 to 313 nm), and broadband UVA (320 to 400 nm) are the primary forms of phototherapy used. Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) phototherapy, which involves the administration of photosensitizing psoralens prior to exposure to UVA, has fallen out of favor because of the added complexity of psoralen administration and a less favorable side effect profile.

UVA1 is a newer form of UVA phototherapy that eliminates the shorter, less deeply penetrating wavelengths in broadband UVA light. This results in a lower risk of sunburn compared with broadband UVA. A disadvantage of UVA1 phototherapy is relatively long treatment times compared with shorter times required to administer other forms of phototherapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91676.html" rel="external">"UVA1 phototherapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When UVA1 is unavailable, we opt for narrowband UVB or broadband UVA phototherapy.

In addition, these patients should receive consultations, as appropriate, with physical therapy, occupational therapy, physical medicine and rehabilitation, rheumatology, plastic surgery, orthopedics, or oral and maxillofacial surgery. The goal of treatment is to maximize function and minimize further damage. (See <a class="local">'Systemic immunosuppressants'</a> above.)</p><p>Surgical intervention is sometimes necessary for persistent, disabling contractures. However, there may be risk for stimulating exacerbation of morphea; the occurrence of new-onset or worsening morphea in sites of surgical incisions or radiation therapy has been reported [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. </p><p>Thus, surgical procedures should be undertaken with caution and should be limited to patients with inactive (atrophic stage) disease when possible. Occasionally, surgical intervention for functional impairment is necessary in the setting of active disease due to a substantial negative impact on quality of life. In these cases, we optimize medical treatment to limit activity prior to and after surgery. We also follow patients carefully for signs of worsening disease activity following surgery. </p><p>Monitoring for recurrence of inflammation and associated volume loss is difficult after surgical correction.
