Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are not used as a single agent for those with intact ovarian function, though they may be combined effectively with ovarian function suppression (OFS) or ablation for appropriate candidates. Here we will discuss the choice of endocrine therapy for premenopausal women, for whom to use OFS or ablation, as well as selection of appropriate antiestrogen therapy.</p><p>The general approach to adjuvant endocrine therapy, including for postmenopausal women, is discussed elsewhere, as is the decision regarding whether to use chemotherapy (regardless of menopausal status). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'Special populations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer", section on 'Patient eligibility'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126631.html" rel="external">"Deciding when to use adjuvant chemotherapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H499622981"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF MENOPAUSE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because the endocrine options for treatment depend on whether or not a woman is in menopause, defining menopausal status is important. We agree with the definition of menopause used by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer", section on 'Definition of menopause'</a>.)</p><p>All women who do not meet the definition of menopause should be treated as premenopausal patients.

As such, for those at higher risk for recurrence, we suggest OFS with an AI (or OFS with tamoxifen, as an alternative), given that this subset of patients has the highest likelihood of experiencing benefit. This recommendation is based on the results of the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT) and the Tamoxifen and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8920" href="/z/d/drug information/8920.html" rel="external">Exemestane</a> Trial (TEXT), both of which are discussed below.</p><p>While formal criteria to define higher risk are not present, a reasonable definition would include patients with <strong>either </strong>of the following attributes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients in whom chemotherapy is indicated</strong> – Such as patients with the presence of pathologically involved lymph nodes, large tumor size, high risk of recurrence based on a genomic assay, or other high-risk features for which the patient received chemotherapy (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef126073" href="/z/d/graphic/126073.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

(See <a class="local">'Transitioning from tamoxifen to an AI after menopause'</a> below.)</p><p>Women who tolerate OFS without difficulty, plan to receive ongoing OFS, and are not interested in further childbearing or recovery of ovarian function in the future may consider surgical oophorectomy as an appropriate alternative to ongoing gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H723799739"><span class="h2">Ovarian suppression plus endocrine therapy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2814905966"><span class="h3">Methods of suppression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ovarian function can be suppressed with a GnRHa or by permanent methods, such as oophorectomy or, rarely, irradiation. Any of these strategies is appropriate, depending on patient preferences, although we often start with a GnRHa and proceed to oophorectomy if OFS is tolerated.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appropriate GnRHas include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8500" href="/z/d/drug information/8500.html" rel="external">goserelin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9549" href="/z/d/drug information/9549.html" rel="external">leuprolide</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10018" href="/z/d/drug information/10018.html" rel="external">triptorelin</a>.

In the SOFT trial, among 233 women younger than 35 years, the rate of freedom from breast cancer at five years was lower for patients treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> alone (68 percent) compared with those assigned to tamoxifen plus OFS and those assigned to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8920" href="/z/d/drug information/8920.html" rel="external">exemestane</a> plus OFS (79 and 83 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

There were no statistically significant differences in OS between the two groups (96.5 versus 95.3 percent respectively; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.49-1.25) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The length of OFS in this trial, two years, was shorter than in SOFT/TEXT, in which it was administered for five years.

Among patients with HER2-negative tumors (86 percent), exemestane plus OFS improved 12-year OS compared with tamoxifen plus OFS by 2 percent (91 versus 89 percent, HR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.04), with a 3.3 percent absolute benefit among those who received chemotherapy [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In subset analyses, which did not achieve statistical significance, the magnitude of benefit was greatest in high-risk patients (eg, women aged &lt;35 years [4.0 percent] and those with &gt;2 cm [4.5 percent] or grade 3 tumors [5.5 percent]).</p><p>Similar findings were described in a meta-analysis by the EBCTCG that included the ABCSG-12 and HOBOE trials in addition to SOFT and TEXT [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Among over 7000 patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer receiving adjuvant OFS, 40 percent of whom were node positive, 10-year recurrence rates were 18 percent with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> and 15 percent with an AI (relative risk [RR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.90). These benefits were primarily observed in years 0 through 4, when treatments differed, but were not observed in years 5 and beyond. Distant recurrences were also improved with AI administration (absolute improvement at 10 years of 1.9 percent; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.97), although breast cancer mortality rates were similar (RR 1.01).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2580928607"><span class="h3">Toxicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Side effects related to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> and AIs, and their management, are discussed elsewhere.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126631.html" rel="external">"Deciding when to use adjuvant chemotherapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, we also consider women at a younger age (ie, ≤35 years) to be at a higher risk of recurrence. (See <a class="local">'Identification of higher-risk patients and approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Higher-risk patients</strong> – For women with high-risk, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, we suggest incorporation of ovarian function suppression (OFS) plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a>, rather than tamoxifen alone (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). When using OFS, we suggest use of an AI rather than tamoxifen (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Incorporation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115098" href="/z/d/drug information/115098.html" rel="external">abemaciclib</a> is an appropriate option for select patients with high-risk, node-positive hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, irrespective of menopausal status, and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer", section on 'CDK 4/6 inhibitors for select patients with high-risk disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Average or low-risk patients</strong> – For women with average-low-risk breast cancer, we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> as single-agent therapy rather than OFS plus endocrine therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The rationale for this recommendation is the better tolerability than OFS plus either an AI or tamoxifen. We typically consider low-risk breast cancer to be in women older than 35 years who are without indications for chemotherapy. However, some women who prioritize minimizing the risk of recurrence over side effects may reasonably opt for OFS plus an AI or tamoxifen. (See <a class="local">'Low- to average-risk, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative cancers'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Single-agent use of an AI as cancer therapy in women with intact ovarian function is contraindicated. In women who were premenopausal at diagnosis and became amenorrheic during the course of chemotherapy, AIs are initiated only with concurrent OFS or ablation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive cancers</strong> – There are few data to inform the approach in this subset. Recognizing that other approaches are acceptable, given the limitations in data, our approach is as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For such patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy, we suggest incorporation of OFS with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant setting (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For those with a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant therapy, either use of OFS or omission of OFS is appropriate, depending on patient preference.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with small (&lt;2 cm), node-negative cancers, chemotherapy is typically administered in the adjuvant rather than neoadjuvant setting. For such patients, we typically suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> alone rather than OFS plus endocrine therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Duration of treatment</strong> – The minimum duration of treatment with endocrine therapy is five years, although extended treatment to 10 years is appropriate in women with higher-risk disease as well as some women with lower-risk disease who prefer to minimize the risks of recurrence, despite increased toxicities. The approach to duration of endocrine therapy in premenopausal women is extrapolated from the postmenopausal setting. Full discussion, including patient selection, efficacy, and toxicities, is covered separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer", section on 'Duration of endocrine treatment'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Toxicities</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Toxicities with OFS with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists include musculoskeletal symptoms, hot flashes, and bone mineral density loss. Combination of OFS with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> or an AI results in typically greater toxicity than tamoxifen alone. (See <a class="local">'Toxicity'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/764.html" rel="external">"Managing the side effects of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There is a high frequency of congenital anomalies associated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> if taken during pregnancy. Women who are of childbearing potential should use an effective means of contraception while on tamoxifen. Those who become pregnant while on tamoxifen should discontinue it during pregnancy. Following completion of tamoxifen treatment, given the pharmacokinetics of the drug, women are advised to wait for at least two months after tamoxifen has been discontinued before attempting pregnancy.
