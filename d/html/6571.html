The approach to the initially stable child with traumatic injury and the classification of trauma in the injured child are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6572.html" rel="external">"Approach to the initially stable child with blunt or penetrating injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6459.html" rel="external">"Classification of trauma in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1059442806"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, over 12,000 children and adolescents 0 to 18 years old die annually of unintentional and intentional injuries, making trauma the leading cause of death for this population [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Injuries and poisoning are also the leading causes of emergency department (ED) visits [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], accounting for over 17 million ED visits in 2017, which is over one-third of the 48.5 million ED visits for children and youth &lt;25 years old [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Blunt injury accounts for approximately 90 percent of all pediatric trauma. When blunt force is applied to a child's small body, multisystem trauma occurs frequently. Although the majority of injuries are mild to moderate in severity, the clinician caring for children should be prepared to rapidly evaluate and manage those patients with serious and life-threatening trauma. In addition, children have differing anatomy and physiology from adults, which requires specific attention during advanced trauma care. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6533.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Overview of unique pediatric considerations"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A standardized approach to the initial management of trauma patients has been disseminated by the American College of Surgeons through the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65952" href="/d/graphic/65952.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The ATLS protocols are based on the concept of the Trimodal Death Distribution [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The first peak of death occurs in the seconds to minutes immediately after injury and only prevention can impact this mortality.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The second peak occurs in the minutes to hours after injury. During this time, referred to as the "golden hour," rapid assessment and treatment decreases fatalities and improves outcomes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The third peak of death occurs days to weeks after the initial injury because of infection and multi-organ system failure. Definitive care in a center with pediatric expertise and resources mitigates this delayed mortality.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For this discussion, the unstable pediatric trauma patient refers to any child who has abnormal vital signs, disruption of vital functions (eg, airway, breathing, circulation, mental function), or apparent injuries of a critical nature. Knowledge of normal vital signs by age and awareness of the ability of children to sustain major hemorrhage without hypotension facilitates recognition of the critically injured child  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60424" href="/d/graphic/60424.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097" href="/d/graphic/78097.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6533.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Overview of unique pediatric considerations"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">INJURY CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several methods for measuring severity of injury exist. In order to appropriately triage the management of the trauma patient, one useful method to categorize injuries uses the following parameters. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6459.html" rel="external">"Classification of trauma in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Injury extent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple trauma is defined by apparent injury to two or more body areas. Localized trauma involves only one anatomic region (eg, head and neck, chest and back, abdomen, extremities) of the body. Sometimes the extent of injury may be obvious; at other times this may not be readily apparent, and the clinical picture may evolve over time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Injury type</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The expected injuries differ based on whether they occur as a result of blunt trauma (eg, fall, motor vehicle collision [MVC]) or penetrating trauma (eg, gunshot, stabbing, shrapnel from explosion).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Injury severity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mechanism of injury and physical examination findings are useful in the determination of severity. Assessment of severity will dictate the initial management and disposition [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. High risk trauma mechanisms predict patients who are more likely to be unstable or become unstable and, along with vital signs and physical findings, are often used to guide prehospital transport decisions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60424" href="/d/graphic/60424.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293" href="/d/graphic/57293.html" rel="external">table 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57153" href="/d/graphic/57153.html" rel="external">table 6</a>).

Achieving these goals requires a systematic and logical approach according to the tenets of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), presented below in an expanded format to emphasize the importance of performing specific procedures rapidly in the emergency department (ED) and the crucial need to continuously reassess vital functions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Primary survey (rapid primary evaluation)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Resuscitation of vital functions (eg, airway, breathing, circulation, mentation)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Utilization of adjuncts to the primary survey and resuscitation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Secondary survey (more comprehensive secondary assessment)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Continued post resuscitation monitoring with further resuscitation as needed</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Utilization of adjuncts to the secondary survey</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transition to definitive care</p><p></p><p>Management of seriously injured children relies on two key principles:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment and management occur simultaneously during the primary survey. Any identified physiologic threat to life must be rapidly treated before moving on to the evaluation of the next priority area.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If there is any deterioration of the patient during the evaluation, the primary survey should be repeated and any newly identified problems addressed before proceeding with the definitive care of the patient [<a href="#rid4">4,7</a>].</p><p></p><p>Clinicians should incorporate ATLS guidelines into the management of the pediatric trauma patient but with the understanding that this offers only a general construct. In reality, particularly when multiple clinicians are involved, many steps typically occur simultaneously.</p><p>Organization of the medical response around the concept of a pediatric trauma team may provide more timely identification of injury and more rapid treatment with improved outcomes [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>The next section will discuss each of the key elements of the primary survey as if they were distinct entities occurring in a strict sequence, even though in centers with optimal pediatric trauma resources these steps typically occur simultaneously.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">PRIMARY SURVEY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The order of priority in the initial assessment and treatment in ATLS is called the "primary survey" and includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A - Airway maintenance with cervical spine (C-spine) protection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>B - Breathing and ventilation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>C - Circulation with hemorrhage control</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>D - Disability (evaluation of neurologic status)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>E - Exposure (complete visualization)/environmental control (prevention of hypothermia)</p><p></p><p>During the primary survey, clinicians must identify and promptly address life-threatening conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Prior to the arrival of the patient, care providers should don eye protection, mask, gown, and gloves to prevent exposure to patient secretions (universal precautions). The care of the patient proceeds more effectively if participants know their role beforehand and if the leader of the resuscitation communicates clearly.</p><p>In trauma centers, advance notice to all participants and key units (eg, blood bank, operating room) facilitates collaborative and timely care of the critically injured child.</p><p>Upon arrival of the patient, clinicians should place the appropriate monitors, obtain vital signs (pulse, respirations, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, temperature), and provide supplemental oxygen. It is imperative for the trauma provider to assess pediatric vital signs in comparison to a readily available reference of normal values for age. (See <a class="local">'Vital signs'</a> below.)</p><p>The list below provides a brief overview of the approach and a more detailed discussion of each major category follows. Use of a trauma flow sheet with a dedicated recorder helps ensure that all aspects of assessment and care receive attention.</p><p>In the clinical setting, particularly when multiple clinicians are involved, many steps occur simultaneously. For example, intravenous (IV) access may precede chest tube placement, even though "breathing" comes before "circulation" in the algorithm. Also, clinical events will dictate the exact sequence of assessment and management. Some conditions are difficult to detect in young children based on physical findings (eg, cardiac tamponade), and others may evolve over time. For instance, a patient with initially symmetric breath sounds may become cyanotic from a tension pneumothorax in the middle of the secondary survey while receiving positive pressure ventilation and require an immediate thoracostomy tube.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3766246690"><span class="h2">Vital signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Normal vital signs change with age in children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097" href="/d/graphic/78097.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). In general, heart and respiratory rates are higher than in adults, and blood pressure is lower. For children, the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile systolic blood pressure for age is defined by Pediatric Advanced Life Support as follows [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Term neonates (0 to 28 days): &lt;60 mmHg</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infants (1 to 12 months): &lt;70 mmHg</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Children (1 to 10 years): &lt;(70 mmHg + [child's age in years x 2])</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Children &gt;10 years: &lt;90 mmHg</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Airway with cervical spine motion restriction</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Airway assessment</strong> – Airway obstruction with hypoxia and inadequate ventilation is the most common cause of pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest following trauma [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The clinician must rapidly determine airway patency, presence of foreign bodies in the mouth or pharynx, and evidence for facial/mandibular or tracheal/laryngeal fractures with potential for an unstable airway. Medical providers must remain alert for the potential loss of the airway. A patient who is able to cry or speak normally is unlikely to have impending airway obstruction, but should be reevaluated frequently [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6383.html" rel="external">"Basic airway management in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6316.html" rel="external">"Technique of emergency endotracheal intubation in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Airway management</strong> – Clinicians should restrict motion of the cervical spine. During the initial management, the clinician must assume a cervical spine injury in the patient with multiple trauma, especially with head/neck injury or with an altered level of consciousness. Padding under the shoulder and back and use of the "sniffing position" is important to open the airway maximally and maintain a neutral cervical spine position in the infant or young child. Note that this positioning is markedly different from adults where padding under the head is frequently required to achieve neutral cervical spine position.

One-person, manual in-line techniques to restrict motion must be used if immobilizing devices need to be removed for endotracheal intubation or other airway procedures  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874" href="/d/graphic/80874.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

In most trauma patients, an inadequate airway means the patient requires rapid sequence intubation to manage or to prevent hypoxemia and hypercarbia and to prevent rapid respiratory decompensation. Establishing an airway, particularly in children &lt;3 years of age may be challenging due to specific anatomical differences from adults (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6383.html" rel="external">"Basic airway management in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6316.html" rel="external">"Technique of emergency endotracheal intubation in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6533.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Overview of unique pediatric considerations", section on 'Airway'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Chin lift or jaw thrust</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Suctioning of secretions</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal airway as adjuncts to bag-valve-mask ventilation or temporary measures prior to endotracheal intubation (nasopharyngeal airway is contraindicated if cribriform plate fracture is suspected)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Endotracheal intubation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) (if endotracheal intubation fails or difficult airway is anticipated)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Needle or surgical cricothyroidotomy</p><p></p><p>Common reasons for endotracheal intubation in injured patients include impending or potential airway compromise (eg, airway trauma, inhalation injury, prolonged seizures), pulmonary contusion with hypoxemia, flail chest with inadequate chest wall movement  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79746" href="/d/graphic/79746.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), hemorrhagic shock, and severe head injury (GCS &lt;8) [<a href="#rid4">4,10,11</a>].

An anatomically focused CT on the cervical spine level of concern should be obtained in any of the following circumstances (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6561.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents", section on 'Cervical spine imaging'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inadequate cervical spine radiographs (three-views)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suspicious plain radiographic findings</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fracture/displacement seen on plain radiographs</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High clinical index of suspicion of injury despite normal radiographs</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H102229276"><span class="h3">Chest CT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For children, chest CT is primarily indicated to identify vascular or tracheo-bronchial injury in hemodynamically stable patients with the following findings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical examination evidence of great vessel injury (asymmetric pulses, diminished pulses throughout with associated major chest trauma, paralysis, or large hemothorax with ongoing hemorrhage)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abnormal screening chest radiograph with findings that suggest great vessel injury (eg, wide mediastinum, obscured aortic knob, left apical cap, or large left hemothorax)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suspected tracheo-bronchial injury</p><p></p><p>Hemodynamically unstable patients with suspected aortic injury should undergo emergency surgical or endovascular repair rather than additional imaging. For children with suspected blunt aortic injury (BAI), the approach to diagnosis and treatment is similar to the approach in adults  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73037" href="/d/graphic/73037.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6569.html" rel="external">"Overview of intrathoracic injuries in children", section on 'Traumatic aortic injury'</a>.)</p><p>We restrict the use of chest CT to the above indications because a normal chest radiograph has a high negative predictive value for significant thoracic injury that requires intervention. Furthermore, the incidence of cardiac and great vessel injury in children is significantly lower than the risk of radiation exposure in children. The initial stabilization and evaluation of thoracic trauma is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6568.html" rel="external">"Thoracic trauma in children: Initial stabilization and evaluation", section on 'Thoracic imaging'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H41"><span class="h3">Abdominal CT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abdominal CT with intravenous contrast is the preferred diagnostic imaging modality to detect intra-abdominal injury in hemodynamically stable children who have sustained blunt abdominal trauma. CT is sensitive and specific in diagnosing liver, spleen, and retroperitoneal injuries, which may be managed nonoperatively. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization", section on 'Abdominal and pelvic CT'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13899.html" rel="external">"Liver, spleen, and pancreas injury in children with blunt abdominal trauma", section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>CT with intravenous (IV) contrast alone is less sensitive in detecting injuries of the pancreas, intestinal tract, bladder, and lumbar spine.

Those children who do not respond to fluid resuscitation require direct operative intervention; a FAST examination may be helpful in characterizing the injury in this situation. Those who become hemodynamically stable after fluid repletion should have an abdominal CT performed. (See <a class="local">'e-FAST (extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma)'</a> above.)</p><p>A low-risk rule for intra-abdominal injury can identify children and adolescents who may undergo emergency department observation rather than abdominal and pelvic CT and is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization", section on 'Low-risk rule for intra-abdominal injury'</a>.)</p><p>The accuracy of CT imaging may be increased with the use of oral or intravenous contrast. The routine use of oral contrast is controversial; it is rarely of benefit in the diagnosis of acute distal bowel injuries, but may be helpful in the diagnosis of duodenal and pancreatic injuries. The use of oral contrast media can increase scanning time and cause vomiting although low rates of aspiration have been documented in retrospective studies. In addition, oral contrast may inadequately penetrate the small or large bowel. For these reasons, many trauma centers no longer use oral contrast. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization", section on 'Abdominal and pelvic CT'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H42"><span class="h3">Laparoscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with suspected bowel injury, who are hemodynamically stable, emergent laparoscopy may be considered as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure.

If the pulses are present, the extremity may be maintained in the position in which it is found. Splints should be placed to immobilize the joint above and below the injury site, if possible. The neurovascular status of the extremity should be evaluated before and after splint placement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6334.html" rel="external">"Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries"</a>.)</p><p>Pelvic fractures may be temporarily managed by wrapping a sheet around the pelvis at the level of the greater trochanter to reduce pelvic volume and control hemorrhage  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76777" href="/d/graphic/76777.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). (See <a class="local">'Circulation'</a> above.)</p><p>Open wounds should have appropriate wound care, and IV antibiotics should be given for open fractures.

When a level 1 PTC is not available, injured children should receive care at a hospital that has the highest level of pediatric trauma expertise and resources. Depending upon the region, this site may be a level II pediatric trauma center, an adult trauma center with pediatric capability sometimes called a combined trauma center (CTC), an adult trauma center (ATC), or a children's hospital without trauma verification. In the US, just over half of children had timely access (ie, ground or air transport time &lt; 60 minutes) to a level 1 or 2 PTC by ground transport in 2020 [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].   </p><p>Experts have developed a field triage guideline that identifies those patients who warrant direct prehospital transportation to a US trauma center. This critical field transport decision requires evaluation of vital signs, level of consciousness, injury anatomy, injury mechanism, and special patient or local emergency medical systems considerations. This guidance recommends that children "should be triaged preferentially to pediatric-capable trauma centers"  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81002" href="/d/graphic/81002.html" rel="external">algorithm 4</a>) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p>For injured infants, children, and younger adolescents who require admission, treatment in a PTC is associated with better clinical outcomes than an ATC. For example, in a metanalysis of 34 studies that evaluated hospitalized pediatric trauma patients, treatment in a PTC for children &lt; 14 years old was associated with lower mortality than in an ATC (23 studies; OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.76) or in an ATC with additional pediatric capability referred to as a combined trauma center (CTC, 11 studies; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Compared with an ATC, care of children with blunt trauma in a PTC was also associated with a lower likelihood of undergoing computed tomography or operative management for a blunt solid organ injury. There was significant heterogeneity in the metaanalyses, and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low. In a separate large retrospective cohort study of over 88,000 children &lt;18 years old treated in 146 US trauma centers, high ED pediatric readiness was independently associated with a lower risk of death at one year [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].  </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3792923234"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
