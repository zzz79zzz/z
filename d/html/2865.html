They are venerated elements of the art of medicine, the best series of diagnostic tests we have [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>A relatively complete physical examination should be performed on each patient, regardless of the reason for the visit. Numerous medical anecdotes relate instances in which the examination revealed findings unrelated to and unexpected from the patient's chief complaint and major concerns. On occasion, a limited or inadequate examination may miss a significant condition, mass lesion, or potentially life-threatening condition.</p><p>The general principles, standard measurements, and overall approach to the pediatric patient are discussed here. Examination of specific organ systems is discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2869.html" rel="external">"The pediatric physical examination: HEENT"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2860.html" rel="external">"The pediatric physical examination: Chest and abdomen"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2868.html" rel="external">"The pediatric physical examination: Back, extremities, nervous system, skin, and lymph nodes"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2858.html" rel="external">"The pediatric physical examination: The perineum"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">The approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before entering the room, the clinician should review the patient's record and confirm the identity of the patient and others in the room. This may avoid greeting the patient, parent, or caregiver by the wrong name. The examiner should always knock on the door and await a response before entering by gently opening the door. Small children standing on the other side can be injured easily by the door handle or by the door's impact as it is being opened.</p><p>Regardless of whether the clinician and caregiver have met previously, it is appropriate to greet everyone in a cordial manner, maintaining a professional yet friendly demeanor. Clinicians should introduce (or reintroduce) themselves and any colleagues or students observing or participating in the visit and ask those in the room to introduce themselves as well, particularly if the clinician is uncertain of the relationship between the caregiver(s) and the child.</p><p>Infants older than six months and anxious toddlers who are leery of strangers often are more comfortable when held by their caregiver. To gain the child's confidence and to avoid an early adversarial relationship, the clinician should try using a calm approach, a reassuring smile, and a toy or bright object as a diversion. An appropriate distance should be maintained during the history-taking portion. The clinician's approach should be cautious and nonthreatening once the physical examination is about to begin.</p><p>Infants younger than six months who have no stranger anxiety and children older than 30 to 36 months who are familiar with the examining clinician and/or who possess a trusting demeanor generally cooperate during the examination without being held. Physical examination of 5- to 12-year-old children usually is easy to perform because these children are not typically apprehensive and tend to be cooperative.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">General appearance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The examiner may gain significant insight into important social and family dynamics by observation alone when entering the patient's room. Terms used to describe a patient's general appearance include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Degree of comfort (calm, nervous, shy)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>State of well-being (normal, ill-appearing, distressed)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>activity level (sedate, alert, active, fidgety)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical appearance (neat, disheveled, unkempt)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Behavior and attitude (happy, sad, irritable, combative)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Body habitus (overweight, underweight, short, tall)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nutritional status (malnourished, normal, corpulent)</p><p></p><p>Initial observations may help the clinician form a hypothesis, further supported by physical examination findings. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the child and caregiver make no eye contact or the patient lacks animation and has no social smile, neglect is one possibility. Psychosocial intervention may be warranted. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6603.html" rel="external">"Child neglect: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If a child appears ill, the clinician should note the patient's preferred position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A child who lies completely still on the examination table, is verbally responsive, but noticeably winces when an attempt is made to change position may have an acute abdomen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6434.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A dyspneic patient who is sitting upright and slightly forward with the arms extended and hands resting on the knees might be experiencing an exacerbation of asthma or other causes of respiratory distress.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If an infant is crying, the pitch and intensity of the cry should be noted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A boisterous hardy cry is reassuring.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A weak and listless cry may indicate a seriously ill infant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A high-pitched, screeching cry may indicate increased intracranial pressure, reaction to a painful injury, toxic reaction, strangulated inguinal hernia, or other serious disorders.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Note the patient's breathing pattern. If the patient has rapid, shallow respiration yet appears to be in no acute distress, the underlying cause could be primary pulmonary disease or respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6100.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with metabolic acidosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The examiner should evaluate the developmental status before touching the child, including during history taking. The patient's motor function, interaction with surrounding objects and people, response to sounds, and speech pattern give clues about whether the patient is developing typically or is in need of more comprehensive developmental assessment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/615.html" rel="external">"Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care", section on 'Approach to surveillance'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historical information depends almost completely upon the caregiver for patients in the neonatal age range through early childhood. To obtain pertinent information regarding a 5- to 12-year-old child, the clinician must still rely primarily on the caregiver, although comments made by the patient are often relevant.</p><p>When appropriate, adolescent patients should have some time with the clinician in the absence of caregivers to permit more open discussion of pertinent historical information, anticipatory guidance, and preventive health care issues. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108.html" rel="external">"Guidelines for adolescent preventive services"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106.html" rel="external">"Confidentiality in adolescent health care"</a>.)</p><p>Key elements in the history-taking process include establishing a warm, caring atmosphere and asking questions in a nonconfrontational, unhurried manner. The terminology and language used by the examiner should be appropriate for the health literacy of the caregiver and the patient. Good eye contact and a sense of undivided attention should be maintained. The clinician should sit opposite the caregiver and/or patient at a comfortable distance, unencumbered by large objects, such as desks or tables. Outside interruption by the medical staff and by telephone calls should be kept to a minimum. Before beginning the history, clinicians should explain that they may occasionally need to refer to the electronic or written medical record to review laboratory results, imaging reports, or other pertinent information. An effort should be made to maintain an uninterrupted dialogue, to write few notes, and as much as possible to refrain from turning their back to the patient/caregiver to look at the medical record.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Examiners should wash their hands thoroughly before beginning and after completing the examination. Protective gloves should be worn when appropriate.</p><p>Skilled clinicians employ different techniques to gain pediatric patient cooperation. The use of toys, distracting objects, and pictures helps in the examination of young children, infants, and toddlers. Engaging the two- to four-year-old in stories or a discussion of imaginary animals frequently creates an effective diversion. Food, in the form of chewable snacks or liquid refreshments, can be used as a means of pacification, depending upon the stage of the examination.</p><p>When an otherwise typically behaving child older than four years fails to cooperate for an examination, even in the presence of a familiar caregiver, it may be an indication of either an earlier traumatic encounter between the patient and another examiner or that the current examining clinician should try a different approach. The possibility of an underlying psychosocial problem or behavior disorder should be considered if a child older than four years is extremely uncooperative or combative.</p><p>For patients old enough to understand but who appear apprehensive, the examiner should explain what is going to be done during the examination and allow them to look at and touch any of the instruments to be used. Older patients should be warned in advance of potential pain or discomfort.</p><p>The examination of an infant, toddler, or child should be performed in the presence of a parent or guardian; if the parent's or guardian's presence may interfere with the examination (eg, suspected child abuse), a chaperone should be present [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. The use of a chaperone is appropriate for the examination of the anorectal and genital areas and/or breasts of male and female adolescent patients. The clinician should explain the reason for the examination and describe how the examination will proceed. The gender of the chaperone should be determined by the patient’s wishes and comfort (if possible). Ideally, the utilized chaperone should be a staff member rather than a family member. The use and identity of the chaperone should be identified in the medical record.</p><p>If the patient has a complaint, sign, or symptom that appears to involve a particular part of the anatomy, that part of the examination should be performed last. As an example, consider a patient complaining of right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain thought to be attributable to appendicitis; by not examining that part of the body first, the clinician may be able to divert the patient's attention away from the involved area and rule out other possible causes for the pain.</p><p>Patient privacy should be respected. If a patient objects to being unclothed or to wearing an examination gown, allow them to remain clothed until a specific part of the anatomy must be checked. When an area needs to be examined, the patient should be asked to remove or pull free the garments that are hindering visualization, palpation, or auscultation.</p><p>The order in which the physical examination is conducted often is age-specific and depends upon examiner preference. For an infant and younger child, the clinician may prefer to begin by examining the eyes, noting the red-light reflex, extraocular eye muscle movements, and visual tracking and then move to other parts of the body or organ systems before finally performing the often sensitive ear examination. For the older, more cooperative child, the examination might begin at the head and progress down the body, with the neurologic examination performed last. In general, the portions of the pediatric examination that require the most patient cooperation, such as blood pressure measurement, lung and heart auscultation, and eye and neurologic examinations, are performed initially. These examinations are followed by the more bothersome portions, including abdominal and ear examinations and measurement of head circumference.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">STANDARD MEASUREMENTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Growth parameters</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Measurement of the standard growth parameters throughout childhood and adolescence is essential for assessing normal development [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].
