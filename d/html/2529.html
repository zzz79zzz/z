         Surgical resection is the cornerstone of curative therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma. However, surgery alone provides a high cure rate only for patients with early stage (stage I  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         )) disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many randomized trials have attempted to improve the results of surgery alone through the addition of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT), both before and after surgery. RT has emerged as an important component of adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer because of the distinct patterns of failure following resection. In contrast to colon cancer, in which the failure pattern is predominantly distant metastases, the site of first failure in patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer is equally distributed locally (ie, pelvis) and in distant sites (eg, liver, lung) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The majority of the early trials of combined modality therapy in rectal cancer evaluated postoperative RT with or without chemotherapy. The focus has shifted to preoperative (neoadjuvant) application of combined chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Neoadjuvant rather than adjuvant CRT is preferred for patients with transmural (T3/4  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         )) or node-positive tumors, particularly if they are low lying within the rectum. Advantages of this approach include better local control, an increased likelihood of sphincter-saving surgery, a decreased risk of post-treatment bowel dysfunction (soiling, frequent stooling), and a lower risk of chronic anastomotic stricture. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2468.html" rel="external">
          "Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma", section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant treatment'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Most recently, a "total neoadjuvant therapy" approach, which includes induction chemotherapy followed by fluoropyrimidine-based concomitant CRT or short-course RT followed by four months of chemotherapy, has emerged as an alternative to initial CRT for patients with large bulky, locally unresectable tumors, those that are clinical N2, or with extramural venous invasion on staging MRI. In some cases, this may permit nonoperative management of locally advanced rectal cancer if a clinical complete response is achieved. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2468.html" rel="external">
          "Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma", section on 'Nonoperative management (watch and wait)'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, despite these advances, initial surgery is still utilized in clinical practice, especially for patients whose preoperative local staging evaluation cannot distinguish between clinical (c) T2/3 tumors and proximal cT3N0  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) tumors, for which RT may not be recommended after total mesorectal excision (TME). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2522.html" rel="external">
          "Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Postoperative (adjuvant) therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients who have not received neoadjuvant CRT will be reviewed here. Neoadjuvant treatment approaches for rectal adenocarcinoma, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy, the preoperative staging evaluation, surgical management of rectal adenocarcinoma, management of rectal squamous cell cancers (which are treated similarly to anal cancers, with definitive CRT), and post-treatment follow-up after definitive treatment are discussed separately.

         For most patients with stage II or III rectal cancer  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ) who go directly to transabdominal surgery, we suggest postoperative combined modality therapy (a combination of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy plus concomitant pelvic radiation therapy [RT]) over surgery alone, even if a total mesorectal excision (TME) was performed.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with margin-negative T3N0 tumors after TME who did not have preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and who wish to avoid the potential toxicity of postoperative RT, the 12-gene recurrence score may provide additional data on which to base a decision to forego postoperative therapy. However, there is uncertainty about the predictive validity of this test, and many clinicians, including the authors and editors associated with this topic review, do not routinely use it in rectal cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         These recommendations are in keeping with consensus-based guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), but others disagree [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
         Following surgery alone for rectal cancer, local failure is a component of first relapse in less than 10 percent of patients with T1 to T2 adenocarcinomas, in 15 to 35 percent of those with stage T3N0 disease, and in 45 to 65 percent of those with stage T3/4 node-positive disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,4
         </a>
         ]. Significantly fewer local recurrences (generally &lt;10 percent) are reported in series utilizing TME  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65765" href="/z/d/graphic/65765.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) (4 to 12 percent). The morbidity associated with local failure is substantial, and salvage procedures often require extensive surgery, possibly including pelvic exenteration, which can be (but is not necessarily) curative. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2528.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of locally recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Randomized trials consistently show significantly better local control and longer times to local failure using conventional fractionation adjuvant RT alone (ie, without concurrent radiosensitizers) in patients with resected stage II or III rectal cancer, although a survival benefit has never been clearly shown [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, a series of randomized trials conducted in the 1980s and 1990s established a benefit for fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, with or without RT, after resection of stage II or III  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) rectal adenocarcinoma for disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival, or both compared with surgery alone or surgery followed by RT alone [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-14
         </a>
         ]. However, many of these trials (including the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group [GITSG], the North Central Cancer Treatment Group [NCCTG], and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project [NSABP] R-01 trials and others [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-11
         </a>
         ]) used chemotherapy that would be considered inferior by modern standards, and very few of the trials directly compared adjuvant chemotherapy with concomitant CRT.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, the NSABP R-01 trial randomly assigned 555 patients with resected Dukes B and C rectal cancer to one of three arms: observation only, adjuvant chemotherapy only (methyl-CCNU,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/z/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">
          vincristine
         </a>
         , and FU [MOF]), or postoperative RT only (46 to 47 Gy) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. No group received postoperative CRT. There was a significant DFS advantage to MOF chemotherapy compared with surgery alone or surgery with RT, but there was no overall survival benefit. Patients receiving postoperative RT had a reduction in local recurrence but no improvement in survival compared with surgery alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, despite these deficiencies, these trials established the benefit of adjuvant therapy, and no subsequent randomized trial exploring refinements in adjuvant therapy has included a control (surgery alone) arm. Largely based on these trials, a 1990 United States (National Institutes of Health) consensus conference recommended postoperative chemotherapy plus pelvic RT (45 to 55 Gy) as a standard treatment after resection of stage II or III rectal cancer [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The panel did not specify an optimal regimen but indicated the need for further refinements in the adjuvant regimen, particularly in chemotherapy, to enhance safety. (See

         A survival benefit for the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy after potentially curative resection of rectal cancer was further shown in a 2012 meta-analysis of 21 trials comparing the outcomes between 4367 patients with resected rectal cancer who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy and 4854 who did [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. All of the trials used fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Compared with no adjuvant chemotherapy, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of disease relapse (hazard ratio [HR] for relapse 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.83) and death (HR for death 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.91). The contribution of RT was not addressed in this analysis.

         Neoadjuvant rather than adjuvant therapy (long-course CRT or short-course RT alone) is generally a preferred approach for patients with transmural (T3/4  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">

Advantages of the neoadjuvant approach include better local control (even in the setting of optimal TME), an increased likelihood of sphincter-saving surgery, a lower risk of post-treatment bowel dysfunction (soiling, frequent stooling), and a lower risk of chronic anastomotic stricture. This approach is consistent with published consensus-based guidelines from the NCCN. However, others disagree. Updated 2017 guidelines for treatment of rectal cancer from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) suggest that neoadjuvant therapy is appropriate for transmural tumors with &gt;5 mm of extramural invasion, but that initial surgery is preferred for cases with &lt;5 mm of extramural invasion [

         Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who undergo neoadjuvant CRT or short-course RT benefit from the addition of systemic chemotherapy, which is typically administered after resection. The benefits of such therapy and the selection of the appropriate regimen in this setting are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         However, increasingly, "total neoadjuvant therapy," in which preoperative treatment includes not only RT but also four months of systemic chemotherapy (which would otherwise be given after resection), has become an accepted alternative to long-course CRT alone or short-course RT alone for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who are at high risk for a margin-positive resection (ie, T4 disease or an involved mesorectal fascia), as well as for those with clearly node-positive disease and a low-lying rectal tumor, given the increased compliance with chemotherapy (which increases the ability to deliver the recommended course of chemotherapy), the improved local control, and the ability to consider nonoperative treatment.

         Given the documented benefits of both RT and chemotherapy, most adjuvant therapy regimens for resected rectal adenocarcinoma consist of two components: chemotherapy alone and concomitant CRT using radiation-sensitizing doses of chemotherapy. No one trial has definitively established an optimal adjuvant regimen after resection of stage II or III rectal cancer.

         We suggest concurrent use of a fluoropyrimidine as a radiation sensitizer during postoperative RT rather than RT alone. This recommendation is based on the lack of a survival benefit with adjuvant RT alone in randomized trials and the results of the GITSG and NCCTG trials, which show a survival benefit with combined use of concurrent

         Both bolus and infusional FU alone represent appropriate choices for adjuvant FU-based chemotherapy in conjunction with postoperative RT. However, many institutions favor infusional FU based on the survival benefit seen in at least one intergroup study and the lower rate of hematologic toxicity using this approach as compared with bolus treatment seen in multiple studies [

         In the treatment of abdominopelvic tumors, careful attention must be paid to RT technique. It is generally
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         appropriate to treat rectal tumors with anteroposterior-posteroanterior (AP-PA) fields alone. Since the anterior structures, which receive a high dose, are not substantially at risk for local failure, the two-field technique results in increased treatment-related toxicity without significant improvement in local control. At our institution, we generally treat patients with a four-field box technique, although a three-field technique with right and left lateral fields and a posterior field is also reasonable. The use of lateral fields permits sparing of a portion of the bladder and some anteriorly placed small bowel.
        </p>
        <p>
         The AP-PA fields extend from approximately the lower level of the L5 vertebral body to 4 to 5 cm below the anastomosis (or below the tumor when treating preoperatively) in patients with a low anterior resection (LAR). For patients with an abdominoperineal resection (APR), the fields always extend to include the perineum. There are a substantial number of local recurrences in the perineum, and this area needs to be in the high dose volume. Laterally, the fields extend approximately 1 to 1.5 cm beyond the bony pelvis so that the lateral pelvic soft tissue receives the full radiation dose. The lateral fields have the same cephalad and caudad extent as the AP-PA fields.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients are treated in the prone position. The posterior border of the lateral field extends beyond the bony sacrum so that the full dose is delivered to the presacral space, a common site of local failure. Anteriorly, the fields extend to adequately cover the original tumor with at least a 2 cm margin. Blocks can often be used to spare a portion of the femoral neck in the lateral fields.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bladder should be full during treatment so as to push some of the small intestine out of the radiation treatment volume. When the perineum needs to be treated, a bolus is placed on it so that a full dose will be delivered to the scar in this region. A bolus is a material with a similar density to tissue that is placed directly on the skin surface. The beam then strikes the absorbing surface at the bolus, whose thickness is calculated so that the maximum dose to the target volume occurs closer to the skin surface. If the reaction becomes marked, the bolus can be removed. Perineal reactions do not typically produce major symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients are treated at 1.8 Gy in five fractions per week to a total dose of 45 Gy to these fields. The field size is then reduced, and a boost dose is delivered to the tumor bed. Prior to designing the boost field, a special small bowel radiographic series is obtained to define the exact location of the small bowel with respect to the boost area. Only by knowing the exact bowel position can one design the treatment volumes to minimize excess irradiation of the small intestine.
        </p>
        <p>
         Great effort is made to avoid doses greater than 45 Gy to any small bowel that is fixed in the pelvis. In this regard, it is helpful to have the surgeon (at the time of the initial surgical procedure) try to move the small intestine out of the pelvis. This can best be accomplished by reperitonealizing the pelvic floor. When this is not possible, a portion of omentum can be mobilized and swung over to cover the pelvic floor, or the uterus can be retroverted to accomplish the same purpose. Some centers have investigated the use of prostheses or artificial mesh, but these are still being investigated. These approaches are most important when treating patients after an APR; after an LAR, the remaining rectum and colon prevent some small bowel from being immobilized deep in the pelvis.

          Role of IMRT and proton beam irradiation

         Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced form of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) that changes the intensity of radiation in different parts of a single radiation beam while the treatment is delivered. IMRT relies on computer control capabilities to maximize the delivery of radiation to the planned treatment volume while minimizing radiation to normal tissue outside the target.
        </p>
        <p>
         Possible benefits of treatment of rectal cancer with IMRT include radiation dose escalation to the target and reduction in dose to surrounding normal tissues. Dosimetric studies comparing IMRT with traditional techniques in rectal cancer have shown clinically significant reductions in dose to the bowel, as well as the bladder, pelvic bones, and femoral heads, while also achieving superior target coverage, dose homogeneity, and conformality [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ]. Successful implementation of IMRT in the preoperative (neoadjuvant) management of rectal cancer has been reported from multiple institutions. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although fewer data are available, IMRT has also been safely and successfully integrated into the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer in patients who have not undergone preoperative RT [

        </p>
        <p>
         Dosimetric studies report that proton therapy reduces bone marrow, bladder, and small bowel exposure compared with both IMRT and 3D-CRT [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         The optimal sequence of adjuvant RT and chemotherapy has not been established conclusively. In a non-study setting, we typically administer two months of chemotherapy followed by six weeks of concomitant fluoropyrimidine-based CRT and then by two months of additional chemotherapy. However, an acceptable alternative is to start with four months of chemotherapy and finish up with concomitant fluoropyrimidine-based CRT.

         With the exception of the GITSG study, most trials demonstrating benefit for combined CRT have used a "sandwich" technique, in which one or two cycles of chemotherapy are followed by combined modality therapy and then additional chemotherapy. Historically, this sandwich approach was pursued in order to get the RT planned appropriately without unnecessarily delaying the initiation of adjuvant therapy. However, there are no data indicating a better outcome with early rather than late initiation of RT. This issue was addressed in a Korean trial that randomly assigned 308 patients with resected stage II or III rectal cancer to begin RT (45 Gy in 25 fractions) with either the first or third planned course of LV-modulated FU [

         One of the advantages of neoadjuvant compared with adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer is a decrease in the likelihood of chronic bowel toxicity. As an example, in the seminal German Rectal Cancer Study Group study, which randomly assigned 823 patients with clinically staged T3/4 or node-positive rectal cancer to the same CRT regimen administered either preoperatively or postoperatively, the benefits of preoperative therapy included significantly fewer pelvic relapses, a twofold higher chance of sphincter preservation, and a significantly lower rate of chronic anastomotic strictures (4 versus 12 percent) [

         TME is the standard technique of removing perirectal tissue when performing radical rectal cancer surgery (LAR or APR). TME employs a precise, sharp dissection between the visceral and parietal layers of the endopelvic fascia to ensure en bloc removal of the perirectal areolar tissue, including the lateral and circumferential margins of the mesorectal envelope, lymphatics, and vascular/perineural tumor deposits with the primary rectal cancer.

          41,42
         </a>

         Opponents of this view quote other data that suggest a higher rate of local recurrence with TME alone when adjuvant therapy is not administered [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43-45

         Furthermore, a benefit for RT even among patients undergoing TME was suggested in a Dutch neoadjuvant trial that randomly assigned 1861 patients with resectable rectal cancer to TME alone or short-course preoperative RT (5 Gy daily for five days in the "Swedish style," followed by TME) [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45

For patients with T3N0 disease who did not have a TME, CRT is especially important to minimize the risk of local recurrence. Others disagree with this approach.

         Some data suggest that a subset of patients with resected T3N0 rectal cancer do well without any adjuvant therapy.

         For patients with margin-negative T3N0 tumors after TME who did not have preoperative CRT and who wish to avoid the potential toxicity of postoperative RT, especially in females who aspire to bear children, the 12-gene recurrence score may provide additional data on which to base a decision to forego postoperative therapy. However, there is uncertainty about the predictive validity of this test, and many clinicians, including the authors and editors associated with this topic review, do not routinely use it in rectal cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients with stage II colon cancer, gene expression tests, such as the 12-gene recurrence score assay (the Oncotype DX colon cancer assay), are used in an attempt to further refine prognostic stratification beyond that possible with conventional clinicopathologic features and assist in decisions about adjuvant chemotherapy. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project suggest that rectal and colon cancers have similar patterns of genomic alteration [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ], implying that recurrence score parameters that have been established for colon cancer might be meaningful for rectal cancer as well. The utility of the 12-gene recurrence score in rectal cancer was addressed in a study of 297 patients who were enrolled in the Dutch TME trial and were mainly treated with surgery alone [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Overall, 182 patients died, including 120 who died after a recurrence of rectal cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the entire cohort, which included patients with stage II and III disease, the recurrence score significantly predicted the risk of recurrence, including distant recurrence and rectal cancer-specific survival, after controlling for stage and resection margin status. The effect was most prominent in stage II patients, in whom the five-year cumulative incidence of recurrence ranged from 11 percent in the low recurrence score group (&lt;30, 49 percent of the total patients with stage II disease) to 27 percent in the intermediate recurrence score group (31 to 40) and 43 percent in the high recurrence score group (≥41).
        </p>
        <p>
         Several caveats must be considered when interpreting these results:

         <span class="glyph">

         The recurrence score was useful for predicting which stage II patients had a very low incidence of recurrence and, thus, which stage II patients might be candidates for not receiving adjuvant therapy. However, caution is advised against using the recurrence score as a deciding factor to go straight to surgery for clinical stage II patients until prospective trials are performed to test the predictive validity of this strategy. There are no absolutely reliable clinical staging methods that accurately predict node positivity prior to surgery since many positive nodes are &lt;5 mm in diameter. In addition, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound may be relatively accurate at predicting a margin-negative resection, they are not perfect. Preoperative RT is associated with improved outcomes (efficacy and toxicity) when compared with postoperative RT, and it is indicated in patients with node-positive tumors or where a margin-positive resection is a concern.

         The 12-gene recurrence score was created as a prognostic marker. While it may have the ability to better estimate a patient's risk of recurrence, there are no good data suggesting that the recurrence score predicts the value of chemotherapy treatment.

The guidelines emphasize that after surgery alone for rectal cancer, trials and a meta-analysis indicate a survival and DFS benefit for adjuvant FU-based chemotherapy, but the magnitude of benefit is smaller than what it is for colon cancer, and few of the studies mandated TME surgery. Furthermore, few data are available on the benefit of an oxaliplatin-containing regimen in the absence of neoadjuvant CRT. The decision on postoperative chemotherapy should be risk balanced, taking into account both the predicted toxicity for a particular patient and the risk of relapse, and it should be made jointly by the individual and the clinician.

Local excision permits removal of both the tumor and the adjoining rectal tissue in one specimen without tumor fragmentation and allows assessment of inked margins, histologic differentiation, vascular involvement, and depth of invasion. This approach is usually reserved for patients with well-differentiated T1 lesions that are less than 3 cm in diameter, are located in the middle to distal rectum, and lack lymphovascular invasion.

        <p>
         Although more radical surgery is preferred, selected patients (ie, those with comorbid illness, refusal of major resection) with incompletely resected early rectal cancers deeper than T1 may be treated with local excision; in such cases, we suggest postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), with or without chemotherapy, if the patient can tolerate it. If this approach is chosen, close post-treatment surveillance is mandatory. Furthermore, all patients undergoing local excision must be closely followed indefinitely, as almost one-third of local recurrences occur more than five years after resection.

         Although more radical surgery is preferred patients with comorbid illness, or those who refuse major resection who have incompletely resected early rectal cancers deeper than T1 may be treated with local excision if used in conjunction with radiation therapy (RT) and/or chemotherapy, which may be administered prior to or following local excision:

         An early prospective study of 26 patients with T2/3 rectal cancer less than 4 cm in diameter, within 10 cm of the dentate line, and treated with local excision (transanal, transsphincteric, or transcoccygeal approach) and adjuvant CRT identified a local recurrence in two patients (8 percent) with a mean follow-up of 40.5 months [
         <a href="#rid53">

         Additional support for this approach is provided by several trials noting relatively low rates of local recurrence (5 to 7 percent) and favorable rates of disease-free as well as overall survival, with rectal preservation rates of over 60 percent in patients treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by local excision for cT2 disease [

         Surgical resection is the cornerstone of therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma, but it provides a high likelihood of cure only for patients with stage I disease. Such patients do not need adjuvant therapy. (See

         Neoadjuvant therapy is generally preferred over initial surgery for patients with clinically staged transmural (ie, T3/4  (

         )) or node-positive tumors, particularly for distal tumors, and those that threaten the mesorectal fascia. Advantages include better local control, a greater likelihood of sphincter-saving surgery, and fewer chronic anastomotic strictures. This approach is consistent with consensus-based guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), but others disagree. Updated 2017 guidelines for treatment of rectal cancer from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) suggest that neoadjuvant therapy is appropriate for transmural node-negative tumors with &gt;5 mm of extramural invasion, but initial surgery is preferred for cases with &lt;5 mm of extramural invasion.

         The optimal sequence of adjuvant RT and chemotherapy has not been established conclusively. We typically administer two months of chemotherapy followed by six weeks of fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy and two additional months of chemotherapy. An acceptable alternative is to start with four months of chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy. (See

         – Although more radical surgery is preferred, select patients (ie, those with comorbid illness, refusal of major resection) with incompletely resected early rectal cancers deeper than T1 may be treated with local excision; in such cases, we suggest postoperative RT and/or chemotherapy if the patient can tolerate it (

          Grade 2C
