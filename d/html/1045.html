These changes can lead to left atrial dilation and progressive dysfunction, as well as possible left ventricular dysfunction, which can reverse with restoration of sinus rhythm. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1041.html" rel="external">"Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1062.html" rel="external">"Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy"</a>.)</p><p>Thus, both rate- and rhythm-control strategies are aimed at alleviating these pathophysiologic consequences or AF and alleviating a patient’s symptoms of AF. </p><p>For patients with AF, the long-term choice between rhythm or rate control should be made after a detailed shared decision-making discussion between patient and their provider(s) regarding the benefits and risks of each approach. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3518407972"><span class="h2">Prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AF is associated with increased mortality and other sequelae. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation", section on 'Sequelae'</a>.)</p><p>Among high-cardiovascular-risk patients who are treated early in the course of their disease, rhythm control has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes and survival when compared with rate control. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a class="local">'High cardiovascular risk'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3111465832"><span class="h2">Alleviation of symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms of AF can include palpitations, dyspnea, lightheadedness, angina, decreased exercise tolerance, and near syncope. These can occur in patients with rate-controlled AF and those with rapid AF. Many patients with AF who are symptomatic will have a strong desire to be in sinus rhythm. For instance, among some physically active patients, being in AF rather than sinus rhythm can lower their exercise capacity [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Many active individuals or those who need to carry out activities requiring optimal cardiac performance generally do not tolerate AF.</p><p>Even patients who are not physically active can be very symptomatic from AF and/or report low AF-related quality of life [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. For many such patients, the benefits of achieving and maintaining sinus rhythm outweigh the risks of a rhythm-control strategy. Still, not every patient will feel better when in sinus rhythm compared with AF.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H791711233"><span class="h2">Thromboembolic risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While thromboembolism, especially stroke, is the most important adverse outcome of AF, prevention of thromboembolism is <strong>not</strong> a reason for choosing a rhythm- versus a rate-control strategy. Regardless of which strategy is chosen, patients remain at risk for thromboembolism, and each must undergo risk stratification to determine their thromboembolic and bleeding risks and whether antithrombotic therapy is indicated. This is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1031.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants"</a>.)</p><p>Studies are somewhat inconsistent in their findings as to whether rhythm-control therapy reduces embolic risk. Both the AFFIRM and RACE trials demonstrated that embolic events occurred with similar frequency regardless of whether a rate- or rhythm-control strategy was pursued. Furthermore, most embolic events (113 of 157 ischemic strokes in AFFIRM and 29 of 35 embolic events in RACE) occurred after <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> had been stopped or when the international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic (less than 2) [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. In contrast, the EAST-AF NET trial showed a lower risk of stroke for patients assigned to rhythm versus rate control; stroke risk was elevated in both groups compared with baseline stroke risk in patients without AF. These findings are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'High cardiovascular risk'</a> below.)</p><p>One reason that a rhythm-control approach may not reduce the embolic risk is that AF frequently recurs after treatment in 35 to 60 percent at one year with intermittent monitoring  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69285" href="/z/d/graphic/69285.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>] and in up to 88 percent of those with continuous monitoring for more than 18 months on antiarrhythmic therapy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In the AFFIRM trial described below, there was a high crossover rate from rhythm to rate control (17 and 38 percent of patients at one and five years), due primarily to an inability to maintain sinus rhythm and drug intolerance [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3404699893"><span class="h1">URGENT MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical decision regarding whether to employ a rate- versus rhythm-control strategy in the urgent setting is required for patients who are clinically unstable. Unstable patients with AF include those with hypotension, altered mental status, ischemia, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or very rapid ventricular rates (eg, patients with preexcitation and anterograde conduction of AF through an accessory pathway). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation", section on 'Unstable patients'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/962.html" rel="external">"Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Anatomy, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome"</a>.)</p><p>In most patients who require urgent management, we first employ a rate-control strategy. Exceptions are if the patient is hemodynamically unstable and successful ventricular rate control cannot be achieved. </p><p>The decision about rate or rhythm control may change once the patient becomes stable and requires long-term management of AF. (See <a class="local">'Elective and long-term management'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1425381340"><span class="h1">ELECTIVE AND LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H846215465"><span class="h2">Rhythm control</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2595049969"><span class="h3">Indications for initial rhythm control</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3073914837"><span class="h4">Symptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Alleviation of symptoms from AF despite adequate ventricular rate control is a major pillar of management of the patient with AF. Therefore, we try an initial rhythm-control strategy. For some patients who are highly symptomatic, AF can limit activity and adversely affect quality of life even for those without a rapid heart rate. For such patients, it is reasonable to attempt a long-term rhythm-control strategy. Typically, a rate-control strategy may alleviate some of the symptoms of AF, especially at rest, but commonly a decline in exercise tolerance remains, often due to rapid rise of heart rate with exertion. In addition, for some patients, loss of atrial contribution to cardiac output can play a major role in symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Alleviation of symptoms'</a> above.) </p><p>Quality-of-life scores have been assessed as substudies of some randomized AF trials. The Canadian Trial of Atrial Fibrillation (CTAF) randomized persistent AF patients to either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/z/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9821" href="/z/d/drug information/9821.html" rel="external">propafenone</a> [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The authors found that by three months, global well-being was significantly worse for patients who had recurrent AF compared with those who did not. In addition, they noted the main clinical variable that correlated with improved subjective quality of life was restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm. The RACE study randomized patients to rate versus rhythm control. The quality-of-life substudy demonstrated that patients with AF had worse quality of life compared with healthy controls [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The treatment strategy did not affect quality of life. However, the presence of sinus rhythm at the end of the follow-up interval (instead of the assigned strategy) was associated with an improvement in quality of life. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1681238943"><span class="h4">Age ≤80 years</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Younger patients generally have fewer side effects with pharmacologic rhythm control and catheter ablation compared with older patients. Younger patients are also less likely to have permanent AF, which increases the likelihood of a successful cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Also, in younger patients, there is concern that being in AF for longer may lead to adverse long-term consequences such as adverse cardiac remodeling. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1579560740"><span class="h4">High cardiovascular risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We prefer rhythm control for any patient, regardless of symptoms, who is at high risk for cardiovascular disease. High risk for cardiovascular disease is defined age &gt;80 years, prior transient ischemic attack or stroke, or two of the following criteria: age &gt;65 years, female sex, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, severe coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (diastolic septal wall width &gt;15 mm). It is important to mention that these age cutoffs provide guidance but are not meant to be absolute. The management of AF in patients with heart failure is discussed in detail separately (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/977.html" rel="external">"The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure", section on 'Preference for rhythm over rate control'</a> and <a class="local">'Patient preference'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Higher survival with early (within 12 months of initial AF diagnosis) rhythm control in patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease outcome in the EAST-AF NET trial </strong>– The EAST-AFNET 4 trial demonstrated slightly improved survival with rhythm control in 2789 high-cardiovascular-risk patients if this strategy is employed within 12 months of the initial diagnosis [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. High risk was defined as &gt;75 years of age, prior transient ischemic attack or stroke, or two of the following criteria: age &gt;65 years, female sex, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, severe coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (diastolic septal wall width &gt;15 mm). This study randomly assigned patients with early AF (diagnosed ≤12 months before enrollment; median time since diagnosis, 36 days) to either early rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs or ablation or to usual care, which limited rhythm control to patients with unacceptable symptoms after rate control. The trial was stopped early for efficacy after a median of 5.1 years of follow-up. The following findings were reported:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The primary composite outcome (eg, cardiovascular death, stroke, or serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy) occurred less often with rhythm control versus usual care (249 versus 316 events; 3.9 versus 5 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% CI 0.66-0.94).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Death from cardiovascular causes occurred less often in the rhythm-control group (67 versus 94 events; 1 versus 1.3 percent; HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.52-0.98).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Stroke occurred less often in the rhythm-control group (40 versus 62 events; 0.6 versus 0.9 percent; HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.44-0.97).

Among asymptomatic patients, patients randomized to early rhythm control had lower risk of the primary composite outcome compared with those assigned to usual care (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.6-1.03) that was not statistically significant. Among symptomatic patients, a similar benefit from early rhythm control was seen (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.6-0.98). The study was not powered to detect a difference between patients with and without symptoms. However, this does suggest that symptoms may be underreported by patients with AF, and there is some clinical improvement with maintaining sinus rhythm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Early studies suggested a higher mortality with pharmacologic rhythm versus rate control,</strong> <strong>whereas later meta-analyses show equivalent outcomes </strong>– This is discussed separately.
