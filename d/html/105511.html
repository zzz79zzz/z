Over 50 million GI endoscopic procedures were performed in the United States alone in 2017, including approximately 19 million colonoscopies [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss anesthetic management for both routine and advanced GI endoscopy. Management of monitored anesthesia care (MAC), office-based anesthesia, and procedural sedation and alternatives to sedation administered by non-anesthesia clinicians are discussed separately.

The goals of preanesthesia evaluation are to identify underlying medical and physical conditions that may increase risks and to formulate an anesthetic plan that minimizes these risks. Hypoxemia and aspiration are the most frequent complications among patients undergoing GI endoscopic procedures. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>In anticipation of GI endoscopy, the patient should be evaluated for conditions that increase sensitivity to sedative and analgesic medications (eg, older age; obstructive sleep apnea; advanced chronic lung disease; pulmonary hypertension; coronary artery, liver, or severe kidney disease). Patients should also be evaluated for conditions that may require increased doses of sedatives and analgesics (eg, anxiety disorders; chronic pain; use of opioids, sedatives, or recreational drugs such as marijuana) to allow appropriate drug dosing and administration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2567.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults: Procedural sedation administered by endoscopists"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ASA physical status </strong>–<strong> </strong>Similar to other procedures that require anesthesia, patients with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504" href="/z/d/graphic/87504.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) classification are at increased risk of periprocedural adverse events [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. The complexity and frequency of advanced endoscopic procedures are increasing, as well as the comorbidities of the patients who undergo such procedures. In particular, therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is associated with increased risk of adverse events, regardless of ASA status [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], and is now performed for patients who were previously considered inoperable or who are critically ill. Patients with symptoms of achalasia including those who have undergone Heller myotomy or peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) are at increased risk of aspiration and should be carefully evaluated for need for tracheal intubation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preanesthesia testing</strong> – Preoperative laboratory and cardiac testing should be performed as it would be for patients who undergo anesthesia for surgery.

Endoscopic procedures are usually classified as conferring low risk of perioperative cardiac events. However, the commonly used revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) is not appropriate for patients having outpatient procedures, and the calculators that use National Surgical Quality Improvement (NSQIP) database (eg, Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest [MICA] or American College of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator) do not include endoscopic procedures (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery", section on 'Using risk assessment tools'</a>).

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15698.html" rel="external">"Preoperative fasting in adults"</a>.)</p><p>In patients with impaired gastric emptying or high risk of aspiration and in emergencies, the potential for aspiration should be considered when determining the level of sedation and whether to intubate to protect the airway. Patients with a history of aspiration pneumonia and conditions such as severe gastroparesis and achalasia benefit from extended fasting times. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94214.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia", section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3216914628"><span class="h1">ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are many ways to provide anesthesia for endoscopy, and practice varies widely across the United States and the world. Factors that determine the choice of anesthesia are facility preference, resource availability (especially anesthesia providers), proceduralist preferences, and patient factors. These procedures may be performed in free-standing endoscopy units, in-hospital endoscopy units, or operating room suites. Basic and emergency equipment, medications, and personnel should be the same, regardless of anesthetizing location. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91909.html" rel="external">"Office-based anesthesia", section on 'Safety concerns'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H838654460"><span class="h2">Choice of anesthetic technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The choice of anesthetic technique should be based on patient factors and the requirements of the procedure, including anticipated duration and complexity. General anesthesia with tracheal intubation (GETA) may be the best choice for patients at high risk of aspiration and for many advanced endoscopic procedures, especially endobariatric and submucosal dissection. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) must be used in facilities without anesthesia machines or gas scavenging, and therefore without the option for inhalation anesthesia. Induction and maintenance of general anesthesia are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94135.html" rel="external">"Induction of general anesthesia: Overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96308.html" rel="external">"Maintenance of general anesthesia: Overview"</a>.)</p><p>Moderate or deep sedation is commonly used for patients without risk factors for aspiration. Moderate sedation (also called conscious sedation) refers to a level of sedation in which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands and maintain spontaneous ventilation without support. Patients under deep sedation cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully to painful stimulation and may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109909" href="/z/d/graphic/109909.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). However, patients often transition between various depths of sedation, and deep sedation can easily become general anesthesia, especially if <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9826" href="/z/d/drug information/9826.html" rel="external">propofol</a> is administered [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94529.html" rel="external">"Monitored anesthesia care in adults", section on 'Clinical assessment of sedation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94529.html" rel="external">"Monitored anesthesia care in adults", section on 'Propofol'</a>.)</p><p>Unsedated endoscopy is rarely used in the United States and is more commonly used in other countries. Though most patients prefer sedation or anesthesia, for select patients (eg, some patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease) and procedures (such as a screening colonoscopy), sedation-free endoscopy may be preferred and is usually well tolerated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2569.html" rel="external">"Sedation-free gastrointestinal endoscopy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H468482741"><span class="h2">Monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monitoring for anesthesia for endoscopy should include standard physiologic monitors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110080" href="/z/d/graphic/110080.html" rel="external">table 4</a>), with additional monitoring based on patient comorbidities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94529.html" rel="external">"Monitored anesthesia care in adults", section on 'Standard physiologic monitors'</a>.)</p><p>Ventilation should be monitored with capnography during moderate or deep sedation. Capnography facilitates early detection of apnea and airway obstruction [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], predicts the development of hypoxemia [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], and may reduce patient injury related to respiratory depression [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Measurement of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) may be challenging during upper endoscopic procedures (depending on the airway adjunct employed) but is usually possible using a two-channel nasal oxygen cannula or the end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> tubing placed beneath or connected to an oxygen mask.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H459772238"><span class="h2">Airway management</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3330848710"><span class="h3">Preparation for airway emergencies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Respiratory events, including hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and respiratory arrest, are among the most common complications of anesthesia for GI endoscopy. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Airway emergencies such as laryngospasm and intractable airway obstruction may occur with little warning during both routine and advanced upper GI endoscopic procedures. Preparation for airway management should be the same for these procedures as it is for other anesthetics, with routine, specialized, and emergency airway equipment available. An air-mask-bag unit (AMBU) should be immediately available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94135.html" rel="external">"Induction of general anesthesia: Overview", section on 'Preparation for anesthetic induction'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2668047415"><span class="h3">Airway management strategy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Airway management for GI endoscopy should be based on patient- and procedure-related factors, including the degree of stimulation, risk of aspiration, and expected duration and complexity of the procedure. The majority of colonoscopies and upper endoscopies are performed with spontaneous ventilation, with or without airway devices, with sedation or general anesthesia. By definition, patients who are unresponsive to a painful stimulus are under general anesthesia, regardless of the airway management technique. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94529.html" rel="external">"Monitored anesthesia care in adults", section on 'Monitoring depth of sedation and analgesia'</a>.)</p><p>The following issues should be considered when planning airway management for endoscopy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Predicted difficulty with airway management </strong>–<strong> </strong>The choice of anesthetic technique and/or airway management may depend on the preoperative airway assessment. Any anticipated difficulty with mask ventilation and subsequent airway obstruction might call for use of tracheal intubation from the outset. However, with an expanding array of devices, the need for tracheal intubation has decreased. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients who are at high risk of respiratory depression or obstruction, noninvasive ventilation or heated humidified high-flow oxygen may be helpful during sedation [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>], though routine use is neither necessary nor cost effective.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk of aspiration </strong>–<strong> </strong>Each patient who undergoes GI endoscopy should be evaluated for risk factors for aspiration, and the plan for sedation and risk of aspiration should be documented. In addition to patient factors that increase the risk of aspiration with sedation or anesthesia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98506" href="/z/d/graphic/98506.html" rel="external">table 5</a>), some of the conditions for which endoscopy is performed are associated with a high risk of aspiration (eg, gastric outlet obstruction, achalasia, upper GI bleeding including actively bleeding varices, esophageal stricture, bowel obstruction). These patients should receive general anesthesia with rapid sequence induction and intubation, or awake tracheal intubation, to protect the airway and minimize the chance of aspiration. Patients who require a duodenal stent placement or removal should be carefully evaluated for the need for tracheal intubation. Often, they will be receiving jejunal feeds and the need for tracheal intubation may be reduced.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Delayed gastric emptying is a potential side effect of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonists (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115980" href="/z/d/drug information/115980.html" rel="external">semaglutide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9522" href="/z/d/drug information/9522.html" rel="external">liraglutide</a>), which are used to treat diabetes and are increasingly used for weight loss. Patients who take these medications may have residual gastric contents despite preoperative fasting and may be at increased risk of aspiration during induction of anesthesia. In 2023, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) issued guidance for patients taking GLP-1 agonists, including recommendations for holding the drug prior to surgery and rapid sequence induction precautions for patients with symptoms of delayed gastric emptying or full stomach on gastric ultrasound [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94214.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia", section on 'Patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients with pharyngeal pouches, intubation in Trendelenburg position would allow drainage of pouch contents by gravity and may reduce the risk of aspiration before intubation. Alternatively, awake intubation may rarely be considered after discussion with the gastroenterologist and/or otolaryngologist. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89917.html" rel="external">"Flexible scope intubation for anesthesia", section on 'Preparation for awake intubation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">During colonoscopy, gas insufflation into the colon and/or application of excessive manual abdominal pressure during the procedure may increase the risk of aspiration. In patients scheduled to undergo both upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy, upper endoscopy should be performed first to allow suctioning of any residual gastric contents in a semireclining position and reduce the risk of aspiration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Shared airway</strong> – The anesthesiologist and the gastroenterologist share the airway during upper endoscopic procedures, and airway management must be coordinated among the care providers. As an example, laryngospasm can occur at the time of endoscope insertion or if secretions collect, especially if the depth of sedation is inadequate or the airway is irritable (eg, patients who smoke, recent or ongoing upper respiratory infection, those with postnasal drip).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Positioning for the procedure </strong>–<strong> </strong>Some endoscopic procedures are routinely or often performed in prone or semiprone positions (eg, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]), thereby restricting access to the airway and options for a modification in airway management during anesthesia. Airway management for ERCP is discussed below.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2220169441"><span class="h4">Airway management devices</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For upper GI endoscopy, the airway device used must allow insertion of the endoscope.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Devices for sedation – The au</strong>thor routinely uses a Mapleson C breathing circuit for airway management. In addition to endoscopy face masks, a number of different airway devices that can be used for endoscopy have become available, including high-flow nasal cannula and nasal masks for noninvasive ventilation. Due to added cost, routine use of these some of these devices may not be reasonable, but the cost may be justified for high-risk patients (eg, patients with severe obesity or obstructive sleep apnea) and for advanced endoscopic procedures (eg, endoscopic ultrasound [EUS], ERCP).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Devices for general anesthesia </strong>–<strong> </strong>Tracheal intubation is often performed for patients who have general anesthesia. Specialized supraglottic airways (SGAs) are available and are reasonable alternatives to tracheal intubation for some patients. The LMA Gastro is a dual-channel SGA with one lumen for passing the endoscope and another for ventilation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115383" href="/z/d/graphic/115383.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).

The reasons for this association are multifactorial and likely include the fact that most of these procedures are performed in out-of-operating room locations, increasingly complicated procedures and patients, and the anesthetic technique. Many complications of sedation for GI endoscopy involve respiratory events; cardiac arrest is most commonly preceded by hypoxemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2599.html" rel="external">"Adverse events related to procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Studies of complications of anesthesia for GI endoscopy are difficult to interpret because most complications are rare and much of the literature is retrospective or prospective and nonrandomized. One exception is the prospective randomized trial of general anesthesia with tracheal intubation versus monitored anesthesia care (MAC) with sedation for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which is discussed above [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See <a class="local">'ERCP'</a> above.)</p><p>In nonrandomized studies, comparisons among techniques may be confounded by patient factors. In some facilities, anesthesia services are requested for more complicated patients, while routine procedures in healthy patients are performed with non-anesthesia sedation, making comparison of techniques unreliable.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An out-of-operating room, or remote, location is a risk factor for complications of anesthesia. Contributing factors may include unfamiliar procedure rooms and personnel, inadequate availability and space for routine anesthesia equipment, a dark environment, and inadequate monitoring. Retrospective reviews and analysis of malpractice claims have reported that most complications result from oversedation and inadequate oxygenation during MAC. An analysis of closed malpractice claims from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Closed Claims Database from 1999 to 2009 found that respiratory events were twice as common in remote locations compared with the operating room, and inadequate oxygenation/ventilation was the most common specific event [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. One-third of claims occurred in the GI endoscopy suite, and 80 percent involved MAC.

In this study, 42 percent of patients had ASA physical status III or IV, 50 percent were &gt;60 years of age, and 17 percent had emergency procedures.

In a single-center prospective study of approximately 850 patients who underwent ERCP with precordial Doppler monitoring, venous gas embolism was detected in 2.4 percent of patients, one-half of whom exhibited hemodynamic changes as a result [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. Since precordial Doppler is not routinely used during endoscopy, many cases of gas embolism may go undetected and result in no clinical consequences.</p><p>A high index of suspicion for gas embolism should be maintained in patients who exhibit unexplained sudden hemodynamic collapse during one of these procedures. Risk factors for gas embolism during ERCP include previous surgery or other intervention on the biliary tract, transhepatic portosystemic shunts, blunt or penetrating trauma to the liver, sphincterotomy, metallic stent placement, and hepatic abscess or tumor [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. The consequences of gas embolism may be mitigated the use of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) rather than air for insufflation, since CO<sub>2</sub> is more rapidly absorbed and eliminated if embolism occurs.
