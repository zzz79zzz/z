Patients with FS are at substantially increased risk for recurrent and severe bacterial infections. Medications that raise the neutrophil count may provide therapeutic benefit [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], but the risk of infection is also affected by neutrophil dysfunction and other disease-related factors [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].</p><p>Treatments for the neutropenia of FS include selected nonbiologic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which are presumed to reverse underlying abnormalities in the immune and reticuloendothelial systems. Other medical therapies for FS, including granulocytopoietic growth factors, increase circulating neutrophils by mechanisms that are not disease-specific. Splenectomy is reserved primarily to treat patients with severe neutropenia and recurrent infections who are refractory to medical therapy.</p><p>Drug therapy for FS is described here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of FS and the indications for splenectomy in the treatment of FS are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7482.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Felty syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7485.html" rel="external">"Role of splenectomy for Felty syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H685090"><span class="h1">GOALS OF THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The management of Felty syndrome (FS) is focused upon the partial or complete reversal of neutropenia to facilitate the resolution of ongoing bacterial infections and to prevent recurrent infections. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity may also improve with many of these therapies independently of any change in the white blood cell count. A response to therapy is characterized by an increased neutrophil count accompanied by a clinical response that can include reductions in the frequency of infections and other clinical features. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7482.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Felty syndrome"</a>.)</p><p>A complete response to therapy was defined in one study as [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An increase in the neutrophil count to at least 2000 cells/microL plus two of the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infection rate decreased by at least 50 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Incidence of cutaneous ulcers decreased by at least 50 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Incidence of febrile episodes decreased by at least 75 percent</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H685425"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of Felty syndrome (FS) is indicated in patients with recurring or severe infections, although the presence of FS can also impact the choice of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but without infections. The principal treatment interventions include nonpharmacologic measures to reduce the risk of infection and medications to control RA disease activity and alleviate the neutropenia.

However, if a patient has an active severe infection, such as sepsis, MTX and biologic DMARDs should be held until the infection has resolved. (See <a class="local">'Initial therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Inadequate response to methotrexate'</a> below and <a class="local">'Inadequate response to methotrexate and rituximab'</a> below and <a class="local">'Well-controlled arthritis'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with life-threatening infections and neutropenia and in those who have not responded to DMARD therapy with a reduction in the frequency and severity of infections, we use granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to rapidly improve the neutrophil count and facilitate management of the infections. (See <a class="local">'Neutropenia and infection inadequately responsive to nonbiologic and biologic DMARDs'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2244682984"><span class="h2">Active arthritis</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3309967795"><span class="h3">Initial therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MTX has been reported to be effective for the treatment of FS in several case series [<a href="#rid6">6-10</a>]. Low-dose weekly oral MTX therapy results in improvement of both articular disease and neutropenia in most patients, often within one to two months. Short-term experience suggests that the frequency of infection may also decrease. However, these encouraging results are based upon small numbers of patients in each report. In one study, seven patients with FS received MTX at a mean dose of 13 mg per week [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The mean neutrophil count rose insignificantly after one month but doubled after a year. However, since that case series in 1998, no reports of larger series of FS patients treated with MTX and followed for longer than one year have been published. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7507.html" rel="external">"Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p>The precautions, administration, and dosing of MTX are the same as for patients without FS. The dose should be increased to maximum tolerated levels up to 25 mg once weekly in patients not responding to lower doses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7507.html" rel="external">"Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7509.html" rel="external">"Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate"</a>.)</p><p>We do not limit the dose of MTX based upon the presence of neutropenia. However, in patients with neutropenia, we monitor complete blood counts and absolute neutrophil counts frequently (eg, monthly) in addition to routine drug safety monitoring. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Monitoring and reevaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Other conventional synthetic DMARDs for which neutropenia is a known adverse effect, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9963" href="/z/d/drug information/9963.html" rel="external">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ), should be discontinued.</p><p>Patients with inadequate control of disease activity (moderate or severe disease activity) and no improvement of neutropenia after two months of MTX therapy at maximum tolerated doses of up to 25 mg weekly (administered by subcutaneous injection) are considered inadequately responsive to MTX therapy.</p><p>We use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10097" href="/z/d/drug information/10097.html" rel="external">leflunomide</a> as an alternative to MTX in patients unable to take MTX or who had responded inadequately to MTX in the past. The precautions, administration, and dosing of leflunomide are the same as in patients without FS. There is very limited evidence regarding its efficacy specifically for FS. In a case report, successful treatment with leflunomide was described in a patient who developed FS while receiving MTX [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. After six months of leflunomide treatment, leg ulcers healed without any adverse effects (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7477.html" rel="external">"Alternatives to methotrexate for the initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Leflunomide'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7515.html" rel="external">"Pharmacology, dosing, and adverse effects of leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H736281412"><span class="h3">Inadequate response to methotrexate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients who are inadequately responsive to MTX, we suggest adding RTX, rather than another nonbiologic DMARD or a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. The precautions, administration, and dosing are the same as in patients without FS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7501.html" rel="external">"Rituximab: Principles of use and adverse effects in rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103866.html" rel="external">"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial biologic DMARD therapy", section on 'Rituximab'</a>.)</p><p>At least eight cases of FS have been reported in which synovitis and neutropenia both improved following intravenous treatment with RTX [<a href="#rid13">13-20</a>]. However, other cases of FS have been described in which only articular disease, but not neutropenia, improved following a course of intravenous RTX treatment [<a href="#rid13">13,21</a>].</p><p>We prefer RTX and other selected agents over a TNF inhibitor because of the lack of efficacy of TNF inhibitors for FS that has been described in case reports. In six published case reports in which <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8583" href="/z/d/drug information/8583.html" rel="external">adalimumab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8925" href="/z/d/drug information/8925.html" rel="external">etanercept</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8984" href="/z/d/drug information/8984.html" rel="external">infliximab</a> was used to treat FS, each was ineffective in correcting the neutropenia of FS [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Although synovitis improved and acute phase reactant levels decreased in the two FS patients treated with subcutaneous etanercept 25 mg twice weekly, neither patient exhibited an increase in the absolute neutrophil counts [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].</p><p>Patients are considered to have responded inadequately to RTX if they have not improved during the three months following the initial course of therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H178329699"><span class="h3">Inadequate response to methotrexate and rituximab</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3314664426"><span class="h4">Role of glucocorticoids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We treat FS with glucocorticoids in patients who inadequately respond to MTX and/or RTX, or who are intolerant of these medications. Glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents should generally be avoided in the presence of active infection (see <a class="local">'General interventions'</a> above). Glucocorticoids may also be useful for short-term bridging therapy until a patient realizes any benefit from a recently initiated DMARD, such as MTX or RTX. Typical dosing of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> is 30 to 40 mg daily, which is then gradually tapered as the neutropenia improves. The rate by which the prednisone dose is tapered to 10 mg daily, or less, depends upon the timing and degree of clinical response and the patient's comorbidities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7520.html" rel="external">"Use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p>We avoid long-term glucocorticoids at doses greater than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> 15 mg daily, and we aim to reduce the dose to less than 10 mg daily, if possible. The white blood cell count may begin to rise within several weeks of initiating glucocorticoid therapy in responders.</p><p>Glucocorticoids can raise the neutrophil count in FS, both by an immunosuppressive action and by altering neutrophil kinetics: they stimulate the release of mature neutrophils from the bone marrow, mobilize neutrophils from the marginal pool into the circulation, and impair egress of neutrophils into tissues [<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>]. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">Prednisone</a> doses of 30 mg daily or higher, often can normalize the neutrophil count [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. However, this effect usually is not sustained when the dose is reduced to that usually used as maintenance treatment (less than 10 mg daily) of RA, unless other treatments are added.</p><p>Concern about overwhelming infection is the main obstacle to using high-dose glucocorticoids in FS. Low doses of glucocorticoids, which still may increase the risk of infection, do not consistently improve the neutrophil count [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2575386261"><span class="h4">Role of other biologic agents</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients intolerant of MTX or in those with an inadequate response to MTX and RTX and who require <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> at doses greater than 10 to 15 mg daily for control of the arthritis and neutropenia, we use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8526" href="/z/d/drug information/8526.html" rel="external">abatacept</a> rather than a TNF inhibitor, an interleukin (IL) 6 inhibitor, or a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to treat FS.

Significant side effects occurred in five of the eight patients, including nausea, malaise, and exacerbation of joint pain and vasculitic skin lesions. However, only two of these five required discontinuation of G-CSF, whereas the other three individuals continued G-CSF treatment at reduced doses. The underlying arthritis was not exacerbated. Several reports of individual cases and other small case series with short-term follow-up also support its use [<a href="#rid31">31-36</a>].</p><p>Both granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and G-CSF effectively reverse neutropenia and reduce infectious complications in many patients. However, some patients do not respond at all to colony-stimulating factor treatment, and secondary treatment failures also have been reported. The incidence of these events is unknown. In addition, cost is often a limiting factor, particularly with extended use.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity may also improve with many of these therapies independently of any change in the white blood cell count. A response to therapy is characterized by an increased neutrophil count accompanied by a clinical response that can include reductions in the frequency of infections and other clinical features.
