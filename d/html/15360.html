         </span>
         The objectives of taking a clinical history are to establish rapport and trust with the child and family, understand the nature of their health concerns regardless of whether or not they pertain to the nervous system, and anatomically localize the neurologic symptoms. A skilled clinician is often able to arrive at a diagnosis by the time a complete history has been taken and uses the examination to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of impairment.

         It is a common practice to inquire about activities a child cannot carry out or finds challenging. However, it is equally important to ask about activities that the patient can do and enjoy because these skills can be targeted for further development.

         Many childhood neurologic disorders are inherited. Thus, the clinician should inquire about the health status of all first-degree relatives (parents, siblings) and whether there is a family history of neurologic conditions, systemic disorders, or consanguinity. If other family members have neurologic disease, a pedigree chart is often helpful.

         Housing status, including the age of the home and possible lead exposure, can be relevant to neurodevelopmental status.

         Clinicians should also inquire about any safety or vulnerability concerns, including whether child and youth services have been involved for either the patient or other children in the home, especially if there are any concerns for nonaccidental trauma or neglect contributing to symptoms.

         – Significant events in the first few weeks of life include the need for neonatal intensive care and, if so, whether the infant required ventilatory support, oxygen therapy, vasopressor therapy, resuscitation medications, exchange transfusion, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In addition, it is important to inquire about seizures in the neonatal period and other signs of neonatal encephalopathy and/or use of therapeutic hypothermia. Poor feeding, impaired sucking and swallowing, and sleep-wake difficulties in the first month of life may be subtle markers of brain dysfunction. If cranial ultrasounds and/or other neuroimaging studies were performed during the neonatal period, the results should be reviewed. Results of newborn screening also should be reviewed. (See

         The clinician should record the child's age at acquisition of developmental milestones, such as social smiling, developing adequate head control, gurgling, reaching out for objects, rolling over, being able to maintain a sitting position, coming to a sitting position independently, crawling, walking independently, babbling, and using first words, phrases, and sentences  (

        <p>
         Some parents and caregivers are unable to recall the exact age at which these milestones were achieved. They may, however, have a good recollection of events surrounding the child's first birthday; thus, one can help jog their memory by asking about the child's abilities at that time, for instance, "Did this happen by the first birthday?" The examiner should be aware that in neurodegenerative disorders, a plateau in development may precede the start of developmental regression.

         The clinician should inquire about underlying medical conditions, some of which may have neurologic symptoms. If any disorder is present, the clinician should document the symptoms, treatment, and status of these disorders (ie, resolving, static, or deteriorating).

         Many regions require comprehensive newborn screening. An inquiry into the results of the newborn screen is important. Although screening programs are designed for high sensitivity, false-negative results may occur, particularly in premature or medically complicated infants. Some forms of congenital hypothyroidism are not consistently captured by newborn screening, so testing should be repeated if there is a clinical suspicion for this disorder. (See

         Infants and children with cerebral palsy often have a variety of problems attributable to their neurologic dysfunction, including dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, chronic constipation, respiratory difficulties, chronic aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree, sleep initiation and maintenance problems, impaired ambulation, scoliosis, deformities around joints of the extremities, and strabismus.

         The examination begins with observation of the child during the visit, even before starting the examination. This observation can provide insight into the spontaneous ability of the child and can guide prioritizing certain components of the examination if the child becomes less compliant with hands-on examination. When examining toddlers, the initial phase of inspection is best conducted while the child is seated in the parent's lap. This minimizes apprehension, which tends to alter the assessment of higher cortical functions, muscle tone, and tendon reflexes. It is also advisable to defer uncomfortable and anxiety-provoking procedures until the end of the session, such as otoscopy and checking of the gag reflex.

         Observations of infants and toddlers during play (eg, while stacking blocks or playing with an age-appropriate toy) can provide valuable information about the patient's attention span, gross and fine motor coordination, and problem-solving abilities. It allows the clinician to evaluate the higher cortical functions, and it provides clues to specific learning difficulties, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and mild developmental delays  (

          Testing visual acuity
         </strong>
         – In an infant, visual acuity can be tested by observing the infant reach for objects of varying size. Infants older than six months of age will usually reach for scraps of paper less than 5 mm in size when they are placed on a dark background. Standard tests can be used in older children who can recognize objects, letters, or numbers. The narrow, alternating black and white stripes painted onto a rotating drum should elicit optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), with quick jerks of the eyes in a direction opposite to the movement of the drum or tape.

          Funduscopy

         – Funduscopy of children requires patience and is best accomplished in a dimly lit room with the patient gazing straight ahead. The parent or caretaker can be requested to keep a bright object in the hand, upon which the child is asked to focus. The ability of the clinician to obtain an adequate funduscopic examination is often compromised by lack of patient cooperation, nystagmus, or small pupils. In this case, consultation should be sought with an ophthalmologist.

         OKN is a normal gaze-stabilizing response elicited by tracking a moving stimulus across the visual field and can be helpful as a crude assessment of the visual system. Assessment of OKN can be performed using an OKN drum or a piece of paper or cloth with alternating black (or red) and white stripes that is rapidly moved across the patient's visual field at reading distance. As the stimulus is moved from left to right, normally sighted patients will show quick, jerky movements to the left side and vice versa. Alternatively, a mirror placed in front of the patient's eyes can be tilted in different directions to elicit ocular pursuit movements. OKN is dependent upon the integrity of the visual system, especially visual perception, and pursuit and saccadic eye movement [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Bilateral absence of OKN in infancy or early childhood may suggest blindness, while unilateral absence may suggest a hemispheric lesion. Normal OKN in an individual with a complaint of vision loss suggests hysterical blindness. (See

         The function of CN VII can be assessed by observing for symmetry of the nasolabial folds, assessing eyelid muscle strength, and assessing the ability to wrinkle the forehead symmetrically. In addition, CN VII mediates taste sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and can be tested by applying two or three drops of a concentrated salt solution to the lateral edge of each one-half of the tongue using a cotton applicator, while the tongue is kept protruded.

         In infants, hearing is tested by making a soft sound close to one ear, such as from rustling of paper. The infant should show an alerting response. By the age of five to six months, the infant may also be able to localize the sound to a specific quadrant. The procedure is then repeated for the opposite ear. In cooperative school-age children, speech discrimination can be tested by softly whispering a number approximately one foot from the ear. The traditional Rinne and Weber tests can be used as well in older children. (See

         Function of CN XII in a child or adolescent is tested by asking the patient to stick out their tongue; normally, the tongue should remain in the midline. In patients with peripheral lesions of CN XII, the tongue points towards the paretic side. CN XII dysfunction can also cause fasciculations (slow, ripple-like movements) in the tongue and oromotor apraxia. Fasciculations are best observed with the mouth open and with the tongue kept immobile within the mouth.

         Muscle tone is the resistance felt upon passive movement of a part of the body. In the extremities, it is assessed by placing a joint through its
         <strong>
          full range
         </strong>
         of movement. Hypotonia is characterized by decreased resistance to passive movement and hyperextension at the joints. Increased tone that is spastic in nature (abnormal lengthening-shortening reaction to stretch that has the feel of a "clasp knife") tends to accompany pyramidal tract lesions. Increased tone that is characterized by muscle rigidity (has a "lead pipe" or "cog wheel" feel during the range of motion) suggests extrapyramidal lesions. Paratonia (also known as gegenhalten) is a form of hypertonia that is characterized by the involuntary resistance to passive movement. Although it is more often elicited in older adults with dementia, it also can occur in children with developmental disabilities, dyspraxia, and learning disabilities and may be incorrectly attributed to the child not complying with the examination.

         ]. Initially, the child is asked to extend the upper extremities with palms down. The child is then asked to close the eyes and rotate the extended arms so that the palms are facing upwards. During this turning maneuver with the eyes closed, a patient with upper motor neuron weakness may pull the elbow down and in. If in the response there is an upward and outward drift, a contralateral parietal lesion or a cerebellar process could be responsible.

         Patients with cerebellar dysfunction have difficulty in regulating the rate and range of muscle contraction (known as dysmetria), which may manifest as nystagmus, intention tremor, scanning speech, truncal or gait ataxia, or rebound phenomenon. To test for rebound phenomenon, the patient flexes the arm against resistance offered by the examiner, then the examiner abruptly releases the resistance. In rebound phenomenon, the patient is unable to stop the muscle contraction.

         Dysmetria can be assessed with the finger-to-nose test: When seated with the elbows fully extended and the arms in a horizontal plane, the patient is asked to touch the index finger to the nose and then return to the starting position. In a young child, use of a toy to reach for may be a helpful surrogate. Cerebellar deficits will impair performance on this test.

         A sensory examination in young children is often imprecise, and only gross deficits can be detected. Information obtained from sensory testing in a child below five to six years of age can be unreliable and may need confirmation during a second examination session.

         In children older than five to six years, sensory function is evaluated in the same manner as in an adult, as discussed in a separate topic review. (See

         The jaw, biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar, and ankle are commonly tested tendon reflexes, and all of these can usually be tested in infants and children. The joint under consideration should be at approximately 90° and fully relaxed. In patients with cerebral palsy, exhortations to "relax" may paradoxically increase contraction of the muscles and should thus be avoided. Instead, the patient should be put at ease during reflex testing with conversation.

         To elicit the reflex, let the head of the reflex hammer drop onto the tendon at the following locations:

         Jaw – With the mouth held partially open and examiner's finger placed over the chin, the finger is lightly tapped with a reflex hammer to displace the mandible downwards. This elicits contraction of the mandible and slight closure of the mouth.

         Absent or diminished tendon reflexes – This generally indicates interruption of the muscle stretch reflex arc at the level. Since the afferent impulses generated after tapping a tendon with reflex hammer are carried via large-diameter fibers, the absence of a tendon reflex could also signify involvement of large-diameter sensory fibers in a peripheral nerve.

         Exaggerated tendon reflexes – This generally indicates disinhibition of the motor units, owing to a pyramidal tract lesion. When the patellar reflex (knee jerk) is elicited, an exaggerated (ie, abnormal) response includes spread to the opposite side in the form of a crossed adductor response (contraction of the contralateral hip muscle) or ipsilateral contraction of the plantar, flexures of the foot. Similarly, clonus (rhythmic muscle contractions elicited by the stimulus) is exaggerated and abnormal.

         Differences between tendon reflexes in the upper and lower body – This may suggest a spinal cord lesion. As an example, the jaw jerk is the only tendon reflex that is mediated above the plane of the foramen magnum; thus, if the jaw jerk is of normal amplitude but the biceps and other tendon reflexes are exaggerated, this might be a clue to a craniovertebral junction lesion.

         Developmental reflexes (also known as primitive reflexes) appear at a certain time during the course of brain development and normally disappear with progressive maturation of cortical inhibitory functions. They are mediated at subcortical levels. Assessment of developmental reflexes is important in the newborn period and during infancy [

         The plantar reflex (S1) is elicited by stroking the plantar surface of the foot using a pointed but not sharp object (eg, the metal end of a reflex hammer). The stroke is from a lateral to medial direction, posterior to anterior, stopping short at the base of the great toes. The normal response is one flexion of all toes. Patients with corticospinal tract lesions manifest an extensor plantar response (Babinski sign), which is characterized by extension of the great toe and fanning of other toes.

         For the conjunctival reflex, gently touching a wisp of cotton or tissue to the surface of the conjunctiva will elicit an eye blink. The afferent loop of the reflex is via CN V, while the efferent loop is through the facial (VII) nerve. (See

          Observation
         </strong>
         – Observations of infants and toddlers during play (eg, while stacking blocks or playing with an age-appropriate toy) can provide valuable information about the patient's attention span, joint attention, babbling, speech, gross and fine motor coordination, and problem-solving abilities. These higher cortical functions are also assessed with a series of questions appropriate to the child's age  (

          Cranial nerves

         – Each cranial nerve (CN) is tested by performance of a specific motor or sensory test. Testing in infants is often by observation for specific movements and responses and is less reliable. (See

          Motor examination
         </strong>
         – The patient should be observed for abnormalities of posture and movements, including asymmetry at rest, fisting of the hand, frog-legged position suggesting hypotonia, tremor, myoclonus, or tics. (See

         Muscle tone is the resistance felt upon passive movement of a joint through its range of motion. Hypotonia is characterized by decreased resistance to passive movement and hyperextension at the joints. Hypertonia can be either spastic in nature or characterized by muscle rigidity. (See

          Sensory examination

          Developmental reflexes
