         Intermittent explosive disorder can be treated by a variety of clinicians. The disorder is usually treated with pharmacotherapy by a psychiatrist, internist, or nurse practitioner. If cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is used in addition to or instead of pharmacotherapy, a psychologist generally provides the psychotherapy. However, psychiatrists, internists, and nurse practitioners can provide all of the treatment if they are trained to administer CBT; treatment by a single clinician is often preferable because it allows for a better understanding of the patient and more consistent care. Patients whose disorder is either resistant or refractory to treatment are typically referred to a psychiatrist.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal of treatment for intermittent explosive disorder is remission, which is defined as resolution of symptoms or improvement to the point that only one or two symptoms of mild intensity persist. For patients who do not achieve remission, a reasonable goal is response, ie, stabilizing the safety of the patient and others, as well as substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms. Response can be quantified (eg, improvement from baseline ≥50 percent) with standardized rating scales such as the clinician administered Overt Aggression Scale-Modified [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ], but this is not standard clinical practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with intermittent explosive disorder should be advised to avoid intoxication with alcohol and other substances. Epidemiologic studies suggest that substance use disorders significantly increase the risk of violent behavior in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In addition, a laboratory study with 56 healthy men found that alcohol intoxication significantly increased aggressive behavior, especially at lower levels of provocation, when most individuals are inclined to behave nonaggressively [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].

         We suggest that clinicians treat intermittent explosive disorder with pharmacotherapy plus CBT, based upon randomized clinical trials that have demonstrated the limited benefit of each treatment alone [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. However, no head-to-head trials have compared CBT plus pharmacotherapy with pharmacotherapy alone or CBT alone. In addition, no trials have compared pharmacotherapy alone with CBT alone. Thus, it is reasonable to use either treatment alone based upon treatment availability, patient preference, prior response, and cost.
        </p>
        <p>
         CBT teaches patients to anticipate and better manage aversive environmental stimuli and may thus prevent aggressive impulses. Medications may increase the threshold at which an aggressive impulse triggers an explosive outburst.

         Assessment of treatment outcome in patients with intermittent explosive disorder generally ranges from daily to monthly, depending upon the severity of persistent symptoms. Hospitalized patients are monitored daily. Outpatients are commonly seen on a weekly basis until their disorder has responded (ie, the safety of the patient and others has stabilized and the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms has improved substantially) for two to four weeks. At that point the patient can be seen every two to four weeks until remission. Patients who subsequently deteriorate may need to resume a more frequent schedule of visits.

         We suggest a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) as first-line pharmacotherapy for intermittent explosive disorder based upon demonstrated efficacy, tolerability, and ease of use.

          Fluoxetine
         </a>
         has been studied most often and is thus preferred. However, other SSRIs are reasonable alternatives. Based upon the duration of treatment in most randomized trials, we suggest 6 to 12 weeks of treatment (beginning from day one) before determining whether the drug is beneficial [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10,12
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians can expect that approximately 66 percent of patients will respond [
         <a href="#rid9">

          fluoxetine
         </a>
         is 20 mg taken once daily. For patients who do not respond within two to four weeks, the dose is increased by 10 to 20 mg per day, depending on how well the medication is tolerated. Patients who remain unresponsive to treatment should receive additional increases of 10 to 20 mg per day every two to four weeks as tolerated, to an effective dose. The maximum dose is 60 mg per day. The dose schedule for other SSRIs and the adverse side effects of SSRIs are discussed separately. (See

          fluoxetine
         </a>
         includes a 12-week randomized trial that compared fluoxetine with placebo in 100 patients with intermittent explosive disorder plus a personality disorder (primarily obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, or borderline) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,12
         </a>
         ]. Moderate to large improvement occurred in significantly more patients who received fluoxetine than placebo (66 versus 29 percent). Side effects that occurred significantly more often with fluoxetine included sexual dysfunction, sleep disturbance, nausea, vomiting, and restlessness.

          fluoxetine

         to treat intermittent explosive disorder. A meta-analysis of randomized trials (3992 patients treated for a variety of psychiatric disorders) found that impulsive aggressive behavior occurred in significantly fewer patients who received fluoxetine than placebo (0.2 versus 0.7 percent) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         Intermittent explosive disorder often does not respond to an SSRI within 6 to 12 weeks of starting the drug. (Response is defined as stabilizing the safety of the patient and others, as well as substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms.) For these treatment-resistant patients, we suggest tapering and discontinuing the SSRI over one to two weeks at the same time that another medication is started and titrated up. The SSRI is generally tapered by the same amount for each dose decrease. As an example,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/z/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">
          fluoxetine
         </a>
         40 mg per day is decreased by 10 mg per day, every one to two days.
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest using the following drugs in sequence for resistant intermittent explosive disorder rather than trying a second SSRI, because of the demonstrated efficacy of the drugs listed below and the lack of evidence that a second SSRI is effective in patients whose disorder is resistant to an initial SSRI. The following drugs are listed in order of preference, based upon how often each drug has been studied and how well it worked [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Following onset of treatment, we suggest 6 to 12 weeks of treatment before determining whether the drug is beneficial [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10,12
         </a>
         ]. The proportion of patients who respond to any specific drug may be as high as approximately 60 percent [

         ], depending upon tolerability and adherence. A 12-hour serum trough level should be checked two weeks after the first dose, and one week after any dose change. Although there are no data correlating serum levels with efficacy in reducing impulsive aggression, toxicity can be prevented by maintaining the serum concentration ≤20 mcg/mL. Most studies have maintained the drug at 300 mg per day, but patients who do not respond after two to three weeks may benefit from increasing the dose by 30 mg per day each week to 400 mg per day. The pharmacology of phenytoin (including adverse side effects) is discussed separately. (See

         CBT works best for highly motivated patients who value a problem-solving approach to their illness. Conversely, CBT is contraindicated for patients who cannot learn the specific techniques that are taught (eg, patients with moderate to severe cognitive deficits) [

         CBT can be administered in either a group or individual format. Patients typically receive 8 to 16 sessions of therapy, but some treatment plans may call for 20; each session lasts approximately 60 minutes. The skills taught in therapy are practiced in between sessions.
        </p>

         Evidence of efficacy includes a 12-week randomized trial that compared group CBT, individual CBT, and a waitlist control condition in 45 patients with intermittent explosive disorder who were not receiving pharmacotherapy [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29

A clinically large and statistically significant reduction of impulsive aggressive behavior occurred in patients who received CBT compared with the control group; only minor differences were observed between group and individual CBT. In addition, treatment effects persisted at the three-month follow-up.

         Our clinical experience is that CBT should be reconsidered for patients who make little progress after four to eight sessions, depending upon the total number of sessions called for in the initial treatment plan. Motivation should be reassessed and the use of pharmacotherapy discussed if a medication has not been prescribed. CBT should be terminated for patients who do not engage in treatment (eg, skip appointments without calling ahead or make no effort to complete homework) despite repeated efforts upon the part of the clinician. Patients who terminate treatment should be allowed to return when they are ready to actively participate.

         Maintenance pharmacotherapy for intermittent explosive disorder may cause side effects (eg, sexual dysfunction due to
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/z/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">
          fluoxetine

         ) that necessitate lowering drug doses within the target dose range. Side effects and target dose ranges are discussed separately. (See

          'Pharmacotherapy'

        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with intermittent explosive disorder who cannot tolerate maintenance pharmacotherapy with the minimum target dose of the drug that induced remission, we suggest switching to another drug. The failed medication is tapered and discontinued over one to two weeks by the same amount for each dose decrease. (As an example,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/z/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">
          fluoxetine

         40 mg per day is decreased by 10 mg per day, every one to two days.) At the same time, the new drug is started and titrated up. The choice of the new drug depends upon which medications, if any, were unsuccessful during acute treatment. Medication options, doses, and side effects are discussed elsewhere in the topic. (See

         Patients who remit from intermittent explosive disorder should be interviewed regularly and monitored for recurrence of symptoms as well as medication side effects. Particular attention is given to explosive outbursts, including physical assaults, verbal threats of interpersonal violence, and destruction of property. Symptoms of intermittent explosive disorder are discussed separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Monitoring can be tapered for patients who remit and remain stable, with progressively longer intervals between assessments. As an example, a patient who is seen every two weeks at the time of remission can be seen every two weeks for one or two more visits, then every month for one to three visits, and then every two months for one to three visits. Continuously stable patients can ultimately be seen every three to six months. More frequent visits should be scheduled for patients who develop symptoms or side effects; monitoring acutely ill patients is discussed elsewhere in the topic. (See

         For patients who remit from intermittent explosive disorder, we suggest maintenance pharmacotherapy for at least two years, based upon clinical experience. However, the duration is not established, and some patients require treatment for many years. The duration depends upon clinical factors and is generally longer in patients with:

        <p>
         If the decision is made to discontinue maintenance pharmacotherapy for intermittent explosive disorder, we suggest slowly tapering the medication over one month to increase the probability of detecting incipient symptoms (eg, subthreshold incidents in which patients briefly scream) before full-blown explosive outbursts recur. Based upon clinical experience, we decrease the dose each week by approximately 25 percent of the dose used during maintenance treatment. As an example,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/z/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">
          fluoxetine

         40 mg per day is reduced by 10 mg per day each week until it is discontinued.
        </p>
        <p>
         If symptoms recur during the taper, the dose should be titrated back up to the full dose used initially to achieve remission. If full-blown explosive outbursts develop despite increasing the dose; the safety of the patient and others does not stabilize; and the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms do not substantially improve within 6 to 12 weeks of increasing the dose; the recurrence is treated as a new acute episode. Acute treatment is discussed above. (See

         If impulsive aggressive behavior recurs during maintenance pharmacotherapy and optimizing the dose does not control symptoms within 6 to 12 weeks, the recurrence is treated as a new acute episode. (See

         – Patients with intermittent explosive disorder are periodically unable to restrain impulses that result in verbal and physical aggression. The explosive outbursts are unplanned, have a rapid onset, grossly exceed the response that is justified by the precipitant, and cause marked subjective distress or psychosocial impairment. (See

          Acute treatment

         – For acute treatment of patients with intermittent explosive disorder, we suggest pharmacotherapy plus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) rather than pharmacotherapy alone or CBT alone (
