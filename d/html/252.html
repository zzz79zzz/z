Most hip pain is aggravated by weightbearing activity such as prolonged standing or walking, or more vigorous activity such as running. Clinicians should inquire about other medical history, medications (eg, glucocorticoids), and family history. Active systemic symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, and diffuse myalgia or bone pain, raise concern about a medical cause and warrant in-depth evaluation. Nocturnal pain in the absence of increased activity or lying on the affected side increases concern for systemic disease. Prior procedures or treatments for hip pain should be noted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H662905273"><span class="h1">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Below, the author provides an approach to the examination of the adult presenting with hip pain of unclear origin. Details pertaining to the performance of the musculoskeletal examination of the hip are provided separately. Depending upon the patient and the clinical scenario, it may be important to examine the abdomen, genitourinary system, low back, and/or lower extremity neurovascular function, in addition to the hip proper. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13805.html" rel="external">"Musculoskeletal examination of the hip and groin"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/290.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with nontraumatic abdominal or flank pain in the emergency department", section on 'Physical examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6862.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5262.html" rel="external">"Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Many common hip conditions stem from altered lower limb biomechanics, and many patients presenting with hip pain manifest an antalgic gait. Thus, it is important to begin the examination by observing the patient's gait and movement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113980.html" rel="external">"Clinical assessment of walking and running gait"</a>.)</p><p>Gait assessment should include observing the patient walking normally followed by having the patient walk on their heels and then on their toes to assess for distal limb weakness. Such weakness may indicate lumbar radiculopathy. A "waddling" or Trendelenburg gait may be indicative of hip joint pathology causing restricted joint motion (eg, osteoarthritis, osteonecrosis). Inability to bear weight may indicate a hip fracture or weakness from lumbar radiculopathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105723.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis", section on 'Hip'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/226.html" rel="external">"Overview of common hip fractures in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83171.html" rel="external">"Minor pelvic fractures (pelvic fragility fractures) in the older adult"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5262.html" rel="external">"Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Lateral pelvic instability is common in adult patients presenting with hip pain and may be contributory or a consequence of the underlying condition. Lateral pelvic instability causes exaggerated movement of the lateral hip structures (gluteus medius tendons, tensor fascia lata, and trochanteric bursa) over the lateral femur as well as compression of anterior and medial hip structures (hip joint, labrum, proximal adductor tendons). Having the patient stand on one leg or perform a partial single-leg squat may reveal such instability  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102338" href="/z/d/graphic/102338.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). In a positive Trendelenburg test  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67453" href="/z/d/graphic/67453.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), the healthy side of the pelvis sags, causing the waistline to appear tilted (ie, no longer parallel to the ground). This finding is likely due to gluteal muscle weakness. Other functional testing such as deep squatting or single-leg hopping causes severe pain with many hip and spine conditions and therefore has limited diagnostic use.</p><p>With the patient standing, assess active motion of the lumbar spine to determine whether particular movements elicit pain. Low back pain with lumbar flexion suggests disc pathology, while pain with lumbar extension suggests lumbar facet joint arthropathy (although these are by no means hard and fast rules). With the patient seated, the neural slump test (cervical flexion with unilateral knee extension  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef120201" href="/z/d/graphic/120201.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>)) can be performed to see if symptoms suggestive of lumbar radiculopathy are elicited. If these maneuvers fail to reproduce the patient's pain, hip pain referred from the lumbar spine is an unlikely cause of their symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7782.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of low back pain in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5262.html" rel="external">"Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>For the next portion of the examination, ask the patient to lie supine. Ask them to lift their buttocks off the bed and then relax. From this position, leg length discrepancy can be assessed. In older patients, a significant discrepancy (&gt;2 cm) may indicate osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis with joint collapse. A straight leg-raise maneuver may elicit lumbar nerve root irritability. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7782.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of low back pain in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Palpate the anterior hip joint for tenderness and other abnormalities. Tenderness may be caused by hip arthritis of any type, labral tear, or iliopsoas bursitis. Focal tenderness over a superior pubic ramus suggests fracture. Limited passive hip motion, particularly when compared with the contralateral hip, suggests hip joint pathology (most often osteoarthritis). Assessment using the flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FADIR;  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98467" href="/z/d/graphic/98467.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>)) and flexion, abduction, and external rotation (FABER/Patrick;  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98468" href="/z/d/graphic/98468.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>)) tests may reveal anterior hip impingement or posterior hip impingement, respectively. Anterior hip impingement is associated with labral tear, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, or osteoarthritis; posterior hip impingement is associated with osteoarthritis.</p><p>Hip internal and external rotation mobility can also be reduced by the loss of articular cartilage or growth of acetabular osteophytes from osteoarthritis or by pain and muscle spasm from acute synovitis. A normal 50-year-old averages 45 to 50 degrees of internal and external rotation. Osteoarthritis, acute synovitis, or septic arthritis may reduce this to as little as 5 to 10 degrees. Internal rotation is often affected first in osteoarthritis and may not be noticed by the patient.</p><p>Focal tenderness at the symphysis pubis and a positive adductor squeeze test in a patient with anterior hip pain of gradual onset and a history of overuse of the groin musculature suggests osteitis pubis.</p><p>Maneuvers to assess the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) include the hip posterior thrust test, Gaenslen test  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98474" href="/z/d/graphic/98474.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>), and lateral compression and distraction of the pelvis. These can be performed in patients with buttock or lower back pain in whom SIJ pathology is suspected [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>A neurovascular assessment can be performed at this stage of the examination. This may include sensory testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef120390" href="/z/d/graphic/120390.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), assessment of a Tinel sign for meralgia paresthetica, and palpation of arterial pulses and bruits. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5270.html" rel="external">"Meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment)"</a>.)</p><p>Next, ask the patient to lie onto their nonpainful hip in a side-lying position. This allows better assessment of lateral hip structures. Palpation at this region includes the origin of the gluteal tendons, the trochanteric bursa (located just cephalad of the greater femoral trochanter), and the mass of the gluteal muscles. Resisted hip abduction  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98477" href="/z/d/graphic/98477.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>) may reveal pain or weakness suggestive of gluteal tendon pathology (eg, gluteus medius or minimus tendinosis or tear), often associated with trochanteric bursitis. Sensory testing of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve can also be performed from this position.</p><p>With the patient prone, palpate the lumbar spine and SIJ as well as the hamstring origin at the ischial tuberosity. Resisted hip extension may reveal pain or weakness, which suggests gluteus maximus tendon pathology, possibly associated with trochanteric bursitis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1430315175"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2299029335"><span class="h2">Step one: Determine if pain is related to trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Even minor trauma (eg, fall from a chair) can cause a fracture of the hip or pelvis in a frail, older adult. These cases are generally obvious from the history and patient presentation. Patients who may have sustained major internal injury should be evaluated in the emergency department.</p><p>In the absence of a clear history of trauma, occult hip fractures (eg, nondisplaced pubic ramus or femoral neck fracture) may be difficult to diagnose but should be suspected in older adults or those with poor bone health (eg, osteoporosis). Examination reveals difficulty with weight-bearing, anterolateral hip tenderness with femoral neck fracture, and significant pain with passive hip motion, especially internal and external rotation. Plain radiographs of the hip may <strong>not</strong> reveal such a fracture; the patient must remain non-weightbearing if the diagnosis is suspected until computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or serial examination of the hip rules out the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/226.html" rel="external">"Overview of common hip fractures in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83171.html" rel="external">"Minor pelvic fractures (pelvic fragility fractures) in the older adult"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87285.html" rel="external">"Geriatric trauma: Initial evaluation and management", section on 'Musculoskeletal injuries of the pelvis, hip, and extremities'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13797.html" rel="external">"Femoral stress fractures in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H409972122"><span class="h2">Step two: Determine if a dangerous medical condition is the cause</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient's presentation and a careful history should suggest whether a dangerous medical cause of hip pain should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Dangerous, nontraumatic causes of hip pain include aortoiliac arterial insufficiency, septic arthritis, osteonecrosis, and tumor. If untreated, these causes may involve an underlying threat to life or result in destruction of the joint. When identified or suspected, any of these conditions requires immediate evaluation by the appropriate specialist.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aortoiliac arterial insufficiency</strong> can present with pain or claudication in the buttock, hip, and occasionally the thigh. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease are usually present. Patients often describe an achy pain that may be associated with weakness of the hip or thigh while walking.

In particular, passive hip adduction, resisted hip abduction  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98477" href="/z/d/graphic/98477.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>), and resisted external derotation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99222" href="/z/d/graphic/99222.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>) are likely to exacerbate the patient's symptoms. Hip mobility is generally unaffected, and passive motion of the joint is typically normal.

However, if the diagnosis remains unclear after a thorough history and examination (and possibly imaging) have largely ruled out important medical causes, it is worthwhile to consider musculoskeletal causes such as piriformis syndrome, Gilmore groin, snapping hip, and ligamentum teres tear. The diagnosis of musculoskeletal causes of hip pain is discussed in detail separately.

The pain history should include the following: site, onset, quality, time course, provocative and palliating factors, radiation, and associated symptoms. More focused questions may suggest an underlying etiology:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Trauma immediately preceding acute onset of pain</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pain onset related to activity of particular duration (eg, occurs only after walking a certain distance, possibly suggesting vascular insufficiency)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pain in multiple joints or associated with other discrete findings (eg, rash, gastrointestinal disturbances, eye findings) may suggest rheumatologic or other systemic disease</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pain associated with focal weakness or radiation may suggest radiculopathy or nerve entrapment</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pain caused by lying on affected hip at night may suggest musculoskeletal cause (see <a class="local">'History'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – In the text, the author provides an approach to the examination of the adult presenting with hip pain of unclear origin. Details about how to perform the musculoskeletal examination of the hip are provided separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13805.html" rel="external">"Musculoskeletal examination of the hip and groin"</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Depending upon the patient and the clinical scenario, it may be important to examine the abdomen, genitourinary system, low back, and/or lower extremity neurovascular function, in addition to the hip proper. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/290.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with nontraumatic abdominal or flank pain in the emergency department", section on 'Physical examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6862.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5262.html" rel="external">"Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic approach</strong> – Our approach to diagnosing hip pain in the adult consists of the following steps (see <a class="local">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a class="local">'Etiology'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Step one: Determine if pain is related to trauma. (See <a class="local">'Step one: Determine if pain is related to trauma'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Even minor trauma (eg, fall from a chair) can cause a fracture of the hip or pelvis in a frail, older adult. These cases are generally obvious from the history and patient presentation. In the absence of a clear history of trauma, occult hip fractures (eg, nondisplaced pubic ramus or femoral neck fracture) may be difficult to diagnose but should be suspected in older adults or those with poor bone health (eg, osteoporosis).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Step two: Determine if a dangerous medical condition is the cause. (See <a class="local">'Step two: Determine if a dangerous medical condition is the cause'</a> above and <a class="local">'Warning: Intraabdominal conditions can refer pain to the hip'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The patient's presentation and a careful history should suggest whether a dangerous medical cause of hip pain should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Dangerous, nontraumatic causes of hip pain include aortoiliac arterial insufficiency, septic arthritis, osteonecrosis, and tumor. Note that abdominal conditions such as inguinal hernia or appendicitis may refer pain to the anteromedial hip.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Step three: Determine if osteoarthritis or rheumatologic disease is a likely cause. (See <a class="local">'Step three: Determine if osteoarthritis or rheumatologic disease is a likely cause'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Osteoarthritis of the hip is relatively common and typically presents with pain of insidious onset that is felt deep in the anterior hip or groin, exacerbated by activity, and relieved by rest. Rising from a seated position often elicits hip pain. Both active and passive hip movements are painful; internal rotation tends to be reduced sooner and more profoundly than external rotation. Other potential causes of hip pain in this category include rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, and crystal arthropathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Step four: Determine if radiculopathy or nerve entrapment is a likely cause. (See <a class="local">'Step four: Determine if radiculopathy or nerve entrapment is a likely cause'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Compression of lumbosacral nerve roots or of peripheral nerves can manifest as hip pain. Nerve-related pain is often associated with paresthesias or an "electric" sensation and typically radiates along the course of the nerve.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Step five: Determine if pain is focal, suggesting a discrete musculoskeletal diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Step five: Determine if pain is focal, suggesting a discrete musculoskeletal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">At this step, the most likely diagnoses depend upon the pain's location (lateral, anterior, or posterior) and chronicity. Lateral hip pain is common and is nearly always localized to the region immediately superior to the greater trochanter, the site of the gluteal tendon insertions and trochanteric bursa. Anterior hip pain is often due to hip joint pathology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic testing</strong> – Laboratory testing is often unnecessary for determining the cause of hip pain but may be indicated if the history and examination raise suspicion for rheumatologic or other systemic disease. Diagnostic imaging should be used judiciously and is best reserved for patients with acute hip pain to exclude fracture or moderate to severe chronic hip pain, or as an initial assessment of hip osteoarthritis. Further imaging (typically magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may be required based upon the results of initial radiographs in combination with clinical findings or in cases of hip pain recalcitrant to treatment.
