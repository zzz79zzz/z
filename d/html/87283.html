         Mortality remains high for patients who experience rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), but it has dropped considerably in the past 20 years due to a variety of factors [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         The definition of AAA and aortic anatomy will be reviewed here together with an overview of the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, natural history, screening, clinical features and diagnosis, management, and surgical repair, with links to more detailed topics. Our recommendations for the care of the patient with AAA are consistent with those provided by the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines, which were updated in 2018 [

         Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common true arterial aneurysm. A true aneurysm is defined as a segmental, full-thickness dilation of a blood vessel that is 50 percent greater than the normal aortic diameter  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60682" href="/z/d/graphic/60682.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. False aneurysms of the abdominal aorta can also occur but are much less common and are usually due to a traumatic or infectious etiology.
        </p>
        <p>
         In most adults, an aortic diameter &gt;3.0 cm is generally considered aneurysmal. Normal aortic diameter varies with age, sex, and body habitus, but the average diameter of the adult human infrarenal aorta is approximately 2.0 cm; 95 percent of the adult population has an aortic diameter ≤3.0 cm [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Thus, for the majority of patients, an infrarenal aorta with a maximum diameter ≥3.0 cm is considered aneurysmal [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. For males, diameter alone defines the presence of an AAA and predicts clinical events. However, for females, although the aorta is still considered aneurysmal when its diameter exceeds 3.0 cm, the diameter is less predictive of clinical events. An aortic size index (ASI), calculated as diameter (cm)/body surface area (m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ), is more predictive of clinical events than the absolute aortic diameter in females [
         <a href="#rid6">

         </a>
         ].

         The abdominal aorta is a retroperitoneal structure that begins at the hiatus of the diaphragm and extends to its bifurcation into the right and left common iliac arteries at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The posterior abdominal peritoneum covers the abdominal aorta anteriorly and is reflected onto the posterolateral duodenum at its junction with the jejunum.
        </p>
        <p>
         The aorta lies slightly left of the midline to accommodate the inferior vena cava, which is adjacent to the aorta on its right. The branches of the aorta include (superior to inferior)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51087" href="/z/d/graphic/51087.html" rel="external">
          figure 4

         ) the left and right inferior phrenic arteries, left and right middle suprarenal arteries, celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, left and right renal arteries, left and right gonadal arteries, inferior mesenteric artery, left and right common iliac artery, middle sacral artery, and paired lumbar arteries (L1 to L4).
        </p>
        <p>
         The common iliac artery bifurcates into the external iliac and internal iliac arteries at the pelvic inlet  (

          figure 5
         </a>
         ). The internal iliac artery gives rise to anterior and posterior branches to the pelvic viscera and also supplies the musculature of the pelvis. The external iliac artery passes underneath the inguinal ligament to become the common femoral artery [

         The estimated prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in developed countries is between 2 and 8 percent and is higher in males (4 to 8 percent in those older than 50) compared with females (1 to 1.3 percent) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Based on screening, approximately 1,000,000 individuals in the United States have an AAA [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence of AAA increases with age in both males and females, although the age-related increase is more pronounced in males [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. Ultrasound screening studies have shown that 4 to 8 percent of older males have an occult AAA [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18-20
         </a>
         ]. Because the incidence of AAA rises sharply in individuals over 60 years of age, the future prevalence of AAA could increase substantially in association with the aging population. Other studies suggest that a reduction in the prevalence of smoking may have the opposite effect [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22

         In the 2010s, death from rupture of an AAA was estimated to occur in approximately 7000 patients per year in the United States. AAA-associated mortality has decreased by nearly 50 percent since the early 1990s. Although the specific reasons for this decline are unknown, the declining prevalence of cigarette smoking in the adult population, the increasing awareness and impact of government-sponsored screening programs for identifying early disease, and an increase in the use of endovascular repair of AAA, particularly in the older patients, all may have played a role in this decline [

         Aneurysmal degeneration of the abdominal aorta is a multifactorial, systemic process generally felt to be due to alterations in vascular wall biology leading to a loss of vascular structural proteins and wall strength. A common systemic etiology for large vessel (eg, aorta, femoral, iliac, popliteal) aneurysm formation is supported by the occurrence of multiple aneurysms in the same patient. Etiologic factors felt to be important in the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) include proteases, inflammatory mediators, and genetic factors. Biomechanical forces, including stresses across the arterial wall, are also felt to play a role. (See

         An understanding of the management of patients with an AAA requires knowledge of the natural history of this disorder. The natural history of AAA is one of progressive expansion, the rate of which is variable. AAAs expand, on average, at a rate of 0.3 to 0.4 cm per year [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24-28
         </a>
         ]. Expansion tends to be more rapid in smokers and less rapid in patients with diabetes mellitus or peripheral artery disease [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Some aneurysms, for unclear reasons, remain relatively fixed in size for a period of time but then undergo rapid expansion. (See

        <p>
         The likelihood that an aneurysm will rupture is increased for those with aneurysm diameter &gt;5.5 cm, a faster rate of expansion (&gt;0.5 cm over a six-month period), those who continue to smoke, and in females. In addition to these, other factors that increase the risk of rupture include recent surgery; medical factors such as uncontrolled hypertension, which may increase aortic wall stress; and, possibly, aneurysm contour [

          32

         <a href="#rid33">
          33-40
         </a>
         ]. Screening for AAA in males over age 65 results in a decreased risk of AAA-related mortality; however, for people with a low risk for AAA, any absolute benefit on overall mortality is likely to be small.

         We screen males ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked and suggest screening males aged 65 to 75 who have a first-degree relative who has been diagnosed with AAA. We offer screening to females who have a first-degree relative who has been diagnosed with AAA; screening is not otherwise indicated for females. The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) guidelines also suggest rescreening individuals at the 10-year time point if their original aortic diameter is between 2.5 and 3.0 cm [

         – Symptomatic AAA refers to any of a number of symptoms that can be attributed to the aneurysm. The development of symptoms may be a sign that AAA configuration is rapidly expanding, has become large enough to compress surrounding structures, or is an inflammatory or infectious aneurysm. Patients with symptomatic AAA most commonly present with abdominal, back, or flank pain, which may or may not be associated with AAA rupture. AAA can also present with other clinical manifestations, such as limb ischemia (acute or chronic), or other systemic manifestations (fever, malaise). In patients with abdominal pain, rupture of the aneurysm must be excluded. (See

          Symptomatic and ruptured
         </strong>
         – The clinical presentation of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is variable with respect to symptoms and time course. The patient may or may not be aware of the diagnosis of AAA prior to their clinical manifestations of rupture. Only 20 to 30 percent of patients who present to an emergency department with rupture have a known history of AAA [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,43

          44

         ]. Although the signs and symptoms of ruptured AAA may be obvious, some presentations make ruptured AAA difficult to recognize. Patients with rupture into the retroperitoneum may attribute their symptoms to other causes and delay seeking medical attention. Even after presenting to a physician, a misdiagnosis of ruptured AAA as renal colic, perforated viscus, diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and ischemic bowel occurs approximately 30 percent of the time [

         </span>
         A diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is established with imaging studies that demonstrate the aneurysm in the patient suspected of having AAA on the basis of risk factors or on physical examination. Physical examination can reliably diagnose a large AAA (&gt;5.5 cm), but the diagnosis is made using abdominal palpation in fewer than 50 percent of those with AAA. The physical examination should include a complete peripheral arterial vascular examination to assess for signs of thromboembolism or other peripheral aneurysms. (See

        <p>
         Laboratory studies are not routinely obtained as part of the evaluation of asymptomatic AAA. However, a white blood cell count, blood cultures, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate should be performed in patients with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss) to evaluate for an infectious cause of AAA or inflammatory aneurysm. For patients with ruptured AAA, routine laboratory studies, and type and crossmatch are obtained.

         AAA that is suspected based upon clinical symptoms or signs, or incidentally on nonvascular imaging studies (eg, spine magnetic resonance [MR] imaging), should be confirmed with definitive vascular imaging  (

          algorithm 1

         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Abdominal ultrasound is noninvasive and is ideal for serial imaging in patients with small- and medium-sized aneurysms who are being conservatively managed. However, ultrasound is technician dependent and has other limitations. (See

         Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are managed according to their diameter and the presence or absence of symptoms. Under most circumstances, patients with symptoms that cannot be definitively attributed to another etiology should be admitted for observation and further vascular evaluation. Asymptomatic aneurysms are evaluated on an outpatient basis, unless they are very large. (See

         – The hemodynamically unstable patient (persistent in spite of resuscitation) with known AAA who presents with classic symptoms/signs of rupture (hypotension, flank/back pain, pulsatile mass) should be taken emergently to the operating room for immediate control of hemorrhage, resuscitation, and repair of the aneurysm. Imaging confirmation of the presence of AAA in hemodynamically unstable patients suspected but not known to have the disease is ideal prior to intervention but is not required. Preoperative management of hemodynamically unstable patients, including the concept of "hypotensive hemostasis," is an area of active investigation. However, in most circumstances, volume resuscitation should be provided to the least amount necessary to maintain mentation and stabilize blood pressure and pulse rate.

         Both open and endovascular techniques can be successfully employed in the treatment of ruptured AAA. Endovascular repair of ruptured AAA may have some advantages over open repair; however, it is not universally available, and the selection of technique is best determined by the available surgical team. Open surgical or endovascular repair of ruptured AAA is accomplished in a manner that is similar to elective repair, with modifications for aortic hemorrhage control, and anticoagulation. Conversion rates from endovascular to open repair for rAAA may be higher compared with elective repair because of unanticipated anatomic features or device-related issues. (See

         Aneurysm repair is indicated for patients with symptoms (abdominal/back/flank pain, thromboembolism) that cannot unequivocally be attributed to another etiology, regardless of aneurysm diameter. For patients with symptomatic AAA, the first priority is to determine whether there is any immediate concern that the aneurysm has ruptured or is at high risk for impending rupture, which may be suggested by clinical symptoms or signs, or certain radiologic features (eg, broken calcification, asymmetry) that may indicate instability of the aneurysm. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15229.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of overt rupture, patients with AAA who are thought to be symptomatic or who have possible signs of impending rupture should be admitted for observation and further evaluation. If the patient is a candidate, repair should be accomplished during the same hospitalization. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15191.html" rel="external">
          "Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Emergency versus delayed repair of symptomatic aneurysm'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient is a candidate for repair, a determination needs to be made about whether an open surgical or endovascular approach is more appropriate, primarily based upon an anatomic assessment of aortoiliac anatomy. (See

         The management of asymptomatic AAA is based upon an assessment of the patient's risk for rupture, compared with the expected risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with repair [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. When the risk of rupture exceeds the risk of repair, repair is recommended. Conversely, if the risk of repair is greater than the risk of rupture, conservative management and surveillance is recommended. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15188.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The assessment of rupture risk depends primarily upon the diameter of the aneurysm at diagnosis and the patient's medical comorbidities. The annual risk of rupture has been found in randomized trials (discussed below) to be similar to, or lower than, the risk of repair in patients with small- or medium-sized aneurysms (&lt;5.5 cm in diameter) [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,54-57

         ]. This diameter threshold for AAA repair is not absolute and may depend on the patient's stature and location of the aneurysm.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other factors that need to be accounted for include the patient's age and sex, faster expansion rates, and the presence of other peripheral aneurysms. (See

         During the period of observation, ultrasound surveillance is routinely performed on a schedule that depends primarily upon the diameter of the aneurysm. We generally obtain annual ultrasound; however, a more frequent interval (eg, every six months) may be used depending upon other characteristics of the aneurysm or patient-related factors. Factors that influence the aneurysm surveillance interval are discussed separately. (See

         Aneurysm repair can be accomplished using open surgical or endovascular techniques. Endovascular aneurysm repair is associated with a lower risk of perioperative morbidity compared with open repair for asymptomatic, symptomatic, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Long-term mortality following elective AAA repair is not significantly different between the techniques. Guidelines from major medical and surgical societies recommend an individualized approach to the patient when choosing between open and endovascular repair, taking into account the patient's age, risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality, anatomic factors, and experience of the surgeon [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,58
         </a>
         ]. Given the need for lifelong surveillance with endovascular repair, younger patients with low operative risk may benefit more from open surgical repair, whereas older patients and those with high operative risk may benefit more from endovascular repair, provided their aortoiliac anatomy is appropriate.

         Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) involves the placement of modular graft components delivered via the iliac or femoral arteries to line the aorta  (

         ) and exclude the aneurysm sac from the circulation. EVAR requires fulfillment of specific anatomic criteria. With contemporary techniques, including custom-made fenestrated and branched devices, most patients can be considered candidates for EVAR in experienced endovascular centers. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15203.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Some anatomic features of the aorta or iliac arteries may preclude the ability to place an aortic endograft. Endovascular repair may not be anatomically feasible if the aortic neck is occupied by thrombus, there is circumferential calcification at the level of the aortic neck, or both iliac arteries are too small for the intended device. Endovascular repair of juxtarenal or suprarenal aortic aneurysm is not possible where advanced devices and technical expertise are not available. (See

         Multiple endovascular devices are commercially available for repair of AAA. Currently available endovascular grafts for infrarenal aortic repair share a bifurcated, modular design. Endografts are chosen to meet size criteria dictated by the size and configuration of the aneurysm. The anatomic measurements of interest include proximal neck length, aneurysm diameter, aortic neck angulation, iliac artery diameter, femoral artery diameter, and aortic length. Other considerations include whether there is flow in the inferior mesenteric artery and the location and number of accessory renal arteries. (See

          Abdominal aortic aneurysm
         </strong>
         – For most adults, an aortic diameter &gt;3.0 cm is generally considered aneurysmal. The most important risk factors for the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) include older age, male sex, cigarette smoking, positive family history, and the presence of other large artery aneurysms.

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – A definitive diagnosis requires abdominal imaging studies that demonstrate a focal, aortic dilation meeting the criteria for aneurysm (&gt;1.5 times normal diameter, or &gt;3.0 cm in the infrarenal segment). Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen are both highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing AAA but are recommended under differing clinical circumstances  (

         ) depending upon the presence of symptoms and the hemodynamic status of the patient. (See

         <strong>
          Screening for AAA
         </strong>
         – We screen males ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked and suggest screening males aged 65 to 75 who have a first-degree relative who has been diagnosed with AAA. We offer screening to females who have a first-degree relative who has been diagnosed with AAA; screening is not otherwise indicated for females. For those in whom an aortic diameter between 2.5 and 3.0 cm was identified, society guidelines also suggest rescreening individuals at 10 years. Screening for other subsets should be individualized.

         <strong>
          Clinical presentations
         </strong>
         – AAA does not typically cause symptoms unless the aneurysm is expanding rapidly, has become large enough to compress surrounding structures, is associated with inflammation (inflammatory aneurysm, infected aneurysm), or has ruptured. Patients with symptomatic AAA most commonly present with abdominal, back, or flank pain. The classic presentation of severe pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients with ruptured AAA. AAA can also present with other clinical manifestations such as limb ischemia (acute or chronic), or systemic manifestations, such as fever or malaise, that may indicate an inflammatory or infectious aneurysm.

         For most patients with asymptomatic infrarenal AAA &lt;5.5 cm, we recommend conservative management (watchful waiting) rather than elective AAA repair. The risk of aneurysm rupture does not exceed the risk of repair until the aneurysm diameter reaches 5.5 cm. Other factors taken into consideration include the patient's age and sex, expansion rate, and the presence of other peripheral aneurysms. For patients under observation, we generally obtain annual ultrasound; however, a more frequent interval (eg, every six months) may be used depending upon the characteristics of the aneurysm, or other factors.

          Repair techniques
         </strong>
         – Aneurysm repair can be accomplished using open surgical or endovascular techniques. The choice between open and endovascular AAA repair should be individualized, taking into account the patient's age, risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality, anatomic factors, and the experience of the surgeon. Endovascular aneurysm repair is associated with a lower risk of perioperative morbidity compared with open repair for asymptomatic, symptomatic, and ruptured AAA. Long-term mortality following elective AAA repair is not significantly different between the techniques. (See
