Some adults with CHD require surgical correction due either to development of criteria for repair, failure to detect a lesion in childhood, or lack of resources for repair earlier in life. Also, adults with known CHD who had surgical procedures during infancy and childhood often require reoperation for management of residual lesions after a previous definitive repair or further palliation after previous palliative surgery.</p><p>This topic reviews specific considerations in the anesthetic management for adults with selected CHD defects requiring primary cardiac surgical repair or reoperation. General management of anesthesia for adults requiring cardiac surgical repair of CHD defects is discussed in a separate topic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114421.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for surgical repair of congenital heart defects in adults: General management"</a>.)</p><p>Other topics address anesthetic management for noncardiac surgery or for labor and delivery, in adult patients with repaired or unrepaired CHD.

With left-to-right shunting, some oxygenated blood returns to the lungs instead of being pumped to the systemic circulation; thus, the ratio of pulmonary-to-systemic flow (Qp:Qs) is &gt;1:1 and, in severe cases &gt;3:1. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) may develop in adults with these defects due to a long-standing excess pulmonary blood flow, and may be further exacerbated by concurrent conditions such as lung disease, left heart dysfunction, or obstructive sleep apnea. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105507.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension with congenital heart disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Atrial septal defects</strong>  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106" href="/z/d/graphic/52106.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) – ASD types include the secundum type, primum type (nearly always associated with atrioventricular [AV] valve abnormalities), sinus venosus defect (most associated with anomalous pulmonary venous return), and unroofed coronary sinus (the rarest type). Physiologically, flow across an ASD occurs in both systole and diastole, and the direction of flow in diastole depends on the atrial pressure difference, which is related to the relative compliance of each ventricle. Such increased pulmonary blood flow results in right ventricular (RV) volume overload and possible, though uncommon, development of progressive pulmonary vascular obstructive disease and PH, which may cause right heart failure (HF). An ASD may come to clinical attention in adulthood due to symptoms of dyspnea caused by an increase in left-to-right shunting with increased pulmonary blood flow as the left ventricle (LV) becomes less compliant with age [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. As the atria enlarge, a previously asymptomatic ASD may come to clinical attention after onset of an atrial arrhythmia or after a stroke caused by paradoxical embolism across the ASD [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1418.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrial septal defects in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ventricular septal defects</strong>  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef127961" href="/z/d/graphic/127961.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) – VSD types include infundibular VSD (type 1), membranous VSD (type 2), inlet VSD (type 3), muscular VSD (type 4), and Gerbode defect (the least common type, which causes an LV to right atrial shunt). Most shunting across a VSD occurs in systole, with the volume of shunted blood determined by the size of the defect and, in the absence of RV outflow obstruction, the relative resistances in the pulmonary and systemic arterial circulations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13602.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ventricular septal defect in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In adults with uncorrected VSD, the spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from small restrictive VSDs that generally remain asymptomatic and rarely require closure, to moderately restrictive defects that may cause symptoms of LV volume overload or PH, to large nonrestrictive VSDs that generally cause progressive PH. An uncorrected VSD may come to clinical attention when left atrial and pulmonary venous congestion cause symptoms of dyspnea as the LV becomes less compliant with aging and is no longer able to accommodate the volume load of the shunt. In some cases, a VSD is diagnosed in adulthood when aortic regurgitation develops due to aortic cusp prolapse into an infundibular or membranous VSD, or when infective endocarditis is diagnosed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patent ductus arteriosus</strong> – The ductus arteriosus connects the aorta and the pulmonary artery (PA) and occasionally remains patent into adulthood. As with a VSD, the volume of shunted blood across a PDA depends on the size of the connection and the relative resistances in the pulmonary and systemic circulations. The PDA generally places a volume load on the LV, as blood from the aorta returns to the PA and eventually to the left atrium and LV, resulting in left heart enlargement, and sometimes result in elevated pulmonary pressures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1421.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in term infants, children, and adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2382826860"><span class="h3">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The anesthetic management of surgical repair of congenital defects causing left-to-right shunts is discussed here. Further discussion regarding surgical repair of an ASD, VSD, or PDA is available in other topics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95760.html" rel="external">"Surgical and percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects in adults", section on 'Surgical closure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116253.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of congenital ventricular septal defect in adults", section on 'VSD closure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5771.html" rel="external">"Management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in term infants, children, and adults", section on 'Surgical ligation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prebypass management</strong> – A midline sternotomy is most often used for open cardiac surgical repair of an ASD or VSD. A PDA is generally closed percutaneously; rarely, it may be closed via left thoracotomy or sternotomy. Minimally invasive and robot-assisted approaches have become increasingly common for selected procedures, with demonstrated safety and efficacy [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. These newer approaches have implications for anesthetic management. In particular, use of lung isolation and one lung ventilation can increase pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hemodynamic management goals for left-to-right shunt lesions are noted in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126171" href="/z/d/graphic/126171.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In particular, a normal to slightly low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is maintained to minimize left-to-right shunting. However, vasodilation with very low SVR is avoided in patients with a PDA, as this may result in diastolic run-off that compromises coronary perfusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Also, a normal to slightly high PVR is maintained to minimize left-to-right shunting. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) concentration is set at 21 percent (or the lowest concentration that produces near-normal oxygen saturations), and mild hypoventilation is employed to maintain partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) at 40 to 45 mmHg, thereby avoiding low PVR that may exacerbate left-to-right shunting. Hyperoxia and hyperventilation are avoided.<strong> </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postbypass management</strong> – Pulmonary hypertension, ventricular dysfunction, and/or arrhythmias may be observed during attempts to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or in the postbypass period. After closure of a defect causing a left-to-right shunt, patients with long-standing increased pulmonary blood flow and PH are at risk for<em> </em>LV failure. This occurs because the affected ventricle loses its original "pop-off" into a circulation with lower vascular resistance, and may not be able to accommodate a normal ventricular volume [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In most cases, an intravenous inotrope infusion (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>) is administered to treat LV or RV dysfunction and achieve separation from CPB and postbypass hemodynamic stability  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119747" href="/z/d/graphic/119747.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9652" href="/z/d/drug information/9652.html" rel="external">Milrinone</a> may also be administered if the patient has RV dysfunction with significant PH. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115472.html" rel="external">"Intraoperative problems after cardiopulmonary bypass", section on 'Left ventricular dysfunction'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115472.html" rel="external">"Intraoperative problems after cardiopulmonary bypass", section on 'Right ventricular dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Arrhythmias, most commonly supraventricular tachycardias, are promptly treated with the appropriate pharmacologic agents. Beta blocker therapy started prior to or immediately after surgery may reduce the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Temporary AV pacing is often necessary to manage bradycardia or complete heart block. Management of these perioperative arrhythmias is discussed in other topics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115472.html" rel="external">"Intraoperative problems after cardiopulmonary bypass", section on 'Arrhythmias'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95760.html" rel="external">"Surgical and percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects in adults", section on 'Perioperative management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116253.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of congenital ventricular septal defect in adults", section on 'Postoperative course'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1011.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery", section on 'Beta blockers'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1179859453"><span class="h2">Coarctation of the aorta</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H423685686"><span class="h3">Lesion and clinical manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aortic coarctation is a narrowing in the lumen of the aorta usually located at or just distal to the insertion of the ductus arteriosus  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88837" href="/z/d/graphic/88837.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Aortic coarctation is associated with long-term cardiovascular sequelae even after repair, particularly hypertension and associated cardiovascular risk (including coronary artery disease, stroke, and HF), as well as risks for development of recoarctation, intracranial aneurysms, and aortic disease (aneurysm, dissection, and rupture) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Presentation in adulthood depends on the degree of aortic obstruction and the extent of collateral blood flow (which may delay symptoms and diagnosis). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5760.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5784.html" rel="external">"Management of coarctation of the aorta", section on 'Long-term cardiovascular complications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3977696346"><span class="h3">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anesthetic management during the intraoperative and early postoperative periods are discussed here. Further discussion regarding initial surgical management of coarctation, recoarctation, and associated aortic complications is available in another topic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5784.html" rel="external">"Management of coarctation of the aorta"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prebypass</strong> <strong>management</strong> – Blood pressure (BP) is typically monitored in both upper and lower extremities in patients with aortic coarctation since hypertension is usually present in the arm(s) while BP in the legs is reduced. Depending on specific coarctation and subclavian arterial anatomy, diminished BP can occur in one or both upper extremities. Preoperative arterial line placement is planned based on the patient's anatomic features. Generally, an intra-arterial catheter for continuous BP monitoring is inserted in an upper extremity before induction of general anesthesia, and a noninvasive BP cuff is positioned on a lower extremity. For patients with severe coarctation, we insert a second intra-arterial catheter in a lower extremity (typically the femoral artery). Key goals for hemodynamic management of patients with coarctation of the aorta are noted in the tabl<em>e</em>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126171" href="/z/d/graphic/126171.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cardiac surgical repair is often accomplished via left thoracotomy; rarely, median sternotomy may be required for long segments of coarctation and in those patients who have concomitant cardiac disease that requires intervention (eg, aortic valve disease, ascending aorta aneurysm, coronary artery disease). Median sternotomy with CPB is employed if an extended aortic cross-clamp time is anticipated, or if the cross-clamp is likely to compromise collateral flow [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. If lower extremity BP decreases to &lt;50 mmHg upon initial placement of the aortic cross-clamp, CPB will probably be necessary [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Other surgical and anesthetic considerations include the need to minimize the aortic cross-clamp time, avoid hemorrhage, and avoid or promptly treat hypotension to minimize risk for postoperative complications, particularly paraplegia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Notably, patients with extensive collateral vasculature are at risk for vessel rupture and hemorrhage. In particular, those with aortic friability or presence of an aortic aneurysm have increased risk for intraoperative aortic dissection or rupture [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Similar to intraoperative management of other thoracic aortic disease, moderate hypertension may be tolerated while the aorta is cross-clamped to ensure adequate perfusion distal to the clamp. Also, mild hypothermia (34 to 35°C) is typically maintained during aortic cross-clamping and continuing into the immediate post-repair period to lessen the risk of paraplegia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94266.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for open descending thoracic aortic surgery", section on 'Review of the surgical plan'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postbypass management</strong> – In the immediate postoperative period, some patients develop paradoxical hypertension after coarctation repair, typically managed with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9697" href="/z/d/drug information/9697.html" rel="external">nicardipine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9420" href="/z/d/drug information/9420.html" rel="external">esmolol</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">nitroglycerin</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9707" href="/z/d/drug information/9707.html" rel="external">nitroprusside</a>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119750" href="/z/d/graphic/119750.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

In some, noninvasive ventilatory (NIV) support with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygenation or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) may be sufficient for recovery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>After transcatheter pulmonic valve implantation </strong>–<strong> </strong>As noted above, there are limited data on use of transcatheter pulmonic valve implantation for native pulmonic regurgitation. If performed, the position and integrity of the replaced pulmonic valve are checked using fluoroscopy and/or intracardiac, transesophageal, or transthoracic echo after deployment. Although large paravalvular leaks are rare, the valve can be balloon dilated or rarely a second valve-in-valve can be deployed to treat this problem.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Extubation of the trachea can typically be accomplished at the end of a transcatheter procedure, after heparin neutralization and ensuring hemostasis [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

For example, development of conduit valve stenosis or regurgitation may result in RV dilation and dysfunction, arrhythmias, or sudden death [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Some patients are candidates for a transcatheter procedure such as pulmonic valve replacement, thereby avoiding the need for redo sternotomy. However, other patients require open cardiac surgical intervention due to anatomy that is not favorable for a transcatheter procedure, or the presence of other cardiac abnormalities that require repair or coronary anatomy that predisposes to complications such as coronary compression.</p><p>Anesthetic considerations are similar to those for pulmonic valve replacement after other types of previous cardiac surgical procedures.

Most adults with CHD presenting for tricuspid valve repair or replacement have had previous heart surgery. In particular, patients with Ebstein anomaly may require reoperation for recurrent tricuspid valve disease or to address associated cardiac defects [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].

The Mustard operation redirects systemic and pulmonary venous blood using a pericardial baffle, while the Senning procedure uses the atrial septum and wall as a baffle  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50524" href="/z/d/graphic/50524.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15851.html" rel="external">"D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA): Management and outcome", section on 'Mustard and Senning procedures'</a>). Complications typically develop following these atrial switch procedures including systemic ventricular failure (which is failure of the anatomic RV), arrhythmias, baffle obstruction, and baffle leaks. Reoperation in adulthood may be required for baffle revision for obstruction or leak, systemic atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation, and rarely for LV outflow tract obstruction.

Complications after arterial switch operation may include pulmonary artery stenosis (at the site of previous anastomosis), RV outflow obstruction, coronary artery stenosis, or neo-aortic root dilation with neo-aortic regurgitation. A catheter-based dilation with stent placement may be possible for a patient with pulmonary artery stenosis at the site of the anastomosis, thereby avoiding the need for redo sternotomy. However, selected patients may require open surgical reoperation to treat coronary lesions, RV outflow obstruction, or, in rare cases, neo-aortic regurgitation [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Furthermore, regurgitation of the tricuspid valve may necessitate its repair or replacement. In addition, placement or revision of a pacemaker is often needed.
