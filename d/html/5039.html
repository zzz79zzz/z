Although the effects of inadequate perfusion are reversible initially, prolonged hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia can disrupt critical biochemical processes, which if not addressed result in cell death, end-organ failure, and, possibly, death.</p><p>The classification and underlying mechanisms of neonatal shock are the same as those seen in pediatric and adult shock. However, the etiology, clinical manifestations, and initial management of neonatal shock differ somewhat from shock in other populations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6396.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of shock in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1594.html" rel="external">"Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The etiology, clinical presentation, and evaluation of neonatal shock will be reviewed here. Management of neonatal shock is discussed separately.

It is manifested by physical findings of tissue hypoperfusion (eg, cold extremities, acrocyanosis, and poor capillary refill), hypotension, and metabolic acidosis. Shock is often initially reversible, but must be recognized and treated immediately to prevent progression to irreversible organ dysfunction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is important to recognize that hypotension, which is commonly used to define shock states in adults, is generally a late finding of shock in neonates.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypotension</strong> – In older infants and children, hypotension<strong> </strong>is commonly defined by a numeric threshold such as blood pressure (BP) below the 5<sup>th </sup>percentile for age. However, characterizing a neonate's BP as "normal" or "abnormally low" using a numerical definition is challenging because BP values vary considerably depending on birth weight, gestational age, and postnatal age  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110007" href="/d/graphic/110007.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110015" href="/d/graphic/110015.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). For these reasons, low BP should not be the sole criteria for therapeutic intervention (see <a class="local">'Vital signs abnormalities'</a> below). In addition, extremely preterm (EPT) infants may maintain adequate perfusion despite numerically low BP values. The definition of hypotension (low blood pressure) in EPT infants is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109813.html" rel="external">"Assessment and management of low blood pressure in extremely preterm infants", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2890976981"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Shock, a state of cellular and tissue hypoxia, is due to reduced oxygen delivery, increased oxygen consumption, and/or inadequate oxygen utilization [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Cellular hypoxia results in a switch to anaerobic metabolism and accumulation of lactic acid. Increasing levels of lactic acid causes metabolic acidosis, which interferes with cell and organ function and, if not addressed, cell death. Tissue hypoperfusion also leads to endothelial dysfunction, stimulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cascades, and activation of local humoral processes that disrupt the microcirculation, resulting in further tissue injury. If untreated, these processes result in circulatory collapse, major organ failure, and death.</p><p>Shock is classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypovolemic (see <a class="local">'Hypovolemic shock'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Distributive (see <a class="local">'Distributive shock'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cardiogenic (see <a class="local">'Cardiogenic shock'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obstructive (see <a class="local">'Obstructive shock'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multifactorial (see <a class="local">'Multifactorial shock'</a> below)</p><p></p><p>When the underlying mechanism is unclear or unknown, the term "undifferentiated shock" is used.</p><p>The pathophysiology of shock is discussed in greater detail separately.

However, these processes are not mutually exclusive, and neonates with circulatory failure may have a combination of more than one form of shock (multifactorial shock).

The following are causes of neonatal distributive shock:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sepsis – In neonates, sepsis is the most common cause of distributive shock. Sepsis releases vasoactive mediators that depress autonomic nervous system regulation of the systemic circulations resulting in diffuse vasodilation and impaired perfusion. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs and the impact of altered autonomic nervous system function are different in septic newborn infants compared with older patients. Sepsis may also cause myocardial dysfunction (cardiogenic shock). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1597.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of sepsis", section on 'Circulation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5043.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of sepsis in term and late preterm neonates"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection – The mechanisms underlying shock in neonates with disseminated HSV infection are similar to those seen in bacterial sepsis. Disseminated HSV infection should be suspected in infants with a sepsis-like illness with a maternal history of genital herpes lesions. However, most neonates with HSV infection are born to asymptomatic women with no known history of HSV infection. Evaluation and treatment of neonatal HSV is discussed in greater detail separately.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5935.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Selection of blood products", section on 'Newborns and young infants'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5041.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the neonate", section on 'Acute blood loss'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chest radiograph</strong> – Chest radiography can be useful for neonates with respiratory distress or an abnormal cardiopulmonary examination. An abnormal chest radiograph may indicate pulmonary disease (eg, tension pneumothorax, pneumonia) or may suggest a cardiac abnormality (eg, cardiomegaly, abnormal pulmonary vascular markings, pulmonary venous congestion).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1233277277"><span class="h3">Additional selective testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Additional testing, which is based upon the findings of the initial evaluation and the infant's response to initial interventions (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126605.html" rel="external">"Neonatal shock: Management", section on 'Interventions for suspected etiologies'</a>) may include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Echocardiography</strong> – Echocardiography should be performed if there is suspicion for a cardiac etiology of shock. Cardiac disease may be suspected on the basis of any of the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Physical findings (eg, murmur, gallop, weak or absent femoral pulses)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cyanosis that does not improve with administration of 100 percent oxygen</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Differential in pre- and postductal oxygen saturation</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Clinical deterioration with fluid administration</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Abnormal electrocardiogram</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Abnormal chest radiograph (eg, cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Consultation with a pediatric cardiologist is suggested if a cardiac etiology is suspected. Echocardiography provides detailed assessment of the cardiac anatomy, and it is the test of choice for diagnosing congenital heart disease (CHD). In addition, it provides an assessment of cardiac function and it can identify other potential etiologies of shock (eg, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, tamponade). Thus, it is reasonable to perform echocardiography in infants with persistent or severe shock even in the absence of the above findings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5785.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn", section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</strong> – ECG should be performed if an abnormal rhythm is noted on examination or cardiac monitoring or if CHD is suspected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5785.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn", section on 'Electrocardiogram'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abdominal imaging</strong> – Abdominal radiographs may be useful in the evaluation of infants with a suspected abdominal source for sepsis or shock (eg, necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC] or volvulus). Abdominal ultrasonography can be used to detect bleeding into the abdomen or kidney. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5019.html" rel="external">"Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Radiologic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Head ultrasonography (HUS)</strong> – HUS is appropriate to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage, which may be suspected based on clinical findings (eg, abnormal neurologic examination) or because of evidence of acute blood loss without a clear source. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5051.html" rel="external">"Germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the newborn: Risk factors, clinical features, screening, and diagnosis", section on 'Cranial ultrasound'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lumbar puncture (LP)</strong> – LP is a routine part of the evaluation for suspected bacterial sepsis in neonates and for suspected herpes simplex virus infection. However, many neonates with shock are too unstable to safely undergo LP, and therefore this testing is often deferred until the neonate is clinically stable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5043.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of sepsis in term and late preterm neonates", section on 'Lumbar puncture'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Kleihauer-Betke assay</strong> – The Kleihauer-Betke assay is a method for quantifying fetal cells in maternal blood. A positive test is indicative of fetomaternal hemorrhage, which may be a cause for hypovolemic shock [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6806.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous massive fetomaternal hemorrhage", section on 'Kleihauer-Betke assay'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3607747711"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Shock is a dynamic and unstable pathophysiologic state characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion due to reduced oxygen delivery and/or increased oxygen consumption or inadequate oxygen utilization.
