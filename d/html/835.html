         Hypophosphatemia is defined as a serum phosphorus concentration that is below the age-appropriate normal range (eg, less than 2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L] in adults). Hypophosphatemia can be induced by decreased net intestinal absorption, increased urinary phosphate excretion, or acute movement of extracellular phosphate into cells.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the evaluation and treatment of patients with hypophosphatemia. The causes of hypophosphatemia and clinical manifestations of phosphate depletion are discussed separately:

         The evaluation of hypophosphatemia begins by excluding spurious hypophosphatemia (pseudohypophosphatemia). Patients with true hypophosphatemia should be evaluated by history and laboratory testing to identify the underlying cause. If the cause is not apparent, measurement of urinary phosphate excretion can be helpful to distinguish between gastrointestinal and renal phosphate losses.

         Spurious hypophosphatemia (pseudohypophosphatemia) may occur in certain clinical settings and should be excluded to avoid unnecessary testing and treatment of hypophosphatemia. It is usually caused by paraproteins (eg, in patients with multiple myeloma or other monoclonal gammopathies) or medications (eg, liposomal amphotericin, large doses of intravenous [IV]

         We repeat the serum phosphorus concentration to determine if the hypophosphatemia is persistent. Transient hypophosphatemia (eg, due to redistribution of phosphate) usually resolves within 6 to 12 hours as long as the underlying cause is corrected. No further evaluation of hypophosphatemia is required if the hypophosphatemia has resolved and there are no worrisome clinical findings. (See

         If the cause of hypophosphatemia is still not apparent from the history and initial laboratory testing, measurement of urinary phosphate excretion can be helpful to distinguish between gastrointestinal and renal phosphate losses. The normal kidney response to phosphate depletion is to increase phosphate reabsorption, leading to the
         <strong>
          virtual abolition

         of phosphate excretion in the urine.

        <p>
         Phosphate excretion can be measured either from a 24-hour urine collection or by calculation of the fractional excretion of filtered phosphate (FEPO4) from a random urine specimen.

        <p>
         The formula used to calculate the FEPO4 (

         A 24-hour urine phosphate excretion less than 100 mg or a FEPO4 less than 5 percent indicates appropriately low renal phosphate excretion, suggesting that the hypophosphatemia is caused by internal redistribution (eg, refeeding syndrome, acute respiratory alkalosis) or decreased intestinal absorption (eg, chronic antacid therapy, steatorrhea).

         A 24-hour urine phosphate excretion greater than or equal to 100 mg or a FEPO4 greater than or equal to 5 percent indicates renal phosphate wasting, suggesting that the hypophosphatemia is caused by excess production of phosphaturic hormones (eg, hyperparathyroidism, increased circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF23]) or a variety of other conditions.

         Urinary phosphate measurements are most reliable for assessing inappropriate urinary phosphate excretion in the absence of active phosphate repletion. Thus, it is best for the measurement to be performed prior to initiating supplementation. If phosphate supplementation has been initiated, we typically pause supplementation for at least 24 hours prior to urine collection for phosphate quantification and measure serum phosphorus at the time of the urine collection.

         The normal kidney response to hypophosphatemia is to reduce daily phosphate excretion below 100 mg and the FEPO4 to well below 5 percent (the normal FEPO4 is 5 to 20 percent). If the kidney response is normal, then renal phosphate wasting is not the cause of the hypophosphatemia. A review of the basic aspects of renal phosphate handling is presented separately. (See

         Hypophosphatemia in patients with an appropriately low urinary FEPO4 (or 24-hour urinary phosphate excretion) is usually caused by either increased cellular uptake (internal redistribution) and/or reduced intestinal phosphate absorption  (

         Increased cell entry may be generated by glucose and/or insulin infusions (as in a refeeding state or during the treatment of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) or as a result of acute respiratory alkalosis (as in patients with hyperventilation). (See

         Urinary phosphate excretion above 100 mg/day or a FEPO4 above 5 percent is indicative of renal phosphate wasting in patients with hypophosphatemia. This is usually due to hyperparathyroidism, increased activity of phosphatonins such as FGF23, or generalized proximal tubule dysfunction. All of these conditions reduce renal tubule phosphate absorption by diminishing the activity of the sodium-phosphate cotransporters (NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc) in the proximal tubule  (

         – Proximal tubule dysfunction is suggested by the presence of other abnormalities in proximal reabsorption, including glucosuria (at a normal plasma glucose concentration), hypouricemia, aminoaciduria, and a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to urinary bicarbonate wasting. Thus, we assess the patient for generalized proximal tubule dysfunction by measuring urinary levels of glucose, protein, and amino acids, as well as serum levels of bicarbonate and uric acid. The major causes of the Fanconi syndrome are cystinosis, Wilson disease, multiple myeloma (in which filtered light chains are toxic to the proximal tubule), heavy metal toxicity, and medications (particularly nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors [such as tenofovir] and

          Hyperparathyroidism
         </strong>
         – Hypophosphatemia can be seen with either primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism. The triad of hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and urinary phosphate wasting is often present in primary hyperparathyroidism. By contrast, hypocalcemia is a major stimulus for hypersecretion of PTH in secondary disease. Hypophosphatemia and urinary phosphate wasting in a patient without hypercalcemia should prompt an evaluation for vitamin D deficiency. The evaluation and diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is discussed in detail separately. (See

          Phosphatonin-mediated hypophosphatemia
         </strong>
         – Increased circulating concentrations of FGF23 (or other less characterized phosphatonins) can result in isolated phosphaturia with no other obvious defects in kidney tubular function. In patients with FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia, the serum concentrations of PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D are usually normal. However, the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level is low or inappropriately normal due to suppression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity by FGF23.

         Our approach to phosphate repletion takes into account the serum phosphorus concentration, the presence of overt symptoms of hypophosphatemia, and whether the patient can take oral therapy.

However, in patients who are unable to take or tolerate oral phosphate supplementation and in patients with extremely low serum phosphorus levels, especially those with symptomatic hypophosphatemia, IV repletion is reasonable.

         The primary concern with chronic phosphate therapy is an increased risk for extraskeletal mineral deposition, particularly in the kidney. In patients with chronic phosphaturia, long-term administration of phosphate supplements can increase the risk for nephrocalcinosis and presumably contribute to a gradual loss of kidney function [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. Individuals receiving chronic phosphate supplementation should undergo periodic measurement of serum phosphorus and creatinine to monitor phosphate balance and kidney function, as well as intermittent kidney ultrasound to assess for the development of nephrocalcinosis.

         Patients with alcohol use disorder are prone to severe hypophosphatemia, particularly when admitted to the hospital. However, the fall in serum phosphorus, occasionally to less than 1 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L), may not become prominent until 12 to 36 hours after admission, due to movement of extracellular phosphate into cells [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         ]. Thus, serial monitoring of the serum phosphorus concentration is warranted when patients with alcohol use disorder are admitted to the hospital. (See

          Avoidance of dextrose-containing fluids

         – As mentioned above, hypophosphatemia in patients with alcohol use disorder often occurs or is exacerbated after admission to the hospital due to phosphate movement from the extracellular fluid into cells.

         Hypophosphatemia is extremely common in patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) using dialysate and replacement solutions that lack phosphate supplementation. Such patients will often require intermittent therapy with IV phosphate solutions, and we generally follow an IV phosphate repletion strategy as outlined above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Intravenous dosing'
         </a>
         above). These patients will continue to develop recurrent hypophosphatemia while they are requiring CKRT; thus, serial phosphorus measurements are necessary in this population. An alternative strategy for CKRT-mediated hypophosphatemia is to change the dialysate and/or replacement solutions to phosphate-containing formulations. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113966.html" rel="external">

         While hypophosphatemia is less common in patients receiving intermittent dialysis therapies, it may still be observed in this population. This is particularly the case in individuals undergoing chronic dialysis therapy in the setting of concurrent malnutrition, aggressive phosphate binder therapy, intestinal phosphate losses (eg, chronic diarrhea or ostomy), or individuals with significant residual urine output.

          General principles
         </strong>
         – Hypophosphatemia is defined as a serum phosphorus concentration that is below the age-appropriate normal range (eg, less than 2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L] in adults). Hypophosphatemia can be induced by decreased net intestinal absorption, increased urinary phosphate excretion, or acute movement of extracellular phosphate into cells. (See

         – Spurious hypophosphatemia (pseudohypophosphatemia) may occur in certain clinical settings (eg, paraproteins or medications that interfere with the phosphate assay) and should be excluded to avoid unnecessary testing and inappropriate treatment of hypophosphatemia. (See

          History and initial laboratory testing
         </strong>
         – Patients with true hypophosphatemia should be evaluated to identify the underlying cause, which is usually apparent from the history  (

          table 1

         ). In patients with unexplained persistent hypophosphatemia, we review the patient's medications to assess for drugs that can cause hypophosphatemia  (

          Assess urinary phosphate excretion
         </strong>
         – If the cause of hypophosphatemia is still not apparent, we measure urinary phosphate excretion to identify excess renal phosphate excretion. Phosphate excretion can be assessed with either a quantitative timed urine collection or by calculation of the fractional excretion of filtered phosphate (FEPO4) from a random urine specimen.

         A 24-hour urine phosphate excretion less than 100 mg or a FEPO4 less than 5 percent indicates appropriately low renal phosphate excretion, suggesting that the hypophosphatemia is caused by internal redistribution (eg, refeeding syndrome, acute respiratory alkalosis) or decreased intestinal absorption (eg, chronic antacid therapy, steatorrhea).

          Treatment
         </strong>
         – Treatment of the underlying cause of hypophosphatemia is sufficient to resolve the hypophosphatemia in many cases. For patients with hypophosphatemia and a serum phosphorus less than 2 mg/dL (0.64 mmol/L), we suggest phosphate repletion (
