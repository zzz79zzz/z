However, the upper limit of normal in preterm infants and young infants may be as high as 6.5 mEq/L (mmol/L). Although children are less likely to develop hyperkalemia compared with adults, pediatric hyperkalemia is not an uncommon occurrence. Severe hyperkalemia (potassium level ≥7 mEq/L [mmol/L]) is a serious medical problem that requires immediate attention.</p><p>The management of hyperkalemia in children is reviewed here.

As therapy is initiated, it is important to confirm that the child is hyperkalemic, especially if the clinical setting makes the diagnosis of hyperkalemia unlikely. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained in children with potassium &gt;6 mEq/L (mmol/L) who are otherwise healthy or in whom there is a suspected rapid rise in potassium. If there are signs indicative of conduction abnormalities, the patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor or serial ECGs should be obtained.

Insulin administration drives extracellular potassium into the cells by enhancing the activity of the Na-K ATPase pump in skeletal muscles. Glucose is given concomitantly to prevent hypoglycemia. The effect of insulin begins in 10 to 20 minutes and peaks at 30 to 60 minutes. The major adverse effect is hypoglycemia, and serum glucose level should be measured one hour after the administration of insulin even when glucose is administered.

As a result, extracellular potassium moves into the cell to maintain electroneutrality. However, it remains uncertain if bicarbonate therapy is beneficial and it should <strong>not</strong> be the only therapy used in the management of hyperkalemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2332.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults", section on 'Sodium bicarbonate'</a>.)</p><p>In children, the dose of bicarbonate is 1 mEq/kg (maximum dose 50 mEq) administered IV over 10 to 15 minutes.

Although children are less likely to develop hyperkalemia compared with adults, pediatric hyperkalemia is not an uncommon occurrence and severe hyperkalemia (potassium level ≥7 mEq/L [mmol/L]) is a serious medical problem and potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
