         Inborn errors of immunity (IEI; primary immunodeficiencies [PIDs]) encompass a group of nearly 500 inherited disorders, often due to single-gene mutations, that result in the specific impairment of normal immune development and function [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
         <strong>
         </strong>
         While individually rare, in aggregate, the prevalence of these conditions is approximately 1 in 1000 to 5 in 1000. The clinical presentation of IEI is variable and includes severe or unusual infections, autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases,
         <strong>
         </strong>
         and malignancies
         <strong>
         </strong>
         [
         <a href="#rid2">

         </a>
         ].
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The classification scheme provides a clinically oriented strategy for disease categorization to facilitate a thoughtful approach to patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Genetic testing in patients with a suspected IEI is reviewed in detail separately. (See

         There are several key points to remember with regard to IEI and classification [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Infections signaling immunodeficiency can be of a single type (ie, papillomavirus or Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]). In addition, autoimmunity and autoinflammation are increasingly recognized as signs of IEI. The tables in the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) classification attempt to reflect common presentations associated with each gene defect. However, there are many instances where different pathogenic variants in a single gene (eg, recombination-activating 1 [
         <em>
          RAG1
         </em>
         ]) cause unique phenotypes; defects in different genes have a similar phenotype due to convergence on a shared critical pathway (eg, the severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] genes); or the identical mutation is expressed differently, even in a single family. Furthermore, pathogenic variants can be somatic or mosaic and can present differently than germline variants. Thus, the categorization described below represents the broadest outline of the clinical approach to patients.

         The expert committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) has classified IEI into nine categories of conditions based upon the segment of the immune system that is affected since 1999 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
         <strong>
         </strong>
         A 10
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         category comprises autoantibody mimics of IEI and somatic variants that also mimic the germline Mendelian conditions.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Each category of IEI is characterized by unique types of infections, autoimmunity, and/or inflammation. Patients with antibody deficiency, for example, typically present with bacterial respiratory tract infections, while terminal complement deficiencies are characterized by recurrent meningitis from
         <em>
          Neisseria
         </em>
         species. The major IUIS categories of IEI, the number of genes described in each category, characteristics of each category, and representative examples are summarized in the table  (

         Category I of the IUIS classification includes immunodeficiencies that affect both cellular and humoral immunity  (

         T cells represent the major component of the cellular immune system and are critical for defense against viral and fungal infections. Patients with T cell immunodeficiencies can have combined (T cell plus B cell/antibody) defects due to impaired T cell "help" required for generation of antibodies from B cells (B cell positive) or due to defects in the B cells themselves (B cell negative). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3980.html" rel="external">
          "The adaptive cellular immune response: T cells and cytokines"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with T cell defects can present with viral, fungal, and/or bacterial infections, including opportunistic infections (eg,
         <em>
          Pneumocystis jirovecii
         </em>
         pneumonia) and infections from live vaccinations (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] and varicella). The most severe example of T cell/CID is SCID. Patients with this condition are born with almost no T cells. Although many patients with SCID have B cells, antibody production is absent because there is no T cell help. Patients present within the first few months of life with life-threatening infections. Without curative therapy (hematopoietic cell transplantation or gene therapy), patients typically die from overwhelming infection before one year of age [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. CIDs are somewhat arbitrarily distinguished from SCID in that they typically do not lead to death in the first year of life and typically have higher T cell numbers and T cell function compared with SCID. Newborn screening to detect very low T cells now exists in most of the United States and several other countries. (See

         The CID group is the most diverse, with global lymphocyte dysfunction, T cell-specific alterations that secondarily impact the B cells, and dysfunction of pathways intrinsic to lymphocytes but also impacting additional cell types. Although T cell numbers are generally low and clinical assessment of these represents a useful screening test, several CIDs do not have low T cell numbers (ras homolog family member H [

         One example of this group is DOCK8 deficiency. Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) is involved in actin assembly and branching, akin to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP). Both DOCK8 deficiency and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome often presents with severe eczema and frequent infectious complications, such as staphylococcal infections, molluscum, and herpes. Later in life, the infections dominate the picture, and pneumonia becomes a common manifestation. Laboratory features are a very high immunoglobulin E (IgE), low immunoglobulin M (IgM), and eosinophilia, with declining T cell counts over time. (See

         Initial screening should include enumeration of T cell numbers by flow cytometry (CD3, CD4, and CD8) and assessment of T cell function by testing proliferation to mitogens (proteins that stimulate T cell division), keeping in mind that T cell numbers can be normal in several forms of CID.

          Purine nucleoside phosphorylase [PNP] deficiency

         – PNP is normally involved in the purine salvage pathway. PNP deficiency leads to an accumulation of intracellular deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), a metabolite that is toxic to lymphocytes. This disorder is characterized by CID, neurologic impairment, hemolytic anemia, and hypouricemia. (See

         Category III of the IUIS classification comprises the predominantly antibody deficiencies, which represent the most common type of immunodeficiency  (

         B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibodies or immunoglobulins such as immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and IgM [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Antibodies can bind and opsonize pathogens to facilitate phagocytosis (bacteria opsonized by antibodies are phagocytosed 50-fold more efficiently by neutrophils) and activate complement proteins. Antibodies also represent an important part of our immune memory, something we take great advantage of in the form of vaccinations. As an example, when a patient receives a tetanus vaccine, long-lasting tetanus antibodies are produced that remain in circulation for many years and help prevent disease. (See

Early-onset autoimmunity, autoimmunity that involves multiple organs, a strong family history of autoimmunity, autoimmunity in combination with susceptibility to infection, or significant lymphoproliferation all suggest an immune dysregulation defect.

         The adaptive immune system (which includes B cells/antibodies and T cells) is designed to recognize and eliminate very specific pathogens. One limitation of the adaptive immune system is the slow kinetics of the response. As an example, it can take three to four weeks to generate protective IgG antibodies following administration of an immunization. By contrast, the innate immune system is "armed" and ready to fight infection immediately by recognizing unique features of pathogens that are not present on host cells. (See

         NK cells are innate lymphocytes that protect the body from herpes virus (herpes simplex virus [HSV], varicella-zoster virus [VZV], EBV, and cytomegalovirus [CMV]) infections and also play a role in tumor surveillance.

         Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are innate receptors on the surface of eukaryotic cells that recognize viral and bacterial components such as cell walls, flagella, and double-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA). Signaling through TLRs leads to production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, IL-6, and IL-1, which trigger fever and inflammation. Patients with TLR defects such as IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) or myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) deficiency suffer from recurrent invasive bacterial infections but often demonstrate impaired fever and inflammatory response (minimally elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] or erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) despite severe infections [

Patients suffer from recurrent episodes of fever, arthritis, arthralgia, rashes, and abdominal pain. Patients are at risk for developing amyloidosis and IBD. One of the most common examples of this category is familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) syndrome. This condition occurs due to mutations in the MEFV, pyrin innate immunity regulator (

         The complement arm of the immune system protects the body from bacterial pathogens by opsonizing bacteria and also forming a membrane attack complex to cause lysis of bacteria. Complement proteins also play a role in clearance of apoptotic cell debris, which can cause autoimmune inflammation. There are three main complement protein pathways: classical complement, alternative complement, and lectin pathway  (

         Early classical complement component deficiencies (C1q, C1r, C1s, C2, C4, C3) present with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and susceptibility to infections from encapsulated bacteria. Terminal classical complement component deficiencies (C5, C6, C7, C8, C9) present with a unique susceptibility to recurrent
         <em>
          Neisseria
         </em>
         meningitis [

         ].

        <p>
         Similar to terminal complement deficiency, alternative complement pathway defects due to properdin or factor D present with recurrent meningitis. A deficiency of factor H and factor I (both complement regulatory proteins) can cause a phenotype of recurrent atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome or neisserial susceptibility, depending upon the mutation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Initial screening tests for complement deficiency include a CH50 (total hemolytic complement) and AH50 (measures total functional activity of the alternative pathway). The CH50 test screens the entire classical complement pathway from C1 to C9. A deficiency of any of the classical complement components would yield a CH50 test value near 0 (thus a normal CH50 essentially rules out any defects in C1 to C9) [

         The bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) comprise an array of conditions where one or more hematopoietic elements decline over time.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         They often manifest with macrocytic anemia, but there is a broad array of presenting manifestations. Although all patients will have characteristic bone marrow biopsy findings in time, the key features are not necessarily obvious at presentation. (See

          Fanconi anemia

         – The majority of patients with Fanconi anemia will have skeletal findings or other congenital malformations leading to the diagnosis. Bone marrow failure occurs at a median age of seven years, and nearly all patients have bone marrow failure by 40 years of age. Acute myeloid leukemia and solid tumors are common in this population.

         – Telomeres are structures at the ends of linear chromosomes that prevent the loss of genetic material that normally occurs with every cell division. Without proper telomere maintenance, cell senescence and apoptosis can occur, especially in highly proliferative cell types such as lymphocytes. In addition to bone marrow failure, patients can develop nail dystrophy, sparse hair, abnormal skin pigmentation, lung fibrosis, and enteropathy. X-linked, autosomal recessive, and autosomal dominant forms of DKC due to various gene defects have been described. (See

         – Nearly 500 inborn errors of immunity (IEI or primary immunodeficiencies [PIDs]) have been described. The International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) has classified these disorders into nine categories based upon the segment of the immune system that is affected, plus a 10

          Category I (combined immunodeficiencies without syndromic features)
         </strong>
         – Category I of the IUIS classification includes immunodeficiencies that affect both cellular and humoral immunity (combined immunodeficiencies [CIDs]) but that lack the additional defining syndromic features of the disorders included in category II  (

         <em>
          Pneumocystis jirovecii
         </em>
         pneumonia) and infections from live vaccinations (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] and varicella). The most severe example is severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which presents in infancy. (See
