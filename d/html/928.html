The LAA is a primary source for thromboembolism in AF. Whereas anticoagulation is recommended for most patients with AF, some patients have contraindications to long-term anticoagulation. Anticoagulation in patients with AF is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128998.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Selection of candidates for anticoagulation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1031.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1467702041"><span class="h1">RATIONALE AND LIMITATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients with AF, thrombus in the LAA is the primary source for thromboemboli. A review of studies examining the site of left atrial thrombus (by transesophageal echocardiography [TEE], cardiac surgery, or autopsy) found that in patients with AF without rheumatic heart disease, 90 percent of left atrial thrombi were located in the LAA [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The importance of the LAA as a source for thromboemboli among patients with AF provides the rationale for ligation, amputation, or occlusion of the LAA, particularly for patients who have an indication for anticoagulation but cannot take long-term oral anticoagulation. However, the following caveats should be kept in mind: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ten percent of left atrial thrombi are not located in the LAA [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], so occluding the LAA may not completely eliminate the risk of embolism from the LA. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thrombogenesis in patients with AF may not be limited to the LA. The pathophysiology of thrombogenesis in AF, including left atrial structural and functional abnormalities and hypercoagulable state, is discussed further separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/981.html" rel="external">"Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1041.html" rel="external">"Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm", section on 'Atrial stunning'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the LAAO has an incomplete closure, this can result in a residual communication between the LAA and LA, also referred to as a residual jet. An incomplete jet is one that is &gt;5 mm; these are believed to predispose to thrombus formation. The importance of smaller jets (ie, ≤5 mm) is uncertain, but one study suggested a low risk of thromboembolic events [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In this retrospective review of 6- and 12-month follow-up echocardiograms in over 400 patients who received the WATCHMAN device, there was no significant increase in the rate of thromboembolism in the 32 percent of patients with LAA residual jet width &gt;5 mm compared with those with no residual jet or jet width ≤5 mm. It is likely that most residual holes are small and not associated with embolization of large clots.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H766505117"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The indications for surgical and nonsurgical closure are similar.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3422272166"><span class="h2">Patients not undergoing cardiac surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following approaches apply to patients with AF with an indication for anticoagulation (based upon their estimated risk of stroke and other systemic thromboembolism  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752" href="/d/graphic/94752.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)) who have a contraindication to long-term anticoagulation. These approaches do not apply to patients with AF who have other indications for anticoagulation (eg, an implanted mechanical valve).

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128998.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Selection of candidates for anticoagulation", section on 'Approach to deciding whether to anticoagulate'</a>.)</p><p>However, it should be noted that short-term antithrombotic therapy (anticoagulant or dual antiplatelet therapy) is generally recommended after placement of the device as discussed below.

Most patients can tolerate at least one antiplatelet agent for a short duration. </p><p>The efficacy and safety of percutaneous LAAO as an adjunct to long-term oral anticoagulation in patients with AF has not been established. A rationale for this approach would be to attempt to reduce the risk of stroke and other systemic embolic events beyond the risk reduction provided by anticoagulation, but this approach would entail procedural risks that might offset potential benefits.</p><p>Both efficacy and safety of LAAO devices compared with long-term anticoagulation were demonstrated in a meta-analysis that included three randomized, open-label, controlled trials (PROTECT AF, PREVAIL, and PRAGUE-17) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A total of 933 patients were randomly assigned to percutaneous LAA closure, and 583 were randomly assigned to oral anticoagulation (65 percent were on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>, and 35 percent on a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]) and followed for an average of 39 months.

Surgical ligation or amputation of the LAA can be performed without significant morbidity or mortality in patients with AF who are undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications. Surgical LAAO is most commonly performed in patients undergoing mitral valve or Maze surgery.

In this multicenter trial, 2379 participants were randomly assigned to the occlusion group, and 2391 to the no-occlusion group, with a mean of 3.8 years of follow-up. A total of 92.1 percent of the participants received the assigned procedure. The majority of participants continued oral anticoagulation after the procedure (76.8 percent at three years). Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8 percent) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0 percent) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.85). Incidence rates of perioperative major bleeding, hospitalization for heart failure, and death were similar in the two groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Surgical LAAO is performed using a variety of techniques. In the LAAOS III trial, LAAO was performed by amputation and closure, stapler closure, double-layer linear closure from within the atrium (in patients undergoing minithoracotomy; this approach required transesophageal confirmation of occlusion), or closure with an approved surgical occlusion device [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Intraoperative TEE confirmation of LAA closure is recommended.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Observational studies </strong>– Two large retrospective cohort studies suggested a benefit from surgical LAAO in patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>], whereas one smaller study did not [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In a study of 75,782 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 8590 propensity-matched pairs (with and without surgical LAAO) were identified and studied; 74.9 percent had a history of AF, and 30.5 percent were taking an oral anticoagulant at baseline [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. During follow-up (mean 2.1 years), LAAO was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (1.14 versus 1.59 events per 100 patient-years; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.96) and mortality (3.01 versus 4.30 events per 100 patient-years; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.84). Most of the benefit was seen in patients with prior AF. LAAO was also associated with modestly higher rates of AF-related outpatient visits (11.96 versus 10.26 events per patient-year; rate ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.10-1.24) and hospitalizations (0.36 versus 0.32 events per patient-year; rate ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.05-1.21). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In contrast, a smaller study (with 461 propensity-matched pairs) found similar risks of stroke and mortality in patients with and without surgical LAAO [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with a</strong> <strong>contraindication to long-term anticoagulation</strong> – In such patients, we suggest concomitant surgical LAAO, as the procedure is generally safe and may provide some protection against future stroke. However, there are limited data to support surgical LAAO without long-term anticoagulation. Long-term anticoagulation is usually used after surgical LAAO. Patients with an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation must be able to take dual antiplatelet therapy for up to six weeks postoperatively. (See <a class="local">'After surgical occlusion'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a retrospective cohort study of 10,524 Medicare recipients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery, surgical LAAO (n = 3892) compared with no occlusion (n = 6632) was significantly associated with lower risk of readmission for thromboembolism at three years (4.2 versus 6.2 percent; HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.56-0.81) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Among patients discharged without anticoagulation, LAAO was associated with a lower risk of thromboembolism (4.2 versus 6.0 percent; HR 0.26; 95% CI 0.17-0.40), but not among patients discharged with anticoagulation (4.1 versus 6.3 percent; HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.56-1.39). In the cohort of patients discharged with oral anticoagulation, surgical LAAO was not associated with thromboembolism but was associated with a lower risk for hemorrhagic stroke, presumably related to eventual discontinuation of oral anticoagulation among the LAAO patients. </p><p></p><p>In patients without AF, there is no established role for LAAO.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4182678982"><span class="h1">PREPROCEDURE PLANNING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among persons with AF, the anatomy of the LAA is heterogenous including varied shapes, neck and long axis diameters, and number of lobes [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Specific LAA measurements (eg, LAA depth and mouth diameter) can be useful for LAA closure planning; these can be obtained by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), coronary computed tomography angiography, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. No specific LAA preprocedural imaging is required for surgical LAAO. </p><p>If upon cardiac imaging an LA/LAA thrombus is seen, the LAAO procedure is contraindicated. If an LAA thrombus is visualized, the we initiate or intensify anticoagulation (as appropriate) and continue it for six to eight weeks. At that time, we repeat LAA imaging to reassess the thrombus and if resolved, we perform LAAO. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1031.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants"</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be asked about sensitivity to Nitinol (an alloy made of nickel and titanium) or any other material that is part of the specific LAAO device; in the case of an allergy, the device would be contraindicated. For instance, both the Watchman and Amplatzer devices contain Nitinol. Nickel allergy is very common. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5556.html" rel="external">"Nickel hypersensitivity and coronary artery stents"</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, patients receiving a percutaneous device are able to tolerate oral anticoagulation (vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]) or dual antiplatelet therapy for at least six weeks after the device is implanted and cannot have LAA clot present at the time of implantation. Some experts would perform LAAO in patients who cannot tolerate anticoagulants or antiplatelets, whereas others require at least two to four weeks of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> postprocedure.</p><p>LAAO device implantation can be performed with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance under general anesthesia or intracardiac echocardiographic guidance under local anesthesia, but the practice varies [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H982666927"><span class="h1">PROCEDURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most centers, the procedure is performed using transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) guidance under deep sedation or general endotracheal anesthesia. Some centers perform the procedure under sedation and only fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p>After vascular access is obtained in the femoral vein, a comprehensive TEE is performed (if it was not performed previously) to assess the LAA anatomy and specifically to rule out presence of any clot/thrombus, as this is a contraindication to proceed. After this, a transseptal puncture is performed. Obtaining the correct location of the puncture in the intraatrial septum is important and is guided by TEE. Once the septum is punctured, we administer heparin with a goal activated clotting time &gt;250 seconds; this is done to avoid thrombosis of the percutaneous catheters and occlusion device. Angiography is performed in two orthogonal views for sizing. Device sizing and selection are based on the anatomy. Once the device is deployed, stability is assessed and then the device is released. Patients usually spend one night in the hospital and are discharged the following day on antiplatelets therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H256726093"><span class="h1">PERCUTANEOUS DEVICES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among the available percutaneous LAA closure devices, the WATCHMAN is the only device for which randomized trials have shown comparable efficacy and safety with long-term <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolization.

The study found that the risk of stroke or systolic embolism was higher in patients with incomplete LAA closure compared with those with complete closure (24 versus 2 percent during 44-month mean follow-up), despite similar rates of anticoagulation and recurrent AF. Among patients with incomplete closure, those with stroke or systemic embolism had smaller LAA neck diameters (2.8 versus 7.1 mm) than those without these adverse outcomes. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4152225026"><span class="h1">DEVICE SAFETY AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Percutaneous LAAO has become safer over time, possibly due to increased operator experience with the procedure and improvements in device iterations. Outcomes were compared between the 542 patients in the randomized study and 460 patients in the nonrandomized Continued Access Protocol registry who underwent WATCHMAN implantation after the randomized trial was completed [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. A study done 10 years later showed a significant decline in the rate of procedure- or device-related safety events within seven days compared with those in the earlier randomized trial (3.7 versus 7.7 percent, respectively). In a large registry of over 38,000 WATCHMAN implantations, the procedural success rate was very high at 98.3 percent, which was even higher than reported in pivotal clinical trials such as PROTECT AF [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. </p><p>The complications of the LARIAT are described above. (See <a class="local">'LARIAT system'</a> above.)</p><p>There are several potential complications that can arise from the procedure itself or that are due to the presence of the device in the LAA. Some of these complications can occur in the acute periprocedural period, whereas others occur over a longer time frame. Management of these complications is crucial and underscores the importance of aggressive patient follow-up using appropriate imaging to look for such complications. Furthermore, understanding factors that lead to increased risk of complications is also important in terms of patient counseling and shared decision-making. </p><p>Complications of cardiac surgery are described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1627.html" rel="external">"Postoperative complications among patients undergoing cardiac surgery"</a>.)</p><p>In patients undergoing percutaneous LAAO, these complications have been described:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Death and cardiac arrest </strong>–<strong> </strong>Death and cardiac arrest are infrequent complications of WATCHMAN procedures. Among 38,158 patients who underwent LAAO in the National Cardiovascular Data LAAO Registry, in-hospital, procedural-related death occurred in 0.19 percent and cardiac arrest in 0.24 percent of patients [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vascular </strong>– The majority of periprocedural complications are vascular (ie, resulting femoral vein puncture). The incidence of such complications is infrequent with adoption of newer techniques to access the femoral vein and to stop bleeding after the procedure. Complications that may arise due to the transseptal puncture itself can also be minimized with ultrasound-guided puncture. Among 38,158 people who underwent LAAO in the National Cardiovascular Data LAAO Registry, the prevalence of a major vascular complication was 0.15 percent [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pericardial effusion </strong>– The LA and LAA are thin walled; thus, manipulation of transseptal equipment, large-bore sheaths, and devices can traumatize the wall, resulting in pericardial effusion. The incidence of pericardial effusion has declined over time, with improved operator skills; in the earlier PROTECT-AF study of WATCHMAN devices, the incidence of pericardial effusion requiring intervention was 4.3 percent [<a href="#rid34">34</a>], whereas in the more recent WATCHMAN clinical trials and registries, the pooled incidence of cardiac tamponade was about 1.3 percent [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>]. In a report from the National Cardiovascular Data LAAO Registry, among 65,355 patients, 881 (1.3 percent) developed procedural pericardial effusions, percutaneous drainage was performed in 1.18 percent, and cardiac surgery was performed in 0.27 percent of the study population [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Pericardial effusion not requiring intervention was reported in 669 patients (1.02 percent). Signs and symptoms of a pericardial effusion and tamponade are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4941.html" rel="external">"Pericardial effusion: Approach to diagnosis", section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Periprocedure</strong> <strong>stroke </strong>– Peridevice leaks (also called device-related leaks), air embolism, and device-related thrombus can lead to near-term stroke. </p><p class="bulletIndent1">Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy after the procedure are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Postprocedure management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the National Cardiovascular Data LAAO registry, in-hospital ischemic stroke was documented in 0.12 and hemorrhagic stroke in 0.01 percent of patients, respectively [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Most events were related to air embolism from inadequate device prepping. Fewer complications are due to thromboembolism from preexisting or de-novo equipment-related LAA thrombus. Air embolism cerebral circulation can cause a transient ischemic attack or stroke. Once a thrombus is detected, additional heparin should be administered, and thrombus aspiration via a large sheath may be attempted. The procedure should be completed expeditiously with either deployment of the device or removal of the sheath/device from the LA. Full neurological assessment should be performed when the patient awakes from general anesthesia, and emergent stroke team consultation is required if the patient has neurological deficits.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Device embolization </strong>– Device embolization is a rare but serious complication of LAAO. With the legacy WATCHMAN device, the reported incidence was 0.24 percent in clinical trials [<a href="#rid41">41</a>], with an even lower incidence reported in the real-world National Cardiovascular Data LAAO registry at 0.07 percent [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Most embolizations do not cause symptoms; however, palpitations, heart failure, hypotension, and cardiac arrest had been reported. The first-line strategy for management is percutaneous retrieval of the embolized device. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Device erosion </strong>– This complication is very rare (occurring in &lt;1 percent or patients) but can be devastating. Long-term follow-up with appropriate imaging (ie, a transesophageal echocardiogram [TEE] between one and six months postprocedure) to look for new pericardial effusion is important to screen for this complication [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p></p><p>The following issues regarding LAAO adverse events and hospital readmission are also important to recognize:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Greater</strong> <strong>adverse events in females </strong>– Females have a higher risk of in-hospital adverse events after LAAO [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. In the National Cardiovascular Data Registry, 49,000 patients (41 percent female) underwent LAAO between 2016 and 2017. Females were more likely than males to experience any adverse event (6 versus 4 percent), including a pericardial effusion requiring drainage (1.2 versus 0.5 percent) or major bleeding (1.7 versus 0.8 percent). Also, female patients were more likely to have a hospital stay &gt;1 day (16 versus 12 percent) or experience death (adjusted odds ratio 2.01; 95% CI 1.31-3.0<em>9</em>), although death was rare and absolute differences minimal (0.3 versus 0.1 percent). Female patients in this study were older than male patients but less likely to have diabetes and heart failure. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High readmission </strong>– Among 14,000 patients with LAAO in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2016 and 2017, the 30-day readmission rate was 9.4 percent [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Of these, 12 percent of readmissions were attributable to gastrointestinal bleeding. Risk factors for readmission included drug abuse ( odds ratio 4.1; 95% CI 1.34-12.54) and anemia (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.12-3.18). </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1174382662"><span class="h1">RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHER GROUPS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The LAAOS III trial on surgical LAAO was completed after major society guidelines were published, so this evidence was not incorporated in those guidelines. (See <a class="local">'Patients undergoing surgery'</a> above.)</p><p>A consensus statement from the European Heart Rhythm Association and the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions published in 2020 states that LAAO is acceptable in patients with a contraindication to oral anticoagulation or those who are unwilling or unable to take oral anticoagulation [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. </p><p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval is somewhat more liberal than the European Society of Cardiology guideline for patients eligible for oral anticoagulation and has other indications for nonpharmacologic therapy (eg, lifestyle indications, labile international normalized ratio).</p><p>The 2019 focused update of the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guideline for the management of patients with AF makes a weak recommendation for surgical excision of LAA at the time of cardiac surgery [<a href="#rid47">47,48</a>]. In addition, it states that percutaneous LAAO may be considered in patients with AF at increased risk of stroke who have contraindications to long-term anticoagulation. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2588032106"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
