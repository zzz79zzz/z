Prevention is guided by the following general principles:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preventive therapy generally consists of lifestyle changes (eg, increased fluid intake, dietary modification, weight loss), drug therapy, or a combination of these. The approach to preventive therapy for an individual patient depends upon a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's dietary and metabolic risk factors for stone formation as well as the patient's stone composition, if known. For calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones, we generally try dietary modification before initiating drug therapy. However, for other stone types, such as uric acid or cystine stones, drug therapy is frequently initiated at the same time as dietary changes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7377.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Evaluation of the patient with established stone disease", section on 'Approach to evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>While certain preventive measures are applicable to all patients with kidney stones, other measures are <strong>specific</strong> to certain stone types and should not be considered generalizable to all stone types. (See <a class="local">'Preventive measures for all stone types'</a> below and <a class="local">'Preventive measures for specific stone types'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>All patients receiving treatment to prevent recurrent kidney stones should be regularly monitored to assess the response to therapy. Such monitoring consists of a metabolic evaluation (ie, 24-hour urine collection for analysis of urine composition) and imaging. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring the response'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients should be informed that these recommended changes are treatments that need to be continued long term. If they are stopped, the urine composition and therefore the stone risk would likely return to the pretreatment levels.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1318835884"><span class="h1">PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR ALL STONE TYPES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Certain preventive measures are applicable to <strong>all</strong> patients with kidney stones, independent of their stone type or individual risk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2411423751"><span class="h2">Fluid intake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with kidney stones, we suggest sufficient fluid intake to consistently produce at least 2 liters of urine per day. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Fluid intake'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To reach this goal, the best strategy is to recommend how much <strong>additional</strong> fluid the patient should drink based upon their 24-hour urine volume. As an example, if the total urine volume is 1.5 liters, then we recommend two additional 8 ounce (240 mL) glasses of fluid each day to reach the goal of at least 2 liters of urine output per day. We advise the patient to distribute the fluid intake throughout the day. If the patient is waking up several times per night to void, then we advise the patient to finish consuming their daily fluid earlier in the evening to avoid sleep disruption.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The risk of stone formation might be affected by the type of beverage consumed, with certain types of beverages being more or less beneficial for the prevention of kidney stones. Water is an ideal choice, but other non-calorie-containing beverages are also effective. We advise patients to avoid calorie-containing beverages, such as sweetened soda, to avoid weight gain with the general increase in fluid intake. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Type of fluid'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Increasing fluid intake, spread throughout the day (although it is not essential that the patient wake up several times per night to urinate), will increase the urine flow rate and lower the urine solute concentration, both of which may protect against stone formation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In one prospective trial, 199 patients with a first calcium oxalate stone were randomly assigned either to no therapy or to a recommendation of a high fluid intake to produce at least 2 liters of urine per day [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. At five years, the incidence of new stone formation was significantly lower in the treated patients than in those in the control group (12 versus 27 percent).</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a prospective clinical series [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Stone formers who remained free of stones were noted to have a greater increase in urine volume than those who had recurrent disease (320 mL/day versus no change). This study emphasizes that even small increases in fluid intake can reduce the risk of new stone formation. Observational studies have consistently found a substantially lower risk of incident stone formation in those with higher fluid intake [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>] and higher urine volume [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3348729087"><span class="h2">Diet and lifestyle measures</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2759385697"><span class="h3">Limit sodium intake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with kidney stones, we suggest limiting dietary sodium intake to below 100 mEq (2300 mg) per day. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Sodium'</a>.)</p><p>Calcium is reabsorbed passively in the proximal tubule down the favorable concentration gradient created by the reabsorption of sodium and water (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2340.html" rel="external">"Diuretics and calcium balance"</a>). Thus, a low-sodium diet (80 to 100 mEq/day) can enhance proximal sodium and calcium reabsorption, leading to a reduction in calcium excretion [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. In one study, for example, lowering sodium intake from 200 to 80 mEq/day diminished calcium excretion by as much as 100 mg/day (2.5 mmol/day) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Although the independent contribution of lowering dietary sodium intake on actual stone formation is unknown, limiting sodium intake is likely an important component of a regimen that has been demonstrated to reduce recurrent stone formation [<a href="#rid7">7,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3526581699"><span class="h3">Increase fruit and vegetable intake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with kidney stones, we suggest increasing dietary fruit and vegetable intake. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Potassium'</a>.)</p><p>Foods that are rich in potassium, particularly fruits and vegetables, may be beneficial. Increasing intake of fruits and vegetables, regardless of 24-hour urine values, may reduce the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation, particularly in patients who self-select a diet that is low in fruits and vegetables. This benefit is primarily the result of increasing citrate excretion [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Observational studies have consistently found a substantially lower risk of incident stone formation in those with diets rich in potassium [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3179297346"><span class="h3">Weight loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Weight control may be helpful in preventing stone recurrence, since obesity and weight gain are risk factors for kidney stones, particularly in females [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, there are no clinical trials that have shown that weight loss reduces the risk of recurrent stones. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Medical conditions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3020798411"><span class="h1">PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR SPECIFIC STONE TYPES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with specific stone types may require additional preventive measures, in addition to general preventive measures for all stone types. (See <a class="local">'Preventive measures for all stone types'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3889130069"><span class="h2">Calcium oxalate stones</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prevention of recurrent calcium oxalate stones is aimed at decreasing the concentrations of the lithogenic factors (calcium and oxalate) and increasing the concentrations of inhibitors of stone formation, such as citrate. Achieving these goals may require an increase in fluid intake (see <a class="local">'Fluid intake'</a> above), dietary modification, and the administration of appropriate medications. Specific recommendations should be based upon the results of 24-hour urine collection results, which should be performed before dietary modification or drug therapy is attempted. In addition, any medical conditions that are associated with calcium stones (eg, primary hyperparathyroidism) should be addressed as appropriate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7377.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Evaluation of the patient with established stone disease", section on '24-hour urine collections'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4198937902"><span class="h3">Dietary modification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>From the viewpoint of diet, increasing the intake of fluid, dietary calcium, potassium, and phytate may be beneficial. In addition, decreasing the intake of oxalate, animal protein, sucrose, fructose, sodium, supplemental <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9776" href="/d/drug information/9776.html" rel="external">vitamin C</a>, and supplemental calcium (as opposed to dietary calcium) may reduce the risk of calcium oxalate stones [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2146614691"><span class="h4">Maintain adequate calcium intake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with calcium oxalate stones, we suggest <strong>against</strong> a low calcium diet. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Calcium'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We generally encourage patients to consume several servings of dairy or other calcium-rich foods to reach 800 to 1000 mg/day. Some plant-based milk alternatives are calcium enriched and low in oxalate and may be suitable options in place of traditional dairy offerings [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Calcium supplements should <strong>not</strong> be routinely used to achieve adequate dietary calcium intake in patients with calcium oxalate stones, as they do not appear to be effective in preventing recurrent stones and may even slightly increase risk [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. In patients with a history of stones who require calcium supplements (eg, for the treatment of osteoporosis, or as an oxalate binder in patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption), a suggested approach is to measure urinary calcium excretion before and approximately one month after starting the calcium supplement. If there is a clinically important increase in urinary calcium excretion, the supplement should be discontinued or the dose should be reduced. In this setting, the initiation of a thiazide diuretic may be useful to reduce urinary calcium excretion (and potentially to help maintain bone density). In addition, if a calcium supplement is used, it should be taken with a meal. (See <a class="local">'High urine calcium'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Higher urine calcium is a common finding in stone formers, but restricting dietary calcium intake is not generally recommended unless it is excessive (more than 1200 mg/day). Although urine calcium excretion may decrease with restriction, the decrease in free intestinal calcium can lead to increased absorption of dietary oxalate and enhanced oxalate excretion, due to decreased binding of oxalate by calcium in the intestinal lumen. The net effect may be increased supersaturation of the urine with respect to calcium oxalate and an enhanced tendency to stone formation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Dietary factors'</a>.)</p><p>The ability to help prevent new stone formation with adequate calcium intake was shown in part by a five-year randomized trial that compared two diets among males with idiopathic hypercalciuria and recurrent calcium oxalate stones [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In this trial, 120 such males were randomly assigned to either a diet consisting of calcium (1200 mg/day [30 mmol/day]) and lower amounts of animal protein (52 g/day) and salt (2900 mg/day [50 mmol/day] of sodium chloride) or a diet containing a low amount of calcium (400 mg/day [10 mmol/day]). At five years, the group assigned to the adequate calcium, low-animal protein, low-salt diet had a lower risk of stone recurrence (unadjusted relative risk 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.98). However, the independent effect of calcium is unclear given that the amounts of animal protein and salt ingested among those in the low-calcium diet differed from that of patients in the normal-calcium diet group. Nonetheless, the low-calcium intervention was not beneficial and is not recommended.</p><p>In addition to increasing stone formation, a low-calcium diet may have a second deleterious effect in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria: development of negative calcium balance [<a href="#rid13">13,17</a>]. This extra loss of calcium can exacerbate the already diminished bone density in some of these patients [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>], a complication that may be due to enhanced bone resorption.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H467871813"><span class="h4">Reduce nondairy animal protein intake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with calcium oxalate stones, we suggest reducing nondairy animal protein intake. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Protein'</a>.)</p><p>Adverse changes in urinary calcium and citrate excretion can be induced by a high-protein diet since the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids increases the daily acid load by generating sulfuric acid  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56597" href="/d/graphic/56597.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Nondairy animal protein is much more likely to induce this effect than vegetable protein since it has a higher sulfur content and therefore generates more acid [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. How acid loading produces these changes is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Protein'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, lowering animal protein intake will produce favorable changes in the urine [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, it has not been proven that this will reduce the likelihood of stone formation. In one randomized trial, for example, reduced animal protein in association with higher dietary calcium and lower dietary sodium reduced the risk of stone recurrence [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], but the individual impact of animal protein could not be determined. A subsequent randomized trial found that, compared with a high fluid intake plus a diet rich in calcium, a low animal protein intake does not reduce stone recurrence [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In addition, observational studies have been inconsistent, suggesting that a high-animal protein diet was a risk factor for incident kidney stones in males and older females but not in younger females [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Based upon the available data, it would be prudent to avoid excessive nondairy animal protein intake for all calcium stone formers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1966160331"><span class="h4">Limit oxalate intake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with calcium oxalate stones, we suggest limiting intake of high oxalate foods and high-dose supplemental <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9776" href="/d/drug information/9776.html" rel="external">vitamin C</a>. However, excessive restriction of oxalate is not likely to be helpful; patients should continue to consume a wide variety of fruits and vegetables while avoiding those very high in oxalate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'High urine oxalate'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Oxalate'</a>.)</p><p>Some foods contain very large amounts of oxalate, and those should be avoided (eg, spinach, rhubarb, potatoes). In addition, some nuts and legumes are also high (eg, almonds) or moderate (eg, peanuts, cashews) in oxalate, and their intake should be limited. High-oxalate foods should be avoided regardless of urine oxalate since there may be a period of very high urinary oxalate excretion soon after the food is consumed. If a low-oxalate diet is recommended, it should only be continued if there is documented evidence that the urine oxalate excretion has fallen. The oxalate content of foods is available at the following <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hsph.harvard.edu%2Fnutrition-questionnaire-service-center%2Fnutrient-tables%2F&amp;token=xbl11vgPHDa2k8M83LphWGy1KFu4SvWyr5Xrvthd6TzYVwD%2FPOfHpeu5pzPaDwMWt1lVQ1j5lybBNpkMpXuPzHvOQ8x40G%2BLq4Vkz%2B2VX7g%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=7373" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p>However, there is scant evidence that low-oxalate diets reduce the risk of stone formation. In prospective observational studies of individuals who had never had a stone, overall higher dietary oxalate only slightly increased the risk of incident stone formation in males and older females; there was no association in younger females [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, the risk was higher with increasing oxalate intake among those with calcium intake below the median, again demonstrating that adequate dietary calcium intake may reduce the risk of stone formation.

By comparison, lemon juice has been proposed to be an effective source of citrate [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>]. In one report, for example, the ingestion of 4 ounces of lemon juice concentrate per day (mixed with tap water as lemonade for a total volume of 2 liters) resulted in increased urinary citrate levels in 11 of 12 patients (average increase of 142 to 346 mg/day, although it remained in the low range) who were either noncompliant or intolerant of conventional citrate replacement therapy [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].

A possible explanation for the lack of effect is the low potassium content of cranberry juice.</p><p>Alkalinization raises citrate excretion by diminishing the uptake of filtered citrate by the proximal tubular cells [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. The mechanism by which this occurs is related in part to the chemical form of citrate that is present in the lumen. Citrate can exist at a physiologic pH either as a divalent or trivalent anion. Proximal citrate reabsorption (via a sodium-citrate cotransporter in the luminal membrane) preferentially occurs as the divalent anion. Raising the pH in the tubular lumen converts the divalent form into the less reabsorbable trivalent form:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p>  Citrate<sup>(2-)</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>  →  Citrate<sup>(3-)</sup> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</p></div></div><p>Increasing the systemic pH may enhance citrate excretion by a second mechanism. The associated intracellular alkalosis will diminish citrate metabolism within the cells. The ensuing elevation in the cell citrate concentration will create a less favorable concentration gradient for passive citrate movement from the tubular lumen into the cell [<a href="#rid46">46,48</a>].</p><p>The net effect is decreased citrate uptake and increased citrate excretion. In addition to the effect on pH, some of the administered citrate may be excreted directly before being metabolized to bicarbonate [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Thus, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10225" href="/d/drug information/10225.html" rel="external">potassium citrate</a> has a slightly greater citraturic effect than potassium bicarbonate [<a href="#rid38">38,49</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, metabolic acidosis diminishes citrate excretion due to enhanced citrate reabsorption [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. This effect is mediated both by conversion of citrate<sup>(3-)</sup> to the more reabsorbable citrate<sup>(2-)</sup> and by increased citrate metabolism (due to upregulation of the enzyme ATP citrate lyase) within the cells [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Hypocitraturia probably contributes to the stone formation that is relatively common in patients with untreated distal renal tubular acidosis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2369.html" rel="external">"Nephrolithiasis in renal tubular acidosis"</a>). Care must be taken when providing alkali supplements in patients with calcium phosphate stones due to the increase in urine pH (see below).</p><p>Hypokalemia, as may be produced by a thiazide diuretic for example, has a similar stimulatory effect on citrate reabsorption. Potassium moves out of the proximal tubule cells to repair the extracellular deficit and electroneutrality is maintained in part by the movement of extracellular hydrogen into the cells. The intracellular acidosis will enhance citrate metabolism, thereby lowering the cell citrate concentration and creating a more favorable gradient for citrate reabsorption [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>].

Although one cannot distinguish between calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones radiographically, this is less important, because the evaluation will be the same for both stone types.</p><p>However, if a patient is a recurrent stone former, then it should be made clear to the patient and the treating urologist that a stone <strong>must</strong> be sent for analysis if possible from the next stone episode.

However, this will also raise the urinary pH. If the predominant calcium salt is calcium phosphate, which forms more readily in an alkaline urine, supplementation with alkali such as citrate (which is metabolized to bicarbonate in the body) may, in fact, accelerate the rate of stone formation. In this case, the urine pH may be a useful guide. If the urine pH is 6.5 or higher, the use of citrate supplements should be used with caution.

Even if the urine calcium is high, adequate dietary calcium or adding an over-the-counter calcium supplement with meals should be considered in addition to a low-oxalate diet if the low-oxalate diet alone is insufficient. However, the amount of urinary oxalate that is derived from the diet is quite variable; thus, if a patient adheres to a low-oxalate diet with adequate calcium intake and the urine oxalate does not fall, then the stricter oxalate restriction can be removed (though the very-high-oxalate-containing foods mentioned above should still be avoided).

The response to dietary or drug therapy is monitored by repeat 24-hour urine collections for calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones; this may also be done more selectively for patients with uric acid, cystine, or struvite stones. It is essential that all the relevant urinary factors be monitored in individuals with calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones as they often have more than one urinary abnormality. Although remnant stones may theoretically consume urinary constituents and lower their measured urinary concentration, the potential error from a stone being present is much less than the variability due to dietary intake [<a href="#rid65">65,66</a>]. Thus, the patient does not need to be stone free to perform a collection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7377.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Evaluation of the patient with established stone disease", section on '24-hour urine collections'</a>.)</p><p>The goal of therapy is to reverse the abnormalities detected during the initial workup (eg, low urine volume, high urine calcium, high urine oxalate, and low urine citrate). We routinely obtain a 24-hour urine collection at six to eight weeks after therapy has begun to assess the impact of the intervention. If the desired changes in the urine values have taken place, repeat values are obtained again at six months and then at yearly intervals [<a href="#rid67">67</a>].

Preventive therapy generally consists of lifestyle changes (eg, increased fluid intake, dietary modification, weight loss), drug therapy, or a combination of these. While certain preventive measures are applicable to all patients with kidney stones, other measures are <strong>specific</strong> to certain stone types and should not be considered generalizable to all stone types. (See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preventive measures for all stone types</strong> – Certain preventive measures are applicable to <strong>all </strong>patients with kidney stones, independent of their stone type or individual risk:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Fluid intake</strong> – For all patients with kidney stones, we suggest sufficient fluid intake to consistently produce at least 2 liters of urine per day (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Fluid intake'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Sodium intake</strong> – For all patients with kidney stones, we suggest limiting dietary sodium intake to below 100 mEq (2300 mg) per day (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Limit sodium intake'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Fruit and vegetable intake</strong> – For all patients with kidney stones, we suggest increasing dietary fruit and vegetable intake (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).

(See <a class="local">'Weight loss'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preventive measures for calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stones</strong> – Prevention of recurrent calcium oxalate stones is aimed at decreasing the concentrations of the lithogenic factors (calcium and oxalate or phosphate) and at increasing the concentrations of inhibitors of stone formation, such as citrate. Achieving these goals may require an increase in fluid intake, dietary modification, and the administration of appropriate medications. Specific recommendations should be based upon 24-hour urine collection results, which should be performed before dietary modification or drug therapy is attempted. In addition, any medical conditions that are associated with calcium stones (eg, primary hyperparathyroidism) should be addressed as appropriate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Calcium intake</strong> – For all patients with calcium oxalate stones, we suggest against a low-calcium diet (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We generally encourage patients to consume several servings of dairy or other calcium-rich foods to reach 800 to 1000 mg/day. Calcium supplements should <strong>not</strong> be routinely used to achieve adequate dietary calcium intake, as they do not appear to be effective in preventing recurrent stones and may even slightly increase risk. (See <a class="local">'Maintain adequate calcium intake'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Protein intake</strong> – For all patients with calcium oxalate stones, we suggest reducing nondairy animal protein intake (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).
