Regurgitation associated with prosthetic heart valves includes regurgitation through the valve (transvalvular) as well as paravalvular regurgitation (also known as paravalvular leak [PVL]). Symptomatic severe prosthetic valve regurgitation is an uncommon complication of surgical valve replacement. However, it is associated with poor outcomes with both conservative management and surgical treatment.</p><p>This topic will discuss the prognosis and management of prosthetic valve regurgitation.

When prosthetic valve regurgitation is due to mechanical or biologic prosthetic valve thrombosis, treatment of valve thrombosis usually corrects the regurgitation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111633.html" rel="external">"Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, and obstruction: Management"</a>.)</p><p>When prosthetic valve regurgitation is caused by infective endocarditis, an appropriate antibiotic regimen should be started as soon as possible to treat the infection. However, the prosthetic valve regurgitation does not generally resolve and may progress while the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics. Surgical consultation is recommended to evaluate and monitor for the presence of an indication for surgical intervention. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2141.html" rel="external">"Antimicrobial therapy of prosthetic valve endocarditis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2132.html" rel="external">"Surgery for prosthetic valve endocarditis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3746589863"><span class="h3">Treatment of consequences of regurgitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The role of medical therapy to treat symptomatic HF in patients with prosthetic valve regurgitation is generally limited to temporary stabilization in patients awaiting redo valve surgery or percutaneous intervention and palliative care for patients who are not candidates for surgical or percutaneous intervention [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The objective of medical treatment is to relieve congestion and reduce afterload, which is achieved with the use of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. If systolic ventricular dysfunction appears, standard therapy for HF with reduced ejection fraction should be administered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121085.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Supportive medical therapy is indicated in patients with hemolysis. If clinically significant hemolysis is present, iron and folate supplementation is indicated to correct deficiencies in these nutrients. Erythropoietin injection or programmed blood transfusions may be required to treat symptomatic anemia. If hemolysis is intractable, surgical or transcatheter therapy (ie, device closure for paravalvular leak [PVL]; transcatheter aortic valve replacement [TAVR] for transvalvular regurgitation, although the last rarely causes hemolysis) is indicated as discussed below.

Data are lacking on the natural history of symptomatic prosthetic transvalvular regurgitation and the effect of treatment. However, indirect data are available from observational studies of patients with symptomatic severe native valve disease showing high mortality risk for patients treated medically, lack of efficacy of medical therapy, and association between surgical treatment and improved symptoms and reduced mortality rates. As an example, an observational study found a mortality rate of 6 percent per year in patients with severe native aortic regurgitation (AR) with class II symptoms and a mortality rate of nearly 24.6 percent per year for patients with severe native AR with class III or IV symptoms treated medically (without surgery) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Among patients with severe AR, aortic valve surgery was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8160.html" rel="external">"Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, observational data in patients with symptomatic chronic primary mitral regurgitation (MR) suggest that chronic severe MR has an annual mortality rate of approximately 6 percent per year (higher among patients with severe symptoms) and early mitral valve surgery is associated with reduced mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8149.html" rel="external">"Chronic primary mitral regurgitation: Indications for intervention"</a>.)</p><p>Limited data are available on the effect of surgical treatment on PVL. In an observational study of 96 patients with mitral PVL with mean follow-up of five years, the mortality rate at follow-up was 12 percent among patients treated with valve reoperation compared with 26 percent for patients treated conservatively [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In addition, there were significant improvements in mean hematocrit levels and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV symptoms after surgery.</p><p>However, surgical management of prosthetic regurgitation is limited by the high risk of the procedure, with survival varying from 40 to 50 percent at 10 years and operative mortality rates around 5 to 10 percent [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. As an example, in an observational study of 155 patients undergoing redo aortic valve surgery, operative mortality was 4.5 percent [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In a series of 282 patients undergoing reoperation for mitral bioprosthetic failure, an operative mortality rate of 7.4 percent was observed [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The operative mortality following redo prosthetic valve replacement is generally higher than that for primary valve replacement (eg, 4.6 versus 2.2 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. However, some studies have found that a nonurgent redo procedure in patients with NYHA functional class I/II symptoms and absence of active endocarditis has the same surgical risk as a first valve surgery [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>It is not clearly known whether surgical risks and outcomes differ with PVLs versus transvalvular regurgitation, but observational data suggest that PVLs results tend to be worse, with less complete surgical correction [<a href="#rid5">5,11</a>]. As an example, in a series of 122 patients with symptomatic mitral or aortic PVL who underwent surgery, PVL repair was feasible in 65 percent and prosthetic valve replacement was required in 35 percent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Mortality at 30 days was 10.7 percent. Two patients (1.6 percent) with residual severe mitral PVL were treated successfully with redo surgery before discharge and one additional patient underwent redo surgery during follow-up (median of seven years). Actuarial survival was 39 percent at 12 years.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3304869477"><span class="h5">For asymptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For operable patients with asymptomatic severe prosthetic regurgitation, redo surgery is suggested since such patients are likely to require surgical intervention soon, and the risk of surgical intervention is considerably lower when the patient is asymptomatic than after severe symptoms of HF develop [<a href="#rid7">7,10</a>]. Acute bioprosthetic valve failure with acute aortic regurgitation or acute mitral regurgitation is a cause of acute HF and cardiogenic shock [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. However, the risk of acute decompensation in patients with asymptomatic severe prosthetic regurgitation is unknown.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3476316330"><span class="h4">On transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A transcatheter VIV procedure involves catheter-based valve implantation inside an already implanted failed (stenotic, regurgitant, or both) bioprosthetic valve.

A variety of devices are used off label to close PVLs since there are no devices specifically designed and approved for this purpose, and procedures are often long and technically demanding. General anesthesia is also required, with proper anticoagulation, especially if transseptal puncture is performed. Percutaneous closure is often assisted by fluoroscopy in combination with transesophageal echocardiography, and sometimes intracardiac echocardiography is also required to locate anterior PVLs. Also, computed tomography transesophageal echocardiography fusion images can provide intraprocedural guidance [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Percutaneous closure of PVL can be approached from various options: transapical, transaortic, or transseptal. Most aortic PVLs can be successfully handled from retrograde transaortic approach, while mitral PVLs are technically more challenging, with the transapical approach providing the most versatile access.</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis included 12 studies with a total of 362 patients with mechanical or bioprosthetic valves who underwent transcatheter reduction of PVL [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]; the three largest studies contributed more than half of the patients [<a href="#rid22">22,24,25</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Technical success (defined as successful delivery of the device) occurred in 82.3 percent of mitral procedures and 86.9 percent of aortic procedures.
