         Hemophilia A (factor VIII [factor 8] deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX [factor 9] deficiency) are X-linked coagulation factor disorders associated with bleeding of variable severity, from life-threatening to clinically silent. The availability of factor replacement products has dramatically improved care for individuals with these conditions. However, patients do present with acute bleeding symptoms that require rapid treatment, and planning is required for patients undergoing surgery or invasive procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review discusses the treatment of bleeding and perioperative management for individuals with hemophilia A and B. Our approach is consistent with the World Federation of Hemophilia Guideline updated in 2020 (available at

         In patients with hemophilia with acute bleeding, the immediate goal is to raise the factor activity to a level sufficient to achieve hemostasis. The targeted factor activity level depends on the location and severity of the bleeding, the expected half-life of the product administered, and the presence of an associated injury or occurrence in a target joint, as outlined in the sections that follow.
        </p>
        <p>
         The data to support the desired factor levels for treating acute bleeding come from extensive clinical experience and uncontrolled, observational studies [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Randomized trials comparing different target factor levels have not been conducted.

         Serious or life-threatening bleeding in a patient with hemophilia is a medical emergency that requires immediate therapy with replacement factor and prompt evaluation. For patients with potentially serious or life-threatening bleeding, it is important to initiate treatment
         <strong>
          immediately
         </strong>
         , even before the diagnostic assessment is completed. Stated another way:

        <p>
         An acutely hemorrhaging hemophilic patient should be transported to a facility equipped to handle the event that has the appropriate replacement or bypassing products and the ability to monitor the patient using specialized coagulation testing [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Guidelines from the United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organization (UKHCDO) suggest that the maximum time between arrival to the hospital and clinical assessment should not exceed 15 minutes, and if treatment for bleeding is required, the maximum time to its delivery should not exceed 30 minutes [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient has the appropriate replacement therapy at home (or with them, if traveling), the product may be administered before leaving or on route to the facility, as long as the bleeding is not life-threatening and this does not result in delays. In life-threatening circumstances, emergency medical transport should be called and the product should be administered as soon as possible, including on-route if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, factor administration should not be delayed while awaiting imaging studies in a patient with a concerning injury or suspected central nervous system bleeding [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,9,10
         </a>
         ]. All significant head injuries must be considered nontrivial unless proven otherwise by observation and imaging (eg, with computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). If there is doubt about the seriousness of bleeding, it is preferable to treat the patient as if the bleeding is serious (ie, "if in doubt, treat" [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]). Further, the importance of urgently giving the factor infusion outweighs considerations of the specific factor preparation (ie, "give the appropriate product that is available rather than spending time trying to obtain a different product").
        </p>
        <p>
         Other hemostatic therapies for individuals with inhibitors or those whose bleeding is not controlled by factor infusion are presented below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Inhibitors'
         </a>

         For severe bleeding, the factor activity level should be maintained
         <strong>
          above 50 percent at all times.
         </strong>
         An exception is individuals receiving
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115772" href="/z/d/drug information/115772.html" rel="external">
          emicizumab
         </a>
         , for whom factor activity measurements will be falsely increased due to assay interference, and a bovine substrate-based assay is needed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with hemophilia A receiving emicizumab'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         For those on factor replacement, an immediate dose of factor should be given to raise the peak factor level to 80 to 100 percent  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110820" href="/z/d/graphic/110820.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), and additional doses should be timed to occur when a factor activity level of approximately 50 percent is anticipated (or documented), so the patient's circulating factor level does not drop below 50 percent. Another option is to give a dose of factor to raise the level to 80 to 100 percent, followed by continuous infusion to maintain a consistent hemostatic level. As noted above, administration of factor should not be delayed while awaiting imaging studies. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial considerations for severe bleeding'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The following illustrates a typical calculation of factor dosing, but this should not substitute for the clinical judgment of the treating clinician, information from previous bleeding events for that patient, labeling information for specific products, consultation with the hemophilia treatment center (HTC), and/or institutional protocols that take into account local practices.

         –
         <strong>
          Give an initial dose of factor VIII of 50 international units/kg
         </strong>
         to raise the factor VIII level to 100 percent. This calculation assumes a starting factor VIII activity level close to 0 percent, a desired factor activity level of 100 percent, and a distribution that remains primarily intravascular (volume of distribution of approximately 0.5 dL/kg).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The dose equals the patient's weight (in kg) multiplied by the desired rise in factor VIII level (as a whole number, such that a desired level of 100 percent is entered as 100) multiplied by a factor that corrects for the volume of distribution (for factor VIII, this equals 0.5). As an example, for a 60 kg patient who requires an increase to 100 percent, the dose would be 60 kg x 100 x 0.5 = 3000 international units of factor VIII.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The second and subsequent doses are given at intervals of approximately one half-life of the infused product for that patient, which is based on peak and trough levels as described below. A typical half-life for standard half-life factor VIII products is approximately 8 to 12 hours. Approximate half-lives for extended half-life factor VIII products range from 10 to 20 hours. Approximate half-lives for specific products are listed in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109838" href="/z/d/graphic/109838.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). These doses will be approximately half the initial dose, and will be guided by the patient's measured factor level and the desired peak level.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Another option is to give the initial factor VIII bolus followed by a continuous infusion [

          factor VIII concentrate
         </a>
         will often maintain the level initially achieved by the bolus infusion. This method offers the advantage of consistent levels, the need for less frequent monitoring, and decreased factor use over time. Factor activity levels should be checked periodically during continuous infusion, with the interval determined by the previous level, dose adjustments, and clinical bleeding. Continuous infusions should not have an attached filter, and the factor product should only be mixed with normal

As an example, for a 60 kg patient who requires an increase to 100 percent, the dose would be 60 kg x 100 x 1 = 6000 international units of factor IX. Some factor IX products have a different volume of distribution or decreased distribution to extravascular spaces, and dosing may vary by product:

         The second and subsequent doses are given at intervals of approximately one half-life of the infused product for that patient, which is based on peak and trough levels as described below. A typical half-life for standard half-life factor IX products is approximately 18 to 24 hours. Approximate half-lives for extended half-life factor IX products range from 54 to 104 hours. Approximate half-lives for specific products are listed in the table  (

         </a>
         will often maintain the level initially achieved by bolus infusion. This method offers the advantage of consistent levels, need for less frequent monitoring, and decreased factor utilization over time. Factor activity levels should be checked periodically during continuous infusion, with the interval determined by the previous level, dose adjustments, and clinical bleeding. Continuous infusions should not have an attached filter and the factor product should only be mixed with normal
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, subsequent factor dosing for patients receiving bolus doses of factor should incorporate information on the patient's peak and trough factor activity levels (or steady state levels for those receiving continuous infusion) rather than a set schedule without monitoring. This is because individual pharmacokinetics vary and can significantly impact factor half-life and ultimate hemostasis. The volume of distribution may vary by patient and can be affected by acute hemorrhage and body fat content [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The peak factor activity level should be checked approximately 5 to 15 minutes after the first dose. Initial dosing may result in lower-than-expected trough levels if there is ongoing bleeding, particularly after major surgery. For major life-threatening bleeding, the trough is checked at approximately 4 to 6 hours after initial dosing for factor VIII and 8 to 12 hours after initial dosing for factor IX. Slightly longer intervals before the first trough level may be used for less-serious bleeding. After initial dosing, monitoring may need to be tailored to the expected half-life of the product being used.
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, for patients receiving bolus doses of factor, the second and subsequent doses will be given at intervals of approximately one half-life. If the trough factor activity is lower than expected, the dosing interval may be shortened and/or the subsequent dose increased depending on peak levels. If the trough factor activity level is higher than expected, the dosing interval may be increased and/or the subsequent dose may be lowered.
        </p>
        <p>
         The duration of factor replacement therapy for severe or potentially serious bleeding is individualized based upon a variety of issues including need for surgery, extent of bleeding, site of bleeding, presence of an injury or target joint, and response (eg, reduction in bleeding, healing) to infusion therapy. Therapy may be continued after acute intensive treatment as the patient may require physical therapy or rehabilitation and may need to use prophylactic dosing until full recovery is achieved.

         , we start treatment as soon as possible at the time of injury and often treat for at least three days, including significant trauma with negative imaging. For documented intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), prolonged therapy (eg, for three weeks) is generally required, followed by a period of prophylaxis. Late bleeding following head trauma can occur up to three to four weeks following the event. Thus, individuals with head trauma or other severe bleeding should be instructed about signs of late or recurrent bleeding, plans for factor dosing should these occur, and parameters for seeking medical attention. This includes instructions about the signs and symptoms of central nervous system bleeding, so that repeat infusion, clinical and radiological assessment, and hospitalization occur at the earliest manifestation.

         Bleeding into a joint (hemarthrosis) is one of the most common manifestations of hemophilia. Joint bleeds are characterized by reduced range of motion associated with pain or other unusual sensation (eg, tingling that often precedes pain), palpable swelling or warmth, or other typical findings for that patient. Bleeding into hip joints is concerning due to the greater risk of increased intra-articular pressure and osteonecrosis of the femoral head. (See

         Some patients develop a "target joint" in which repeated bleeding episodes and chronic inflammatory changes occur. (See

         Additional interventions to reduce bleeding, pain, and inflammation include avoidance of weight bearing or use of the affected extremity, application of ice packs, immobilization and/or splinting as recommended, and analgesics as needed (generally avoiding agents with antiplatelet activity such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [NSAIDs], although these may be used in some circumstances such as significant joint inflammation in a patient receiving factor replacement). Selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors may be used.

         Clinical evaluation is used to distinguish an acute bleed from other conditions such as pain due to chronic arthropathy, acute fracture or sprain, or infection. In many cases, this assessment is based on the history and physical examination rather than radiography or ultrasound examinations.

         It may be challenging to distinguish hemarthrosis of the hip from bleeding into the iliopsoas muscle. In general, hemarthrosis of the hip results in severe pain with hip motion, whereas iliopsoas bleeding primarily causes limited hip extension. Iliopsoas bleeding may also cause reduced sensation over the ipsilateral thigh due to compression of the sacral plexus root of the femoral nerve. Ultrasonography or other radiologic evaluation may be helpful in identifying hematoma in the iliopsoas region versus the hip joint. (See

         If a target joint has undergone repeated hemorrhage, we often administer a short course of glucocorticoids as appropriate to reduce pain and swelling associated with synovial inflammation (eg,

A benefit from a short course of glucocorticoids was demonstrated in a pair of trials that randomly assigned 35 children with hemophilia and a joint bleed to receive prednisone (1 mg per pound of body weight per day [equivalent to approximately 0.45 mg/kg; maximum dose, 80 mg] for three days) or placebo along with factor replacement therapy [

         It can be challenging to determine when acute bleeding into a joint has stopped. Patient report of bleeding is most commonly used, and ultrasound may be helpful as well. Most experts continue to treat with a course of therapy designed to allow bleed resolution and prevent rebleeding based upon patient circumstances and the presence of a target joint, injury, or inhibitor. The duration of therapy depends on the joint affected, the size of the hemarthrosis, and the ability to avoid weight bearing, which affects the pace of healing. Some experts treat for approximately three to four days after bleeding has stopped; questions should be directed to the local HTC.

         Following resolution of a joint bleed, it is important to initiate a rehabilitation program that involves gradual increased range of motion, weight bearing, and strength training. Attention to bone health (eg, adequate vitamin D and knowledge regarding the presence of osteopenia) is also indicated. Involvement of a physical therapist with expertise in hemophilia to design a rehabilitative program is helpful. Individuals who are not receiving routine prophylaxis should consider using a form of prophylaxis including limited short-term prophylaxis following recurrent target joint hemarthrosis, with factor administration for several weeks to months to reduce or prevent recurrent bleeding, or to use a more aggressive dosing schedule in individuals who are already receiving routine prophylaxis. Prophylaxis is discussed separately. (See

This should be done at home, if possible (ie, do not wait until being evaluated at the hospital). For bleeding into the hip, iliopsoas, or a target joint; or bleeding associated with injury, higher factor levels (eg, 80 to 100 percent) are used (see

         The need for additional doses and the duration of therapy are individualized according to the patient's symptoms, affected joint, concurrent issues (bleeding into the hip, iliopsoas muscle, or a target joint; or bleeding associated with injury), and initial response.
        </p>
        <p>
         For some patients who are able to identify the early symptoms of a joint bleed and rapidly administer factor, a single dose of factor may be sufficient. However, some comprehensive treatment centers use more intensive therapy for hemarthroses for specific patients or all patients (eg, for hemophilia A, an initial factor VIII dose of 40 units/kg followed by additional doses of 20 units/kg at 24 and 72 hours after the first dose; for hemophilia B, an initial factor IX dose to provide a target level of 80 percent activity followed by additional doses to provide 40 percent activity, with the interval determined by the half-life of the factor IX product used) [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         At the other extreme, some individuals may require several days of factor infusion to allow bleed resolution and reduce the risk of rebleeding for a severe bleed, a bleed into a target joint, or a bleed with concurrent injury. Hip joint or acetabular hemorrhages may result in increased intra-articular pressure and osteonecrosis (aseptic necrosis) of the femoral head [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Therapy designed to sustain a factor level above a minimum of 30 to 40 percent for at least three days should be given, along with enforced bed rest; often this is done in the hospital using continuous infusion.

         Muscle bleeding may present with aching, stiffness, pain, or swelling. In muscle groups such as the upper arm, forearm, wrist, volar hand, and anterior or posterior tibial compartment, soft tissue hemorrhage may result in development of a compartment syndrome with impingement on the neurovascular bundle. This may be associated with tingling, numbness, and in severe situations loss of distal arterial pulses.
        </p>
        <p>
         Therapy should be initiated as soon as possible (eg, at the first sign of symptoms or immediately after injury or trauma). For severe muscle hematomas, a peak factor activity level of at least 50 percent is appropriate. This requires treatment/factor replacement therapy for individuals with any degree of factor deficiency in hemophilia A and B. For individuals with mild hemophilia A, it may be possible to raise the factor VIII level using DDAVP [

         Severe muscle bleeds usually require more than one factor infusion. Surgical decompression is undertaken only if medical therapy fails to forestall progression, and in consultation with a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center. (See

         Planning for elective surgery should include the patient, family/caregivers, and all relevant clinicians to ensure that best practices are followed. Collaboration with experts from a hemophilia treatment center to develop a hemostatically effective and safe care plan is strongly advised. A comprehensive plan for management before, during, and after the procedure, and excellent communication between the operative physician, anesthesiologist, patient, family/caregivers, and the hematologist is required to assure an optimal outcome [

         Surgery should be performed in a setting that includes timely access to laboratory monitoring of factor activity levels and immediate availability of replacement factor (or plasma components, in resource-limited settings) and other hemostatic products, and clinicians with expertise in managing patients with hemophilia. Meticulous operative technique should be used, with local hemostatic agents as appropriate.

         Desired factor levels and duration of therapy depend on the type of procedure, as described below, with longer durations for greater bleeding risk procedures or procedures where healing requires a longer duration of coverage. DDAVP may be used in patients with mild hemophilia A who have been demonstrated to have an adequate response and in appropriate procedures (eg, dental procedures). Antifibrinolytics are often useful in dental procedures or other interventions affecting mucosal surfaces. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Major surgery'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who require perioperative factor administration, the initial (preoperative) dose should be timed to provide maximal coverage at the time of greatest bleeding risk (typically 30 to 60 minutes before the procedure). The dose is calculated from the patient's weight, baseline factor level, desired factor level, volume of distribution, and presence of an inhibitor as described in the dosing sections above. For the first dose, we assume the baseline factor level to be 0 percent. It is generally not necessary to subtract the patient's baseline factor activity level.
        </p>
        <p>
         After infusion, the factor level should be checked before proceeding with the operative intervention for all procedures other than routine outpatient dental procedures. In a patient who has been receiving
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115772" href="/z/d/drug information/115772.html" rel="external">
          emicizumab
         </a>
         , a bovine substrate-based chromogenic factor VIII assay must be used. In a patient with an inhibitor who is using bypassing therapy, there is no coagulation test that reflects clinical efficacy; therefore, laboratory monitoring of factor activity levels is not used.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequent dosing is based on the plan of care developed, the patient's clinical status, and the measured levels, which if bolus dosing is used are typically measured at 8 to 12 hours after the previous dose for factor VIII and 12 to 24 hours after the previous dose for factor IX [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>
         ]. In addition, levels are often obtained in the recovery room to assure adequate hemostasis.
        </p>
        <p>
         If there is unexpected postoperative bleeding, it is important to obtain an immediate (stat) factor level and to consider the possibility that bleeding may be due to an anatomic or mechanical cause (eg, need for ligation of blood vessels) if adequate hemostatic factor levels are documented.
        </p>
        <p>
         The efficacy and safety of extended half-life factor VIII products (recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion; PEGylated recombinant factor VIII) has been demonstrated in small studies in which patients with hemophilia A were managed perioperatively for major and minor surgeries and had excellent hemostasis without serious adverse events [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31
         </a>
         ]. Wider clinical experience has accumulated since the licensure of these products, and experience supports the safety and efficacy seen in earlier studies. Product consistency during outpatient and inpatient use is a consideration, and if the patient uses a longer-lasting product or specific product at home, we use the same product in the hospital if possible. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Breakthrough bleeding during prophylaxis with a longer-lasting factor'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with mild hemophilia A and those who have received intensive factor replacement for the first time should be re-screened for inhibitors at the completion of therapy, and at approximately two to three weeks postoperatively [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Patients for whom factor administration is ineffective and those requiring higher than expected doses of factor may also require earlier inhibitor screening. (See

         Major surgery includes any surgery with a risk of clinically significant bleeding or penetration of a major body cavity, including orthopedic surgery. Decisions regarding major surgery are best made in close consultation between the patient and an experienced multidisciplinary team including a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center hematologist (to confirm that factor replacement and other hemostatic therapies are optimally administered) and the surgeon (to assess the feasibility of the procedure and likelihood of efficacy) [

        <p>
         For the management of major surgery in which postoperative continuous infusion is planned, the infusion is often started before the surgery, after the initial bolus is administered. Factor VIII and factor IX clearance is increased during surgery (consumption is increased) due to expected operative blood loss. A follow-up bolus may be needed before initiating the continuous infusion. This is especially pertinent to orthopedic procedures.

         Orthopedic procedures are the most commonly performed major surgical procedures in people with hemophilia. Joint surgery may be indicated in some cases of chronic synovitis or arthropathy. Various procedures may be offered, including:

         A 2016 meta-analysis of studies evaluating the role of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in people with hemophilia reviewed outcomes of 336 procedures in 254 individuals and found an overall improvement in range of motion, although not as great as that of individuals without hemophilia [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32

         Individuals with hemophilia can undergo any type of major surgery (eg, cancer surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) as long as factor replacement is given and adequate hemostasis assured. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The target factor activity level and duration of therapy are individualized according to the patient and procedure. Most recommendations, including the 2020 World Federation of Hemophilia guideline, use a desired preoperative factor level for major surgery of 80 to 100 percent for hemophilia A and 60 to 80 percent for hemophilia B, with postoperative levels gradually tapering to approximately 50 percent until the wound is healed (typically over a period of 10 to 14 days) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         At our center, we generally do not administer factor prior to the procedure if circumcision is performed via a method such as a the Plastibell device, because bleeding is generally not excessive. However, we ensure that replacement factor is available at the time of the procedure should it be needed. If circumcision is performed via a method such as a the Gomco clamp, then one dose of replacement therapy (the smallest vial size available) is administered prior to the procedure; in addition, local hemostatic therapies may be used and the family/caregiver is educated to assure the wound is not disrupted.

         Observation post-procedure is likely to require a longer period than used for neonates without hemophilia. If postoperative bleeding occurs, further or initial replacement therapy is required as well as use of local hemostatic agents. Prolonged bleeding may require additional doses.

         Fibrin glue (also called fibrin sealant) comes as a kit made from plasma-derived clotting proteins that is applied to the external surface of a wound as a spray or patch. The products contain concentrated fibrinogen (the precursor of fibrin) and coagulation factor XIII, which crosslinks fibrin. Fibrin sealant can be used for those with hemophilia with bleeding that cannot be controlled with local measures. This product lessens the need for factor replacement and is not associated with some of the risks and expense of factor administration [

Of 64 respondents, 2 (3 percent) would not allow the procedure unless there was a urologic indication, 18 (28 percent) would perform the procedure at the time of another procedure that required factor administration, and 20 (31 percent) would defer the procedure until the child was older. The remaining 24 (38 percent) would perform the procedure (some reluctantly). All respondents stated they would use at least one dose of factor before the procedure; approximately one-third used two or three doses; and an additional 12 (19 percent) used more prolonged therapy. Most used a target factor level of approximately 75 percent; often a level of 100 percent or higher is used because the smallest vial size provides this level for a small infant, and the entire vial is given so as not to waste the product. Approximately one-third used antifibrinolytic therapy, and smaller numbers used fibrin glue,

         Tonsillectomy is a high-risk procedure in individuals with hemophilia. In particular, the risk of bleeding from tonsillectomy may be especially concerning because the bleeding may be not only oral but also retropharyngeal; the latter may be associated with airway compromise. Delayed bleeding is a significant risk and can lead to hypotension and shock. Due to the location of potential bleeding, attention to hemostasis is especially important.

         Factor replacement is used for those with severe or moderate (and often mild) hemophilia, typically for a prolonged period of at least several days. An antifibrinolytic agent is always used.

         For children and adults with hemophilia undergoing invasive dental procedures that require factor replacement, a target factor level above 50 percent for one to two days is usually sufficient; this often can be achieved with one infusion of factor plus antifibrinolytic therapy. Factor infusions should be scheduled in such a way that the number of infusions is minimized. Dosing to achieve the appropriate factor level is described above. (See

         For adults with moderate to severe hemophilia, certain dental procedures may not require factor infusion; examples include buccal infiltration, inter-papillary injection, endodontic (root canal) treatment, and intra-ligamentary injections. However, we do have patients infuse factor for lower posterior root canals. For adults undergoing dental extractions, the use of sutures and topical hemostatic gelatin matrices or cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives may minimize bleeding. (See

         Management of bleeding or surgery in a patient with an inhibitor (neutralizing alloantibody against infused factor) is especially challenging because inhibitors bind to the infused factor and render it ineffective. Inhibitors are much more likely to occur in individuals with hemophilia A and those with severe disease. Some patients may only become aware that they have an inhibitor in the midst of an acute bleeding episode or surgery, when factor infusions no longer raise factor activity levels to the expected range or if there is an allergic/anaphylactic reaction to the infusion, as seen in some patients with factor IX deficiency. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1308.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Any patient with an inhibitor is best treated in consultation with a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center, especially when a decision is being made to administer the factor in which they are deficient rather than to use bypassing therapy. This is particularly true for individuals receiving

         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Protocols for managing inhibitors should be available at each institution that cares for patients with hemophilia. The local hemophilia treatment center can assist in developing general protocols and protocols for specific patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107911.html" rel="external">
          "Hemophilia A and B: Routine management including prophylaxis", section on 'Hemophilia treatment centers'

        </p>
        <p>
         Management of bleeding or surgery in patients with inhibitors depends on the severity of bleeding and the type and titer of the inhibitor [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Inhibitors are diagnosed and classified by titer using the Bethesda assay, in which serial dilution of patient plasma is used to determine an inhibitor titer in Bethesda units (BU). Inhibitors with a titer of &lt;5 BU despite repeated factor infusions are referred to as low-responding inhibitors [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. Any inhibitor ≥5 BU/mL at any time is considered high responding, even if the titer subsequently becomes undetectable due to lack of re-exposure. Classically, high-responding inhibitors rapidly increase upon re-exposure to infused factor in an anamnestic response that takes four to seven days. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1308.html" rel="external">
          "Inhibitors in hemophilia: Mechanisms, prevalence, diagnosis, and eradication", section on 'Terminology and definitions'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Individuals with an inhibitor titer of ≥5 BU and those with an unknown titer but with a known high-responding inhibitor are less likely to be effectively treated with factor infusions in an emergency situation because the quantity of circulating antibody is likely too great to be overcome by factor infusion.

         For patients with a high-responding inhibitor whose current titer is &lt;5 BU, it may be possible in some circumstances to treat them with factor coverage; this decision should only be made in consultation with a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center as anamnesis is expected.

         For a patient with a titer ≥5 BU with a high-responding inhibitor and serious bleeding with a need for major surgery, a bypassing product is used. (See

         In an emergency setting when a patient is receiving factor infusions and factor activity level does not increase at one hour post-infusion (or bleeding does not respond to factor infusion and a factor activity level or inhibitor titer is not available), the patient should be treated as if they have a high titer/high-responding inhibitor until inhibitor testing with a Bethesda assay can be performed. The main caveats are that the original hemophilia A or B diagnosis is correct, the correct replacement factor was given, there is no heparin contamination in the sample, and the assay is performed correctly (including the use of a bovine substrate-based factor assay in individuals receiving

         A bypassing product is generally the first choice in a patient with hemophilia A or B who has a high titer inhibitor and requires treatment for bleeding or surgery. These clotting factor products contain an activated form of a clotting factor in the coagulation cascade. Activated factor VII (factor VIIa) can directly activate factor X, bypassing the need for factors VIII and IX. Available products include recombinant human factor VII (rFVIIa; including NovoSeven, NovoSeven RT, and SevenFact) and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8434" href="/z/d/drug information/8434.html" rel="external">
          activated prothrombin complex concentrate
         </a>
         (aPCC), such as FEIBA (factor eight inhibitor bypassing agent; the only aPCC available in most settings)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94210" href="/z/d/graphic/94210.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). The rFVIIa products are also appropriate in individuals with hemophilia A who have critical bleeding while receiving
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115772" href="/z/d/drug information/115772.html" rel="external">

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Both rFVIIa products and FEIBA contain activated clotting factors, and both are effective for hemostasis in hemophilia. For hemophilia B with an inhibitor, rFVIIa products are preferred agent because they do not contain factor IX; this is especially true in individuals with hemophilia B with an inhibitor who have experienced reactions or anaphylaxis upon exposure to factor IX. For hemophilia A, either product can be used. If the patient has had a favorable response with one of these products, it is reasonable to use the same product again.

Standard interval dosing is generally continued for at least 48 to 72 hours for severe bleeding or major surgery (generally 72 hours or longer for major surgery; shorter durations for minor surgery), followed by a taper in which the dosing interval is gradually increased. In cases of severe uncontrolled bleeding, it is important to remember that therapy with one bypassing product may be effective even if the other bypassing product has failed. Also, the patient may have a surgical, traumatic, or anatomic reason for continued bleeding that may need to be addressed surgically or endoscopically. In rare cases of ongoing joint bleeding, arterial embolization has been used [

At six hours post-bleeding, the overall efficacy of FEIBA and rFVIIa were similar (81 and 79 percent, respectively); other time points and efficacy measures did not show one product to be clearly superior. However, some individual patients derived greater efficacy from one product or the other, especially during the first 12 hours.

This product was previously used to treat patients with hemophilia A who had life-threatening bleeding complicated by high titer inhibitors to human factor VIII, most commonly when titers against porcine factor VIII were below 10 BU [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55-57

         A final option for an individual with bleeding and an inhibitor is to provide high-dose factor infusion. This approach may be effective for patients with hemophilia A or B and a low titer (&lt;5 BU) or a low-responding inhibitor, as long as the patient does not have an infusion reaction to the replacement factor (reactions are most commonly seen with factor IX inhibitors). High-dose factor also may be useful for patients with high-responding inhibitors currently at a low titer or a titer lowered by plasmapheresis, with the understanding that this is only likely to be effective for a limited time period (four to seven days) and is likely to induce anamnesis [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Dosing in this setting has not been established from prospective trials. One approach is to administer the full replacement dose as described for a patient without an inhibitor above, plus an additional 50 percent correction for every BU of inhibitor. As an example, for a 60 kg patient with factor VIII deficiency and an inhibitor of 2 BU who requires correction to 100 percent factor activity, the patient would be given the usual replacement dose (60 kg x 100 x 0.5 = 3000 international units of factor VIII) plus an additional (2 BU x 60 kg x 50 x 0.5 = 3000 international units of factor VIII) for a total of 6000 units of factor VIII.
        </p>
        <p>
         This may be followed by bolus dosing, based on factor activity level measured 10 to 15 minutes after the infusion is completed, or by continuous infusion, at a starting rate adequate to compensate for altered pharmacokinetics based on the presence of an inhibitor, with dose adjustments based on factor activity levels.

         Management of bleeding is the same as for other patients, with factor infusion to maintain the factor level above the threshold determined necessary for the location and severity of bleeding. The calculations for dosing generally assume that the patient is at their baseline level (ie, calculations should be the same as for any other patients). (See

         For elective surgery, it is best to use the same longer-lasting factor that the patient uses at home, as this simplifies care and potentially simplifies issues of adverse events and the difficulty in determining how to ascribe these if changing products. Issues related to the use of longer-lasting products for surgical procedures are essentially the same as for standard half-life products and include use of appropriate monitoring assays for levels and assurance of adequate hemostatic levels. Use of longer-lasting products may reduce the number of infusions needed during and after procedures, depending on the product, the patient, and the individual half-life. It is important to use an assay for factor activity that is tailored to the specific factor being used [

         Individuals with mild hemophilia (factor level between 5 and 49 percent) may require factor replacement therapy for acute bleeding, surgery, or invasive procedures. It is important to remember that patients with mild hemophilia are also at risk of inhibitor development and should be followed closely during times of intensive replacement therapy. Knowledge of the specific genetic variant may help in predicting the risk of inhibitor development (see

         Purified factor products (virally inactivated plasma-derived concentrates or recombinant products) should be used whenever possible, to avoid potential transfusion-transmitted infection and transfusion reactions. However, individuals in resource-poor settings may not have access to these products. For such individuals, options include Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), or, for those with hemophilia A, Cryoprecipitate. Dosing is based on the factor concentration in the product, patient weight, and the desired factor level. One bag of Cryoprecipitate is made from approximately 250 mL of FFP and contains approximately 70 to 80 units of factor VIII in a volume of 30 to 40 mL (concentration of factor VIII in Cryoprecipitate, approximately 3 to 5 units/mL) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. One mL of FFP contains one unit of factor activity. A dose of 15 to 20 mL/kg will raise the factor VIII level by approximately 30 to 40 percent and the factor IX level by approximately 15 to 20 percent (different increases are due to different volumes of distribution of factors VIII and IX).

          39,59

         The test dose is generally performed as part of routine comprehensive care. If not done previously it should be performed at least one week prior to use for hemostasis, to allow review of the results, surgical planning, and communication among treating clinicians. Details of the test dose are described separately. (See

         For those who respond, a typical dose is 0.3 mcg/kg (maximum dose, 20 to 30 mcg), administered intravenously or subcutaneously; or as a nasal spray (Stimate), one puff (150 mcg) in one nostril in patients weighing &lt;50 kg and two puffs (150 mcg in both nostrils) in patients weighing ≥50 kg. For adults, a repeat dose may be given at 12 hours, and subsequent doses are often administered once daily, as long as the individual is under the supervision of a hemophilia expert. Administration of DDAVP is usually no longer than three days due to tachyphylaxis and hyponatremia risk. When using the nasal spray it is important to use the spray intended for hemostasis and not the spray for enuresis, which has a lower concentration.

         DDAVP can increase the factor VIII level two- to fourfold. A patient with a baseline factor activity of 25 percent who has an increase to 50 percent may have adequate hemostasis with DDAVP in the setting of minor bleeding or procedures and thus avoid factor infusion. Tachyphylaxis may occur; the administration should be timed to provide the maximal response at the time of greatest bleeding risk, while limiting the number of doses.

        <p>
         In rare patients with mild hemophilia A who have mild bleeding and wish to avoid factor infusion but have not been tested for DDAVP response, it may be reasonable to use DDAVP, especially if a post-dose factor VIII level is obtained; however, evidence to support this practice is lacking. Effective therapy should not be delayed in a bleeding patient, which may occur if the response to DDAVP is not documented.

         If a person with hemophilia is hospitalized with COVID-19, we favor treating with anticoagulation (prophylactic or therapeutic dose, depending on the clinical scenario).

          Factor dosing for serious bleeds
         </strong>
         – For a patient with hemophilia who has serious life-threatening bleeding including any intracranial bleeding or head trauma, factor concentrate should be infused as urgently as possible to target a factor activity level of 80 to 100 percent  (

          Joint bleeding
         </strong>
         – Factor should also be infused promptly (within two hours of bleed identification), with a target factor activity level of approximately 50 percent (for hemophilia A, give 25 units/kg of factor VIII; for hemophilia B, give 50 to 60 units/kg of factor IX). Additional considerations include need for higher target levels in specific circumstances such as trauma, repeated factor infusions to assure adequate resolution, decisions regarding hospitalization, distinction from other conditions (infection, muscle bleeding), the need for arthrocentesis or a surgical procedure, appropriate rehabilitation, and optimal prophylactic therapy.

          Surgery
         </strong>
         – For elective surgery, coordination among the patient/family/caregivers and all relevant clinicians is essential. This should involve inhibitor screening, determination of desired factor activity levels, and planning for monitoring and factor administration. Certain sites of potential bleeding may be especially serious due to their location and possibility of causing airway compromise (retropharyngeal bleeding from tonsillectomy or impacted mandibular wisdom tooth extraction). Special considerations for monitoring apply to individuals receiving

          Inhibitors
         </strong>
         – Management of bleeding and surgery in patients with hemophilia with an inhibitor (neutralizing antibodies against infused factor) is challenging. For a patient with a high titer and high-responding inhibitor (≥5 Bethesda units) who has serious bleeding or requires major surgery, a bypassing product (FEIBA or recombinant factor VIIa) is used. For patients with a low-responding inhibitor, options include factor concentrates or other hemostatic agents. Individuals with inhibitors who are receiving
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115772" href="/z/d/drug information/115772.html" rel="external">
          emicizumab
         </a>
         can be treated with a bypassing agent, but special considerations apply to choice of product and dosing. Inhibitor eradication/immune tolerance induction should be addressed after recovery. (See
