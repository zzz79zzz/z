Several studies, including the landmark NSABP 18 trial, have demonstrated that administration of the same chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant versus adjuvant setting is associated with similar outcomes [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. While traditionally neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been used to downstage locally advanced and unresectable primary breast cancers, a number of studies have highlighted the role of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy as an alternative option to chemotherapy in HR-positive tumors, particularly for postmenopausal women.</p><p>In this topic, we will focus on the approaches and data specific to HR-positive breast cancers. For the purpose of this discussion, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual is used  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848" href="/d/graphic/110848.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); however, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/800.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>The rationale and general approach to neoadjuvant treatment is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14225.html" rel="external">"General principles of neoadjuvant management of breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2259486826"><span class="h1">GOALS AND INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of neoadjuvant therapy is to improve surgical outcomes by causing tumor shrinkage by providing effective systemic therapy. It is appropriate for many patients with locally advanced breast cancer (regardless of subtype), generally defined as stage III cancers, as well as the subset of IIB cancers with T3 disease. For those with stage II disease, either primary surgery or neoadjuvant therapy may be used, the latter being appropriate, for example, for the patient who desires breast-conserving surgery and is not a candidate due to a high tumor size: breast size ratio. It should be recognized, however, that HR-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative cancers are less likely to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than other biologic subtypes [<a href="#rid6">6-10</a>]. For patients with stage I, estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease, we generally prefer primary surgery rather than neoadjuvant therapy given that such patients are likely to have good surgical outcomes.</p><p>Further discussion of appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy is found elsewhere, including for those with HER2-positive disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14225.html" rel="external">"General principles of neoadjuvant management of breast cancer", section on 'Patient selection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106774.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1445425805"><span class="h1">THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1195272516"><span class="h2">Selection of treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The choice of neoadjuvant treatment is informed by studies in the adjuvant setting that include overall survival outcomes, as well as by studies in the neoadjuvant setting for which response rates and rates of breast-conserving therapy are the outcomes assessed.</p><p>Typically the choice of therapy is neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) followed by surgery, or upfront surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy, if indicated. All patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cancers should receive endocrine therapy in the adjuvant setting  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113540" href="/d/graphic/113540.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2155862955"><span class="h2">HER2-negative cancers</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1299179884"><span class="h3">Premenopausal women</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neoadjuvant therapy is typically indicated in women with larger tumors and/or locally advanced breast cancer. In such situations, most premenopausal women should receive chemotherapy rather than endocrine therapy. If a premenopausal woman refuses (or is not a good candidate for) neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we suggest proceeding to surgical treatment, if possible, rather than attempting NET. For such women who are concerned about the extent of definitive surgical treatment, NET may be offered, but patients should be advised that the data in this setting suggest superior outcomes with chemotherapy over endocrine therapy. (See <a class="local">'Premenopausal women'</a> below.)</p><p>Details regarding chemotherapy regimen selection and duration of treatment are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/122902.html" rel="external">"Choice of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'Choosing a regimen'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2937383443"><span class="h3">Postmenopausal women</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most postmenopausal women for whom neoadjuvant treatment is indicated receive chemotherapy, although endocrine therapy may be offered as an alternative for some women, as outlined below. Details regarding chemotherapy regimen selection are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/122902.html" rel="external">"Choice of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'Choosing a regimen'</a>.)</p><p>While historically NET has been reserved for patients with substantial comorbid health problems who would not tolerate chemotherapy, it is coming to be seen as a viable alternative for other patients, especially those with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, HR-positive tumors that are strongly ER positive. In such patients, it may allow for improved surgical outcomes and cosmesis.</p><p>Other investigational biomarkers are being studied to further define the most appropriate population to receive endocrine neoadjuvant therapy. (See <a class="local">'Biomarkers'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1857774609"><span class="h4">Medically fit</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most medically fit patients requiring neoadjuvant treatment, we treat with chemotherapy based on a robust literature documenting response rates and survival benefits [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, for those with HER2-negative tumors that are strongly HR positive, NET is an acceptable alternative option. Tumors that are more likely to respond to neoadjuvant endocrine treatment have strong HR expression (eg, ≥50 percent staining for ER or an Allred score of 7 or 8) and a low proliferative index (Ki67 &lt;10 or 15 percent). Further details regarding efficacy, selection of, and duration of endocrine therapy are found below. (See <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Choice of endocrine therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Duration of endocrine treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Response to endocrine therapy has been shown to correlate with levels of ER expression, as quantified by the Allred score. In a study of 324 postmenopausal women with HR-positive breast cancer randomly assigned to four months of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10064" href="/d/drug information/10064.html" rel="external">letrozole</a>, response rates among those with Allred scores of 7 to 8 were over 60 percent for letrozole and approximately 30 to 45 percent for tamoxifen, while response rates for patients with Allred scores of 0 to 2 were 0 percent [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Discussion of appropriate candidates for chemotherapy is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/757.html" rel="external">"Overview of the approach to early breast cancer in older women", section on 'Chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2039995969"><span class="h4">Medically frail</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease who are unfit for chemotherapy due to significant comorbidities or extent of disease, options include upfront surgery (if feasible) or NET, which can enable tumor volume reduction prior to resection under local anesthesia, possibly facilitating less extensive surgery. Further details regarding efficacy, selection of, and duration of endocrine therapy are found below. (See <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Choice of endocrine therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Duration of endocrine treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>For those who are unlikely to become surgical candidates regardless of their response to neoadjuvant treatment, primary endocrine therapy may be offered. In frail patients with a poor response to endocrine therapy, primary radiation therapy (RT) may also be an option. Patients can often receive endocrine therapy alone for years.

However, a limitation of using pCR to predict outcomes in patients with ER-positive disease is that only 2 to 10 percent of patients with ER-positive disease achieve a pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, though many more have favorable survival outcomes, possibly because of utilization of endocrine therapy in the adjuvant setting [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p>In the meta-analysis discussed above, among patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease, the pCR was positively associated with event-free survival (EFS: hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.71) and overall survival (OS: HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.71) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

At present, however, these biomarkers are investigational and should not be used in routine clinical decision-making.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Predictive biomarkers</strong> – Gene expression has been studied in multiple studies as a predictor of response to endocrine therapy. Examples of available data are as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The 21-gene Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) has been evaluated in several studies [<a href="#rid35">35-40</a>]. As in the adjuvant setting, a lower RS is associated with less benefit from chemotherapy and more benefit from endocrine therapy, and vice versa for a higher RS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For example, in a systematic review of seven studies involving 1744 patients who had an RS performed on a core needle biopsy specimen, followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the pCR rate was higher in the group with a high RS than in the group with a low-intermediate score (10.9 versus 1.1 percent) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. We note pCR has limited sensitivity in this setting, however. (See <a class="local">'Prognostic features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">On the other hand, in a separate study, among 87 postmenopausal women with HR-positive tumors &gt;3 cm treated with NET (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8780" href="/d/drug information/8780.html" rel="external">anastrozole</a>), patients with a low RS had a higher response rate (64 percent) compared with those who had an intermediate or high RS (31 percent for both groups) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Furthermore, there was a trend toward better relapse-free survival (RFS) among those with a low RS compared with those who had an intermediate or high RS (five-year RFS of 100 versus 84 and 73 percent, respectively), though the study had low statistical power due to small number of patients [<a href="#rid38">38,39</a>]. These data fit with the overall understanding that low-RS tumors are more sensitive to endocrine treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Similarly, in a retrospective study of 217 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, the 12-gene EndoPredict Molecular Score (MS) was associated with pCR to neoadjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy; tumors with low MS were unlikely to benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whereas a high MS predicted resistance to NET [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A four-gene predictor has been developed that classifies patients into likely responders or nonresponders based on measurement of baseline gene expression of two genes as well as gene expression of two proliferation genes at 14 days of treatment. In an initial test set of 73 patients the model was 96 percent accurate, and in a validation series of 44 patients a 93 percent accuracy rate was reported [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].

The mean reduction in tumor volume measured clinically at three months was 66 percent [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. However, pCR is variable within lobular cancers treated with either chemotherapy or endocrine therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Markers of response</strong> – While pCR rates are a standard outcome measure of the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy, they may not fully reflect the response to NET. The histology pattern of response differs between chemotherapy and hormone therapy, with chemotherapy producing significantly more complete pathologic responses and more responses that leave scattered foci of disease than hormone therapy [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. However, higher rates of central scarring are observed with endocrine therapy (58.5 percent) than for chemotherapy (2 percent), which may affect the natural history of the disease without resulting in pCR.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While contemporary attempts have been made to better evaluate the response to NET, all of these require further prospective validation and correlation with clinical outcome before incorporation into routine clinical practice [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Tools that have been studied include gene expression analyses [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]; the preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>], which takes into account tumor and nodal stage, level of ER expression, and Ki67 following NET; and measurement of Ki67 before and during treatment [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For example, data from the IMPACT trial suggest that measurement of residual proliferation after two weeks of neoadjuvant endocrine treatment, as assessed by Ki67, may predict relapse-free survival (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.4-3.1) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. While changes in Ki67 have been observed with neoadjuvant therapy in a number of studies [<a href="#rid29">29,50,51</a>], there was no relationship between response and change in Ki67 in the IMPACT study [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Although patients with elevated Ki67 after an initial period of NET may have a worse prognosis, limited evidence suggests that switching such patients to chemotherapy is not beneficial. In a subset of the ACOSOG Z1031B trial, in which 35 women with Ki67 &gt;10 percent after two to four weeks of neoadjuvant AI therapy were switched to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, only two women (5.7 percent) experienced a pCR [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. However, the low chemotherapy responsiveness could reflect a selection bias in the study population given the inclusion of postmenopausal women with strong hormone receptor-positive tumors deemed eligible for NET. The relationship between Ki67 and clinical outcomes is being further assessed in the POETIC and ALTERNATE trials. Early data from POETIC confirmed that a low proliferation rate on treatment (low Ki67) was a predictor of outcome with a much higher rate of events in the population with a high Ki67 [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1377738632"><span class="h4">Treatments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Investigational treatment strategies for patients with HR-positive disease include combinations of endocrine therapy with chemotherapy as well as targeted agents.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Goals and indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For premenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive disease who warrant neoadjuvant therapy, we recommend chemotherapy over endocrine therapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a class="local">'Premenopausal women'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For the majority of postmenopausal women with HR-positive disease who warrant neoadjuvant therapy, we suggest chemotherapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). For those with significant comorbidities, we use neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET). For those with tumors that are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative and strongly HR positive, NET is another option  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113540" href="/d/graphic/113540.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Medically fit'</a> above and <a class="local">'Medically frail'</a> above and <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chemotherapy can shrink HR-positive tumors and facilitate lesser surgery, but is less likely to achieve a pathologic complete response in HR-positive cancers, especially luminal A cancers, compared with more aggressive histologies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In postmenopausal women, NET is associated with similar response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, although it may take longer to achieve a response. Survival data with NET versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy are not yet available. (See <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with HR-positive disease receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the approach to chemotherapy regimen selection is similar to that of other biologic subtypes and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14225.html" rel="external">"General principles of neoadjuvant management of breast cancer", section on 'Neoadjuvant treatment options'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive disease receiving neoadjuvant therapy should usually be treated with a regimen that combines chemotherapy with HER2-directed agents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106774.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer", section on 'Components of therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For postmenopausal women receiving NET, we suggest aromatase inhibitors (AIs) rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> because of higher efficacy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_4" rel="external">Grade 2A</a>). Some women may, however, prefer the side effect profile of tamoxifen to that of AIs. For such women, tamoxifen is appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Choice of endocrine therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Our general approach is to administer NET for four to six months, though a longer duration of treatment may be utilized, if needed, to allow for breast-conserving surgery in patients who have stable disease or partial response to endocrine therapy. If progression of disease occurs at any point, we proceed directly to definitive surgical management. (See <a class="local">'Duration of endocrine treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>All patients with HR-positive breast cancer should continue with adjuvant endocrine therapy, regardless of whether it was administered in the neoadjuvant setting.
