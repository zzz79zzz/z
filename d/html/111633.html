The evaluation of BPVT and obstruction is linked to management since some therapies (such as valve surgery or a trial of anticoagulant therapy) may both identify the cause of prosthetic valve obstruction and treat it.</p><p>Factors influencing the choice of therapy include the acuity and severity of symptoms of obstruction and the cause of obstruction [<a href="#rid1">1,2,7-9</a>]. We favor not including thrombus size in selecting initial strategy for BPVT as thrombus size cannot be reliably quantified due to prosthesis imaging artifact, and data are lacking on the significance of thrombus size for bioprosthetic valves. Causes of obstruction other than thrombus or pannus (such as endocarditis) should be excluded. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113815.html" rel="external">"Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, and obstruction: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The vast majority of patients with BPVT are treated with anticoagulation alone. Of note, some patients with subclinical BPVT experience spontaneous resolution without use of anticoagulant therapy; this has been demonstrated with both transcatheter and surgically implanted aortic valve prostheses [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'For valve thrombosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'For valve thrombosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Referral to a multidisciplinary Heart Valve Team is recommended for patient with bioprosthetic valve obstruction and/or BPVT who may require fibrinolysis, valve surgery, or transcatheter valve intervention. (See <a class="local">'Referral to Heart Valve Team'</a> below.)</p><p>The approach described here is based largely on expert opinion. Randomized controlled data for the therapy of BPVT are not available, and each therapeutic option has important limitations, including risk of periprocedural morbidity and mortality with valve surgery or transcatheter intervention, risk of bleeding and systemic embolization with fibrinolytic therapy, and risk of failure to improve with intravenous heparin therapy. Similar recommendations are included in the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] and 2021 European Society of Cardiology valve disease guidelines [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1881821939"><span class="h1">FOR NO OR MILD SYMPTOMS OF OBSTRUCTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with BPVT, thromboembolism, or bioprosthetic valve obstruction with no or mild symptoms (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class I or II) of obstruction, management is aimed at treating any symptoms of heart failure (HF) and treating the obstruction (eg, thrombus or pannus) or source of thromboembolism.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3141517380"><span class="h2">Temporizing medical care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptomatic HF caused by obstruction is treated with cautious use of diuretics and antihypertensive agents, given the risk of hemodynamic instability with attempted therapy.

We suggest the following approach based on observational data and our clinical experience (see <a class="local">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> below):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trial of therapeutic anticoagulation</strong> – We suggest an initial 30-day trial of therapeutic oral anticoagulant plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> 75 to 100 mg orally daily.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>With no concurrent indication for anticoagulation</strong> – For patients with BPVT with no concurrent indication for anticoagulation (such as atrial fibrillation [AF]), vitamin K antagonist (VKA) is the preferred anticoagulant (target international normalized ratio [INR] generally 2.5). We do not routinely use therapeutic heparin bridging anticoagulation for minimally symptomatic patients, but this can be considered on an individual basis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Patients post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation should not be routinely treated with the combination of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC; also referred to as non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [NOAC]) plus antiplatelet agent in the absence of a concurrent indication for anticoagulation, given the excess risk of death or thromboembolic events identified with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/z/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">rivaroxaban</a> (10 mg daily) plus low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> in the GALILEO trial [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131939.html" rel="external">"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Antithrombotic therapy", section on 'Without concurrent indication for therapeutic anticoagulation'</a>). Although evidence is lacking on the effect of rivaroxaban in patients with BPVT, we favor avoiding this agent in this setting until more data are available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>With a concurrent indication for anticoagulation</strong> – For patients with a concurrent indication for anticoagulation, the choice of anticoagulant is based upon the indication for anticoagulation and other clinical factors, but VKA (target INR 2.5) is generally preferred. Although a DOAC is generally preferred for patients with AF with risk factors favoring anticoagulation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1031.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants", section on 'Choice of anticoagulant'</a>), in patients with BPVT and AF, VKA is preferred, given reports of BPVT and thromboembolic events occurring in patients with bioprosthetic valves during DOAC treatment [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assess response</strong> – After at least 30 days of therapeutic anticoagulation, evaluate symptoms and signs of obstruction and perform imaging by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and, when needed, either transesophageal echocardiography (TEE; preferably three-dimensional) or four-dimensional multidetector computed tomography to reassess valve gradient and valve appearance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Adequate response</strong> – For patients with BPVT who respond to VKA therapy (defined as ≥50 percent reduction in mean gradient), VKA therapy is continued for at least six months after thrombus resolution and long-term antithrombotic therapy is instituted, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Long-term management after an event'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Inadequate response</strong> – If there is inadequate reduction in valve gradient (defined as less than 50 percent reduction in mean gradient), the adequacy of anticoagulation should be evaluated and:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>If stable</strong> – If the patient is stable and the transvalvular gradient is not increasing, anticoagulation may be continued for successive 30-day intervals followed by reassessment of valve gradient and appearance. If there is no response despite adequate oral anticoagulant therapy, we suggest evaluation for another cause, such as endocarditis (if not already excluded) or hypercoagulable state, and referral to a Heart Valve Team for valve surgery/intervention. (See <a class="local">'Referral to Heart Valve Team'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>If worsening</strong> – If the patient’s symptoms of obstruction are worsening or the transvalvular gradient is increasing with lack of resolution of thrombus after one or more 30-day trials of VKA and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, we suggest evaluation for another cause, such as endocarditis (if not already excluded) or hypercoagulable state, and referral to a Heart Valve Team for consideration of valve surgery and possible alternative options (a valve-in-valve (ViV) procedure or fibrinolytic therapy). However, in our experience, fibrinolytic therapy is unlikely to improve clinical status in patients with a bioprosthetic valve who have failed a 30-day trial of VKA. Scant data are available on the optimum duration of anticoagulation prior to a trial of fibrinolytic therapy. (See <a class="local">'Referral to Heart Valve Team'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2915263650"><span class="h3">For pannus or calcification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If a patient with mildly symptomatic obstruction has a presumptive diagnosis of pannus or calcification, the patient is referred to a Heart Valve Team for an individualized assessment of the risk/benefit of valve surgery or transcatheter intervention. The approach to choosing between open surgery and transcatheter intervention is the same as that described below for patients with moderately to severely symptomatic obstruction. (See <a class="local">'Referral to Heart Valve Team'</a> below and <a class="local">'For pannus or calcification'</a> below and <a class="local">'Transcatheter intervention'</a> below and <a class="local">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H569616615"><span class="h3">For pannus/calcification plus thrombus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with clinical and imaging features consistent with BPVT plus pannus or calcification with moderately to severely symptomatic obstruction are referred to a Heart Valve Team for consideration of the options of fibrinolysis or surgery. Surgery is generally preferred in this setting because fibrinolysis has no effect on pannus and is thus unlikely to result in complete resolution of the obstruction. Fibrinolysis is an option only for hemodynamically stable patients who have clear evidence of predominant thrombus. The presence of thrombus is a relative contraindication to a ViV procedure. (See <a class="local">'Referral to Heart Valve Team'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2299799762"><span class="h3">For other bioprosthetic valve findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients evaluated for BPVT and/or obstruction have findings that are nondiagnostic. The following approach is suggested for such patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bioprosthetic cusp thickening/mass strongly suggestive of thrombus with normal cusp motion and no bioprosthetic valve obstruction</strong> – In this setting, we suggest treatment as for patients with a presumptive diagnosis of BPVT (see <a class="local">'For valve thrombosis'</a> above). Of note, some patients with BPVT have spontaneous resolution without anticoagulant therapy [<a href="#rid10">10,14</a>]. Whether subclinical bioprosthetic thrombosis is associated with increased risk of stroke and other embolic events remains uncertain. Given the slight signal of excess risk noted in the Partner 3 trial [<a href="#rid10">10</a>] and our previous observation that BPVT may lead to early degeneration, at this time we favor anticoagulation over observation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited bioprosthetic cusp motion with no bioprosthetic valve thickening/mass and no bioprosthetic valve obstruction</strong> – Bioprosthetic valve cusp immobility alone is not diagnostic of BPVT [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Patients with bioprosthetic valves should continue to take routine antithrombotic therapy (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> 75 to 100 mg orally daily after the first three to six months for patients with surgical bioprosthetic valves) and undergo close (eg, within three months) clinical and echocardiographic follow-up to assess for development of symptoms or change in bioprosthetic valve appearance or gradient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>No or nonspecific bioprosthetic valve abnormalities with no bioprosthetic valve obstruction</strong> – For patients with no or nonspecific bioprosthetic valve abnormalities (eg, mild nonspecific bioprosthetic cusp thickening with normal cusp motion), routine antithrombotic therapy and follow-up is recommended.

Limited evidence is available on management in this setting. (See <a class="local">'Components of short-term management'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1222865503"><span class="h2">Temporizing medical care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Temporizing supportive medical care for moderately to severely symptomatic bioprosthetic valve obstruction includes respiratory support as needed and cautious treatment of hypertension, hypotension, HF, and volume overload. Medical therapies such as diuretics and antihypertensive agents pose the risk of destabilizing the patient with symptomatic bioprosthetic valve obstruction. These are temporizing measures for patients awaiting definitive treatment of the cause of obstruction and palliative measures for patients who are not candidates for definitive therapy (eg, patients with obstructive pannus who are not candidates for valve surgery or transcatheter valve intervention). Limited data are available on the efficacy of medical management of HF in this setting, but the expected prognosis with only medical treatment of HF is poor given the known natural history of medically treated severe symptomatic valve stenosis.</p><p>Therapeutic anticoagulation is promptly initiated if BPVT is the suspected cause of obstruction and fibrinolysis is not the chosen therapy. For patients with BPVT who are taking a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and require urgent therapy, VKA is held, and intravenous (IV) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) and low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> (75 to 100 mg orally daily) are added.

(See <a class="local">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management for mild or no obstructive symptoms</strong> –<strong> </strong>For patients with BPVT, thromboembolism, or bioprosthetic valve obstruction with no or mild symptoms (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class I or II) of obstruction, management is aimed at treating any symptoms of heart failure (HF) and treating the obstruction (eg, thrombus or pannus) or source of thromboembolism. (See <a class="local">'For no or mild symptoms of obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For valve thrombosis</strong> – For patients with BPVT, we suggest a 30-day trial of therapeutic oral anticoagulant plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> 75 to 100 mg orally daily (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The oral anticoagulant used in this setting is generally a vitamin K antagonist (VKA; eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>). (See <a class="local">'For valve thrombosis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Adequate response</strong> – For patients who respond to oral anticoagulant (defined as ≥50 percent reduction in mean gradient), anticoagulation is continued for at least six months after thrombus resolution while long-term antithrombotic therapy is instituted. (See <a class="local">'Long-term management after an event'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Inadequate response</strong> – For patients with inadequate reduction in valve gradient, the adequacy of oral anticoagulation should be evaluated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">If the patient is stable and the transvalvular gradient is not increasing, oral anticoagulation may be continued for successive 30-day intervals followed by reassessment of valve gradient and appearance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">If the patient’s symptoms of obstruction are worsening or the transvalvular gradient is increasing with lack of thrombus resolution after one or more 30-day trials of VKA, evaluation for a hypercoagulable state and referral to a Heart Valve Team for valve surgery is appropriate. Other possible options include a valve-in-valve (ViV) procedure or fibrinolytic therapy, although the efficacy of the latter option is uncertain. (See <a class="local">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For pannus or calcification</strong> – Patients in this setting are referred to a Heart Valve Team for an individualized assessment of the risk/benefit of redo surgical valve replacement or transcatheter ViV intervention. (See <a class="local">'For pannus or calcification'</a> above and <a class="local">'General approach'</a> above and <a class="local">'Transcatheter intervention'</a> above and <a class="local">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management for moderate to severe symptoms of obstruction</strong> – Patients with moderately to severely symptomatic (NYHA class III or IV) bioprosthetic valve obstruction require urgent management, including temporizing medical care and Heart Valve Team assessment. (See <a class="local">'For moderate to severe symptoms of obstruction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Components of short-term management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For valve thrombosis</strong> (see <a class="local">'For valve thrombosis'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>With shock</strong> – For patients with left-sided (aortic or mitral) BPVT, we suggest surgery (redo valve replacement) rather than fibrinolysis (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with right-sided (pulmonic or tricuspid) BPVT, we suggest fibrinolysis rather than surgery (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a class="local">'General approach'</a> above and <a class="local">'Fibrinolysis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Without shock </strong>– For patients in this setting, we suggest prompt initiation of intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) with close monitoring (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). If there is no response within 48 to 72 hours, surgery or fibrinolysis should be considered. Oral anticoagulant therapy (generally VKA) is started after a favorable initial response. When VKA is initiated, bridging heparin therapy is used. (See <a class="local">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For pannus or calcification</strong> (see <a class="local">'For pannus or calcification'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>For high surgical risk</strong> – For patients with high risk of complications with surgical therapy (ie, Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS] operative risk score &gt;8 percent or a &gt;15 percent risk of mortality at 30 days), we suggest a transcatheter ViV procedure at a center with expertise in this procedure (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Transcatheter intervention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>For low surgical risk</strong> – Patients with a low or intermediate risk of complications with surgical therapy (ie, STS operative risk score ≤8 percent or a ≤15 percent risk of mortality at 30 days) are referred to a Heart Valve Team for an individualized assessment of the risk/benefit of redo surgical valve replacement or transcatheter ViV intervention. (See <a class="local">'Surgery'</a> above and <a class="local">'Transcatheter intervention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Long-term antithrombotic therapy </strong>– For patients not adhering to the recommended antithrombotic therapy (eg, daily low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> therapy)<strong> </strong>when BPVT developed, institution of adequate therapy is the first therapeutic step. For patients with low bleeding risk who developed BPVT or thromboembolism while taking aspirin only or VKA only, we suggest treatment with both aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily and VKA (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The target international normalized ratio (INR) for VKA is generally 2.5, with higher targets for patients with thrombotic complications while taking both aspirin and VKA with a documented therapeutic INR.
