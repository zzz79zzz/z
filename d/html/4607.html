Although pembrolizumab monotherapy is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved option for patients with PD-L1 expression of 1 to 49 percent, a chemotherapy/pembrolizumab combination is preferred when feasible. In the randomized trial leading to this approval, results demonstrating superiority of pembrolizumab monotherapy over chemotherapy among patients with tumor PD-L1 expression of 1 percent or greater were driven by the subset of patients with high tumor PD-L1 expression (50 percent or higher). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Regarding chemotherapy selection, there is no single optimal chemotherapy combination. Cisplatin-based regimens are slightly more effective than carboplatin-based combinations or nonplatinum regimens, but are associated with increased nonhematologic toxicity. Given that treatment is palliative in this setting, we opt for a carboplatin-based regimen for the majority of patients who will receive a chemotherapy doublet. Pemetrexed-based regimens should only be used in patients with nonsquamous histology. When combination chemotherapy is the initial treatment, it generally is limited to four to six cycles. Specifically, our approach to initial chemotherapy selection is as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with <strong>nonsquamous</strong> NSCLC and PD-L1 expression &lt;50 percent, our preferred option is the combination of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10098" href="/z/d/drug information/10098.html" rel="external">pemetrexed</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96957" href="/z/d/drug information/96957.html" rel="external">pembrolizumab</a>. This regimen has demonstrated improvements in multiple efficacy endpoints, including OS, relative to pemetrexed and carboplatin alone [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].
