         Intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy can cause severe and sometimes prolonged neutropenia, which may result in hospitalization for treatment of fever or cause potentially fatal infection. Severe prolonged neutropenia is most likely to occur in the pre-engraftment phase of hematopoietic cell transplantation (particularly allogeneic) and in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. One approach to reducing infectious complications involves the use of prophylactic antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents in patients at significant risk of such infections.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because neutropenic patients are unable to mount robust inflammatory responses, serious infection can occur with minimal symptoms and signs. In such patients, fever is often the only sign of infection. Infections in neutropenic patients can progress rapidly, leading to hypotension and/or other life-threatening complications. Thus, empiric therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated promptly in all febrile neutropenic patients (including those receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis) to reduce the risk of serious morbidity and mortality.

         The definition of neutropenia varies from institution to institution, but neutropenia is usually defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500 or 1000 cells/microL, and severe neutropenia is usually defined as an ANC &lt;500 cells/microL or an ANC that is expected to decrease to &lt;500 cells/microL over the next 48 hours [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The risk of clinically important infection rises as the neutrophil count falls below 500 cells/microL and is higher in those with a prolonged duration of neutropenia (&gt;7 days). For the purposes of this discussion,
         <strong>
          we are defining neutropenia as an ANC &lt;500 cells/microL.
         </strong>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The ANC can be calculated by multiplying the total white blood cell count by the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells and bands (

         It is crucial to assess the risk of serious complications in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia who develop fever  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67027" href="/z/d/graphic/67027.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). This risk assessment is also relevant for patients in whom antimicrobial prophylaxis is being considered, since prophylaxis is generally indicated for high-risk patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          High-risk patients are those who are expected to be neutropenic (ANC &lt;500 cells/microL) for &gt;7 days. Patients with neutropenic fever who have ongoing comorbidities or evidence of significant hepatic or renal dysfunction are also considered to be high risk, regardless of the duration of neutropenia.
         </strong>
         By contrast, low-risk patients are those in whom the duration of neutropenia (ANC &lt;500 cells/microL) is expected to be less than seven days and who have no comorbidities and no evidence of significant hepatic or renal dysfunction. It is important to note that the presence of comorbidities and hepatic or renal dysfunction are important for determining the approach to empiric therapy in patients with neutropenic fever, whereas only the risk of neutropenia (ANC &lt;500 cells/microL) is used for determining the need for prophylaxis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some experts have defined high-risk patients as those expected to have profound neutropenia (ANC ≤100 cells/microL) for &gt;7 days based on experience that such patients are the most likely to have life-threatening complications [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. However, formal studies to clearly differentiate between patients with an ANC &lt;500 cells/microL and ≤100 cells/microL are lacking. For the purposes of this discourse, we will combine these groups.
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk assessment of patients with neutropenic fever is discussed in greater detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16888.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Prolonged neutropenia is most likely to occur in the pre-engraftment phase of hematopoietic cell transplantation (particularly allogeneic) and in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Additional factors, such as oral and gastrointestinal mucositis, also increase the risk of neutropenic fever [

         Many investigators have sought to determine if the administration of prophylactic antibacterial agents has a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes. The fluoroquinolones,

          levofloxacin

          ciprofloxacin

         (500 to 750 mg orally twice daily), have been studied most extensively, and levofloxacin is favored in patients at increased risk for oral mucositis-related viridans group streptococcal infection [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Results have been mixed with respect to effectiveness and have prompted concern about toxicities and antimicrobial resistance [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. At institutions that use fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, systematic monitoring of the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance among gram-negative bacilli should be performed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Based upon the available data, we suggest fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for high-risk neutropenic patients (patients anticipated to have an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;500 cells/microL for &gt;7 days) who do not have a contraindication to receiving a fluoroquinolone  (

         Antibacterial prophylaxis is sometimes given to an additional category of "intermediate-risk" patients, as discussed below. The decision of whether to give antibacterial prophylaxis to intermediate-risk patients should be made on a case-by-case basis. (See

         When considering the use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, caution is indicated in patients at risk of a prolonged QT interval because QT prolongation is a known toxicity. This is particularly important to consider in patients who may require other QT prolonging agents, such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10118" href="/z/d/drug information/10118.html" rel="external">
          voriconazole

          table 3
         </a>
         ). Tendon rupture has also been reported with fluoroquinolone use. Further, doses need to be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Another important consideration when deciding whether or not to give fluoroquinolone prophylaxis involves the risk of promoting resistance among both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In institutions and geographic regions in which there are appreciable rates of fluoroquinolone resistance, the use of these agents for prophylaxis is less likely to be effective [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,9
         </a>
         ]. In one study, HCT recipients receiving
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9554" href="/z/d/drug information/9554.html" rel="external">
          levofloxacin
         </a>
         prophylaxis who were colonized with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae pre-transplant were more likely to develop bacteremia with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae post-transplant than those who were not colonized [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Of 31 patients colonized pre-transplant, 10 (32 percent) developed ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia during their transplant admission, compared with 1 of 281 patients (0.4 percent) who were not colonized. All bloodstream ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were levofloxacin resistant and colonizing and bloodstream isolates from individual patients had identical genotypic profiles. It is not clear if this single-center experience is representative of other centers and other neutropenic patient populations, but clearly further study is warranted. There has also been concern about the possibility of increasing the risk of
         <em>
          Clostridioides
         </em>
         <em>
          difficile
         </em>
         infections, although this has not been proven among neutropenic patients receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,11
         </a>
         ]. In a large multicenter randomized trial of levofloxacin prophylaxis among children undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia or HCT, no increase in
         <em>
          C. difficile
         </em>
         infection was observed in those who received levofloxacin prophylaxis compared with those who received no prophylaxis (2.3 versus 5.2 percent) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Practices regarding the use of antibacterial prophylaxis vary from center to center, with some centers avoiding the routine use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis.

         For most patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia expected to be of short duration (which includes standard chemotherapy regimens for most solid tumors), we recommend against the use of antibacterial prophylaxis. This is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         The optimal timing for initiating and discontinuing antibacterial prophylaxis has not been adequately studied. When indicated, many clinicians start antibacterial prophylaxis either on the first day of cytotoxic chemotherapy or on the day after the administration of the last dose of the cycle of chemotherapy. It is common to discontinue antibacterial prophylaxis when the neutropenia has resolved or, for patients who become febrile during neutropenia, when an empiric antibacterial regimen is initiated.

         Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend consideration of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in patients at high risk for profound prolonged neutropenia (anticipated ANC ≤100 cells/microL for &gt;7 days) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         The "neutropenic diet," consisting of "low-bacteria," well-cooked foods, has been the usual approach for decades for neutropenic patients, recognizing that gut mucosal injury makes patients particularly susceptible to serious infection from enteric bacteria. Unfortunately, there has been a paucity of data from clinical trials to evaluate the neutropenic diet. Meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies have not demonstrated a reduction in the overall infection rates when comparing neutropenic diets with unrestricted diets [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29-32
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A variety of methodologic concerns make definitive conclusions difficult. The ASCO/IDSA guidelines do not endorse the neutropenic diet due to lack of evidence suggesting a benefit for reducing infection rates or all-cause mortality [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,33
         </a>
         ]. However, one large randomized trial in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients found more bacteremias in the unrestricted diet group although there was no difference in rates of major infection between the neutropenic diet and unrestricted diet groups [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. This finding raises a concern that, at least in more intensively treated patients, such as AML patients and HCT recipients, there may be a benefit of the neutropenic diet.
        </p>
        <p>
         We believe that there is need for more study to determine the optimal strategy for preventing foodborne infection in cancer patients and, until such definitive trials are performed, recommendations are difficult to make. Of note, a survey of United States HCT programs participating in the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network [

          Background
         </strong>
         − Intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy can cause severe and sometimes prolonged neutropenia, which may result in hospitalization for treatment of fever or cause potentially fatal infection. One approach to reducing infectious complications involves the use of prophylactic antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents in patients at significant risk of such infections. (See
         <a class="local">

          Risk assessment
         </strong>
         − It is crucial to assess the risk of serious complications in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia; prophylaxis is generally indicated for high-risk patients, defined as those who are anticipated to have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500 cells/microL for &gt;7 days.

          High-risk patients
         </strong>
         − We suggest fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for high-risk neutropenic patients (patients anticipated to have an ANC &lt;500 cells/microL for &gt;7 days) who do not have a contraindication to receiving a fluoroquinolone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_4" rel="external">
          Grade 2A
         </a>
         ). High-risk patients include those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and those receiving induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia.

          Selected intermediate-risk patients
         </strong>
         − Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is sometimes used in selected intermediate-risk patients whose treatment regimens generally result in 7 to 10 days of neutropenia (eg, autologous HCT recipients; patients with lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma; patients receiving a purine analog). The decision of whether to give antibacterial prophylaxis to intermediate-risk patients should be made on a case-by-case basis. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Caveats with fluoroquinolone use
         </strong>
         − There are several potential downsides to using fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, including toxicities and the potential for promoting resistance. Practices regarding the use of antibacterial prophylaxis vary from center to center, with some centers avoiding the routine use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. At institutions that use fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, systematic monitoring of the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance among gram-negative bacilli should be performed. (See
