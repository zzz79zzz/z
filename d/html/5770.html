         TOF accounts for approximately 7 to 10 percent of all cases of congenital heart disease and is one of the most common cyanotic congenital heart defects. Morbidity and mortality of TOF have declined markedly with comprehensive management of these patients that includes initial medical care, surgical repair, and postoperative management of complications.

         The need for medical intervention is dependent on the degree of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction. Patients with severe obstruction have inadequate pulmonary flow and typically present in the immediate newborn period with profound cyanosis. These patients may need urgent therapy. Patients with moderate obstruction and balanced pulmonary and systemic flow usually come to clinical attention during elective evaluation for a murmur. These children may also present with hypercyanotic ("tet") spells when RVOT is obstructed during periods of agitation. Patients with minimal obstruction may present with increased pulmonary blood flow and heart failure. In addition, some affected newborns will be detected by an evaluation prompted by a failed oximetry screening test. (See

         Hypercyanotic (or "tet") spells present as periods of profound cyanosis that occur because of episodes of dynamic severe RVOT obstruction. They typically arise when an infant becomes agitated or in older, uncorrected children after vigorous exercise.

         Patients with unrepaired or palliated TOF (eg, with a shunt or stent) may require antibiotic prophylaxis if they undergo certain dental, oral, or other invasive airway procedures (eg, tonsillectomy, cleft lip or palate repair) to reduce the risk of infective endocarditis. These procedures are uncommon in infants with unrepaired TOF since elective surgeries are typically deferred until after surgical repair. Nevertheless, if the infant does undergo one of these procedures, it is important to ensure that appropriate prophylactic antibiotics are administered, as summarized in the figure (

         A small minority of infants require palliative shunts, right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stents, or ductal stents prior to surgical repair. Shunts or stents may be necessary due to severe RVOT obstruction or, less commonly, medically refractory hypercyanotic ("tet") spells. Shunts or stents may also be used in infants who are not initially acceptable candidates for intracardiac repair due to small size (eg, preterm infants), hypoplastic pulmonary arteries (PAs), or coronary artery anatomy.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The surgery consists of patch closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and enlargement of the RVOT, thereby relieving obstructed pulmonary flow. RVOT enlargement is accomplished by relieving pulmonary stenosis, resecting infundibular and sub-infundibular muscle bundles, and, if necessary, by a transannular patch, creating unobstructed flow from RV into the PAs (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67062" href="/z/d/graphic/67062.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         When feasible, a transatrial approach is utilized to access the RVOT and close the VSD in an effort to avoid ventriculotomy, which carries a risk for late ventricular arrhythmias. This approach is most likely to be successful in patients with discrete infundibular stenosis and an adequate pulmonary annulus [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Increasingly, surgical approaches emphasize maintaining pulmonary valve competence whenever possible. A "valve sparing approach" is easily applied to individuals with adequate pulmonary annulus size [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-10
         </a>
         ]. However, in patients with borderline pulmonary valve annulus sizes, this approach necessitates balancing some degree of residual RVOT obstruction against the obligate insufficiency associated with a transannular patch, which renders the pulmonary valve incompetent. Consensus is lacking on the size of the pulmonary annulus and the acceptable degree of residual outflow tract obstruction that is amenable to a valve sparing approach [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8,11
         </a>
         ]. Though there is increasing emphasis on preservation of pulmonary valve function, two large database studies (the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2002 to 2007 and the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery Congenital Database 1999 to 2011) demonstrated that ventriculotomy with transannular patch repair was the most common strategy for repair of TOF during that era [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An alternate surgical procedure is insertion of a valved conduit from the RV to the distal main pulmonary artery (PA) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67062" href="/z/d/graphic/67062.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). However, these conduits have no growth potential and they can become stenotic over time [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the conduit's prosthetic valve can develop stenosis and/or regurgitation. A monocusp valve may also be placed in the RVOT at the time of transannular patch in an attempt to decrease pulmonary insufficiency. However, it is unclear whether the presence of these valves affects the postoperative course or severity of pulmonary insufficiency. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Historically, TOF repair was performed in two staged procedures: a palliative shunt in early infancy followed by intracardiac repair later in childhood. However, this approach has been replaced with primary intracardiac repair [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,14-17
         </a>
         ]. Palliative shunts are reserved for cases wherein primary repair is not feasible. (See

         Surgery is usually performed electively in the first year of life; most repairs are performed before age six months [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

          Infants without severe RVOT obstruction
         </strong>
         – If the RVOT obstruction is not severe and the patient can be managed medically, it is generally preferable to defer elective surgical repair until after the neonatal period. This allows pulmonary vascular resistance to decline and gives time for the infant to grow to a larger size. Elective surgery is typically performed around three to four months of age.

          Neonates with severe RVOT obstruction
         </strong>
         – Neonates with more severe RVOT obstruction and/or ductal dependency may require early surgical or transcatheter intervention within the neonatal period. Options for these neonates include early primary repair or staged repair (ie, initial palliative procedure in the neonatal period followed by later elective complete repair). Surgical practice varies between centers, and the optimal approach is uncertain. For some patients, primary surgical repair may not be feasible due to the size of the infant (eg, preterm infants) or anatomy (eg, unfavorable coronary anatomy). Palliative shunts, RVOT stents, or ductal stents may be required in such cases. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Palliative intervention'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with TOF who require intervention in the neonatal period, the advantage of primary repair is that it reduces the total number of surgeries required [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. The main disadvantage is that risk of surgery may be increased in this setting [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18-20
         </a>
         ]. In a meta-analysis of eight observational studies, mortality was higher for neonates who underwent early compete repair compared with later repair (6 versus 1 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. However, most of these studies were not able to adequately control for severity of RVOT obstruction and other factors that impact surgical decision-making. Thus, the higher mortality rate observed in neonates undergoing repair may be a reflection of their higher baseline risk rather than the impact of the timing of surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies addressing the question of whether outcomes differ between the two surgical approaches in neonates (early primary repair versus staged repair) have reached somewhat different conclusions [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17,20,21
         </a>
         ]. One retrospective multicenter study of 2363 neonates with TOF who underwent early intervention found that primary repair was associated with higher mortality during the initial hospitalization compared with staged repair (odds ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.15-2.62) and higher two-year mortality (hazard ratio 1.51, 95% CI 1.05-2.06) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. However, the study was limited by the lack of robust clinical details in the dataset used (an administrative database of hospital discharge and billing information). Thus, the investigators were not able to adequately control for many clinically important factors. In addition, a large proportion of the cohort (42 percent) had limited follow-up data available.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, in a multicenter study of 572 infants with cyanotic TOF who underwent staged repair (n = 342) or primary complete repair (n = 230), after adjusting for patient-related factors, early mortality and neonatal morbidity were higher in primary repair group, but cumulative morbidity and reinterventions where higher in the staged repair group [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. These findings suggest potential benefits to each strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Smaller single-center retrospective studies have reported equivalent outcomes for early complete repair and staged repair, with comparable mortality and fewer total surgical procedures and hospitalizations with early complete repair [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional prospective data are needed to more definitively answer the question of which approach is best. In the meantime, either approach is acceptable.

          Residual lesions
         </strong>
         – Residual lesions such as VSDs and RVOT obstruction may persist. In some cases, reoperations or interventional catheterization may be needed if these lesions are hemodynamically significant. Residual VSDs may be "intramural defects" and more challenging to identify intraoperatively or by imaging. Intervention for residual RVOT obstruction is generally warranted for RV pressures ≥70 percent systemic pressure. (See

         Small atrial communications are often purposefully retained at the time of operative repair to allow atrial decompression (ie, as a "pop-off" communication allowing right-to-left shunting) to maintain cardiac output and prevent postoperative RV failure, albeit at the expense of a lower arterial oxygen saturation. These atrial communications generally do not require intervention.

         Palliative intervention allows deferral of elective complete repair by providing stable pulmonary blood flow required for survival. Palliative intervention has traditionally consisted of surgical placement of a systemic-to-pulmonary connection. However, experience with transcatheter intervention (eg, stenting of the ductus arteriosus or RVOT) is growing, and these procedures have become an attractive alternative method to provide a source of pulmonary blood flow.

         Although it is now a rare occurrence, TOF remains the most common unrepaired cyanotic CHD defect in adults. Complete repair is feasible in adults and may improve function. However, there is an increased operative risk compared with younger patients, and repair is often complicated by previous palliative surgery and the need for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) or preservation. This issue is discussed separately. (See

         Longitudinal follow-up care is required in all patients with TOF, in conjunction with a cardiologist with expertise in congenital heart disease (CHD). Clinicians need to know the associated complications following surgical repair, which can include chronic pulmonary regurgitation, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, residual RV outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, aortic root dilation, endocarditis, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (

         Patients who have undergone TOF repair require lifelong follow-up with a cardiologist with expertise in CHD. Follow-up visits occur frequently in the first year after surgery and are then spaced out if the child is doing well. Follow-up should occur at least annually throughout childhood, with more frequent visits if acute concerns arise. Our suggested schedule for follow-up cardiac testing is summarized in the table (

         To reduce the risk of endocarditis, patients with repaired TOF should maintain good oral hygiene and receive timely treatment of infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis may be required before certain dental, oral, or invasive airway procedures (eg, routine dental cleaning, tooth extraction, adenotonsillectomy, cleft lip or palate repair) to reduce the risk of infective endocarditis. Prophylaxis is not necessary prior to gastrointestinal procedures (eg, endoscopy, colonoscopy) or genitourinary procedures (eg, cystoscopy, voiding cystourethrogram) unless the patient has an active infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to relevant procedures is recommended during the first six months after the corrective surgery. Prophylaxis is also recommended in patients who have prosthetic heart valves, in whom prosthetic material was used for cardiac valve surgery, or if there are residual defects at or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic device or material.

          Surgical repair
         </strong>
         – For most infants with TOF, we suggest primary complete repair rather than a staged approach (ie, initial palliative intervention followed by intracardiac repair) (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Surgical repair is typically performed between three to six months of age and consists of patch closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and enlargement of the RVOT with relief of all sources of obstruction (

         – Longitudinal follow-up care is required in all patients with TOF, in conjunction with a cardiologist with expertise in congenital heart disease. Important aspects of long-term health care maintenance in children with TOF include administering routine childhood vaccinations, monitoring growth parameters, monitoring for long-term complications (

          Outcome
         </strong>
         – Surgical correction has resulted in excellent long-term survival, particularly for patients who are operated on at a young age, for whom survival is &gt;90 percent 25 years after repair. Heart failure and arrhythmia leading to SCD are the most common causes of late death following surgical repair. Long-term cardiovascular sequelae are common among adult survivors of TOF repair, and approximately one-third of patients require reoperation, most commonly for pulmonary valve replacement. In addition, patients with TOF are at risk for long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. (See
