Hyponatremia is among the most common electrolyte abnormalities in children. Drops in sodium level can lead to neurologic findings and, in severe cases, to significant morbidity and mortality, especially in those with acute and rapid changes in plasma or serum sodium.</p><p>The etiology and clinical findings of pediatric hyponatremia are reviewed here. The detection, diagnostic evaluation, prevention, and treatment of pediatric hyponatremia are discussed separately. In addition, hyponatremia in adults is discussed separately.

Because most laboratory testing of blood sodium (clotted blood samples) is based on the serum sodium, this topic preferentially uses serum sodium except if a study specifies the use of plasma sodium.

For example, the reported incidence of hyponatremia was 17 percent of children at the time of hospital admission in Japan, which was higher in febrile children [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The incidence increased to 45 percent in an Italian study in children with pneumonia [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This is most likely due to the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) associated with a number of clinical conditions that result in hospitalization. These include hypovolemia, fever, head injury, central nervous system (CNS) infections, and respiratory disorders (eg, pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis) [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2217231630"><span class="h2">Hospital-acquired</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In-hospital interventions, such as recent surgery (which is associated with ADH release) and administration of hypotonic intravenous solutions, contribute to the development of hospital-acquired hyponatremia [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The effect of administered hypotonic intravenous solution on the development of hyponatremia, especially in children with persistent ADH release, was illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study from the United States of 1048 children who had normal serum sodium levels at the time of presentation, 35 percent of the cohort developed hyponatremia [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Patients who received hypotonic fluids were more likely to develop hyponatremia than those who received isotonic fluids (39 versus 28 percent). Additional identified risk factors for hyponatremia included admitting diagnoses of a cardiac or hematologic/oncologic condition and surgical admission.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an observational Canadian study of 432 hospitalized children who had two or more measurements of plasma sodium, 40 patients developed hospital-acquired hyponatremia due to the administration of excessive free water as hypotonic solution [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1521202326"><span class="h1">SODIUM AS A MARKER OF TONICITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serum tonicity is defined as the concentration of solutes that do not easily cross the cell membrane (effective osmoles). These solutes are primarily sodium salts contained in the extracellular space. As a result, serum sodium is used as a surrogate for assessing tonicity of the extracellular fluid.</p><p>Serum tonicity is tightly regulated by the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary, promoting water retention, and by thirst-prompting water ingestion  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195" href="/d/graphic/65195.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The homeostatic mechanisms that mediate tonicity and water balance are similar in adults and children, resulting in a normal range of serum sodium between 135 and 145 mEq/L that does not vary by age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2307.html" rel="external">"General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)", section on 'Regulation of plasma tonicity'</a>.)</p><p>The formulas used to estimate serum tonicity are similar to those for serum osmolality, with the one exception that the contribution of urea (an ineffective osmole) is not included. The multiplier factor of 2 accounts for the osmotic contributions of the anions that accompany sodium, the primary extracellular cation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum tonicity = 2 × [Na] + [glucose]/18 (when glucose is measured in mg/dL)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum tonicity = 2 × [Na] + [glucose] (when glucose is measured in mmol/L)</p><p></p><p>Most pediatric patients have an underlying condition that results in hyponatremia with hypotonicity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116018" href="/d/graphic/116018.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), caused by an imbalance in the body's handling of water. However, there are exceptions of hyponatremic conditions when tonicity is normal or increased due to the presence of another osmole (eg, hyperglycemia). (See <a class="local">'Hypotonic hyponatremia'</a> below and <a class="local">'Hyponatremia without hypotonicity'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, the routinely measured value of sodium concentration may be low when there is pseudohyponatremia, in which the water content of plasma is reduced (eg, hyperlipidemia). (See <a class="local">'Pseudohyponatremia'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H765666317"><span class="h1">HYPOTONIC HYPONATREMIA</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H58368179"><span class="h2">Pathogenesis and volume status</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children, hypotonic hyponatremia is typically due to a loss of sodium as well as free water or excess free water retention. These can be classified according to volume status as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypovolemia and persistent antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels</strong> – In most pediatric cases, hyponatremia occurs in children with hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal loss. In this setting, ADH is appropriately released, resulting in a concentrated urine and decrease in urine volume. If hypotonic fluids are given for volume repletion, either orally or intravenously, retention of free water in excess of solutes results in a <strong>decrease</strong> in serum sodium. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6103.html" rel="external">"Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Intravenous rehydration therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Less commonly, pediatric hyponatremia may be caused by loss of sodium in excess of water (eg, urinary salt wasting in obstructive uropathy, skin losses in cystic fibrosis), which results in volume depletion and a decrease in serum sodium.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Normovolemia and</strong> <strong>inappropriate</strong> <strong>ADH levels</strong> – In volume-replete individuals, excess water intake normally suppresses ADH release, allowing for free water excretion and the generation of a dilute urine. However, several pediatric conditions are associated with inappropriate ADH release that results in retention of free water, leading to a drop in serum sodium  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93177" href="/d/graphic/93177.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). These include pulmonary and oncologic disorders, recent surgery, central nervous system (CNS) injury or infection, endocrine disorders, and certain medications including some anticonvulsants and chemotherapeutic drugs  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118898" href="/d/graphic/118898.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Euvolemia'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2384.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)", section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a class="local">'Medications'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Normovolemia</strong> – Other less common causes of hyponatremia in children who are euvolemic include primary polydipsia and reset osmostat (those with a lower-than-normal plasma osmolality threshold for ADH release). (See <a class="local">'Primary polydipsia'</a> below and <a class="local">'Reset osmostat'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypervolemia</strong> – Hypervolemic conditions resulting in pediatric hyponatremia include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Conditions with <strong>decreased effective circulating volume</strong> (ECV; eg, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, and heart failure) result in hypervolemia with excess water retention promoted by a decrease in kidney perfusion and urine output, leading to a drop in serum sodium. (See <a class="local">'Hypervolemia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Kidney failure</strong> with a decrease in glomerular filtration rate results in water retention caused by a reduced ability to excrete free water, leading to a drop in serum sodium.</p><p></p><p>Another classification scheme divides hyponatremia based on the body's ability to excrete dilute urine (release of ADH) and, if that is impaired, the reason for the impairment. In pediatrics, the volume status classification is preferred as it is common clinical practice to assess the volume status of the patient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2374.html" rel="external">"Causes of hypotonic hyponatremia in adults", section on 'Classification of hypotonic hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H952883055"><span class="h2">Hypovolemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most pediatric cases of hyponatremia are due to retention of free water during repletion with hypotonic solutions for hypovolemic conditions (eg, gastroenteritis). In this setting, the initial appropriate ADH release for maintaining circulating volume in the hypovolemic child persists and results in a concentrated urine, lower urine volume, and water retention leading to a drop in serum sodium  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58012" href="/d/graphic/58012.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gastrointestinal losses – The most common cause of hypovolemia in children is gastroenteritis. Other less common causes of pediatric gastrointestinal losses include secretory and osmotic diarrheas, enteric fistulas, and ostomies. Rehydration with hypotonic fluids results in free water retention in patients, leading to hyponatremia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15157.html" rel="external">"Enterocutaneous and enteroatmospheric fistulas", section on 'Fluid therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117487.html" rel="external">"Approach to chronic diarrhea in neonates and young infants (&lt;6 months)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diuretic-induced hyponatremia – Hyponatremia can be a complication of diuretic use. Acutely, the initial volume loss stimulates ADH release. As a result, the combination of diuretic-enhanced sodium and potassium excretion, and the resultant water retention due to ADH release, results in excretion of urine with a higher solute concentration than that of plasma, leading to a drop in serum sodium. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2288.html" rel="external">"Diuretic-induced hyponatremia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intense exercise – High rate of fluid consumption, particularly of hypotonic fluids, during and after intense exercise (eg, marathons) has also been associated with the development of hyponatremia. In this setting, the major factors for developing hyponatremia are an ongoing high rate of fluid consumption and submaximal suppression of ADH secretion.

However, patients with a reset osmostat have a lower than normal plasma osmolality threshold for ADH release. These patients typically are euvolemic and have a moderately reduced serum sodium concentration (usually between 125 and 135 mEq/L) that is stable on multiple measurements. Reset osmostat has been associated with children with severe brain injury or an underlying defect in the genes encoding hypothalamic osmoreceptor [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].

As a result, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk for retaining ingested water (increased total body volume) and developing hyponatremia, despite suppression of ADH. However, as CKD progresses, accumulation of blood urea nitrogen increases plasma/serum osmolality, which may lead to hyponatremia and normal or increased serum osmolality due to azotemia.

Although this will tend to lower the plasma osmolality, this effect is counterbalanced to a variable degree by the associated elevation in blood urea nitrogen, resulting in a serum osmolality that may be normal or elevated. However, there is a difference between the measured osmolality and the effective osmolality in patients with kidney failure. In contrast with sodium and glucose, urea is an ineffective osmole since it can freely cross cell membranes and therefore does not obligate water movement out of the cells.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2920825282"><span class="h1">PSEUDOHYPONATREMIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In pseudohyponatremia, the sodium concentration is not affected in the water phase of plasma but rather the water content of a given volume is reduced, resulting in an overall lower sodium concentration when that volume is assayed. This most commonly occurs in patients with hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia. In children, hyperlipidemia can occur in children who receive intravenous lipid emulsions as part of their total parental nutrition, whereas hyperproteinemia is uncommon in children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15634.html" rel="external">"Parenteral nutrition in infants and children", section on 'Fat'</a>.)</p><p>In pseudohyponatremia, the depressed sodium level is the result of electrolyte measurement performed using <strong>indirect</strong> ion-selective electrode potentiometry, which measures the sodium concentration per volume of plasma. However, when a <strong>direct</strong> ion-selective electrode is used, this false decrease in serum sodium does not occur. Although an increasing number of laboratories use direct ion-selective electrode techniques, in facilities using the older method, this interference needs to be kept in mind when interpreting low sodium results in patients with hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia. In this setting, checking with the clinical laboratory to see what method was used to measure sodium levels is warranted.

The presence and severity of symptoms are a result in neurologic dysfunction due to water movement into brain cells caused by an osmotic gradient across the cell membrane. Symptoms correlate with the rate and extent of changes in sodium concentration (rapid alterations less well tolerated than slowly acquired disorders) that increase brain cell volume, resulting in cerebral edema.</p><p>In response to a drop in extracellular sodium levels, acute and chronic cellular regulatory mechanisms are initiated to minimize cell volume shifts (ie, cerebral adaption). Cerebral adaptation begins within a day of sustained hyponatremia and generally takes several days for full measures to be in place. Thus, the more rapid and extensive the degree of change, the less time is available for regulatory mechanisms to minimize cell volume change. Rapid shifts seen with acute hyponatremia may significantly increase brain volume, and, because of limited space in the skull, the ensuing cerebral edema is manifested by the associated neurologic signs and symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4233941589"><span class="h3">Acute hyponatremia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with acute hyponatremia (developed over a period of less than 48 hours) are more likely to be symptomatic and are at risk for complications as there has not been sufficient time for cerebral adaption to occur.

Although the true incidence is unknown, hyponatremia is often observed in children on admission to the hospital and is also a common complication of in-hospital interventions. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sodium as a marker of tonicity</strong> – Pediatric hyponatremia is usually caused by an imbalance in the body's handling of water, resulting in a relative deficit of effective plasma/serum osmolality (tonicity) to total body water.

(See <a class="local">'Sodium as a marker of tonicity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Classification</strong> – Most cases of pediatric hyponatremia are due to an underlying condition that results in hyponatremia with hypotonicity.
