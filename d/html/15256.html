Survival outcomes are closely related to the extent of disease at presentation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81414" href="/z/d/graphic/81414.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

The goal of postoperative (adjuvant) therapy is to eradicate these micrometastases, thereby increasing the cure rate.</p><p>The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy have been most clearly demonstrated in stage III (node-positive  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)) disease (an approximately 30 percent relative reduction in the risk of disease recurrence and a 22 to 32 percent relative reduction in mortality), and it has become a standard approach in this setting. The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II (node-negative) disease are less certain, and the use of chemotherapy in this group is variable. Decision-making is influenced by tumoral deficiency of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) enzyme status/high levels of microsatellite instability (dMMR/MSI-H), which is associated with better prognosis overall. All patients with stage II colon should be tested for dMMR (either by microsatellite instability [MSI] testing or immunohistochemistry [IHC] for expression of MMR proteins) to aid in chemotherapy decision-making. (See <a class="local">'Testing for Lynch syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic review will cover adjuvant therapy for patients with resected stage II colon cancer. Trials demonstrating the benefit of adjuvant therapy for patients with stage III (node-positive) colon cancer, optimal timing of adjuvant therapy, use of adjuvant regional liver-directed therapy and adjuvant radiation therapy, adjuvant therapy for colon cancer in older adult patients, benefits of adjunctive therapy with diet, exercise, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), vitamin D, and coffee consumption in patients with early stage colorectal cancer, surgical management and prognosis of colon cancer, chemotherapy after resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases, and recommendations for post-treatment follow-up are discussed separately.

A high level of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is the biologic footprint of deficient MMR (dMMR). (See <a class="local">'Testing for Lynch syndrome'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2485.html" rel="external">"Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer", section on 'Mismatch repair genes'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>MMR status influences decision-making for adjuvant therapy in two ways:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>MMR status is an important prognostic factor in stage II disease. Patients with dMMR have an approximately 50 percent lower risk of recurrence and a relatively higher survival rate after surgery alone compared with tumors that are proficient in MMR [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2484.html" rel="external">"Pathology and prognostic determinants of colorectal cancer", section on 'Mismatch repair deficiency'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The majority of published data also suggest that MMR status is an important predictor of benefit from fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Most studies support the view that dMMR tumors are resistant to fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy but retain sensitivity to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a>.

For patients with a pT4 primary tumor or two or more other high-risk features (fewer than 12 sampled lymph nodes in the surgical specimen, perineural or lymphovascular invasion, poorly differentiated or undifferentiated histology, clinical intestinal obstruction, tumor perforation, or grade BD3 tumor budding), we suggest adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with one high-risk clinicopathologic feature other than a T4 primary, we discuss the risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy and individualize decision-making.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H589530323"><span class="h3">Is there benefit for fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy?</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3623324150"><span class="h4">Low-risk patients with stage II disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients without specific high-risk features, we suggest observation rather than adjuvant therapy. Studies in patients with both high- and low-risk disease (most of whom had pMMR disease) have not shown conclusive evidence of benefit, and if present, the absolute benefit is likely to be small and offset by chemotherapy side effects.</p><p>The benefits of fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant systemic therapy have been clearly shown for patients with stage III disease. Multiple clinical trials have tested the value of such therapy in resected stage II colon cancer, showing at best a small disease-free survival (DFS) and a potentially very small overall survival (OS) benefit from adjuvant therapy, which is no greater than 5 percent at five years. Adjuvant chemotherapy cannot be considered a standard approach to all patients with stage II colon cancer.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chemotherapy benefit in pMMR tumors</strong> – The available data addressing the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with pMMR tumors are mixed:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a pooled analysis of data from two fluoropyrimidine adjuvant therapy trials, a treatment benefit was not found in patients with pMMR stage II disease (hazard ratio [HR] for DFS 0.84, 95% CI 0.57-1.24) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Patients with deficient MMR'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other series have reported modest benefits for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with pMMR [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A pooled analysis of data from two studies [<a href="#rid4">4,7,9</a>] specifically addressing the impact of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy in patients with stage II colon cancer and pMMR tumors concluded that OS was significantly improved (1093 patients in two studies, HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.18-0.52, translating to 242 fewer deaths per 1000 (95% CI, 298 fewer to 160 fewer), but DFS was not significantly different (1162 patients, HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.25-1.26, translating to 171 fewer recurrences per 1000 [95% CI 323 fewer to 81 more]) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Higher-risk stage II disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trials in all risk groups</strong> – Four large trials that specifically address the benefit of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in populations consisting either entirely or predominantly of stage II disease have been undertaken, all of which fail to show unequivocal OS benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy, although a DFS benefit has been consistently demonstrated [<a href="#rid11">11-14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The largest of these, the QUASAR trial, randomly assigned 3238 patients with an "uncertain indication for adjuvant therapy" (91 percent node-negative) to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (FU) plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9548" href="/z/d/drug information/9548.html" rel="external">leucovorin</a> (LV) with or without levamisole, or observation following resection of colon (71 percent) or rectal cancer [<a href="#rid12">12,15</a>]. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a significant 22 percent lower risk of disease recurrence and an 18 percent reduction in death, which translated into a 3 to 4 percent absolute benefit in five-year OS [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Among patients with stage II colon cancer (n = 2146), there was only a trend towards better OS (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.54-1.19, five-year survival 83.9 versus 81.5 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This trial included patients with rectal cancer (29 percent of the total enrolled), the median number of lymph nodes examined was only six, some patients received radiation therapy (14 percent in each group), and a small number of patients in both groups received portal venous, rather than systemic, infusions of chemotherapy (six percent in the chemotherapy group and five percent in the observation group).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Meta-analyses in all risk groups</strong> – Several meta-analyses have evaluated the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II disease, all of which have concluded that if there is a survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in this group, that it is no greater than 5 percent at five years [<a href="#rid2">2,16-20</a>]. As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>An Intergroup analysis included pooled individual data from 3302 patients with stage II or III colon cancer who were enrolled in seven randomized trials comparing LV- or levamisole-modulated FU versus surgery alone [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In multivariate analysis adjusted for T-stage, histologic grade, and nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a significant 30 percent relative reduction in the risk of recurrence and a 26 percent relative reduction in the risk of death. Treatment effects were consistent across all subsets, with similar relative risk reductions for stage II and III disease. For patients with stage II disease, this benefit translated into a significant improvement in five-year DFS favoring chemotherapy (76 versus 72 percent), but the difference in OS was not statistically significant (81 versus 76 percent, an absolute benefit of 5 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">A follow-up analysis of long-term outcomes of adjuvant therapy was conducted by the Adjuvant Colon Cancer End Points (ACCENT) collaboration. This analysis included the individual patient data from nine trials, seven of which were in the Intergroup analysis. Among the nearly 6900 patients with stage II cancer, adjuvant FU-based chemotherapy was associated with a 5 percent absolute improvement in survival at eight years (72 versus 66.8 percent, p = 0.026) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>By contrast, a year 2015 meta-analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer (37 trials, 5 randomized the remained observational, 15,559 patients) concluded that the overall estimated five-year DFS for patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy was lower, 79.3 (95% CI 75.6-83.1) percent compared with 81.4 (95% CI 75.4-87.4) percent for patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. OS results were not reported.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Largely based upon these data, updated year 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline on adjuvant therapy for stage II colon cancer reiterated its position from 2004 [<a href="#rid21">21</a>] that a significant subgroup of patients with stage II colon cancer are not expected to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, and recommended against routine use for all patients with stage II disease [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower-risk disease</strong> – The only data addressing the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for low-risk patients with stage II disease without definable high-risk factors come from retrospective reports, and the results are mixed, with some suggesting benefit (mostly in terms of DFS) [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>], and others, no benefit, and even a detrimental impact on outcomes [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. Based upon these limited data, the ASCO expert consensus group recommended against adjuvant chemotherapy for individuals with low-risk stage II disease [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3658854820"><span class="h4">Higher-risk stage II disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As discussed above, the magnitude of the absolute OS benefit from adjuvant therapy seems to be very small for most patients with stage II disease. However, most trials have shown at least a DFS benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II disease. Furthermore, as indicated by the Intergroup meta-analysis, the <strong>relative</strong> improvement in outcomes with adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (as measured by the HR or odds ratio [OR]) appears to be independent of stage and similar in stage II and III disease. (See <a class="local">'Low-risk patients with stage II disease'</a> above.)</p><p>This has prompted efforts to utilize clinicopathologic and molecular features to select groups of patients with higher-risk stage II disease who have a greater risk of recurrence and might derive a greater absolute degree of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1688874445"><span class="h5">Definitions of expert groups</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Not surprisingly, definitions of "high-risk" early colon cancer from expert groups are variable; we use the ASCO definitions [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In its 2000 consensus guidelines, the College of American Pathologists recognized only T4 disease, nodal status, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), a high preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, and positive surgical margins to represent category I prognostic factors (ie, factors definitively proven to be of prognostic import based on evidence from multiple statistically robust published trials) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. These guidelines have not been updated since 2000.

An important point is that, while all three guidelines consider poorly differentiated histology to represent an adverse feature, this is only true for tumors that are not microsatellite unstable (MSI-H).

In fact, ctDNA testing outperforms the current standard assessment of clinicopathologic features in terms of prognostic value. In one study, patients with stage II colon cancer who were not treated with chemotherapy and who had ctDNA detected after curative-intent surgery were 18-fold more likely to have a recurrence as compared with those without detectable ctDNA (79 versus 9.8 percent) [<a href="#rid65">65</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Prospective trials have been designed to address the clinical utility of detecting minimal residual disease after potentially curative surgery and whether such testing can refine the selection of patients at highest risk to receive chemotherapy.

Despite these differences, two-year recurrence-free survival was similar in both groups (93.5 versus 92.4 percent, absolute difference 1.1 percent, 95% CI -4.1 to 6.2 [noninferiority margin -8.5]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, in the ctDNA-negative patients not treated with chemotherapy, the three-year recurrence rate was threefold higher among those with clinical high-risk tumors (ie, high grade, lymphovascular invasion, &lt;12 nodes examined, obstruction or perforation) than among those with low-risk (three-year recurrence-free survival 86.4 versus 96.7 percent, HR for recurrence 3.04, 95% CI 1.26-7.34). Similarly, among ctDNA-negative patients, three-year recurrence-free survival was higher for those with T3 as compared with T4 tumors (94.2 versus 81.3 percent, HR for recurrence 2.60, 95% CI 1.01-6.71).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Notably, more patients in the ctDNA-guided chemotherapy group completed all planned cycles of chemotherapy (84 versus 78 percent). Furthermore, there were significant discrepancies in the type of adjuvant chemotherapy administered to those in the standard management arm (10 percent oxaliplatin-based, 90 percent fluoropyrimidine monotherapy) versus the ctDNA-guided management group (62 percent oxaliplatin-based). Furthermore, among the ctDNA-positive patients who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, three-year recurrence-free survival was 92.6 percent among those who received an oxaliplatin-containing regimen compared with 76 percent with single-agent fluoropyrimidine.

Patients with an RS &lt;30 had a three-year recurrence rate of 8 percent, patients with an RS of 31 to 40 had a recurrence risk of 11 percent, and patients with RS &gt;40 had a recurrence rate of 25 percent at three years. The ability of this 12-gene assay to predict recurrence rate was independently validated in an analysis of data from the prospective QUASAR trial [<a href="#rid73">73</a>], in a separate analysis of data from the CALGB 9581 trial [<a href="#rid74">74</a>], and in the SUNRISE study [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. In the CALGB 9581 analysis, the RS appeared to be most discerning for patients with T3N0 tumors that were pMMR, in whom the prespecified low- and high-RS groups had average five-year recurrence risks of 13 and 21 percent, respectively. Forty-four percent of patients with T3N0 pMMR tumors fell into the low-RS category and, thus, may have been spared from receiving chemotherapy.
