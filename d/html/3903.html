Patients with IEI diseases may also have immune dysregulation that includes unusual or severe autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and fevers and severe inflammation that are unprovoked (autoinflammation). Some forms of IEI are also characterized by an increased risk of malignancies. This topic review will provide a general approach to the laboratory evaluation of the immune system, beginning with screening tests and progressing through the indications for more advanced immunologic testing. Indications for referral to a specialist are discussed, and links to more detailed topics about the different groups of disorders are provided here and throughout the topic:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3914.html" rel="external">"Primary humoral immunodeficiencies: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3935.html" rel="external">"Combined immunodeficiencies: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3913.html" rel="external">"Primary disorders of phagocyte number and/or function: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8388.html" rel="external">"Laboratory evaluation of neutrophil disorders"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3920.html" rel="external">"Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16362.html" rel="external">"Autoimmunity in patients with inborn errors of immunity/primary immunodeficiency"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19688153"><span class="h1">INITIAL APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) should be considered once the more common causes of recurrent infection, autoimmunity, and inflammation have been excluded.

Lymphopenia is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count &lt;1500 cells/microL in adults or &lt;2500 cells/microL in infants. Neutropenia can be found in primary phagocyte disorders, as well as in neutrophil disorders that lead to secondary immunodeficiency [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Leukocytosis is sometimes noted and suggests chronic infection. Monocytopenia is seen in GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2) deficiency. Eosinophilia can be seen in primary atopic disorders and in several IEI.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chemistry panels</strong> – Chemistry panels should be evaluated to assess for metabolic disorders (diabetes mellitus, kidney disease) that might cause secondary immunodeficiency. Hypoalbuminemia or low serum proteins suggest malnutrition or protein loss. Markedly elevated globulin levels may be seen in gammopathies or chronic infections.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Urinalysis</strong> – Urinalysis should be performed to detect proteinuria, casts, or cells, which suggest nephritis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tests to evaluate for specific infections, if indicated by the presentation</strong> – Tests for specific infections include appropriate cultures, serologies, and sinus imaging. Note that antibody testing for acute or historical evidence of infection may not accurately reflect past infections in patients with IEI that involve impaired antibody function. Sinus imaging may uncover chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with immunodeficiency. Children or adolescents with nasal polyposis should be evaluated for cystic fibrosis, which is a cause of frequent sinopulmonary infections.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chest radiograph</strong> – In infants, a chest radiograph showing the absence of a thymic shadow is a potentially critical finding  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67690" href="/z/d/graphic/67690.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). An ultrasound of the anterior chest should be performed next to confirm the lack of thymic tissue, which is a feature of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and should prompt an urgent evaluation for severe forms of IEI. However, there are other causes of thymic involution as the thymus responds to stress by shrinking in infants, and the presence of a thymic shadow does not exclude SCID. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3955.html" rel="external">"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In older children and adults, chest radiographs may show scarring from past infections, interstitial lung disease, or bronchiectasis.

There are several methods for determining serum immunoglobulin levels, and laboratories use different systems. Therefore, it is critical that age-adjusted normal reference ranges are used when making comparisons  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107086" href="/z/d/graphic/107086.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypogammaglobulinemia is defined as an IgG less than two standard deviations below normal, and agammaglobulinemia is usually considered when IgG is &lt;100 mg/dL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Panhypogammaglobulinemia is defined as low levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM and is a hallmark of B cell deficiencies, most forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and can rarely be seen in certain genetic variants of the common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) phenotype. In combined immunodeficiencies (CIDs), as well as in several predominantly humoral immunodeficiencies, there are characteristic alterations in the profile of immunoglobulin isotypes that may aid in diagnosis (eg, selective IgA deficiency, selective IgM deficiency, and hyper-IgM immunodeficiencies).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An isolated low level of IgA is relatively common and does not necessarily signify an IEI. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3963.html" rel="external">"Selective IgA deficiency: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology of IgA deficiency'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Measurement of IgG subclasses is usually<strong> not</strong> helpful, and it is useless in young children because the expression of IgG subclasses is quite variable in these ages. However, IgG subclasses are sometimes assessed later in the evaluation of antibody defects. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3906.html" rel="external">"IgG subclass deficiency"</a>.)</p><p>IgE levels can be useful if elevated or low. Elevated IgE levels are helpful in the identification of several monogenic causes of antibody deficiency (eg, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 [STAT3], interleukin 21 receptor [IL21R], interleukin 6 receptor [IL6R], and interleukin 6 signal transducer [IL6ST] deficiencies, among others). Measurement of IgE is helpful in patients with recurrent sinopulmonary infections or scaly or eczematoid skin disorders as an elevation is consistent with underlying allergic disease (eg, &gt;100 international units/mL). A very elevated IgE (eg, &gt;2000 international units/mL) in a patient with recurrent bacterial or fungal infections and dermatitis would raise suspicion for a hyper-IgE syndrome and several other IEI  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83457" href="/z/d/graphic/83457.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3960.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome"</a>). Very low or undetectable serum IgE &lt;2 ng/mL is often seen in the CVID phenotype that can be used to distinguish it from other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Serum immunoglobulin D (IgD) is not used in the diagnosis of any disorder, though elevated levels of IgD are often seen in one of the rare autoinflammatory disorders (mevalonate kinase [MVK] deficiency). This and related disorders are described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5954.html" rel="external">"Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19688892"><span class="h3">Measurement of antibody function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinically significant impairment in antibody function can be present even when serum antibody levels are normal. Antibody function can be assessed by measuring antibody titers (usually IgG isotype) to specific antigens (also known as specific antibody) in response to intentional immunization or natural infection. There are two major goals to measuring vaccine responses: first, to assess if naïve B cells can respond to a new antigen; second, to assess if memory B cells respond appropriately to an antigen seen in the past. Choosing the right vaccine to test with is critical for properly assessing B cell function.</p><p>Antibody function is assessed by examining the patient's response to the two general types of antigens: protein antigens and polysaccharide antigens. Routine vaccinations provide examples of both types:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vaccines that assess responses to protein antigens</strong> - Measurement of antibody titers to tetanus, diphtheria, <em>H. influenzae</em> B, and protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccines (eg, Prevnar) are used to assess response to protein antigens. Antibody titers to other vaccines (eg, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, measles, others) can also be used.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vaccines that assess responses to polysaccharide antigens</strong> - Measurement of antibody titers to multiple serotypes in pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (eg, Pneumovax 23) are used to assess response to polysaccharide antigens.

They generally appear in the blood by six months of age in individuals who have blood types <strong>other than</strong> AB. Very low titers in a child suggests poor antibody function. Similarly, antibodies to streptococcal antigens (eg, streptolysin O and anti-DNAase) are normally present in all subjects after two years of age; very low titers also hint at antibody deficiency. However, vaccine responsiveness is generally considered to be a more reliable indicator of intact humoral immune function. Isohemagglutinin testing is reviewed in more detail separately.

However, because much of the specific antibody production by B cells requires intact T cell function, most T cell defects lead to combined (cellular and humoral) immunodeficiency.</p><p>Thus, evaluation of T cell numbers and function is critical in patients with "predominantly" antibody deficiencies, especially in those with certain infections or significant autoimmunity. An evaluation of cellular immunity is appropriate for patients with severe viral and/or bacterial illnesses or opportunistic infections. The disorders that can impair cellular immunity are different in various age groups:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In children younger than one year of age, IEI are the most common cause of impaired cellular immunity, although perinatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other herpes virus infections can cause transient or persistent cellular immunodeficiency [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

Mild forms of primary CID or DiGeorge syndrome can escape diagnosis until adolescence or adulthood.</p><p></p><p>The most profound CIDs are classified under the heading "severe combined immunodeficiency" (SCID). SCID disorders usually present in infancy, while less severe combined immunodeficiencies present in children and occasionally in adolescents or adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3955.html" rel="external">"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3935.html" rel="external">"Combined immunodeficiencies: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h3">Complete blood count with differential and blood smear</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood smear provides valuable information about the cellular immune system. Lymphocyte counts in infants are normally much higher than in older children and adults [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. In many IEI, cell populations decline over time. Thus, normal results in the past cannot be relied upon as a reflection of the patient’s current state.</p><p>In patients suspected of having a defect in cellular immunity, the CBC evaluates for lymphopenia and any associated gross hematologic abnormalities, some of which may greatly assist in diagnosis. For example, patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome have low numbers of small platelets.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H674032"><span class="h4">Evaluation of lymphopenia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The definition of lymphopenia depends considerably on the age of the subject, and normal values for adults may be critically low for infants. Thus, it is especially important to consider the age and appropriate reference values and not the general "reference range" that is often provided alongside laboratory results. The ranges of normal lymphocyte counts in premature infants, low-birth-weight infants, and through early infancy have been published [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In young children through adolescence, normal values are quite variable and can be seen in this reference [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Normal lymphocyte counts through adulthood and into the older adult years are more stable [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Lymphopenia can be caused by an array of disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58469" href="/z/d/graphic/58469.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). A single finding of lymphopenia should be interpreted with caution since transient lymphopenia is frequently found in a variety of common infectious illnesses [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. However, significant lymphopenia that does not rapidly correct should not be ignored, since lymphopenia may be the first indication of cellular immunodeficiency or another serious disease (eg, lymphoma) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8387.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with lymphocytosis or lymphocytopenia", section on 'Lymphocytopenia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104124.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with lymphocytosis or lymphocytopenia", section on 'Lymphocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p>Flow cytometry to evaluate lymphocyte populations should be performed in all patients suspected of cellular immunodeficiency with any significant infection in a patient where the absolute lymphocyte count is consistently low. In the absence of other indicators of immune dysfunction, there should (at the very least) be subsequent measurements of the lymphocyte count to document normalization. Persistent lymphopenia requires further investigation of immune function and to ascertain which type of lymphocytes are low. In rare situations, a normal total lymphocyte count can be seen in the presence of a severe immunodeficiency (eg, normal lymphocyte counts due to expanded B cell counts in infants with Janus kinase 3 [JAK3] deficiency SCID). If the clinical presentation is suggestive of an underlying disorder (eg, a patient with <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia or invasive <em>Candida</em>), then lymphocyte subsets should be evaluated with flow cytometry, even if the total lymphocyte count is normal.

This test measures the recall response to an intradermal injection of an antigen to which an individual has already been exposed over a period of time [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. For that reason, skin testing is usually not of much value under the age of one year. DTH testing has fallen out of common use in most centers but is reviewed briefly here.</p><p>A positive response to intracutaneous antigen injection requires uptake and processing of antigen by antigen-presenting cells, their interaction with CD4+ helper T cells, cytokine production by T cells, and subsequent recruitment and activation of monocytes and macrophages. Thus, skin testing is a sensitive indicator of intact cellular immunity, but negative results must be interpreted with caution because an impairment in any step of the response pathway will lead to a negative response. In addition, the DTH response is unreliable in children under one year of age (even with prior antigen exposure) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>] and is often suppressed during viral and bacterial infection (even with live-attenuated vaccines as in the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine). DTH skin reactivity is also suppressed by antiinflammatory drugs (glucocorticoids) and other immunosuppressants (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9217" href="/z/d/drug information/9217.html" rel="external">cyclosporine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9971" href="/z/d/drug information/9971.html" rel="external">tacrolimus</a>, mycophenolic acid).

This method has fallen out of practice for a number of reasons including the lack of availability of the reagents, the requirement of patients to assess induration of the skin 48 to 72 hours after the test is started, and the sensitivity to lymphopenia (ie, low T cell counts will result in poor DTH results even if the T cells are functional). DTH incorrectly suggests that type 1 immune responses of T cells (ie, interferon [IFN] gamma production, which elicits strong induration) are superior to type 2 responses (which elicit low/minimal induration). DTH also fails to assess antigen-specific T helper type 17 (Th17) and T regulatory (Treg) responses and other patterns of T cell differentiation in response to antigen priming. DTH responses in the skin are affected by age and intercurrent illness. We recommend that DTH be avoided as a way to assess antigen-specific T cell responses. In vitro assays (particularly tracking proliferation and cytokine production of T cells after stimulation by mitogens, recall antigens, and anti-CD3 and anti-CD28) are the more accurate way to assess T cell function.

A typical panel of markers used to identify the major subsets of lymphocytes includes CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 or CD20, and CD16 and CD56. Analysis of the expression of markers of naïve (CD45RA in combination with CD62L or CCR7) and memory (CD45RO) T cells is important in the diagnostic approach to patients with CID. The nature and derivation of the nomenclature of the markers are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13933.html" rel="external">"Normal B and T lymphocyte development"</a>.)</p><p>A CBC with differential should be performed on a blood specimen obtained at the time of the flow cytometric analysis, or the cytometer itself should be used to determine the lymphocyte number. This analysis permits the calculation of the absolute numbers of each lymphocyte subset. It is possible for the percentage of a particular subset to be abnormal while the total number of cells is within the normal range and vice versa. For the major subsets of lymphocytes, an absolute deficiency, rather than a relative (percentage) deficiency, is of much greater clinical significance.</p><p>Flow cytometry is invaluable in the assessment of lymphocyte subpopulations in patients with opportunistic infections or severe or persistent lymphopenia [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>].

In patients with CVID and autoimmunity, CD21 low B cells are elevated in numbers; these B cells show defective central and peripheral tolerance to self-antigens. In CVID patients with poor antibody responses, memory B cells (CD27+) are low, especially those that have switched their immunoglobulin isotype (IgM-negative, IgD-negative).

Flow cytometry can be used in the definitive diagnosis of several genetic immunodeficiencies by assessing the absence or abnormal expression of a specific protein (eg, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome).

A control tube with cells and media alone is also incubated. In the most common procedure, tritiated thymidine is added to the cells during the last 24 hours of culture. Dividing lymphocytes incorporate the thymidine into their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The extent of proliferation is determined by measuring the radioactivity taken up by cells. Many laboratories report results as a stimulation index (SI), the ratio of radioactivity (as counts per minute [CPM]) with stimulation over the CPM in the control tube without stimulation (background). This method is dependent on the number of lymphocytes in the sample and when during the cell cycle the thymidine is added so as to identify maximal cell proliferation. Tritiated thymidine incorporation should be interpreted with caution when there are very low numbers of T cells in the blood.</p><p>Suppression of T cell responses to mitogens and antigens may be seen with significant nutritional deficiencies, moderate-to-severe concurrent illnesses, or with administration of immunosuppressive drugs.

These tests are less susceptible to the effects of very low numbers of T cells and should exclusively be used when evaluating functional responses of T cells in SCID or severe lymphopenia. The assays can be performed using mitogens or specific antigens (eg, tetanus antigen) as stimuli and usually measure the uptake of a thymidine analog linked to a fluorescent dye (5-ethynyl-2'deoxyuridine [EdU]). Alternatively, the permeable fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) can be added to the cells prior to stimulation, and its diminution with each cell division can be measured [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>].

Newborns generally have higher mitogen responses compared with adults [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. When using a tritiated thymidine incorporation assay, depending upon the mitogens and the laboratory, the range of CPM reported for normal controls is approximately 50,000 to 300,000, with a SI between 10 and 200. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) is the mitogen most commonly used. Results for patients in comparison with controls are roughly interpreted as normal (&gt;50 percent of control), low (25 to 50 percent), very low (10 to 25 percent), or absent (&lt;10 percent). Results expressed as SI vary widely between laboratories.

OKT3 cross-links the epsilon chain of T cell CD3 complexes and stimulates T cells (in the presence of accessory or antigen-presenting cells) in a manner analogous to T cell mitogens [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. These tests are superior to mitogens in directly assessing the ability of the TCR itself to initiate activation. Proliferative responses to mitogen or OKT3 are generally similar, although they may sometimes give different patterns in the context of distinct immune defects [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. There are no published comparisons in a large group of normal individuals or immune-deficient patients. Most clinical reference laboratories use one or more mitogens and one or more antigens, but do not routinely use OKT3.</p><p>Diminished or absent proliferation indicates a serious derangement of T cell function. Mitogen responses will be severely depressed (usually well below the control fifth percentile) in the vast majority of patients with profound T cell lymphopenia (eg, complete DiGeorge syndrome), SCID [<a href="#rid35">35</a>], or advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). By comparison, the response may be partial or normal in milder syndromes of combined deficiency (eg, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome), in mainly humoral deficiency, or in those with infections (especially CMV and other herpes viruses) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h4">Response to specific antigens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Specific antigen tests are more sensitive than mitogen assays as indicators of defects in T cell function since the mechanisms of antigen-specific activation go through the TCR and are more complex than those for mitogens. These tests require antigen processing and presentation by antigen-presenting cells and thus are affected by states where antigen-presenting cells are low (eg, B cell depletion following treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> or with monogenic deficiencies of circulating dendritic cells). As with DTH testing, in vitro-specific antigen proliferation tests are not useful in infants or other patients who have not been vaccinated.</p><p>Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and monilia (<em>Candida</em>) are antigens frequently used for this assay. Since only a small number of cells respond to the specific antigens offered in these assays, the cultures must be maintained longer, and proliferation is often lower than for mitogen stimulation. Proliferation as assessed by CFSE or EdU incorporation dilution may also be lower than is seen for mitogen stimulation. Results expressed as CPM are often reported from 5000 to 50,000; results as SI generally range from 4 to 50. In general, a SI for specific antigen &gt;4 is usually considered adequate, although an isolated SI &lt;4 is not a reliable indicator of impaired cellular immunity.</p><p>In many forms of CID (eg, in those that diminish the signaling downstream of the TCR), responses to specific antigens are diminished or even absent while mitogen responses remain intact. In secondary immunodeficiency, specific antigen responses will also generally be suppressed more easily than mitogen responses. However, these generalizations are not always true [<a href="#rid37">37</a>], and interpretation of these tests requires expertise. As with DTH testing, booster immunization with tetanus followed by a repeat in vitro proliferation assay may detect a significant response.</p><p>Another way to assess function of T cells is to measure cytokine release, rather than proliferation, following antigen exposure. An example of this type of test that has become widely used in the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection is the IFN-gamma release assay, which can be used instead of tuberculin testing. Cytokine production upon stimulation with mitogens or tetanus antigen is typical. When low or absent, cytokine production defects indicate a failure of T cell activation that often parallels proliferative defects.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4062267085"><span class="h3">Chromosomal instability assays for radiation-sensitive patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tests for chromosomal breakage, as is present in Fanconi anemia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome, are commercially available.

Thus, a central step in making the diagnosis of IEI includes genetic testing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) tools include whole exome sequencing (WES), whole<strong> </strong>genome sequencing (WGS), and target enrichment NGS ("gene panels"). Genetic testing techniques had previously been performed at research centers, but availability has expanded through a number of academic and commercial laboratories. Due to the decrease in cost and increased availability, every patient with suspected IEI should have a genetic diagnosis as part of their workup [<a href="#rid42">42-52</a>]. Increasingly, genetic testing is performed earlier in the workup, and results of genetic tests can inform the need for other laboratory tests. Older techniques such as linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping worked well for identifying monogenic traits, particularly in patients with syndromic features, although a large pedigree or several smaller pedigrees were needed. Microarray methods of comparative genomic hybridization can detect relatively large areas of gain or loss of copy number and may identify clinically relevant change. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17039.html" rel="external">"Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications"</a>.)</p><p>Targeted NGS is a cost-effective method to screen for defects in known IEI-associated genes. It can identify patients with atypical presentations of known genetic defects and can also be used to identify the defect in patients with an IEI that has multiple associated candidate genes. Most panels allow for identification of copy number variation because they use high numbers of NGS reads. If targeted NGS screening is uninformative, WES is usually performed next. As the cost of WGS decreases, the role of WES and targeted NGS may become less clear.</p><p>WES assesses approximately 2 percent of the genome that encompasses most of the coding genes (the exons) and the few nucleotides that surround each exon (regions of splicing). In contrast, WGS includes the entire genome including the introns. Thus, WES is less laborious and expensive and easier to analyze. Variants found by WGS in the deep intronic regions or in the promoter regions of genes are difficult to interpret by themselves. Therefore, WGS is frequently performed in the research setting and is often coupled with ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing to allow for interpretations of alternative splicing and transcriptional levels. Both WES and WGS are used for identifying rare genetic defects, particularly in patients with early-onset severe disease. Validating a new variant either in a newly described or a known gene is difficult as the underlying biology needs to be understood, and the putatively pathogenic variants often have to be recreated in the lab to understand their impact on signaling or other aspects of the immune response.</p><p>These techniques also work well if several genes are involved (polygenic traits), although analysis can be challenging and laborious in that circumstance.
