At the cellular level, shock results from insufficient delivery of required metabolic substrates, principally oxygen, to sustain aerobic metabolism.</p><p>In the setting of trauma, loss of circulating blood volume from hemorrhage is the most common cause of shock. Non-hemorrhagic causes include inadequate oxygenation, mechanical obstruction (eg, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax), neurologic dysfunction (eg, high spinal cord injury), and cardiac dysfunction [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Shock is the leading cause of preventable death in injured patients and is second only to brain injury as the leading cause of overall death from trauma [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>The recognition, causes, and principles of the initial management of shock in the adult trauma patient are reviewed here. The initial management of hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic shock in the adult trauma patient, general management of trauma in adults and children, and other aspects of shock (including the pathophysiology and differential diagnosis) are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hemorrhage in adult trauma (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113837.html" rel="external">"Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General trauma management (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">"Initial management of trauma in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7956.html" rel="external">"Overview of inpatient management of the adult trauma patient"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Undifferentiated shock in adults (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98976.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of and initial approach to the adult patient with undifferentiated hypotension and shock"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1594.html" rel="external">"Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2093428802"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathophysiology of shock primarily relates to an imbalance in oxygen supply and demand. Patients in shock suffer from a critical reduction in oxygen available to the mitochondria. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can still be synthesized by anaerobic glycolysis but at only 5 to 10 percent of aerobic metabolism [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Anaerobic glycolysis results in hydrogen ion accumulation and generation of pyruvate, which is converted to lactate [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Any type of shock can occur in the injured patient  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99574" href="/z/d/graphic/99574.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), while hemorrhagic shock is by far the most common. The pathophysiology of shock is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1594.html" rel="external">"Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The compensatory physiologic responses to shock are an attempt to maintain adequate oxygen delivery to tissues. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system results in an increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, and increased ventricular contractility. As the shock state progresses, vital organ (eg, brain and heart) perfusion can only be maintained at the expense of nonvital organs. If the process is not reversed, progressive metabolic acidosis along with hypoxemia ultimately causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction and cardiovascular collapse.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2473865005"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES OF SHOCK</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2215850464"><span class="h2">Common clinical signs of shock</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Obvious and immediately detectable manifestations of shock include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tachycardia (an exception is neurogenic shock, which may present with normal heart rate or bradycardia)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypotension</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cool extremities (an exception is neurogenic shock, which may present with warm extremities)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weak peripheral pulses</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prolonged capillary refill (&gt;2 seconds)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Narrowing of the pulse pressure (&lt;25 mmHg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased respiratory rate</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Change in skin color (eg, pale, cyanotic)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Altered mental status not due to head injury (may range from mild agitation to coma)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3081854628"><span class="h2">Stages of hemorrhagic shock</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) curriculum describes four classes of hemorrhage to emphasize the early signs of the shock state [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A significant blood pressure decrease is generally not seen until 30 percent of a patient's blood volume is lost (class III hemorrhage). These classes and the associated signs and symptoms exist along a clinical spectrum with variability among individuals.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class I hemorrhage involves a blood volume loss of up to 15 percent. The heart rate is minimally elevated or normal, and there is no change in blood pressure, pulse pressure, or respiratory rate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class II hemorrhage occurs when there is a 15 to 30 percent blood volume loss and is manifested clinically as tachycardia (heart rate of 100 to 120 beats per minute), tachypnea (respiratory rate of 20 to 24 breaths per minute), and a decreased pulse pressure, although systolic blood pressure changes minimally, if at all. The skin may be cool and clammy, and capillary refill may be delayed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class III hemorrhage involves a 30 to 40 percent blood volume loss, resulting in a drop in blood pressure and changes in mental status. Any hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg) or drop in blood pressure greater than 20 to 30 percent of the measurement at presentation is cause for concern. Heart rate (≥120 beats per minutes and thready) and respiratory rate are markedly elevated, while urine output is diminished. Capillary refill is delayed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class IV hemorrhage involves more than 40 percent blood volume loss, leading to significant depression in blood pressure and mental status. Most patients in class IV shock are hypotensive (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg). Pulse pressure is narrowed (≤25 mmHg), and tachycardia is marked (&gt;120 beats per minute). Urine output is minimal or absent. The skin is cold and pale, and capillary refill is delayed.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H442039229"><span class="h2">Recognizing early and non-obvious signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early recognition, ideally before hypotension develops, is the first step in managing the injured patient with shock [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Recognizing shock in its early stages can be difficult but provides clinicians greater opportunity for reversal of end-organ hypoperfusion. The clinical presentation of traumatic shock depends on the rate, volume, and duration of bleeding, the patient's baseline physiology, and the presence of other acute pathologic processes (eg, tension pneumothorax, myocardial ischemia). In severe trauma, patients often sustain more than one injury that contributes to the shock state.</p><p>In patients with a significant traumatic mechanism, even if they initially appear "stable," serial examinations, vital signs, and bedside ultrasound studies can help identify occult and potentially life-threatening injuries [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Subtle changes in vital signs and physical exam findings are best detected by frequent reassessment, preferably by the same provider, and may offer the earliest clues to the presence of significant injury and/or early shock. Pallor or poor capillary refill may represent peripheral vasoconstriction. Diaphoresis can indicate physiologic stress and appear before vital sign abnormalities. Mild tachypnea may reflect compensation for metabolic acidosis. Increasing heart rate may reflect ongoing hemorrhage. Low urine output may indicate inadequate visceral perfusion. Patients who are unable to maintain a urine output greater than 0.5 mL/kg per hour may have underlying hypovolemia.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"Normal" vital signs</strong> — Shock may exist even in the setting of "normal" vital signs, particularly in older patients. Young patients without underlying comorbidities can maintain a blood pressure within the normal range despite substantial blood loss through compensatory vasoconstriction and increases in heart rate, which can be followed by an acute decompensation if the cause of the shock state is not addressed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bradycardia, which may be vagally mediated, can occur following intraperitoneal injury [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. A paradoxical or relative bradycardia can also occur in hypoperfusing trauma patients. A retrospective review comparing initial heart rate with base deficits and lactate concentrations in more than 1700 trauma patients found that patients with hypoperfusion without tachycardia had a poor prognosis independent of injury severity, systolic blood pressure, and head injury [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medications blunting tachycardia</strong> — Patients in shock who take cardioactive medications (eg, beta blockers) may not have typical vital sign responses, such as compensatory tachycardia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Shock index</strong> – The shock index and modified shock index can help identify early shock. In a trauma patient, a shock index (the heart rate divided by the systolic blood pressure) greater than 0.9 is associated with increased likelihood of transfusion and increased mortality [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. A normal shock index is 0.5 to 0.7. A modified shock index (the heart rate divide by the mean arterial pressure) greater than 1.3 or less than 0.7 is associated with increased mortality [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Older adults</strong> — Older patients are more likely to be taking anticoagulants or medications that affect the hemodynamic response to injury and are more likely to have baseline hypertension. Therefore, an older patient with a normal blood pressure may actually be hypotensive compared with their baseline if they have underlying hypertension [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Reviewing a patient's medication list and notes of previous medical encounters can often provide useful information such as their baseline blood pressure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87285.html" rel="external">"Geriatric trauma: Initial evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subtle alteration in mental status</strong> — Initial alterations in mental status caused by hypoperfusion may be subtle and are difficult to distinguish from drug or alcohol intoxication, head injury, or behavioral issues. In young, healthy patients, agitation, confusion, irritability, indifference to surroundings, or inattention to instructions may be the only early signs of shock. Altered mental status on presentation or a subsequent decline in mental status, particularly in patients without obvious evidence of head injury, should raise suspicion for cerebral hypoperfusion. Normal pulse oximetry and fingerstick glucose measurements in such patients further increase concern for cerebral hypoperfusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pelvic injuries</strong> — Retroperitoneal hemorrhage from a pelvic fracture can be occult. As part of the examination, gentle compression of the pelvis should be done <strong>once</strong> <strong>only</strong> to test for pelvic instability, which is highly specific (albeit not sensitive) for pelvic fracture. Pressure should be directed posterior and medial in order to feel an unstable fracture "closing," and not to further displace ("open") an unstable injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/360.html" rel="external">"Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Superficial and extremity injuries</strong> — Scalp lacerations can bleed profusely, especially if the patient is taking an anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication. These wounds can be overlooked if there are distracting thoracic or abdominal injuries or if they bled significantly prior to arrival for medical care.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After a femur fracture, the thigh can hold up to one to two liters of blood. This may not be initially obvious and only become apparent after recognizing increasing thigh girth on re-evaluation.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1129666181"><span class="h1">CAUSES OF SHOCK IN THE TRAUMA PATIENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1900777896"><span class="h2">Hemorrhagic sites</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hemorrhage is the most common cause of shock in the trauma patient and should be the presumed cause until proven otherwise  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63698" href="/z/d/graphic/63698.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).
