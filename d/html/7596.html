STIs are frequently asymptomatic and can lead to various complications. The immediate goal of screening for STIs is to identify and treat infected persons before they develop complications and to identify, test, and treat their sex partners to prevent transmission and reinfections.</p><p>In this topic, we discuss screening for STIs among asymptomatic individuals. In its 2021 guidelines on the treatment of sexually transmitted infections, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also made recommendations on screening [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has also released guidelines on screening for various STIs [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America's HIV Medical Association has published STI screening recommendations for persons with HIV [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The recommendations in this topic are largely consistent with these guidelines. Other subspecialty group guidelines and national guidelines may be more pertinent in certain settings [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>].</p><p>Information on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of specific STIs is reviewed in detail separately, as are a number of related topics: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The approach to patients with specific genitourinary symptoms and signs:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5477.html" rel="external">"Vaginitis in adults: Initial evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7581.html" rel="external">"Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7592.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with genital ulcers"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8063.html" rel="external">"Acute simple cystitis in adult and adolescent females"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>STIs and HIV infection in adolescents:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115.html" rel="external">"Sexually transmitted infections: Issues specific to adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6007.html" rel="external">"The adolescent with HIV infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prevention of STIs:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7595.html" rel="external">"Prevention of sexually transmitted infections"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Guidelines for STI screening for individuals using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113426.html" rel="external">"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1120616292"><span class="h1">RATIONALE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complications of untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs) include upper genital tract infections, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, cervical cancer, and chronic infection with hepatitis viruses and HIV. The approach to STI diagnosis and management is based upon disease or symptom-specific syndromes, including vaginal discharge, urethral discharge, ulcerative genital disease, nonulcerative genital disease, and pelvic pain. However, many patients have asymptomatic disease, which increases the risk of complications and sustained transmission in the community. Thus, screening is an important approach to identify and treat infected individuals, who would otherwise go undetected. Routine screening for all potential STIs in all patients is cost-prohibitive [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]; targeted screening of asymptomatic patients in specified risk groups is more feasible.</p><p>There is little direct evidence supporting the efficacy of screening programs. Screening for chlamydia has been the most extensively studied. The drawbacks to screening pertain largely to expense of the tests, the infrastructure required to administer them, and the psychological and relationship repercussions of false positive tests, which do occur, particularly among low prevalence populations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88323163"><span class="h2">Chlamydia and gonorrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infections with <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> are very common. In the United States, they are the two most commonly reported communicable diseases. In females, the primary benefit of screening and treatment is to reduce their personal risk of reproductive sequelae. In males, who have a lower risk of long-term sequelae or more frequently have symptomatic disease, the main rationale for screening and treatment would be to reduce the likelihood of reinfection of sex partners and reduce overall transmission of these infections.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88324495"><span class="h3">Females</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among females, most chlamydial and gonococcal infections are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and if left untreated, can lead to serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, complications of pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain [<a href="#rid4">4,11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83019.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis </i>infections", section on 'Clinical syndromes in females'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15893.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae </i>infection in adults and adolescents", section on 'Infection of the female urogenital tract'</a>.)</p><p>Because the incidence of these infections are highest among adolescents and young adults, screening efforts have focused on this age group. Some proponents have argued that school-based health centers should implement systematic screening programs in adolescents to target these high-risk populations [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. For older females, decisions on screening are based on the presence of personal behavioral risk factors. (See <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Several trials have suggested that screening young females for chlamydia reduces the rate of subsequent PID, although some limitations reduce certainty about the findings [<a href="#rid13">13-16</a>]. As an example, in a trial of female college students in London, all participants provided vaginal swabs at study entry and were then randomly assigned to screening (in which the samples were tested for chlamydia and those with positive tests were treated) or control (in which the samples were stored and analyzed at the end of the study) [<a href="#rid14">14,17</a>]. Among those with chlamydia at baseline, 1 of 63 in the intervention group versus 7 of 74 in the control group developed PID (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03- 1.01). However, 30 of the 38 cases of PID observed in the study occurred in participants with negative baseline chlamydia, and 10 of those cases were documented to be associated with chlamydia. These findings indicate the importance of ongoing chlamydial transmission and the need for repeated screening over time in at-risk individuals.</p><p>Data on the effect of screening on prevalence of chlamydia are less clear, although studies evaluating the impact have had limitations. In one study of females and males aged 16 to 29 years in the Netherlands who were offered yearly home-based chlamydia screening tests for three years, participation was low (10 to 16 percent), and there was no evidence of reduced chlamydia rates after three rounds of screening [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Effects on population prevalences could not be reliably estimated because of low uptake. In a cluster-randomized trial in rural Australia, a clinic-based intervention to promote yearly chlamydia screening for sexually active females and males aged 16 to 28 years did not reduce the chlamydia prevalence in the clinic population more than standard care [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In both groups, rates decreased from about 5 to 3.4 percent over three years. Importantly, while screening uptake increased in both groups, only 20 and 13 percent of patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively, were tested during the last year of the study. </p><p>While nongenital infections in females (eg, rectal chlamydial infection, pharyngeal and rectal gonococcal infection) have been recognized increasingly, the adverse consequences of undetected and untreated infection at these sites are largely unknown. Screening may be considered based on reported sexual behaviors and exposures, through shared clinical decision-making between the patient and provider. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89490.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> infections", section on 'Extragenital infections'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88324501"><span class="h3">Males</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The major rationale for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening among males is to reduce infection or reinfection of existing partners and transmission to new partners. For males who have sex with only females, it is unclear if this would be of additive benefit over screening females and treating them and their sex partners. Screening is thus more relevant among men who have sex with men (MSM), among whom there is a high burden of STIs, which would be less likely impacted by screening efforts among females.</p><p>MSM are at high risk of STIs, in part, because of individual behavioral risk, but also because of other factors, such as a higher prevalence of these infections within MSM sexual networks. In the United States in 2018, the median prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea among MSM seen at STI clinics throughout the country was 6 and 8 percent for urogenital infection and 16 and 15 percent for rectal infection [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Prevalence is even higher among MSM with HIV. Although there are few data to show that these screening tests improve outcomes, it is reasonable to perform screening on at least an annual basis given the high-prevalence rates of these STIs in MSM and the higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among gonococcal isolates in this population. MSM with high-risk behaviors should be screened every three months. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15892.html" rel="external">"Treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea (<i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae </i>infection) in adults and adolescents", section on 'Antibiotic resistance'</a>.) </p><p>Evaluation for infection at nongenital sites (ie, rectal, pharyngeal) is also important in this population. Several studies have reported that a significant proportion of gonorrhea and chlamydia cases would be missed if genital-only screening were performed [<a href="#rid21">21-24</a>]. For example, over a seven-year period, 7333 MSM attending a STI clinic in the United States underwent culture and/or NAAT sampling of multiple sites [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The study demonstrated that one-third of the total number of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> cases would have been missed if only urethral or urine samples were tested. Similar findings have been reported in MSM with HIV [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. It has also been suggested that the acquisition of drug resistance mainly takes place at extragenital sites, such as the throat, where horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants is more likely to occur than in the urethra [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>For males who have sex with only females, there is little rationale for routine screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Evidence to support routine screening of chlamydia in males is lacking. Although screening and treating asymptomatic males for STI can reduce the burden of infection and thus transmission, it is unclear if this would be of additive benefit over screening females and treating them and their sex partners. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to screen heterosexual males for chlamydia in high-prevalence settings (eg, at STI or adolescent clinics and correctional facilities) if resources allow and screening programs for males would not negatively impact those for females [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>Among asymptomatic heterosexual males, gonorrhea prevalence is low (0 to 1.5 percent), in contrast to rates as high as 28 percent among symptomatic males in some settings [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Focusing on treating symptomatic males would thus likely address a significant proportion of the gonococcal burden among heterosexual males, and screening asymptomatic males may not add substantial value.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2366324584"><span class="h3">Transgender and gender-diverse persons</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gonorrhea and chlamydia screening recommendations should be adapted based on anatomy (ie, screening recommendations for cisgender females should be extended to all transgender males and gender-diverse people with a cervix). Screening at the pharyngeal and rectal site for gonorrhea and chlamydia should be considered based on reported sexual behaviors and exposure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88323746"><span class="h2">Trichomonas</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>Trichomonas</em> <em>vaginalis</em> infection is often asymptomatic, has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and, among females with HIV, an increased risk of PID. Some studies have suggested that vaginal trichomoniasis is also a risk factor for HIV acquisition and transmission [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. The prevalence of trichomoniasis appears to increase with age and is up to twice as high in females with HIV. Screening at entry to care and at least annually thereafter is recommended for sexually active females with HIV. Screening may be considered for females receiving care in high-prevalence settings or at increased risk [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5453.html" rel="external">"Trichomoniasis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88323184"><span class="h2">Syphilis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Syphilis can lead to serious long-term sequelae, including cardiac and neurologic manifestations, which are prevented by treatment in the early stages of disease, which can be minimally symptomatic or easily left undiagnosed. Screening and treatment can also reduce transmission of infection. Additionally, syphilis is associated with an increased risk for HIV transmission and acquisition [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>]. </p><p>Although syphilis is not as common as chlamydia or gonorrhea, the prevalence can be high among certain risk groups. As an example, in the United States, the majority of all primary and secondary syphilis cases occur among MSM, many of whom have HIV [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, the USPSTF recommends routine screening of asymptomatic persons who are at increased risk of syphilis, in particular MSM and individuals with HIV [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7588.html" rel="external">"Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing", section on 'Asymptomatic patients'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88323170"><span class="h2">HIV and hepatitis viruses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Untreated HIV infection, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can result in substantial excess morbidity and mortality for the infected individual and contribute to further transmission of these infections. These infections can be transmitted sexually as well as through other modes of transmission, and screening is recommended for broader populations than just those at risk of sexual acquisition. Rationale for screening for these infections is discussed elsewhere: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3736.html" rel="external">"Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection", section on 'Rationale for routine screening'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3680.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis in adults", section on 'Approach to screening and testing'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89950.html" rel="external">"Screening and diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Rationale'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Sexual transmission of HCV is not particularly efficient, and the risk is very low among monogamous sexual partners. However, the risk is higher in those with multiple sexual partners, and sexual transmission among MSM has been increasingly reported, particularly among MSM with HIV [<a href="#rid32">32-38</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3675.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Sexual transmission'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88323191"><span class="h2">Human papillomavirus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Persistent viral infection with specific high-risk genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) causes virtually all cancers of the cervix and is associated with oropharyngeal and anal cancer.</p><p>Screening currently focuses on detection of oncogenic HPV infection and/or the cytologic abnormalities that can be caused by persistent HPV infection. </p><p>The rationale for cervical cancer screening among females is discussed in detail elsewhere. In the United States, guidelines issued by various professional organizations strongly recommend screening for cervical cancer, although there are minor differences in the recommended screening parameters. Cervical cancer screening policies in other countries also differ by starting age, stopping age, and frequency. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7575.html" rel="external">"Screening for cervical cancer in resource-rich settings"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3220.html" rel="external">"Screening for cervical cancer in patients with HIV infection and other immunocompromised states"</a>.)</p><p>The rationale of screening for AIN in individuals at increased risk for anal cancer is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8032.html" rel="external">"Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment", section on 'Screening for anal SIL'</a>.)</p><p>There are no screening tests for HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers.</p><p>HPV vaccination can prevent HPV infection and its sequelae. Vaccination status does not change recommendations for screening. This is discussed in detail elsewhere.

It is a recognized cause of nongonococcal urethritis in males and has been associated with cervicitis and PID in females. However, the benefits of screening and treatment in asymptomatic persons are unclear. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83202.html" rel="external">"<i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i> infection"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88323198"><span class="h2">Herpes simplex virus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Routine screening for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections is not recommended [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, performing type-specific serological testing for HSV can be useful on an individual basis to counsel couples on their risk for HSV transmission, particularly during pregnancy.

The majority of infections are transmitted from individuals unaware of their infection or during asymptomatic periods between outbreaks.

Many patients have asymptomatic disease, and screening for infection is thus an important approach to identify and treat infected individuals who would otherwise go undetected. (See <a class="local">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors and risk groups</strong> – Although all sexually active individuals are at some risk of STIs, screening for all STIs in all patients is not practical. Thus, screening for STIs focuses on those who are at high risk. For some STIs, this is done by targeting specific risk groups that have a high prevalence for STIs (eg, females &lt;25 years old, men who have sex with men [MSM], patients with HIV, and individuals entering into correctional facilities). In other cases, screening is dependent on assessment of an individual's personal risk based on behavioral factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61677" href="/z/d/graphic/61677.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) or the prevalence of infection in the local community.
