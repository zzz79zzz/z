It is an alternative to mastectomy for patients with early breast cancer. </p><p>Prior to the advent of BCT, all breast cancers were treated with mastectomy. Despite the fact that modern surgical techniques are less morbid than radical mastectomy, a mastectomy still requires the loss of the breast. The goals of BCT are to provide the survival equivalent of mastectomy, a cosmetically acceptable breast, and a low rate of recurrence in the treated breast. </p><p>The indications, techniques, complications, and outcomes of BCT will be reviewed here. BCT requires adjuvant radiation therapy in most patients, which is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The selection of appropriate patients is crucial to the success of BCT. Most contraindications to BCT are due to either a failure to obtain margin control with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or an inability to tolerate adjuvant radiotherapy. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H203142178"><span class="h2">Absolute contraindications for BCT</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A clinical diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) or the presence of extensive skin changes or dermal lymphatic involvement consistent with IBC. Even following a complete clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, modified radical mastectomy is recommended in the treatment of IBC, followed by post-mastectomy radiation therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/768.html" rel="external">"Inflammatory breast cancer: Clinical features and treatment", section on 'Locoregional treatment'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multicentric disease, defined as two or more primary tumors in separate quadrants of the breast such that they cannot be encompassed in a single excision, has classically been considered an absolute contraindication to BCT. However, this may be changing for select patients. In the Alliance Z11102 trial, 198 women with two (96 percent) or three (4 percent) separate sites of biopsy-proven malignancy separated by ≥2 cm within the same breast underwent BCS with negative margins followed by whole breast radiation with boost to all lumpectomy beds. Breast conservation was feasible in 93 percent, with 70 percent of patients having two separate lumpectomies. Surgery was completed in a single operation in 73 percent; only 7 percent required mastectomy due to positive margins [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. At two years, the majority of women who underwent BCT reported good-to-excellent cosmesis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. At five years, the cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 3.1 percent (95% CI 1.3-6.4) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. For select patients with multicentric disease, where the tumors are small, have favorable histology, and two separate lumpectomies are technically feasible, BCT may be an option. However, because the Z11102 trial is a registry trial which could have allowed surgeons to selectively enroll patients with favorable results, further evidence is required for BCT to be routinely recommended for multicentric diseases. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Of note, the five-year local recurrence rate was much higher without preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) than with it (22.6 versus 1.7 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In that analysis, however, only 15 patients received preoperative MRI versus 189 patients who did not. This calls into question the generalizability of mandatory MRI to make sure there are no other areas of suspicion prior to proceeding with more than one lumpectomy, especially in light of the plethora of data demonstrating that MRI does not improve surgical outcomes (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/808.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of suspected breast cancer", section on 'Impact of preoperative breast MRI'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diffuse malignant microcalcifications on mammography.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of prior therapeutic radiation therapy (RT) that included a portion of the affected breast, which, when combined with the proposed treatment, would result in an excessively high total radiation dose to the chest wall. The two most common scenarios are prior mantle radiation to the chest wall for Hodgkin lymphoma and prior whole breast radiotherapy for breast cancer. Although there is ongoing research exploring the potential of 3D conformal partial breast reirradiation in selected patients who have an in-breast recurrence and prior whole breast irradiation [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], it is still investigational.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The use of breast irradiation is contraindicated during pregnancy, but BCT is an option during pregnancy if the timing works out so that the radiation may be delivered postpartum. Thus, breast cancer diagnosed during the first trimester should be treated with mastectomy. Breast cancer diagnosed during the second or third trimester can be managed with BCS followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery, with the radiotherapy delivered postpartum. For breast cancer diagnosed late in the third trimester, it may be possible to perform BCS in the third trimester, deferring breast irradiation until after delivery. Breast cancer during pregnancy is further discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/786.html" rel="external">"Gestational breast cancer: Epidemiology and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15801.html" rel="external">"Gestational breast cancer: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistently positive resection margins despite multiple attempts at re-excision after BCS [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some patients with a history of connective tissue disease tolerate irradiation poorly, and so the use of radiation as a component of BCT must be weighed against the possible complications [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Scleroderma and Sjögren disease are contraindications to radiation because of cutaneous fragility [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Breast cancer patients with these two connective tissue disorders should undergo mastectomy instead of BCT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis can also increase risk of radiation toxicity, but data are sparse. Thus, management of breast cancer in patients with these two conditions can be individualized [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H186106697"><span class="h2">Relative contraindications for BCT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tumor size relative to breast size is an important consideration in selecting patients for BCS. A large tumor in a small breast is a relative contraindication, since an adequate resection would result in significant cosmetic alteration. </p><p>However, breast size in itself is not a contraindication to BCT. Women with large or pendulous breasts can undergo breast irradiation successfully as long as reproducibility of patient setup can be ensured and it is technically possible to obtain adequate dose homogeneity. It is now widely accepted that patient eligibility for BCS is determined more by the anticipated cosmetic result, as well as the ability to achieve margin control and deliver adjuvant radiation, than by the size of the primary tumor [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p>Tumor size in itself is not an absolute contraindication to BCT either. Neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy can reduce tumor size significantly and allow for breast conservation with acceptable rates of local recurrence [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Whether a patient is eligible for BCS is dependent on the extent of tumor involvement after, not before, neoadjuvant treatment. (See <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant therapy prior to BCT'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14225.html" rel="external">"General principles of neoadjuvant management of breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1974713145"><span class="h2">Not a contraindication for BCT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pool of candidates for BCT is expanding commensurate with advances in neoadjuvant therapy, surgical and radiation therapy techniques, and pathologic evaluation [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Factors that are no longer considered contraindications for BCT include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age is not a contraindication for BCT. For older women, physiologic age and the presence of comorbid conditions should be the primary determinants of local therapy, rather than chronological age. Young age, which is defined as ≤40 years in the majority of studies, by itself, is not a contraindication to BCT and is a prognostic rather than predictive factor [<a href="#rid13">13-22</a>]. Furthermore, the recurrence rates after BCT are very similar to those after mastectomy in young women in contemporary series [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. However, bilateral mastectomy may be preferred among relatively younger patients with hereditary breast cancer, such as <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>BRCA2</em> mutation carriers, or those with a strong family history. In those patients, bilateral mastectomy serves a risk-reducing purpose. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Local involvement or retraction of the skin or nipple-areolar complex does not necessarily contraindicate BCT. However, a portion of skin or the nipple-areolar complex will likely need to be resected to achieve negative margins, so the cosmetic implications of this should be factored into the decision to proceed with BCT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Histologic subtypes other than invasive ductal carcinoma (eg, invasive lobular cancer) are not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence; these women are candidates for BCT if the tumor distribution is not diffuse and it can be excised with negative margins. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because tumors with a lobular histology often present insidiously, it may be more difficult to perform BCS in these patients [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. However, as long as negative margins can be obtained, the local control of invasive lobular cancer is comparable to that in invasive ductal cancer. The presence of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) does not affect rates of local recurrence, and classic LCIS at lumpectomy margins has no clinical significance and does not warrant a re-excision. Pleomorphic LCIS, however, behaves more like ductal carcinoma in situ and does require margin clearance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/743.html" rel="external">"Atypia and lobular carcinoma in situ: High-risk lesions of the breast"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/783.html" rel="external">"Pathology of breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extensive intraductal component (EIC) is defined as an invasive ductal carcinoma in which intraductal cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]) is present in greater than 25 percent of the tumor. Both requirements must be met before EIC can be diagnosed. Because EIC refers to the DCIS component of an invasive cancer, it does not apply to pure DCIS. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The presence of EIC is an indicator that disease extent may be greater than clinically suspected. While EIC-positive cancers with a positive margin have a higher rate of local recurrence compared with EIC-negative cancers, EIC-positive cancers with negative resection margins do not have an increased risk of ipsilateral recurrence following BCT [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Thus, EIC is not a contraindication to BCT by itself, though routine assessment of the margins of resection is an important component of the histologic evaluation in women with an EIC; patients with negative margins are still acceptable candidates for BCT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14219.html" rel="external">"Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lymph node positivity is a marker of worse prognosis, but positive lymph nodes are not a contraindication for BCT, as BCT and mastectomy have equivalent outcomes independent of nodal metastases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tumor location should not dictate but can influence the choice of treatment. Tumors in a superficial subareolar location may require resection of the nipple-areolar complex to achieve negative margins; oncologic outcomes will not be affected, but the cosmetic result may be. Although oncoplastic techniques improve cosmesis, the patient and their clinician need to assess whether such a resection is preferable to mastectomy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An inherited susceptibility to breast and other cancers has been linked to germ-line mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genes in some women. Young women with a strong family history of either breast or ovarian cancer have a significant probability of harboring one of the mutations and should be offered genetic counseling about these mutations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/785.html" rel="external">"Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/753.html" rel="external">"Genetic testing and management of individuals at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although a family history of breast cancer is not a contraindication to BCT, women with hereditary breast cancer (eg, <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation carrier) should be informed about their increased risk of a second primary cancer, and that bilateral mastectomy may reduce that risk. However, those contemplating bilateral mastectomy must understand that contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) has not been shown to have a survival benefit [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. That is because the survival rates tend to be driven by the metastatic potential of the first cancer and mastectomy does not eliminate the risk of either a chest wall recurrence or a new primary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/758.html" rel="external">"Cancer risks and management of BRCA1/2 carriers without cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/785.html" rel="external">"Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The decision whether to pursue BCT in known <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation carriers should be made following extensive discussion with an experienced surgeon and a genetics counselor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>BCS is not contraindicated for women with dense breast tissue. In a prospective study of 1052 patients undergoing attempted BCS, patients with dense breast tissue were significantly more likely to be treated with an initial mastectomy compared with women with less dense breast tissue (74 versus 52 percent, odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% CI 1.44-2.62) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. This may reflect surgeon or patient bias rather than an inability to fulfill criteria for BCS. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, MRI was performed more often in patients with dense breast tissue (65 versus 33 percent). However, breast density was not associated with positive margins for BCS or conversion to a mastectomy, and preoperative MRI did not decrease the risk of positive margins. (See <a class="local">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Mastectomy is mandatory for tumor control in patients with breast cancer and one or more absolute contraindications for BCT, and it may provide more satisfactory outcomes in others. The specific indications and techniques of mastectomy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14981.html" rel="external">"Mastectomy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3660634119"><span class="h2">Shared decision making</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the past, BCT was underutilized in the United States [<a href="#rid29">29-32</a>] due to both surgeon and patient reasons [<a href="#rid33">33-36</a>]. To inform an optimal choice, the individual patient's needs and expectations should be accurately assessed. This requires that the patient and clinician discuss the benefits and risks of mastectomy versus BCT in regards to long-term survival, the likelihood and consequence of local recurrence, and the impact on cosmetic outcome and psychosocial adjustment. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>To dispel a common misconception that mastectomy is a more "aggressive" approach to treating cancer that guarantees that they will never have to deal with cancer or additional treatment again, patients should be clearly told that [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>BCT and mastectomy have equivalent survival outcomes.

(See <a class="local">'Patient selection for BCT'</a> above.)</p><p>The biologic plausibility of a more limited procedure (BCS) being superior to a more radical surgery (mastectomy) can potentially be explained by the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) [<a href="#rid97">97</a>] and the fact that mastectomy may not remove all breast tissue (thus leaving behind microscopic cancer foci) [<a href="#rid98">98</a>]. </p><p>Indeed, we know that the success of BCT is contingent upon moderate-dose RT in eliminating subclinical foci of disease in the ipsilateral breast. Adjuvant RT has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of in-breast recurrences [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/739.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, the isolated axillary recurrence rate after BCT has been shown to be lower than that after mastectomy without radiation (1.1 versus 3.5 percent) in a prospective nonrandomized study with 13 year follow-up [<a href="#rid99">99</a>]. In that study, both overall survival (79.5 versus 64.3 percent) and disease-free survival (90.5 versus 84 percent) were better after BCT than after mastectomy, although the ipsilateral breast or chest wall recurrence-free survival rates were not statistically different (90.5 percent BCT versus 95 percent mastectomy; p = 0.428). Thus, the survival benefit of BCT should at least be partially attributed to the protective effect of radiation. The tangential radiation fields originating from whole breast irradiation may help reduce recurrence by controlling minimal residual disease in the lower axilla. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h2">Local recurrence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Local control is important to overall survival because local failure is a risk factor for distant metastasis [<a href="#rid100">100</a>]. Rough estimates indicate that one patient may die from breast cancer for every four local recurrences [<a href="#rid98">98</a>]. </p><p>A higher locoregional recurrence rate for BCT was reported in some of the early trials comparing BCT with mastectomy [<a href="#rid101">101</a>]. In randomized studies using variable surgical and radiation techniques, long-term recurrence rates in the treated breast following BCT ranged from 5 to 22 percent, compared with 4 to 14 percent with mastectomy [<a href="#rid75">75-79,81,82</a>]. In those days, the risk of local recurrence after BCT was estimated to be around 1 percent per year, or 10 percent at 10 years. However, the higher local recurrence rate did not appear to negatively impact survival [<a href="#rid102">102</a>]. </p><p>Since then, better imaging, more attention to margins, and more effective and longer durations of systemic therapy have reduced local recurrence rate after BCT to just 2 percent at 10 years [<a href="#rid103">103</a>]. Thus, the local recurrence rate after contemporary treatment with BCT is no longer considered higher than that after mastectomy [<a href="#rid104">104</a>]. </p><p>The local recurrence rate following BCT increases with young age, positive surgical margins, node positivity, estrogen receptor negativity, and absence of radiation therapy [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. It is important to realize that these factors are <strong>not</strong> contraindications to BCT, but their presence may influence the choice of treatment. (See <a class="local">'Not a contraindication for BCT'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2434383344"><span class="h2">Cosmetic outcome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to local recurrence, another major goal of BCT is the preservation of a cosmetically acceptable breast. With modern treatment techniques, an acceptable cosmetic outcome can be achieved in almost all patients without compromising local tumor control. </p><p>Many surgical factors will play a role in the ultimate cosmetic appearance of the breast. These include the size and placement of the incision, management of the lumpectomy cavity, and the extent of axillary dissection if necessary. The surgeon has control over several of these issues, and careful attention to detail will improve the aesthetic results [<a href="#rid105">105</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Breast-conserving surgery'</a> above.)</p><p>The amount of resected breast tissue is the major determinant of appearance following BCS. Oncoplastic surgical techniques allow resection of a breast cancer with wide surgical margins while preserving the shape and appearance of the breast. Patients with either a large tumor relative to their breast size or a central tumor are candidates for oncoplastic resections. Long-term outcomes of oncoplastic surgery are comparable or superior to those of standard breast conservation surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14976.html" rel="external">"Oncoplastic breast surgery"</a>.)</p><p>Adjuvant radiotherapy can also influence cosmetic outcomes by causing skin fibrosis. The primary approach to prevention of radiation-induced fibrosis is through the use of appropriate radiation therapy doses and techniques that minimize the radiation exposure for normal tissue. For patients with established radiation-induced fibrosis, treatment is primarily symptomatic and includes a combination of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9757" href="/z/d/drug information/9757.html" rel="external">pentoxifylline</a> and tocopherol (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10049" href="/z/d/drug information/10049.html" rel="external">vitamin E</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7055.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, prevention, and treatment of radiation-induced fibrosis"</a>.)</p><p>Although treatment-related changes in the breast stabilize at approximately three years, other factors that affect the untreated breast, such as change in size because of weight gain or the normal ptosis seen with aging, continue to affect breast symmetry. Such less-than-ideal cosmetic results can be remedied by reconstruction of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast.

Successful BCT requires complete surgical removal of the tumor (with negative surgical margins) followed by radiation therapy to eradicate any residual disease. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient selection for BCT</strong> – Patient selection is crucial to the success of BCT. BCT should be offered unless:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>It is not possible to obtain margin control with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) (eg, inflammatory breast cancer, multicentric disease, diffuse malignant microcalcifications, or persistent positive margins despite multiple re-excisions).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There is a contraindication to adjuvant radiation therapy (eg, pregnancy, prior breast irradiation, scleroderma, or Sjögren disease). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cosmetic concerns do not dictate but can influence procedure choice (eg, large tumor in a small breast, breast asymmetry, or postradiation fibrosis). (See <a class="local">'Patient selection for BCT'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy</strong> – Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to increase eligibility for BCT. Before the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy, a clip should be placed in the tumor bed to guide BCS. After completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, breast imaging should be repeated to determine a patient's candidacy for BCT. All patients should undergo definitive breast surgery, either BCS or mastectomy, including those who are fortunate enough to achieve a complete response. (See <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant therapy prior to BCT'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98345.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant management of newly diagnosed hormone-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Breast surgery</strong> – BCS involves excision of the primary tumor (ie, lumpectomy) to negative margins (see <a class="local">'Breast-conserving surgery'</a> above): </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Margin for invasive breast cancer</strong> – For patients with stage I or II invasive breast cancer treated with BCS followed by whole breast irradiation, we recommend "no ink on tumor" as the standard margin (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). However, we use an individualized approach to patients who have a close margin (eg, &lt;1 mm) with regard to re-excision. (See <a class="local">'Margins for invasive cancer'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Margin for DCIS</strong> – For patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with BCS followed by whole breast irradiation, negative margins are also required. We suggest a ≥2 mm rather than a narrower negative margin (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>) because a ≥2 mm margin may confer additional benefit for local recurrence over a narrower margin. However, we use an individualized approach to patients who have a close but negative margin (eg, &gt;0 or 1 mm) with regard to re-excision. (See <a class="local">'Margins for DCIS'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Surgical evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes (most commonly with sentinel lymph node biopsy [SLNB]) is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/813.html" rel="external">"Overview of management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer", section on 'Axillary management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adjuvant radiotherapy</strong> – Most women require whole breast irradiation to eradicate any tumor deposits remaining following breast BCS. Doing so reduces risk of locoregional recurrence and improves breast-cancer-specific and overall survival. There are exceptions (eg, older women with estrogen-receptor-positive tumor), which are discussed in another topic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/739.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comparison with mastectomy</strong> – Earlier randomized trials established that BCT and mastectomy have equivalent survival outcomes. Later observational studies suggested that BCT may have a slight survival advantage over mastectomy, but those studies are observational and may have inherent selection bias. Thus, it is now widely accepted that BCT is "at least" equal to mastectomy in terms of survival outcomes. (See <a class="local">'Survival'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While earlier trials reported a higher local recurrence rate after BCT than after mastectomy, it did not translate into worse survival. Since then, refinement in BCT techniques has reduced local recurrence rate to just 2 percent at 10 years, comparable to that of mastectomy. (See <a class="local">'Local recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cosmesis</strong> – Another major goal of BCT is the preservation of a cosmetically acceptable breast. Surgery and radiation can both influence cosmetic outcomes. Attention to surgical techniques, oncoplastic techniques, and breast reconstruction can all contribute to optimal cosmesis after BCT.
