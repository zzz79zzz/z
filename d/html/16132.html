         Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous disorder involving immune dysfunction of B and T cells and dendritic cells. The characteristic immunologic defect is the inability of B cells to differentiate into plasma cells capable of secreting all immunoglobulin types.

         Clinical features of CVID and issues in the diagnosis and management of this disorder that are specific to pediatric patients (less than 18 years of age) will be reviewed here. Additional reviews of CVID, which emphasize adult manifestations and management, are found separately:

         CVID is one of the more common antibody deficiency disorders. In one large series of primary immunodeficiency (PID) in children diagnosed over a 10-year period, CVID made up 17 of 189 total PID cases and 20 percent of the 87 cases of antibody deficiency [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients with CVID present after puberty, and the disorder is usually diagnosed in the second or third decade of life. However, about 25 percent of all CVID patients present in childhood or adolescence, and there is an earlier peak of diagnosis at approximately eight years of age [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. A diagnosis of CVID before six years of age should be considered preliminary because of immunologic immaturity and the persistence of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy in some children. In addition, the possible presence of a monogenic defect that causes a CVID-like disorder should be considered in children who present at a very young age. (See
         <a class="local">

         Patients with CVID most commonly present with recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections. However, they are also at increased risk for other disorders of immune dysregulation and may present with a dominant autoimmune (cytopenias, thyroid disorders), gastrointestinal, allergic, or malignant disease. Children with these less common presentations may be cared for in hematology, rheumatology, gastroenterology, or endocrine clinics for a period of years before the underlying diagnosis of CVID is appreciated.

         The types of disorders that develop in patients with CVID are similar in adults and children, although there are some differences in the prevalence of certain manifestations of the disease. In all age groups, sinopulmonary infections and complications of infections are the most common presentation. However, children have more problems with ear infections and certain disorders, such as autoimmune cytopenias and allergic disease, compared with adults with CVID. In addition, children may present with failure-to-thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several series support these conclusions [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,7-9

         ]. The two largest are presented here:

         A series of 457 patients used the United States Immunodeficiency Network data to compare patients diagnosed with CVID before age 18 with those with adult-onset CVID [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Pediatric-onset CVID patients more often had recurrent otitis media, developmental delay, and failure-to-thrive compared with adult-onset CVID patients. Asthma or reactive airway disease was reported more in early-onset and adolescent CVID groups compared with adult-onset CVID patients (46 versus 34 percent). Adult CVID patients were more frequently diagnosed with bronchitis, arthritis, depression, and fatigue.

         A 30-year review of 198 cases of CVID, both pediatric- and adult-onset, also found that infectious complications between groups were similar, with sinopulmonary infections and chickenpox/shingles being the most common [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Otitis media and autoimmune hematologic disease were more frequent in the 91 pediatric-onset CVID cases as compared to adult-onset. A common comorbidity of each group was lymphoproliferative/granulomatous disease (44 percent of pediatric-onset and 35 percent adult-onset CVID). Malignancy was present in 11 percent of the pediatric-onset cohort, compared with 22 percent of the adult-onset population.

         Pediatric patients with CVID often experience recurrent pyogenic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts and chronic gastrointestinal infections with the same spectrum of organisms seen in adult patients  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89794" href="/z/d/graphic/89794.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The most common presentation for the pediatric patient with CVID is recurrent otitis media, which is more common than in adults, chronic and persistent sinusitis, chronic cough, and recurrent bacterial pneumonias [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,7-9
         </a>
         ]. Older children will often have bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening, presumedly from recurrent infections.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the above-mentioned study, which included 91 pediatric-onset CVID patients, a delay in diagnosis of CVID in children was associated with an increased risk of virulent organisms such as methicillin-resistant
         <em>
          Staphylococcus aureus
         </em>
         , vancomycin-resistant
         <em>

         , and
         <em>
          Clostridium difficile

         , which resulted in increased odds of mortality [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Both pediatric-onset and adult-onset CVID patients in this group (6 percent of the cohort) developed sepsis associated with indwelling catheter use, suggesting that the risk/benefits of placement should be weighed carefully. (See

         There are rare reports of chronic enteroviral infections causing neurodegenerative diseases or encephalitis. One case series described 32 children, in which two cases of poliovirus-related vaccine paresis were reported [

         A majority of CVID patients (all ages) develop chronic structural pulmonary complications, including bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 54 children with either CVID or similar disorders, structural lung disease was found in more than 85 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Most children had mild bronchiectasis scores, although 5 percent were scored moderate-to-severe. Twenty-five percent of CVID children had multiple lung nodules, which tended to resolve after treatment with systemic glucocorticoids. However, in the case series of 91 pediatric-onset CVID patients, lymphocytic/granulomatous disease was common and found to be a significant cause of mortality in females, while bronchiectasis contributed to mortality in males [
         <a href="#rid9">

         Children with CVID frequently have obstructive airway disease that is indistinguishable from asthma, and this appears to be a more common manifestation in children compared with adults. Obstructive flow-volume curves have been found in 50 to 94 percent of patients (all ages) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,10
         </a>
         ]. The increased prevalence of obstructive airway disease may be in part due to recurrent viral illnesses associated with childhood.

         The presence of atopic disease (asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis, and urticaria) may be a feature of pediatric-onset CVID as compared to adult-onset disease. In both children and adults, absent immunoglobulin E (IgE) is common, with undetectable allergen-specific IgE in 97 percent [

         Failure-to-thrive (FTT) is an important manifestation of immunodeficiency in children and is usually attributed to repetitive illnesses. However, primary growth hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism have also been reported in hypogammaglobulinemic children [

         Autoimmune cytopenias are a more common presenting disorder in children than adults and may be the initial manifestation of the disease. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and hemolytic anemia, or combinations of these disorders, were present in 33 percent of pediatric-onset CVID patients with evidence of autoimmunity in one large series [

         Evans syndrome is characterized by the combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and ITP and has been associated with immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferation. A pediatric series of seven children with Evans syndrome found Fas expression on peripheral blood T and B cells and Fas-mediated elimination of activated T cells to be elevated compared with control children with acute ITP or other nonimmune disorders [

          21

Among the seven with Evans syndrome, five eventually developed CVID, indicating that elevated Fas expression and Fas-mediated apoptosis may be associated with the development of CVID in these patients. In another series of Evans syndrome patients, 3 of 35 pediatric patients were found to have CVID, and these authors suggested that immunodeficiency screening in this population may be recommended [

         Many children with CVID are small and appear chronically ill. They may show signs of chronic upper or lower respiratory infections including otitis, purulent nasal discharge, or visible postnasal drainage. Tonsils and lymphoid tissue are usually present and are sometimes enlarged. Skin infections or eczema may be noted. Pulmonary findings of rales, wheezing, and digital clubbing may be present. Hepatosplenomegaly suggests gastrointestinal or autoimmune problems. Signs of arthritis, vasculitis, or vitiligo may be present.

         The diagnosis of CVID requires decreased immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels, in association with low levels of IgA and/or IgM. When assessing pediatric patients for hypogammaglobulinemia, it is important to use age-related normal values  (

         A normal IgG level for children 6 to 16 years old is about 1000 mg/dL with a 1 standard deviation range of 250, whereas children with CVID will typically have IgG levels below 500 mg/dL.

         If the patient's history and physical examination raise concern about a possible diagnosis of CVID, immunoglobulin levels should be evaluated initially.

         It is difficult to diagnose CVID in children younger than six years of age, because CVID may not be distinguishable from transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI) in this age group. Both disorders involve hypogammaglobulinemia, but patients with THI ultimately produce adequate specific antibodies (in response to vaccines and infections), while those with CVID cannot. However, normal children below the age of two years and sometimes older children have impaired responses to polysaccharide antigens, and so this distinction can be challenging to make. Because of these uncertainties, it is important to follow the patient regularly and make the diagnosis as expediently as possible, because prolonged delays between the onset of symptoms and the beginning of

Approximately one-half (49 percent) of these children spontaneously corrected their immunoglobulin abnormalities. Among the remaining children, just two were eventually diagnosed with CVID.

         Children under six years of age with hypogammaglobulinemia, who are suspected to have CVID, should be periodically reevaluated to determine if their immune status has improved. We suggest repeating immunoglobulin levels and specific antibody titers on average one year after initial evaluation. If these patients have been started on

         replacement therapy, the treatments must be withheld for four months prior to reevaluation, after which the patient's immunoglobulin G (IgG) should be compared with the trough level just before the final immune globulin treatment, in order to appreciate the patient's current level of antibody deficiency. Also at this time, specific antibody titers to various vaccines can be drawn, immunization with killed vaccines given (eg, pneumococcal vaccine,
         <em>
          H. influenzae

         Congenital agammaglobulinemia is distinguished clinically from CVID by onset in infancy, hypoplastic lymphoid tissue, and severe reduction in all serum immunoglobulin isotypes. In addition, B cells in the peripheral blood (quantitated by flow cytometric evaluation of CD19 expression on lymphocytes) are nearly absent (&lt;2 percent) or completely absent. In contrast, B cells in patients with CVID are usually normal or only mildly reduced. However, rare patients with CVID can have ≤1 percent B cells. In this situation, the patient should be assessed for causes of primary agammaglobulinemia. While X-linked agammaglobulinemia due to

         X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) is a rare disorder of immune dysregulation, resulting in lymphoproliferation, liver failure, hypogammaglobulinemia, and/or lymphoma. The clinical and immunologic abnormalities are triggered after Epstein-Barr virus infection. Testing for XLP is appropriate in boys with a history of preceding viral hepatitis or other features suggestive of this disorder, as well as a family history of early death in males in the family.

         replacement therapy, in subcutaneous (SCIG) or intravenous (IVIG) form, has significantly decreased the frequency of life-threatening infections in pediatric patients with CVID.

         Children generally have a higher rate of viral infections than adults, due to increased exposure and other factors, which complicates the management of febrile episodes in children with CVID. Children with CVID and fever should be evaluated promptly. Attempts to identify responsible organisms should be undertaken, such as rapid viral identification kits for influenza or respiratory syncytial virus. IgG-based diagnostic tests will not be useful in those children receiving

         Monitoring the child for progressive but subclinical pulmonary damage is important, since patients can develop chronic pulmonary disease. Such monitoring usually takes the form of serial pulmonary function tests.

        <p>
         High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been found to be the most sensitive method for identification of bronchiectasis and lymphocytic/granulomatous disease. It is an important diagnostic tool for pulmonary complications because it can detect abnormalities that are missed by chest radiographs or pulmonary function testing. HRCT is also important in determining future therapy, and patients should be screened if respiratory symptoms are present or after the CVID diagnosis is confirmed. In pediatric-onset CVID, there is an increased risk of mortality in patients with lung disease as defined by any persistent changes in HRCT or lung function testing [

         Treatment of autoimmune cytopenias in patients with primary immunodeficiencies is difficult, because the treatments result in further immunosuppression in an already-compromised patient. Immunosuppressant medication should be used only when the benefits are clear and in those patients whose autoimmune disorders are clearly causing symptomatic disease. The lowest dose and the shortest course sufficient to treat the condition are recommended. Careful monitoring during treatment is required. The treatment of these conditions in patients without CVID, including glucocorticoid dosing, is reviewed separately. (See

         Those children with ongoing sinopulmonary symptoms despite adequate treatment may benefit from allergy testing, as children with an allergy diathesis coincident to CVID have been described. In patients who are found to have IgE present at the time of CVID diagnosis, either allergy skin testing or serum evaluation of IgE to specific aeroallergens may be helpful in discerning the presence of ongoing atopy that may be complicating control of sinopulmonary disease. In these children, we have observed that aggressive asthma or allergy-specific treatment appears to improve outcomes and quality of life by reducing the frequency of complications, such as recurrent otitis media and sinopulmonary infections, although definitive studies have not been performed. It is the authors' impression that pediatric CVID patients follow the same general course as immunocompetent children with atopy and experience fewer complications, such as recurrent otitis media and rhinosinusitis, if allergy is addressed and managed.

         ]. These concerns include depression, anxiety, somatization, social withdrawal, and decreased social skills. Increasing severity of the immunodeficiency was associated with a number of school adjustment issues, including concomitant psychiatric diagnoses and requiring special education services. In a series of pediatric-onset CVID patients, 18 percent of children had depression as a comorbidity and this was associated with mortality, particularly in patients with a delayed diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         Some proactive education about immunodeficiency can be tremendously helpful in ensuring that school staff fully engage with the child and participate in his/her daily care. Many people (including nurses and other staff) equate immunodeficiency with HIV infection, and it is useful to explain that CVID is not a transmittable disease. Age-appropriate education of other children can also prevent alienation and/or bullying. Parents/caregivers often take the lead in these matters, although the clinician should initiate the discussion and help the caregivers choose the information to be shared.

         replacement therapy became standard of care. However, pediatric-onset CVID with pulmonary complications has a higher mortality rate as compared to adult-onset CVID patients, as noted in the above-mentioned review [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In that series, the average age of death was 31 years for the 91 patients diagnosed with CVID prior to 19 years of age. The most common cause of mortality was infection, although these patients had multiple comorbidities as outlined previously. Those children diagnosed after irreversible pulmonary disease has developed may have a shorter lifespan, based on findings in adults with CVID in both the case series mentioned above and adult studies of CVID. In addition, the authors found that pediatric mortality correlated with a delay in diagnosis of CVID. The prognosis of CVID in all age groups considered together is reviewed separately. (See

         Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by the inability of B cells to differentiate into plasma cells capable of secreting all immunoglobulin types. Approximately 25 percent of all CVID patients present in childhood, with a peak in diagnosis around eight years of age. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definition and classification'
         </a>

         In all age groups, sinopulmonary infections and complications of infections are the most common presentation. However, children have more problems with ear infections and certain disorders, such as autoimmune cytopenias and allergic disease, compared with adults with CVID. In addition, children may present with failure-to-thrive. (See
         <a class="local">

         The diagnosis of CVID is based on the findings of hypogammaglobulinemia, defective antibody formation (ie, vaccine response), and exclusion of other causes of antibody deficiency. Diagnosis in children younger than six years of age is difficult, because there are several causes of hypogammaglobulinemia that must be excluded and because response to polysaccharide antigens is normally weak in young children. Definitive diagnosis may not be possible until the child has undergone serial evaluations over a period of years. (See

         The management of CVID is similar in adults and children. Important aspects include

         </a>
         replacement therapy, avoidance of infection, monitoring of pulmonary status, and vigilance for known associated disorders, such as cytopenias and malignancy. Issues that are of special importance in children include monitoring of physical and emotional development, early intervention for psychosocial and educational problems, and attention to cumulative radiation exposure resulting from radiologic studies.

         replacement therapy became standard of care. However, it has been demonstrated that those with pediatric-onset disease may be at increased risk for mortality as compared to adult-onset CVID. At-risk children are those who develop pulmonary manifestations, and initiation of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy may be needed to prevent a poorer prognosis. (See
