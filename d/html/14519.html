This topic will review the approach to providing routine care and anticipatory guidance for children with SCD. It is intended for use both by SCD specialists and by primary care providers who are participating in the comprehensive care of children with SCD.</p><p>The guidance in this topic represents a synthesis of the standards promoted by various professional societies including the American Society of Hematology; American College of Emergency Physicians; American Academy of Pediatrics; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [<a href="#rid1">1-10</a>].

This offers the unparalleled opportunity to identify <strong>all</strong> children with SCD in the newborn period. Newborn screening for SCD is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7113.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders", section on 'Newborn screening'</a>.)</p><p>Infants with SCD identified through newborn screening should be promptly referred for consultation with clinicians experienced in the care of children with SCD. Depending upon local resources, the SCD clinician may be a pediatric hematologist (often within a specialized SCD center or program) or a knowledgeable general pediatric provider.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H102244215"><span class="h1">INITIAL VISIT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H112753078"><span class="h2">Timing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The timing of the first visit with an experienced SCD clinician depends upon the hemoglobin (Hb) pattern on the newborn screen. For those with an FS pattern  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116210" href="/d/graphic/116210.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), suggesting Hb SS or Hb S-β<sup>0</sup> thalassemia, the infant should be seen by the SCD expert by six to eight weeks. It is important to begin prophylactic penicillin early in these patients since splenic function begins to decline by the age of two to three months. For infants with other newborn screen patterns who generally do not display early clinical symptoms, the first SCD clinical visit may be delayed until 12 to 16 weeks of age, depending on local resources. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7113.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders", section on 'Hemoglobin patterns'</a>.)</p><p>The first visit is critical to confirm the diagnosis, introduce anticipatory guidance, start penicillin prophylaxis, review and update vaccinations, alleviate parental/caregiver concerns, dispel misconceptions, and discuss implications for the parental genotypes (for their own health care and for future children). Typically, the first visit is with a hematologist; however, in settings with limited access to specialty care, it may be with a pediatrician who is well informed and experienced in caring for children with SCD.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H112753085"><span class="h2">Laboratory testing</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Confirmation of exact diagnosis</strong> – The confirmation of an exact diagnosis will depend on the testing provided by the newborn screening program. At least two separate blood tests, including the immediate newborn sample, should be used to confirm the initial findings. Confirmatory testing may be provided by subsequent Hb analysis using a different technique than the one used for newborn screening. Examples of methods used in newborn screening include electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and DNA-based tests. These tests confirm the identity of the variant Hb(s) present and thus the specific type of SCD. The approach is described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7113.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complete blood count and reticulocyte count</strong> – A complete blood count with reticulocyte count should be performed at the first visit and at each subsequent visit to establish baseline values for the individual patient.

Therefore, some clinicians and caregivers prefer to use <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12689" href="/d/drug information/12689.html" rel="external">penicillin V</a> potassium 250 mg tablets (one-half a tablet in children &lt;3 years), which can be crushed and mixed in a small amount of formula or water. However, there are few published data to support this practice [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13276" href="/d/drug information/13276.html" rel="external">Erythromycin</a> is the alternative for penicillin-allergic patients.</p><p>The evidence supporting the efficacy of prophylactic penicillin in children with SCD is discussed in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease", section on 'Prophylactic penicillin'</a>.) </p><p>Children with other sickle cell syndromes such as Hb SC disease and Hb S-β<sup>+</sup> thalassemia are not routinely prescribed prophylactic penicillin, due to the lower incidence and/or later onset of functional asplenia. This issue is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease", section on 'Hb SC disease and sickle cell-beta thalassemia'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to prophylactic penicillin, caregivers should understand the fever management plan and should be counselled about the importance of following the recommended immunization schedule for immunocompromised children, as discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Fever plan'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1412.html" rel="external">"Prevention of infection in patients with impaired splenic function", section on 'Vaccinations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H50960975"><span class="h3">Folic acid</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13322" href="/d/drug information/13322.html" rel="external">Folic acid</a> (400 micrograms to 1 mg daily) is often given to children with Hb SS and Hb S-β<sup>0</sup> thalassemia (and other hemolytic anemias). However, clinicians may reasonably omit folic acid for patients in resource-abundant settings who have sufficient dietary intake, especially in settings where grains and cereals are routinely supplemented. Formula-fed infants in particular receive adequate folic acid in their diet. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7153.html" rel="external">"Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies", section on 'Inadequate dietary intake'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45340507"><span class="h3">Hydroxyurea and other disease-modifying therapies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13367" href="/d/drug information/13367.html" rel="external">Hydroxyurea</a> is the principal disease-modifying therapy for SCD.

Its efficacy in other SCD variants (eg, Hb SC and Hb S-β<sup>+</sup> thalassemia) is less certain, but it may offer the same benefits.</p><p>We introduce the concept of starting <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13367" href="/d/drug information/13367.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> during each visit in infancy, including written materials to ensure that families are well informed about the benefits and risks of this therapy.

This is a cornerstone of effective medical care and is discussed in detail in the sections below. (See <a class="local">'Anticipatory guidance'</a> below.)</p><p>Most aspects of anticipatory guidance should be introduced at the initial visit and then reviewed during each follow-up visit to reinforce the information and ensure understanding. Two issues that are particularly important at the initial visit are instructions for managing fevers and for regularly palpating the spleen. This is because febrile illnesses and splenic sequestration are problems that tend to arise in early infancy.

The chance of having another child with SCD depends on the genotypes of the parents. If both parents are heterozygous (with sickle cell trait or other beta globin variant), the risk of having another affected child is 25 percent. If either parent is homozygous for a beta globin variant, the risk is 50 percent and, if both are homozygous, all children will be affected. If either parent has a subsequent pregnancy with another partner, the risk of recurrence will depend on that person's hemoglobinopathy status. Each parent should be encouraged to share the information about their status with any future partners to allow for informed decision-making before another child is conceived. This issue is discussed in greater detail separately.

The visit should be dedicated to anticipatory guidance concerning issues specific to SCD and for verification of disease-specific immunization needs.

Children with SCD often have some decrement of growth between 6 and 24 months of age, corresponding to the decline in hemoglobin (Hb) associated with increased beta chain synthesis. However, the subsequent rate of growth should be normal. Growth velocity data are particularly important in assessment of pubertal delays or of short stature and in related treatment decisions [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].

Blood pressure should be assessed during well visits when the child is at rest. Baseline blood pressure in children with SCD is generally lower than age-matched controls, and an increase in blood pressure within the normal range may actually represent hypertension for that individual. Hypertension noted only during painful episodes is most often attributable to pain.

The stakes for health and even survival are high for individuals with SCD, who often experience an increase in the use of health care resources as well as a sharp increase in mortality during the young adult years. Transition is a multidimensional process that must occur in stages that include providing information about the process, assessing readiness, coordinating communication between pediatric and adult providers, completing age-appropriate medical assessments and interventions, preparing a medical summary and an action plan for pain control and prevention, and introducing the adult provider. The general approach and the core elements of health care transition are summarized in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115352" href="/d/graphic/115352.html" rel="external">table 8</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115302" href="/d/graphic/115302.html" rel="external">table 9</a>).

A specific plan should be made for where the family should bring the child with SCD when they develop a fever. Options include the primary care clinician's office, a local emergency department (ED), or a tertiary pediatric hospital ED or clinic. The evaluation includes, at a minimum, a complete blood count, blood culture, and empiric dose of parenteral antibiotic active against <em>Streptococcus</em> <em>pneumoniae</em>. Management of fever in SCD is discussed in greater detail separately.

Caregivers should be taught how to palpate the child's spleen and instructed to check it at least daily and more often if the child is ill. If the spleen feels enlarged, the child should be evaluated by a clinician to confirm the finding and obtain a blood count to assess if transfusion is required.</p><p>In patients with Hb SS or Hb S-β<sup>0</sup> thalassemia, the risk for acute splenic sequestration crisis is highest during infancy and early childhood (up to age three years). Individuals with Hb SC also develop splenomegaly and splenic sequestration, but, typically, this occurs at an older age (school age to adulthood) and usually is not an acute clinical problem, because of the higher baseline Hb in Hb SC disease. Eventually, because of infarction, this process may lead to splenic hypofunction and to functional asplenia, placing the child at risk for overwhelming infection with encapsulated organisms.

(See <a class="local">'Hydroxyurea and other disease-modifying therapies'</a> above.)</p><p>Another option that should be discussed periodically with families in the context of routine visits is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), which is the only curative treatment for SCD. HCT has been available since the 1990s; however, the small but real risks of death and sterility from the procedure have limited its use. Parents or caregivers of children with Hb SS and Hb S-β<sup>0</sup> thalassemia should be advised of this option and consideration given to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of patient and full siblings at any time in childhood.

Depending upon local resources, the experienced SCD clinician may be a pediatric hematologist (often within a specialized SCD program) or a knowledgeable general pediatric provider. Children with SCD can have complications involving many different organ systems, and they often require involvement from multiple subspecialists. It is imperative to appropriately coordinate care when multiple specialists are involved. (See <a class="local">'Multidisciplinary care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial visit</strong> – The timing of the first visit with an experienced SCD clinician depends upon the hemoglobin (Hb) pattern on the newborn screen. Those with Hb SS or Hb S-β<sup>0</sup> thalassemia should be seen by age six to eight weeks to begin prophylactic penicillin. For those with other SCD variants, the first visit can be deferred until age 12 to 16 weeks depending on local resources. The initial visit includes laboratory testing, confirmation of the SCD diagnosis and type, determination of the need for prophylactic penicillin, and anticipatory guidance about common early SCD complications. Caregivers should be taught to evaluate for complications that require urgent treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86907" href="/d/graphic/86907.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Initial visit'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up visits</strong> – The frequency of follow-up visits varies depending upon SCD type, patient needs, other medical conditions, and available medical resources.
