          MECHANISM OF INJURY

         Isolated nail bed injury typically occurs as a result of direct blunt trauma (eg, crush in a door jamb) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. A nail bed injury almost always accompanies a partial or complete fingertip avulsion [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Fingertip avulsions often occur when the finger gets slammed in the door (latch side) or is caught along the edge of the door (hinge side). Most avulsions are partial avulsions of the fingertip, although full amputations are not rare.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fingertip avulsions are also caused by knives, slicers, exercise equipment (eg, treadmills, exercise bicycles), power tools, and lawn mowers. In contrast to adults, complete or partial avulsions heal extremely well in children, especially before adolescence. In particular, the literature indicates that children younger than two years of age are very likely to demonstrate complete distal tip regeneration after amputation when managed without repair [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6

         The nail bed is a thin layer of epithelial tissue overlying the cortex of the distal phalanx. The richly vascularized nail bed lies directly beneath the nail plate and provides adherence and support for the nail.

         The germinal matrix is the proximal element of the nail bed responsible for most of the nail formation. The matrix begins 7 to 8 mm under the proximal fold, and its distal end is the white crescent called the lunula.

         The fingertip has a rich blood supply provided by numerous branches of the ulnar and radial elements of the digital arteries. The pulp of the fingertip is composed of fatty and soft tissues with dense sensory innervation provided by the palmar digital nerves. Extension and flexion of the fingertip are provided by the extensor hood and flexor digitorum profundus tendons, respectively. (See

         Proper management of nail bed lacerations and fingertip avulsions requires careful evaluation, including assessment for associated injuries and plain radiographs, prior to definitive care. This assessment should identify conditions that warrant prompt referral to a hand or orthopedic surgeon. (See

          Age and skeletal maturity
         </strong>
         – The need for surgical repair varies for fingertip amputation based upon age. In particular, children &lt;2 years of age often heal well without grafting of large soft tissue defects or replantation of distal fingertip amputations that contain pulp and bone. (See

          Digit position during injury (flexed versus extended)

          Dominant hand
         </strong>
         – Although the goal for all fingertip injuries is restoration of a sensate fingertip with a smooth and intact nail and normal range of motion, the clinician and patient may opt for a more complex procedure (eg, replantation) for the chance to maintain full or close to full function of a fingertip on the dominant hand, even if the likelihood for success is low.

         The clinician should determine the extent of damage to the fingertip with attention to injury to the nail, nail folds, nail bed, and germinal matrix and evaluate for associated proximal injuries to the finger or hand by testing neurovascular status and range of motion.

          Fingertip perfusion
         </strong>
         – Vascular compromise is suggested by the presence of distal pallor. The vascular status of fingers is also evaluated using capillary refill time. Although standard values for capillary refill time increase with age and certain disease states (eg, diabetes), normal capillary refill is generally less than two seconds [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         <strong>
          Fingertip sensation
         </strong>
         – Fingertip sensation testing should occur before a digital block is performed. Two-point discrimination is the most sensitive test for sensation in the fingers. Two-point discrimination of 4 to 5 mm is normal for most patients, with an upper limit of normal of 8 to 9 mm in older adult patients.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In cooperative patients, a caliper can be fashioned from a paper clip with the points held at about 10 mm. The patient is asked to close their eyes, and the paper clip points are placed against the skin along the long axis of the finger and away from the wound. The touch should be relatively light so as to minimize the stimulation of pressure receptors. It is important to assess sensation on both the radial and ulnar aspects of the finger as well as the dorsal and palmar sides. The points of the paper clip are gradually brought closer together.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In cooperative younger children, it may only be possible to test light touch. A cotton-tipped swab touched lightly on all aspects of the finger may suffice for this examination.

         In very young or uncooperative children, the clinician may not be able to discern the presence or absence of nerve injury. Indirect evidence of intact sensory innervation is obtained by placing the finger in a bowl of warm water for five minutes. Intact innervation is indicated by wrinkling of the skin of the distal finger, whereas nerve injury results in persistence of smooth skin or less wrinkling compared with uninjured fingers [

          Closed nail bed injuries
         </strong>
         – Nail bed lacerations do not require nail removal and repair when the nail is sufficiently intact within the nail folds (ie, nail continues to splint and approximate any nail bed or nail fold laceration) and a distal phalanx fracture, if present, is not significantly displaced. If a painful subungual hematoma is present, then trephination should be performed. (See

         In a retrospective study of 78 adults with fingertip injuries resulting in a subungual hematoma that was either greater than 50 percent or associated with a nondisplaced distal phalanx fracture (without frank nail disruption or nail fold laceration), conservative management (ie, trephination as needed, splinting) was associated with reduction in nail deformity compared with nail bed laceration repair, although the result was not statistically significant (5/13 [13 percent] versus 9/40 [23 percent], RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-1.25) [

          Open nail bed injuries and partial fingertip avulsions

         Controversy exists regarding replacing the nail or splint following nail bed suturing, which has traditionally been recommended since it may maintain the proximal nail fold during healing, prevent synechiae (nail bed scar that can cause nail deformity), reduce infection, and decrease pain during dressing changes. We replace the nail or splint if there is an associated proximal nail fold injury or comminuted, displaced tuft fracture. In one study of 586 patients with repaired nail bed injuries, worse cosmetic results were associated with nail fold injuries, crushing, avulsion, or fractures [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. A trial of 451 children undergoing nail bed repair (79 percent with crush injuries) compared replacing the nail with simply applying a low-adherent dressing (without splinting open the nail fold); 32 patients (7 percent) had a pulp laceration and/or distal phalanx tuft fracture, and 6 patients (1 percent) had a germinal matrix injury (patients with fracture requiring fixation or nail bed laceration requiring reconstruction were excluded) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. There was no difference in cosmetic appearance of the nail (final follow-up occurred between 4 and 12 months after the injury) or infection rate at 7 to 10 days. Patients who had the nail replaced had a higher infection rate at the four-month follow-up visit (3.5 versus 0.9 percent), but fewer experienced pain during dressing changes (41 versus 48 percent), although these did not reach statistical significance.

         Patients with fingertip injuries are usually anxious and in pain. The patient and, for children, the caretaker should receive an explanation of the injury and the procedural approach. In patients with significant nail bed lacerations and suspected damage to the area near the germinal matrix, the patient and family/caregivers should be advised that a deformed or absent nail may occur on the finger despite appropriate treatment.

         Tissue adhesives –The nail bed may be repaired using a skin glue such as 2-octylcyanoacrylate (eg, Dermabond). As an example, in a study of 40 consecutive patients with acute nail bed lacerations, there was no statistical difference in physician-judged or patient-perceived cosmetic outcome, pain, or functional ability between repairs performed using skin glue versus 6-0 chromic suture. In addition, the average time for repair was clinically significantly shorter for the skin glue group (10 versus 28 minutes) [

          29

Place two to three drops of tissue glue in the areas of the nail folds and allow the stream of adhesive to seal the nail to the skin.

         Partial fingertip avulsions arise when the distal finger is crushed between two objects. The distal phalanx often sustains a fracture and the nail bed, nail, and pulp are disrupted but still partially attached to the proximal finger by a skin bridge. Partial fingertip avulsions may survive, provided some distal perfusion is preserved, especially in children younger than two years of age. At worst, the tip acts as a graft that may revascularize or act as a biologic dressing in older children, adolescents, and healthy adults.

         In adults with increased infectious risk due to comorbidities (eg, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, advanced age), removal of the avulsed fingertip and treatment as for complete fingertip amputation may be advisable. (See

          Mechanism of injury
         </strong>
         – Fingertip avulsions often occur in the setting of door closure upon the finger. A nail bed injury almost always accompanies a full or partial fingertip avulsion. Fingertip avulsions are also caused by knives, slicers, exercise equipment (eg, treadmills, exercise bicycles), power tools, and lawn mowers. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mechanism of injury'

         <strong>
          Closed nail bed injury
         </strong>
         – Small nail bed lacerations do not require nail removal and repair when the nail is sufficiently intact within the nail folds (ie, nail continues to splint and approximate any nail bed or nail fold laceration) and a distal phalanx fracture, if present, is not significantly displaced. If a painful subungual hematoma is present in such patients, trephination is appropriate, as discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6335.html" rel="external">
          "Subungual hematoma", section on 'Procedure'

         <strong>
          Open nail bed injury
         </strong>
         – With an open nail bed injury, the nail plate is displaced from the nail bed and accompanied by a nail bed laceration; a distal phalanx fracture is also frequently present. These injuries require primary repair, provided that they are uninfected and &lt;24 hours old. The nail must be removed completely for adequate examination and repair. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Isolated open nail bed injury'

         <strong>
          Partial fingertip avulsion
         </strong>
         – Partial fingertip avulsions arise when the distal finger is crushed between two objects. The distal phalanx often sustains a fracture and the nail bed, nail, and soft tissue are disrupted but still partially attached to the proximal finger by a skin bridge. Repair includes nail removal, securing of the partially avulsed fingertip in anatomic position, and open nail bed repair. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Partial fingertip avulsion'

         <strong>
          Pulp only
         </strong>
         – The approach to amputations of the fingertip pulp only depends on the size of the soft tissue defect, the status of the amputated pulp, and the age of the patient as discussed above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Finger pulp only'

         <strong>
          Pulp and nail and/or bone
         </strong>
         – Because of the potential need for grafting, flap repair, or replantation, most patients over two years of age with fingertip amputations involving more than the pulp require emergency consultation with a hand surgeon or other surgeon with similar expertise to determine the potential for replantation and to perform definitive surgical repair.
