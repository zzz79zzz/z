The discussion will include pertinent features of the history and physical examination and an algorithmic approach to common and life threatening conditions. The approach and treatment of children with infectious pharyngitis are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5971.html" rel="external">"Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2875.html" rel="external">"Acute pharyngitis in children and adolescents: Symptomatic treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8049.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of streptococcal pharyngitis in adults and children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2528594141"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sore throat refers to any painful sensation localized to the pharynx or surrounding anatomy. The developmental ability of young children to identify and define their symptoms varies and the physician must pay careful attention to the patient and the caretaker in order to clarify the exact nature of the complaint.</p><p>Sore throat can be the symptom of a disease process that does not directly affect the pharynx. Occasionally, young patients with dysphagia that results from disease in the area of the esophagus or with difficulty swallowing because of a neuromuscular disorder may verbalize these sensations as a sore throat or their symptoms may be interpreted by a caretaker as a sore throat.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The etiology of sore throat varies by age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60174" href="/d/graphic/60174.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and can further be divided by conditions that are life-threatening, common, or less common. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Life-threatening conditions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Epiglottitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of epiglottitis, a well-appreciated cause of life-threatening upper airway infection, has declined significantly since the introduction of vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b. This disease manifests with a toxic appearance, high fever, stridor, and drooling. Sore throat occurs in many cases, but is only rarely the primary complaint. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6080.html" rel="external">"Epiglottitis (supraglottitis): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Retropharyngeal abscess</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Retropharyngeal abscesses can cause sore throat and usually occur in children less than four years of age. Other complaints include neck pain and fever. There may be difficulty swallowing and respiratory distress. The posterior location of the abscess makes it difficult to visualize on physical examination. Imaging is often required to confirm the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6078.html" rel="external">"Retropharyngeal infections in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Lateral pharyngeal abscesses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lateral pharyngeal abscesses produce symptoms similar to retropharyngeal infections but occur less often. High fever is common. Other signs include trismus and swelling below the mandible. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Peritonsillar abscess</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A peritonsillar abscess may complicate a previously diagnosed infectious pharyngitis or may be the initial source of a child's discomfort. This disease is most common in older children and adolescents. The diagnosis is evident from visual inspection, augmented occasionally by careful palpation. The abscess produces a bulge in the posterior aspect of the soft palate, deviates the uvula to the contralateral side of the pharynx, and has a fluctuant quality on palpation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6078.html" rel="external">"Retropharyngeal infections in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Infectious mononucleosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infectious mononucleosis can rarely cause airway obstruction from severe tonsillar hypertrophy.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8051.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathophysiology of diphtheria"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Lemierre syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This unusual infection is caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] or mixed anaerobic flora and is associated with jugular venous thrombophlebitis and the dissemination of infection by septic emboli. Both children and adults with Lemierre’s syndrome almost always have pharyngitis at presentation [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. It should be considered in the ill-appearing patient with neck pain, severe pharyngitis, and respiratory distress [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129255.html" rel="external">"Lemierre syndrome: Septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Common conditions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Viral pharyngitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infection is the most common cause of sore throat and the etiologic agents are usually respiratory viruses, of which a few cause a readily identifiable syndrome including  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60174" href="/d/graphic/60174.html" rel="external">table 1</a>): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adenoviruses – Pharyngoconjunctival fever, a benign follicular conjunctivitis often accompanied by a febrile pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8339.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection", section on 'Eyes'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coxsackie A viruses – Herpangina or hand, foot, and mouth disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53423" href="/d/graphic/53423.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58566" href="/d/graphic/58566.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71314" href="/d/graphic/71314.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>) (common in infants and young children; decreases in frequency as age increases) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96219.html" rel="external">"Hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Herpes simplex virus usually causes stomatitis (discussed below).

Fever and cough are other common symptoms that often accompany a sore throat. Fatigue, nasal congestion, diarrhea, and vomiting have also been described but occur less frequently. Although COVID-19 is rarely life threatening in children, it may occasionally be so. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127488.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in children", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2524053632"><span class="h3">Candidal infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Oropharyngeal candidal infections (thrush)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75887" href="/d/graphic/75887.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) can cause significant pain and, outside of early infancy, are a marker for immunosuppression (eg, after chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer or immunodeficiency [eg, human immunodeficiency virus]).

In the winter months during streptococcal outbreaks, as many as 30 percent of episodes of pharyngitis may be caused by S. pyogenes in school age children. Clinical manifestations include high fever, exudative tonsillopharyngitis, palatal petechiae, and swollen, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5971.html" rel="external">"Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Infectious mononucleosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The only other common infectious agent in pharyngitis is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes infectious mononucleosis and affects adolescents most frequently. Rarely, infectious mononucleosis can cause life threatening airway obstruction from tonsillar hypertrophy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8283.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection"</a>.)</p><p>An additional consideration in adolescents with an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

This condition occurs most commonly during the winter months, particularly after a night's sleep in a house with forced hot-air heating.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Foreign body</strong> – Occasionally, a foreign object such as a fish bone may become embedded in the pharynx. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6382.html" rel="external">"Airway foreign bodies in children", section on 'Presentation'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Herpetic stomatitis</strong> – Stomatitis caused by herpes simplex usually is confined to the anterior buccal mucosa but may extend to the tonsillar pillars. In these more extensive cases, the child may complain of a sore throat. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8334.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection", section on 'Primary infection'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Systemic inflammatory conditions</strong> – Examples include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Kawasaki disease is classically characterized by high fever along with at least four of the five following findings [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]: conjunctivitis, mucositis, peripheral erythema and/or edema, truncal rash, cervical adenopathy. Kawasaki disease is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6417.html" rel="external">"Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a disease of unknown etiology, but presumed to be immune mediated, which is characterized by vesicular and ulcerative lesions of the mucosa, including the pharynx, genitalia, and conjunctivae. Additionally, children with this condition may have a diffuse rash, often consisting of target lesions or vesicles and bullae. Usually self-limited, occasional cases may lead to dehydration or progress to involve the pulmonary system. Rarely, Stevens-Johnson syndrome may be fatal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2091.html" rel="external">"Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Behçet syndrome is a more chronic systemic inflammatory disease that may involve the oral cavity.

Episodes occur primarily in school age children approximately every four weeks. Mean duration of illness ranges from four to eight years. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5953.html" rel="external">"Periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA syndrome)", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5953.html" rel="external">"Periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA syndrome)", section on 'Natural history'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chemical exposure</strong> – Certain ingestions, such as paraquat and various alkalis, may cause a chemical injury to the mucosa of the pharynx. Usually these findings occur in the setting of a known ingestion and are accompanied by lesions of the oral mucosa.

Examples include dental abscesses, cervical adenitis, and otitis media. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3417.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of odontogenic infections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6009.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5982.html" rel="external">"Cervical lymphadenitis in children: Etiology and clinical manifestations", section on 'Infectious causes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychogenic pharyngitis</strong> – Some children who complain of a sore throat have no organic explanation for their complaint identified after a thorough history and physical examination and a throat culture. In these cases, the physician should consider the possibility of anxiety, at times associated with frequent or difficult (globus hystericus) swallowing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2240.html" rel="external">"Globus sensation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immunosuppressed host</strong> – Immunosuppressed hosts may develop pharyngitis from any of the previously discussed causes. In addition, these patients exhibit a particular susceptibility to infections with fungal organisms, such as Candida albicans. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5972.html" rel="external">"Candida infections in children", section on 'Oropharyngeal candidiasis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h1">HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Key historical variables that may assist in the diagnosis of a specific cause of sore throat include respiratory distress, fever, fatigue, and the rapidity of the onset of symptoms.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sore throat and respiratory distress</strong> – The combination of sore throat and respiratory distress suggests conditions in or near the pharynx that are producing an obstruction, including epiglottitis, retropharyngeal or lateral pharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, massive tonsillar hypertrophy secondary to infectious mononucleosis, and, rarely, diphtheria. In addition, patients with COVID-19 may display fever and respiratory distress due to a pneumonia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127488.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – Fever points to one of the many infectious causes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60174" href="/d/graphic/60174.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) but may also occur with inflammatory conditions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fatigue</strong> – Fatigue, particularly when prolonged, characterizes infectious mononucleosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abrupt onset</strong> – Among the diseases causing pharyngitis, epiglottitis has a particularly abrupt onset, in a matter of hours, while infectious mononucleosis manifests over a period of days or weeks.</p><p></p><p>Other factors in the history that may be important in selected cases include immunocompromising conditions, immunizations, travel, sexual activity, exposure to an individual with known COVID-19 infection, and frequent recurrences.

Before settling on infectious pharyngitis, however, the clinician should first at least briefly consider several more serious disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72946" href="/d/graphic/72946.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h2">Acutely ill patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conditions that have immediate life-threatening potential include epiglottitis, retropharyngeal and lateral pharyngeal abscesses, peritonsillar abscess, severe tonsillar hypertrophy (usually as an exaggerated manifestation of infectious mononucleosis), diphtheria, and Lemierre's syndrome. COVID-19 should also be considered in acutely ill children presenting with sore throat, but severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rarely causes serious illness in the pediatric age group and would be unlikely to present predominantly with a complaint of sore throat. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127488.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in children", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Generally, stridor and signs of respiratory distress accompany the complaint of sore throat in epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Drooling occurs commonly in children with these two conditions, particularly with epiglottitis. Patients with epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, or severe infectious tonsillar hypertrophy often experience a change in their voice. In cases of epiglottitis or retropharyngeal abscess that are not clinically obvious, a lateral neck radiograph, obtained under appropriate supervision, may be confirmatory, but CT is often required to diagnose a retropharyngeal abscess. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6080.html" rel="external">"Epiglottitis (supraglottitis): Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Imaging'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6078.html" rel="external">"Retropharyngeal infections in children", section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Peritonsillar abscess and tonsillar hypertrophy are diagnosed by visual examination of the pharynx. Diphtheria, which produces a thick pharyngeal exudate and markedly enlarged cervical lymph nodes, is rarely a consideration except in unimmunized children, particularly those from underdeveloped nations.</p><p>Lemierre syndrome is rare but potentially fatal, and is characterized by septic thrombophlebitis, often caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. Most common in adolescents and young adults, the patient appears toxic, has high fever, neck pain, often has asymmetrically enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes, and may be hypotensive. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129255.html" rel="external">"Lemierre syndrome: Septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein"</a>.)</p><p>The next phase of the evaluation of the child with a complaint of sore throat hinges on a careful physical examination, particularly of the pharynx. The appearance of vesicles on the buccal mucosa anterior to the tonsillar pillars points to a herpetic stomatitis or noninfectious syndromes, such as Behçet or Stevens-Johnson syndrome (erythema multiforme), and generalized inflammation of the oral mucosa in a persistently febrile child suggests Kawasaki disease.</p><p>Uncommonly, a small, pointed foreign body, perhaps a fish bone, becomes lodged in the mucosal folds of the tonsils or pharynx; usually, the history suggests the diagnosis, but an unanticipated sighting may occur in the younger child. Significant asymmetry of the tonsils indicates a peritonsillar cellulitis or, if extensive, an abscess. Clinically, the diagnosis of an abscess is reserved for the tonsil that protrudes beyond the midline, causing the uvula to deviate to the uninvolved side.</p><p>A pharynx that is not inflamed suggests a source of referred pain or irritative pharyngitis. Sources of referred pain (otitis media, dental abscess, and cervical adenitis) usually are identified during the examination. Irritative pharyngitis, seen most commonly during the winter among older children who live in homes with forced hot-air heating, produces minimal or no pharyngeal inflammation. It often is transient, appearing on arising and resolving by midday.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h2">Suspected infectious pharyngitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who do not have one of the life threatening conditions discussed above and do not have another easily identifiable cause of sore throat (eg, foreign body) are likely to have infectious pharyngitis.</p><p>Infectious pharyngitis evokes a spectrum of inflammatory responses that range from minimal injection of the mucosa to beefy erythema with exudation and edema formation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64820" href="/d/graphic/64820.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). The three relatively common causes are streptococci, respiratory viruses, and infectious mononucleosis.

Such patients require no further testing and only symptomatic therapy. </p><p>For patients without pharyngeal vesicles who have significant symptoms with pharyngeal erythema and/or exudate, it is prudent to obtain a rapid test for group A streptococcus, followed by a throat culture if the rapid test is negative. Back up culture for a rapid antigen diagnostic test is recommended in children. However back up testing (either culture or rapid DNA probe) may not be necessary in older adolescents similar to the approach in adult patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6867.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of acute pharyngitis in adults", section on 'Testing for GAS'</a>.) In settings where a rapid test is not routinely performed or available, a throat culture for group A streptococcus should be obtained.</p><p>Sore throat is well described in COVID-19 in children, and diagnostic testing is warranted for those with nonexudative pharyngitis and fever.

In this situation, the clinician should inform the laboratory that pathogens other than group A streptococcus are also under consideration. If no diagnosis has yet been made in a child who has persistent sore throat and fever, infectious mononucleosis merits consideration even in the absence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
