         Gout (monosodium urate [MSU] crystal deposition disease) is characterized biochemically by extracellular fluid urate saturation, which is reflected in the blood by hyperuricemia, with serum or plasma urate concentrations exceeding 6.8 mg/dL (approximately 400 micromol/L); this level of urate is the approximate limit of urate solubility [

         Descriptions of the epidemiology, clinical features, and natural history of gout have evolved over more than two millennia of observations and study. The latter half of the 20
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         century produced confirmation that the pathogenesis of gout involves urate crystal deposition. Pivotal in this progress was the introduction of polarized light microscopy into clinical practice, providing urate crystal identification in synovial fluid as the means to achieve rapid and definitive diagnosis and to resolve the formerly ambiguous relationship between hyperuricemia and gout [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Further study increased understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of gouty inflammation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1673.html" rel="external">
          "Pathophysiology of gout"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, the development of drugs capable of suppressing gouty inflammation and reversing hyperuricemia has provided means to prevent, and even reverse, the previously ravaging effects of acute inflammatory and chronic destructive manifestations of urate crystal deposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         These advances have favorably influenced the course of gout in the majority of appropriately treated individuals. However, gout has less than optimal clinical outcomes in a large majority of cases, despite attempts at treatment [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. This is particularly true among nonadherent or poorly instructed patients [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ] and in patients whose demographic profiles do not fit what may have historically been considered the "classic" clinical profile of the gouty patient (ie, a 30- to 60-year-old man who is likely to be obese, hypertensive, and a frequent imbiber of alcohol).
        </p>
        <p>
         These "non-classic" at-risk groups that are increasingly common differ from the classic profile in that they include patients of older age, an increased proportion of women [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9

          Incidence and prevalence

         <a href="#rid14">
          14-16
         </a>
         ] of the disease increased from the late 1970s to the mid-2000s in the United States, where it exceeded 3 percent in adults [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-20
         </a>
         ]. Estimates of the prevalence of gout in the United States range from less than three million [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ] to eight million or more individuals [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,21,22
         </a>
         ]. Another estimate describes increasing prevalences from 2011 until 2018, with a more recent prevalence estimate of 5.1 percent and affecting approximately 12 million individuals [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The prevalence of gout has continued to increase steadily in the United Kingdom and worldwide [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,19,22,24
         </a>
         ].The prevalence of gout was reported to be stable in the United States in population surveys conducted from 2007 to 2016 [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

          23
         </a>
         ]. From 2017 to 2018, the age and sex-adjusted prevalence of gout among Asian American individuals increased from 3.3 to 6.6 percent. Gout was more common among Asian American individuals than any other racial or ethnic group during this period.

         <strong>
          Impact of age
         </strong>
         – Childhood serum urate levels normally range from approximately 3 to 4 mg/dL and are similar in prepubescent males and females [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Thus, gout is rare in children, except in instances of marked hyperuricemia due to urate overproduction, such as inherited defects in enzymes of purine metabolism or diseases with greatly increased rates of cell proliferation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80891" href="/z/d/graphic/80891.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), or due to severely impaired renal uric acid clearance, as in familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799" href="/z/d/graphic/66799.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         </span>
         <strong>
          Impact of sex
         </strong>
         - In men, adult serum urate levels of 5 to 6 mg/dL are usually reached at puberty, with little increase thereafter due to age alone [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. The corresponding age-related course of serum urate levels differs in women, in whom serum urate concentrations average approximately 1.0 to 1.5 mg/dL lower than men of similar age; the lower levels result from higher urinary fractional excretion of urate during the childbearing period, which is mediated by estrogenic compounds [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ]. After menopause, the urate concentrations in women rise to levels comparable to those in adult men [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. The sex differences in age-related patterns of urate concentration appear to affect the clinical differences between males and females in the age of onset of gout [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]; increases in gout incidence are detectable in men by the fourth or fifth decades of life and in women by the sixth or seventh decades. These observations suggest an average period of asymptomatic hyperuricemia of at least 10 years or more in both males and females prior to the clinical expression of gout and provide at least a partial explanation for the greater prevalence of gout in men through at least the ninth decade [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-14
         </a>

         <strong>
          Risk factors -
         </strong>
         Increases in onset and recurrences of gout likely reflect changes in both nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors for hyperuricemia and gout  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98500" href="/z/d/graphic/98500.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Notable among these factors are increased longevity and age-associated cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal diseases in the population; the use of medications that alter urate balance as an unintended consequence of treatment for these chronic disorders (and to prevent organ rejection among transplant recipients); and increased dietary intake of foods and food additives (such as high-fructose corn syrup) that contribute to the development of obesity and diabetes mellitus. The epidemiology and risk factors for hyperuricemia and gout are described in more detail separately. (See

         Persistent hyperuricemia is a common biochemical abnormality that results from excessive urate production and/or absolute or relative impairment of renal uric acid excretion (see

          "Urate balance"

         ); all patients with gout have hyperuricemia (saturation of serum for urate) at some point in their disease. However, most hyperuricemic individuals never experience a clinical event resulting from urate crystal deposition.

         The three classic clinical stages in the natural history of progressive urate crystal deposition disease (gout) are:

         The clinical stages of gout can be regarded as emerging sequentially (but with some overlapping), with clinical severity that often parallels the frequency of gout flares and the eventual development of chronic gouty arthropathy and tophaceous gout. In this context, treatment with antihyperuricemic (urate-lowering) agents is not curative, but it may reset the course of the individual patient and provide what is effectively a cure if subsaturating urate levels (&lt;6 mg/dL [357 micromol/L]) are achieved and maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to the availability of effective urate-lowering treatment, the interval from the first gout flare to the onset of chronic gouty arthritis or detectable tophi averaged approximately 12 years, although intervals ranging from less than 5 to 40 years were noted in individual patients. During this era, duration of gout and degree of hyperuricemia were correlated with the rate and extent of tophus formation. After 20 years of untreated gout, almost 75 percent of patients were affected, with the highest prevalence of tophaceous gout in patients with the highest serum urate concentrations [

         </a>
         initially led to a dramatic reduction in chronic gouty arthritis and tophaceous gout, particularly among patients with primary gout who were adherent to treatment and among most patients with secondary gout, with a prevalence of less than 5 percent reported in some series [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. When progression does occur, it is most often among nonadherent patients, those to whom the management scheme has not been appropriately communicated, and those in whom the diagnosis of gout has not been made.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other patients liable to show progression of gout include those intolerant of urate-lowering agents or those treated with inadequate doses of such agents, those receiving medications (usually for comorbidities) that interfere with urate-lowering agents, and organ transplant recipients. These factors differ from those associated with the manifestations of acute hyperuricemia (primarily acute renal failure) seen in the tumor-lysis syndrome or with other causes of massive tissue breakdown.

         Residual prevalences of chronic polyarticular and tophaceous gout approaching 50 percent have been reported in some series of men with gout whose major risk factors were excessive alcohol consumption, diuretic use, and, most importantly, suboptimal management with or low adherence to urate-lowering therapy [

         The triad of diuretic-induced hyperuricemia, renal insufficiency, and nodal osteoarthritis plus overrepresentation of women represents a distinctly different presentation from the classically described group of middle-aged men with tophaceous gout with longstanding disease. Patients in the former group are typically older adults and prone to develop polyarticular and tophaceous gout in osteoarthritic joints:

         Other patients at increased risk for tophaceous gout are those who have chronic kidney disease that has been probably erroneously felt to preclude full-dose antihyperuricemic drug therapy, those who are allergic to or intolerant of urate-lowering agents, and those receiving doses of urate-lowering agents that are inadequate to achieve goal serum urate levels in a range below the limit of urate solubility (often recommended as &lt;6 mg/dL [357 micromol/L]) [

          'Polyarticular gout flares'

          Physiologic alterations

         – Circumstances that promote gout flares include conditions that may provoke generalized disturbances in extracellular fluid urate concentrations or may increase the proinflammatory activities of cells interacting with monosodium urate (MSU) crystals deposited in tissues or in extracellular fluids [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

          Hospitalization

         – Hospitalization is a well-recognized risk factor for flares in patients with gout. A retrospective study among hospitalized patients in New Zealand described predictive factors for flare among hospitalized patients with gout including an elevated pre-admission serum urate (&gt;6 mg/dL), presence of tophi, not being on urate-lowering therapy, presence of acute kidney injury, surgery, initiation or increase of gout flare prophylaxis, adjustment of the urate-lowering therapy while in the hospital, and use of diuretics [

Complete resolution of the earliest flares almost always occurs within a few days to several weeks, even in untreated individuals. Resolution of the gout flare is sometimes accompanied by desquamation of the skin overlying the affected joint. The physiologic basis of the resolution of acute gouty inflammation is complex but centers on the action of endogenous and exogenous suppressors of gouty inflammation [

         A polyarticular pattern is the initial manifestation in less than 20 percent of patients with gout but occurs with increasing frequency in later flares. Polyarticular symptoms are particularly common late in the course of untreated gout, when multiple recurrences, short or absent symptom-free intervals, and palpable tophaceous deposits are common (see

         Upon resolution of a gout flare, the patient is said to have entered an intercritical (between flares) period. Even after severe and incapacitating gout flares, intercritical periods early in the course of gout are most often entirely asymptomatic. This sequence is so uncommon in arthritic disorders other than crystal deposition diseases and palindromic rheumatism that its presence is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Intervals between gout flares are of variable duration. Most untreated patients with gout will experience a second episode within two years. As an example, one large group of patients studied prior to effective antihyperuricemic (urate-lowering) therapy found that 62 percent of patients had a second flare within the first year, 78 percent within two years, and 93 percent within 10 years [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. The risk of recurrent flares is higher in those with worse hyperuricemia at baseline [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ] and with chronic kidney disease. The trend among untreated patients is toward recurrent gout flares that occur after progressively shorter asymptomatic periods and that are increasingly prolonged and disabling, polyarticular, and may be associated with fever.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the intermittency of flares, continued deposition of tophaceous material may occur, causing bony erosions that can evolve into chronic gouty arthropathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial intercritical period provides an opportunity to establish the diagnosis of gout (if this has not been accomplished during the gout flare) through consideration of one or several potential sources of information, including pertinent clinical diagnostic criteria (see
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical diagnosis of intercritical gout'
         </a>
         below); analysis of the aspirate of a previously involved joint or a suspected tophus for crystals, which often persist between flares (see
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis of intercritical or tophaceous gout'
         </a>
         below); and the results of imaging studies of previously inflamed joints. (See

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, the intercritical period is also a time during which important patient education and counseling regarding the management of hyperuricemia and gout can take place. (See

         Tophaceous gout is characterized by collections of solid urate accompanied by chronic inflammatory and often destructive changes in the surrounding connective tissue [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ]; tophi are often visible and/or palpable and can be present on the ears or in the soft tissues, including articular structures, tendons, or bursas  (

          picture 1
         </a>
         ). Tophi are typically not painful or tender. They may attenuate the skin, revealing a yellow or white color. On the ear, they do not transilluminate.
        </p>
        <p>
         The chronic inflammatory process may extend beyond the confines of a single joint, producing generalized enlargement of a digit due to the presence of tophi and/or the inflammation itself. The clinical appearance may be similar to dactylitis seen in other disorders such as psoriatic arthritis, other spondyloarthritides, and sarcoidosis. The expansive and destructive changes associated with tophaceous gout may be mistaken for osteomyelitis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52500" href="/z/d/graphic/52500.html" rel="external">
          image 1

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A characteristic chronic granulomatous inflammatory response can be seen on histologic examination of the lesions [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]; on occasion, acute inflammation, mimicking that of a gout flare, occurs adjacent to one or several tophi  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73021" href="/z/d/graphic/73021.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). Affected areas include articular bone and cartilage, bursas, soft tissues, tendons, ligaments, and entheses [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While tophi may be apparent clinically or may sometimes be detected with plain radiography, other imaging techniques are more sensitive for their detection, including ultrasonography, dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Imaging'

        <p>
         It is likely that many patients with gout and sustained hyperuricemia have a much larger burden of urate crystal deposits than is suspected by clinical examination alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast to the classic presentation, a number of reports have described patients with tophaceous deposits in the absence of, or prior to, gout flare, a presentation that was previously considered a rare occurrence restricted to patients with urate overproduction due to myeloproliferative disorders or hereditary enzyme defects [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59,63
         </a>
         ]. Although this situation may, in part, reflect increasing recognition that tophi can form in any area containing connective tissue (including the meninges but not the brain and spinal cord), risk factors similar to those accounting for cryptic gout in older patients may contribute to tophus formation as the first sign of gout. Such patients are more likely to be women, have predominant or exclusive involvement of the fingers, have chronic kidney disease, and be treated with a diuretic or antiinflammatory drug [

         The gout flare is characterized by the presence of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid obtained from joints or bursas visualized by direct examination of a sample of fluid using compensated polarized light microscopy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85631" href="/z/d/graphic/85631.html" rel="external">

         ). Urate crystals may also be identified frequently by this technique in material aspirated during the intercritical period from previously affected joints and tophaceous deposits [

          64
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The synovial fluid is inflammatory, with white blood cell counts in joint fluid that usually range between 10,000 to 100,000 with neutrophil predominance (see

         Neutrophilic leukocytosis and/or elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) are common in gout flares, but their presence in other acute arthritides generally makes these findings of little diagnostic value. An exception to this may be in distinguishing gout from events such as a stress fracture, which may cause some of the above symptoms and physical findings in the absence of laboratory abnormalities and which can be confirmed by imaging studies. (See

         Serum urate levels can be difficult to interpret during a gout flare. For example, in the early months of urate-lowering drug therapy, gout flares often occur with normal or even low serum urate concentrations at the time of the acute event. Lower urate levels have also been proposed to result from effects of cytokines during flares. Overall, normal to low serum urate values have been noted in 12 to 43 percent of patients with gout flares [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65-68
         </a>
         ]. In patients suspected of gout based upon clinical features, an elevated serum urate (≥6.8 mg/dL) can lend support to the diagnosis but is thus neither diagnostic nor required to establish the diagnosis. The most accurate time for assessment of serum urate (and establishment of a baseline value) is two weeks or more after a gout flare completely subsides.

         – Subcortical bone cysts apparent on plain radiography or MRI examination can be suggestive of gouty tophi or erosions. Changes of these types seen in imaging procedures are not usually detectable at the time of the first gout flare. More specific gouty lesions, such as delicate "overhanging edges" of bone associated with bone erosions due to tophi, occur with more chronic disease.

         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. Another study reported an excellent sensitivity for gout of 90 percent but emphasized that all false-negative cases happened in cases with less than six weeks of symptom duration [

          76

         Although typically used just for diagnosis, DECT may also be useful for determining response to therapy and prognosis.

         The preferred approach to the diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of intracellular monosodium urate (MSU) crystals on polarizing light microscopy of an affected joint, particularly when the diagnosis has not been established or is uncertain; when this is not feasible, a diagnosis may be made based upon clinical features, including the history, examination, laboratory, and imaging studies  (

         ). (See

         A definitive diagnosis should be sought when a gout flare is suspected, both to exclude alternative explanations for the acute event and to ensure that patients with recurrent or progressive arthritis due to another cause are not treated unnecessarily with long-term, expensive, and potentially toxic urate-lowering medications. The diagnosis of gout focuses on the fundamental pathophysiologic events defining the clinical state: tissue deposition of urate crystals and the accompanying inflammatory and potentially destructive consequences.

         Patients with a suspected gout flare in whom the diagnosis has not been previously established or in whom the cause of acute arthritis is uncertain should undergo arthrocentesis; testing of the synovial or bursal fluid should include cell counts and differential white count, Gram stain and culture, and examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116039" href="/z/d/graphic/116039.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). The diagnosis of a gout flare is most secure when supported by visualization of MSU crystals in an inflammatory synovial fluid or an aspirate of an uninflamed joint or tophus by an experienced examiner using compensated polarizing light microscopy (see
         <a class="local">
          'Synovial fluid analysis'
         </a>
         above). The sensitivity of this technique in demonstrating negatively birefringent crystals in patients with gout flares is at least 85 percent, and the specificity for gout is 100 percent [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78,79
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, gout flares may occasionally coexist with another type of joint disease, such as septic arthritis or acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis (pseudogout). For this reason, an acute inflammatory arthritis in a patient with a previously established diagnosis of gout or the presence of urate crystals in synovial fluid aspirated from one of several inflamed joints or from a tophus does not exclude the possibility of a second, sometimes life-threatening, process (eg, systemic infection). Careful attention should thus be given to the clinical status of the patient and to clinical, laboratory, and imaging features likely to permit an accurate differential diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The sensitivity of the joint fluid analysis can be improved by examination of the sediment in a centrifuged specimen [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80
         </a>
         ]. Additional approaches to consider in the event of a negative (no urate crystals seen) study during the gout flare include aspiration of a concurrently inflamed joint or aspiration of an uninflamed but previously involved joint or of a tophus if either is present, although aspiration of an uninflamed joint or tophus is less helpful in excluding an accompanying cause for the acute event.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians who are not skilled at joint aspiration should request the assistance of an orthopedic surgeon to obtain the fluid or of a rheumatologist to perform a joint aspiration and to help with the analysis of the synovial fluid. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In many patients in whom crystal confirmation of the diagnosis cannot be made, an accurate diagnosis of gout can still be established on the basis of clinical data. (See

         In patients with a gout flare in whom crystal diagnosis is not achieved, confirmation of the diagnosis of gout can be made in the gout flare setting in the absence of synovial fluid or when the polarized light microscopic study of aspirated synovial fluid is negative by use of a "diagnostic rule" utilizing a set of validated clinical, historic, and laboratory criteria [

         A clinical diagnostic approach ("rule"), which can be used to estimate the likelihood of gout, has been shown to improve the accuracy of diagnosis of a gout flare made in primary care practice without joint fluid analysis  (

         Based upon the total score, patients can be identified as having low (≤4 points), intermediate (&gt;4 to &lt;8 points), or high (≥8 points) probability of gout. In addition, the authors of the rule have developed a calculator for clinical use that provides a more precise absolute calculated risk of gout for the individual patient [
         <a href="#rid83">
          83
         </a>
         ] and is based upon statistically refined characterization of the variables [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81,82
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The rule was based upon an analysis of 328 patients with acute monoarthritis seen initially by family practitioners in the Netherlands; the patients also underwent prompt expert synovial fluid analysis. In the study cohort, scoring for low (≤4 points), intermediate (&gt;4 to &lt;8 points), and high (≥8 points) probability of gout identified groups with a prevalence of gout of 2.2, 31.2, and 82.5 percent, respectively. This approach yielded substantially fewer false-positive diagnoses than those made clinically by the family practitioners (17 versus 36 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients falling into the intermediate category would most benefit from further evaluation with synovial fluid analysis, as gout cannot be excluded or confirmed based upon an intermediate score alone. Thus, further investigation of such patients is required, including referral for joint aspiration and synovial fluid analysis and detailed clinical reassessment. Advanced imaging, such as ultrasound or dual-energy CT (DECT), may be of benefit in patients in whom a diagnosis of gout has not previously been established if appropriate expertise and technology is available. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Imaging'
         </a>

         <a class="local">

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with an intermediate score, a tentative diagnosis of gout for the purpose of clinical management may still be made in the absence of crystals based upon a preponderance of evidence otherwise favoring the diagnosis (eg, inflammatory joint fluid in a patient with evidence of or known gout in the absence of infection, especially with a score in the higher part of the intermediate range). An alternative diagnosis should be sought in patients lacking sufficient features to support a tentative diagnosis of gout.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnostic rule was validated by application to another cohort of 390 patients with monoarthritis who could conceivably have had gout and were referred to rheumatologists in a regional gout research center in the Netherlands by primary care and other specialty clinicians [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82
         </a>
         ]. The diagnostic rule was developed and validated in an outpatient setting so has limited applicability to hospitalized patients in whom gout is suspected.

         In cases of podagra or involvement of small joints in the hands, a plain radiograph with characteristic erosive appearance ("overhanging edge") can be very supportive of a gout diagnosis. We employ ultrasonography of affected joints selectively in patients with histories of multiple episodes of acute intermittent inflammation, especially when those episodes have involved one or a few specific joints, aspiration of synovial fluid is not feasible or not accepted by the patient, urate crystals have not been detected by prior polarized light microscopic examination, and the diagnosis of gout remains uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even though the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography and DECT in the diagnosis of gout was best established in patient subsets with more advanced disease, crystal deposition can be identified using these imaging modalities in most early gout patients by practitioners with appropriate expertise. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Imaging'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The ready availability of ultrasonography in the clinic, the identification of abnormalities with high specificity for gout by this method, and its additional capacity to serve as the basis for directed needle aspiration of joint fluid for polarized light microscopy support this approach, which may be undertaken either in the course of an acute inflammatory episode or during an intercritical period.

         Even during the asymptomatic intercritical period, urate crystals are identifiable in synovial fluid from previously affected joints in virtually all untreated gouty patients and in approximately 70 percent of those receiving urate-lowering therapy [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64,84,85

        </p>
        <p>
         The high prevalence of urate crystals in aspirates from joints previously affected only once supports the view that deposition of urate crystals in and about joints precedes the first clinical episode of gout by a substantial period of time in most instances.

         Ideally, tissues that are being prepared for histologic examination for urate crystals should be examined as fresh or frozen sections or should be preserved in alcohol (rather than in formalin) and later stained with a nonaqueous system such as Wright-Giemsa stain. However, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue has been reported to still occasionally have demonstrable birefringent urate crystals if stained with a nonaqueous technique using alcoholic eosin [

          87

         In the absence of the means to identify urate crystals or in the presence of a negative polarized light microscopic study, a provisional diagnosis of gout is made by a combination of clinical and historic criteria. However, non-crystal diagnostic criteria have been validated only for the gout flare setting, and their application to diagnosis of patients in intercritical period awaits validation. (See

Diagnostic criteria performance is specific to the population and clinical context in which they were developed (eg, diagnostic criteria developed in an outpatient setting might not apply to hospitalized cases). By contrast, classification criteria are standardized definitions primarily aimed at enabling clinical studies to have uniform cohorts for research and have no direct treatment implications for patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Classification criteria for diseases are possible to develop whether or not there is a "gold standard" diagnostic criterion, but diagnostic criteria, which require levels of specificity and sensitivity approaching 100 percent, are more problematic to achieve, except for diseases with a true gold standard, like urate crystals in gout. When a gold standard for diagnosis exists, diagnostic and classification criteria for that disease can be very similar, but the underlying aims of the processes involved will necessarily perpetuate differences in the appropriateness of applying individual criteria, even if validated for one purpose, to the other category (eg, using classification criteria for clinical diagnostic purposes).

         – Acute monoarticular gout can appear clinically indistinguishable from acute septic arthritis on history and physical examination, including fever, leukocytosis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). On rare occasions, a gout flare and septic arthritis coexist. Extremely high white blood cell counts in synovial fluid (&gt;100,000 cells/mL), although occasionally found in gout and pseudogout, are most supportive of a diagnosis of septic arthritis and should be approached as such until Gram stain or synovial fluid culture confirms or excludes the diagnosis [

          Cellulitis
         </strong>
         – The extensive periarticular inflammation accompanying a gout flare (particularly involving contiguous joints) may result in a clinical picture resembling cellulitis, requiring identification and prompt treatment of the latter process. In most instances, the distribution of inflammatory signs and symptoms in cellulitis does not focus on a joint, progressively extends into nonarticular areas, and is accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and chills. Joint aspiration and synovial fluid analysis, sometimes aimed at distinguishing gout from cellulitis, usually shows noninflammatory joint fluid and leukocyte counts, and urate crystals are not identifiable by polarized microscopy. Arthrocentesis should not be performed through an area potentially involved by cellulitis, as this can lead to extending an infection into the joint.

          Natural history and role of hyperuricemia
         </strong>
         – The three clinical stages in the natural history of progressive urate crystal deposition disease (gout) are the gout flare, intercritical (or interval) gout, and chronic gouty arthritis and tophaceous gout. Use of effective urate-lowering therapies has resulted in a reduced frequency of progression of gout to the tophaceous stage. All patients with gout have hyperuricemia (saturation of serum for urate) at some point in their disease, imparting the risk of urate crystal formation and deposition in tissues with inflammatory responses, resulting in the signs and symptoms of gout. Gout flares usually occur after years of asymptomatic hyperuricemia, although most hyperuricemic individuals never experience a clinical event resulting from urate crystal deposition. (See

          Features of gout flares
         </strong>
         – Numerous circumstances promote or are associated with gout flares, which are typically monoarticular and intensely inflammatory, with severe pain, redness, swelling, and disability. Maximal severity of the flare is usually reached within 12 to 24 hours. Complete resolution of the earliest flares almost always occurs within a few days to several weeks, even in untreated individuals. A polyarticular pattern is the initial manifestation in less than 20 percent of patients with gout but occurs with increasing frequency in later flares. Gout sometimes occurs with normal or even low serum urate concentrations at the time of the acute event. (See

          Intercritical gout
         </strong>
         – Upon resolution of a gout flare, the patient is said to have entered an intercritical (between flares) period, which is most often asymptomatic. This sequence is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Without urate-lowering treatment, the trend is toward recurrent gout flares that occur after progressively shorter asymptomatic periods and that are increasingly prolonged and disabling, are polyarticular, and may be associated with fever.

          Tophaceous gout
         </strong>
         – Tophaceous gout is characterized by collections of densely packed urate crystals, which are occasionally calcified, in connective tissues and accompanied by a chronic inflammatory response. These collections can be visible and/or palpable but are usually not painful or tender; they can be present on the ears or in the soft tissues, including articular structures, tendons, bursas, or bone  (

          picture 1
         </a>
         ). Tophi may be detected with ultrasonography, dual-energy CT (DECT), or MRI. It is likely that many patients with gout and sustained hyperuricemia have a much larger burden of urate crystal deposits than is suspected by clinical examination alone. (See

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – A definitive diagnosis should be sought when a gout flare is suspected, both to exclude alternative explanations for the acute event and to ensure that long-term therapy is not prescribed unnecessarily  (

         ).

         <strong>
          Crystal visualization
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis is most secure when supported by visualization of urate crystals by experienced examiners in a sample of fluid aspirated from an affected joint (or bursa)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85631" href="/z/d/graphic/85631.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). Ultrasonography of joints and adjacent soft tissues is useful for guiding fluid aspiration and can identify specific abnormalities that are highly sensitive and specific for urate crystal deposition. DECT has been standardized and has very good diagnostic yields. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Urate crystal diagnosis of a gout flare'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Role of imaging in diagnosis'

         <strong>
          Use of a "diagnostic" rule
         </strong>
         – When crystal diagnosis is not achieved, confirmation of the diagnosis of gout can be made in the gout flare setting by use of a "diagnostic rule" utilizing a set of validated clinical, historic, and laboratory criteria  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116039" href="/z/d/graphic/116039.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         ). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Role of findings during intercritical period
         </strong>
         – During the asymptomatic intercritical period, extracellular urate crystals are identifiable in synovial fluid from previously affected joints in virtually all untreated gouty patients and in approximately 70 percent of those receiving urate-lowering therapy. This allows late establishment of the diagnosis in the majority of patients in whom the diagnosis was not made in the acute setting. Demonstration of urate crystals in aspirates of tophaceous deposits provides a convenient and specific means to corroborate the diagnosis in gouty individuals with clinically detectable tophi. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The differential diagnosis of the gout flare includes septic arthritis, trauma, acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis (pseudogout), cellulitis, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, and other types of inflammatory arthritis. (See
