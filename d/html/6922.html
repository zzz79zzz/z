However, a very large number of males are diagnosed with low-risk tumors that are unlikely to harm them if left untreated initially [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Furthermore, the treatment of prostate cancer often involves invasive therapy that often compromises sexual, urinary, or bowel-related quality of life [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. As a result, active surveillance (AS) has emerged as a recommended management alternative to immediate treatment for carefully selected males with very low-, low-, and select patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4-9</a>]. AS is based on the assumption that initial assessment (particularly if it incorporates new tools such as prostate magnetic resonance imaging) is reasonably accurate for risk stratification, and that serial monitoring can successfully identify subclinical progression at a time when treatment is still curative in intent, and no more morbid than definitive treatment delivered at the time of diagnosis.</p><p>AS has grown rapidly over the last decade from an approach that was offered primarily at academic centers to worldwide adoption into clinical practice and incorporation into numerous guidelines [<a href="#rid4">4-9</a>], appropriately making it the preferred standard of care for males with very low- and low-risk prostate cancer [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, the uptake of AS remains quite variable [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In addition, questions remain regarding who is and who is not an optimal candidate for AS.</p><p>Key aspects of AS for males with localized prostate cancer will be reviewed here, including the evidence supporting AS, optimal selection of patients for AS, approaches to tumor monitoring, and triggers for intervention. Other approaches to the management of patients with low- and intermediate-risk, localized prostate cancer are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6943.html" rel="external">"Localized prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6940.html" rel="external">"Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6947.html" rel="external">"Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer and those with clinical lymph node involvement"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1518651804"><span class="h1">ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE VERSUS WATCHFUL WAITING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AS differs from watchful waiting (observation), which is based on the premise that males will not benefit from definitive treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer because of limited life expectancy, comorbidity, and the prolonged natural history of prostate cancer [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. With AS, the treatment intent is cure, the follow-up schedule is predefined, and the aim is to minimize treatment-related toxicity without compromising survival, in a man with a reasonable (5 to 10 year) life expectancy and low- or favorable prognosis intermediate-risk disease. By contrast, there is no predefined schedule for watchful waiting, the aim is to minimize treatment-related toxicity and it may be applicable to patients at all stages of disease, especially if life expectancy is limited or significant comorbidity exists. While the age and health of the patient are always important considerations, AS is focused more on stratifying tumor risk and monitoring closely with the intent to provide timely definitive treatment if disease progresses.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H533859882"><span class="h1">RATIONALE FOR ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AS is based on the assumption that initial assessment (particularly if it incorporates new tools such as prostate magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is reasonably accurate for risk stratification, and that serial monitoring can successfully identify subclinical progression at a time when treatment is still curative in intent, and no more morbid than definitive treatment delivered at the time of diagnosis. The primary concerns with AS are twofold:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disease may be misclassified at diagnosis, such that a patient with an aggressive cancer is incorrectly classified as having a low-risk cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Favorable-risk cancer may evolve into higher-grade cancer during AS.</p><p></p><p>The rationale for AS as an alternative to definitive initial treatment for appropriately selected males with low-risk localized prostate cancer is as follows [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prostate cancer is often detected when it is not clinically significant, and it may not become clinically significant during the patient's lifetime. The growth rate of many prostate cancers is slow, and the biologic propensity for metastasis is low in many cases. For many males, low-risk prostate cancer either never requires treatment or treatment can be postponed for a prolonged period without significantly decreasing the chance for cure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Evidence supporting the concept that many males have asymptomatic prostate cancer that is indolent and does not require immediate treatment comes from a number of sources:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Autopsy studies have shown that there is a high incidence of occult cancer in the prostate of males dying without a known prostate cancer. The frequency of such tumors may be as high as 30 percent in males under 40 years, and it may approach 70 to 80 percent in those 60 to 80 years of age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6938.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for prostate cancer", section on 'Age'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A high frequency of occult prostate cancer was observed in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, in which males underwent routine prostate biopsy at the completion of the trial [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Among those who had received placebo, 15 percent of those without an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or abnormal digital rectal examination had occult prostate cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6949.html" rel="external">"Chemoprevention strategies in prostate cancer", section on 'Finasteride: PCPT'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The low risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality in males with low-risk disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) can be illustrated by data showing that males with grade group 1 disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) undergoing AS and followed long-term have less than a 1 percent risk of metastases, and a rate of prostate cancer mortality of 0.1 percent at 15 years [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Males who have indolent prostate cancer can be distinguished by clinical and/or pathologic parameters from those who will have more aggressive disease that will lead to symptoms, metastases, or death. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6943.html" rel="external">"Localized prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Definitive treatments for patients with prostate cancer, including those directed at minimal disease, are associated with significant side effects and costs that are likely greater than the psychologic burden of living with prostate cancer without definitive treatment. (See <a class="local">'Quality of life issues and psychologic comfort with surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prostatectomy data in patients otherwise meeting AS enrollment criteria suggest that the initial biopsy misclassification rate is on the order of 20 to 30 percent, and this may be lower if the initial biopsy includes MRI with MRI-targeted biopsy [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Furthermore, approximately one-third of AS patients show risk reclassification over time, and most do so within two to three years. With appropriate surveillance strategies, patients can be reclassified as being at higher risk for disease progression during AS, and receive definitive therapy without substantially decreasing the chance for cure. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2221163460"><span class="h2">Quality of life issues and psychologic comfort with surveillance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A major advantage of AS is the avoidance or deferral of treatment-associated side effects. These advantages are difficult to quantify, with the exception of treatment-related side effects. An overview of the complications of radiation and surgical treatments for localized prostate cancer are presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6940.html" rel="external">"Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer", section on 'Outcomes and the choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>However, a decision about whether to choose AS or immediate treatment for early prostate cancer also needs to consider factors other than treatment-related side effects that may affect quality of life. In a detailed decision analysis that focused on hypothetical, otherwise healthy 65-year-old males with low-risk, localized prostate cancer that used quality of life as the endpoint [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], AS was associated with a higher quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) than initial treatment with external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, or radical prostatectomy. However, the QALE gains and the optimal strategy were highly dependent on individual preferences for living under AS and for having been treated.</p><p>Males who are managed with AS have the psychosocial burden of living with an indolent cancer without active treatment [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. This anxiety can be a significant factor in causing many patients who are being managed with AS to seek active treatment [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. In the Toronto cohort, approximately one-third of patients sought active treatment for reasons other than disease progression [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, males who are properly educated about the indolent course of good-risk prostate cancer may be better able to avoid some of the psychologic complications associated with AS [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Improved communication with the medical staff may improve both the acceptability of AS as an initial approach as well as the continuing participation in such a program [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Ensuring compliance with follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H497242442"><span class="h2">Outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A definitive assessment of the role of AS for prostate cancer patients requires a direct comparison between immediate treatment and AS, which includes definitive treatment at the time when there is evidence of progression. There are no available randomized trials that satisfy these criteria. However, taken together, the available data (mostly from older trials that compared definitive versus deferred initial therapy, usually watchful waiting) suggest that outcomes in appropriately selected males with localized prostate cancer who are managed with initial observation appear to be similar to those undergoing immediate definitive therapy. [<a href="#rid24">24-28</a>]. Most of these data were derived in males with very low- and low-risk disease. These results are described in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6940.html" rel="external">"Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer", section on 'Active surveillance'</a>.)</p><p>Further evidence comes from the PROTECT trial that randomly assigned over 1600 males to "active monitoring," surgery, or radiation [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Patients assigned to active monitoring had their PSA monitored every three months during the first year and every six months thereafter. Additional testing was carried out as indicated, and the therapeutic plan was reassessed as clinically indicated. Notably, MRI was not used to follow patients on active monitoring.</p><p>In the initial report of this trial (median follow-up 10 years), the development of metastases was significantly more frequent in patients managed with AS (33 males with metastatic disease versus 13 and 16 of those assigned to prostatectomy and radiation therapy, respectively), and the incidence of clinical progression was high (40 percent of males assigned to AS switched over to active therapy within five years). It is likely that these results were driven by the over 20 percent of males with intermediate- to high-risk disease who were randomized to the observation arm and, possibly, due to methods used for patient selection and surveillance. Unfortunately, the PROTECT trial was not powered appropriately for subgroup analyses, so a focused evaluation of low-risk patients was not possible. Despite these findings, there were only a limited number of prostate cancer-related deaths in any of the groups, and there was no significant difference in the 10-year cancer-specific survival or all-cause mortality among the three treatments.</p><p>Additional support for AS in males with low-risk disease is provided by several single and multi-institutional series with intermediate- to long-term follow-up that have shown AS to be a safe alternative to immediate treatment with comparable survival in appropriately selected patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130093" href="/z/d/graphic/130093.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14,30-34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3712291649"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3957579210"><span class="h2">Males at low risk of disease progression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Identification of males whose disease is at a low risk for progression is a critical issue in the choice of AS. Tumor grade, volume, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are the most common factors influencing the choice of AS, but other factors such as age, comorbidity and life expectancy, results of prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genomic testing, the absence of certain histologic features on prostate biopsy (areas of cribriform or intraductal histology), psychologic comfort with AS, and the ability/willingness to follow-through with recommended monitoring during AS need to be considered. (See <a class="local">'Tools to refine the selection of males for AS'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Very low- and low-risk tumors</strong> – Guidelines from expert groups (including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], combined guidelines from the American Urological Association [AUA]/American Society for Radiation Oncology [ASTRO], and the American Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO] [<a href="#rid5">5-9</a>]) all state that AS is the preferred approach for males with very low-risk prostate cancer, as defined by tumor grade volume, and PSA level  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). NCCN, AUA/ASTRO, and ASCO also consider AS an appropriate alternative to immediate definitive treatment for males with low-risk disease [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6940.html" rel="external">"Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intermediate-risk tumors</strong> – Although controversial, AS is an option for males with <strong>favorable</strong> intermediate-risk disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), especially those who are older or have significant comorbidity and are willing to accept a potentially higher risk of developing metastases. AS is not indicated for males with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease, unless they are an older adult and/or have a limited life expectancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6947.html" rel="external">"Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer and those with clinical lymph node involvement", section on 'Options for intermediate-risk disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus as to how to substratify those who fall into a "more favorable" versus "less favorable" intermediate-risk category, nor whether all males in the favorable intermediate-risk category are good candidates for AS. Guidelines from the AUA/ASTRO, ASCO, Cancer Care Ontario, NCCN, and a combined guideline from the European Association of Urology/European Association of Nuclear Medicine/European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology/ European Society of Urogenital radiology/International Society of Geriatric Oncology all endorse AS as a management option for carefully selected patients with intermediate-risk disease, but each defines that population of "favorable" intermediate-risk differently. Current guideline-based definitions of intermediate-risk prostate cancer and recommendations for AS from expert groups are outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130140" href="/z/d/graphic/130140.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). We consider that any of these definitions are appropriate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Decision-making in a patient with favorable intermediate-risk disease who is considering AS rather than definitive local therapy must be carefully individualized. The main concern for intermediate-risk disease managed with AS is the possibility that outcomes may be worse, as was suggested in the PROTECT trial, described above. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An important point is that being at an increased risk of progression based on a classification of intermediate risk disease compared with low-risk and very low-risk tumor does not mean AS is not an option [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. Risk is measured on a continuous spectrum that requires a careful balance between avoiding overtreatment and ensuring cancer control. Other factors influencing the decision to pursue AS in this population include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We tend to prefer upfront definitive treatment rather than AS for males with grade group 3 disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and for those with high volume grade group 2 disease (three or more involved cores).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We discourage individuals with intraductal or cribriform histology subtypes from AS unless they are an older adult or have lower life expectancy, given the greater risk of progression and concern for undersampled higher-grade tumors. (See <a class="local">'Histology'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tissue-based genomic prognostic markers can be used in males with favorable intermediate-risk disease to discover those who might have more aggressive disease, and better served by definitive therapy. However, while these tests are currently being used for treatment decision-making, better evidence is needed before they can be considered a standard component of the decision-making process for or against AS. (See <a class="local">'Tissue-based genomic prognostic markers'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The impact of these and other factors, including the results of tissue-based genomic testing and prostate MRI are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Tools to refine the selection of males for AS'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H234980562"><span class="h2">Tools to refine the selection of males for AS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tumor grade, volume, and PSA still represent the most common factors that are considered in the choice of AS for males with low-risk or favorable-intermediate risk prostate cancer. In the last decade, other factors, including multiparametric prostate (mp) MRI, histology, and tissue based genomic markers have emerged as helpful tools to select and monitor patients for AS, but more research is needed to understand how to best utilize these tools.</p><p>Future studies focusing on the prospective serial evaluation of these tests in all males undergoing surveillance will help us to better understand how to best use these tests and for whom they benefit the most.

However, in our view, for regions where MRI is not widely available or affordable, AS can be performed safely without the inclusion of prostate MRI. The role of prostate MRI for the confirmatory biopsy and for monitoring patients while on an AS protocol are addressed below. (See <a class="local">'Confirmatory biopsy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Role of repeat biopsy and MRI during longitudinal follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>Multiparametric prostate MRI has emerged as the best method of localizing cancer within the prostate gland. A negative transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy in the face of clinically determined need or indication for a prostate biopsy is the most validated and accepted indication for prostate MRI and MRI-targeted biopsy. However, accumulating evidence suggests that incorporation of prebiopsy MRI into the diagnostic pathway for any clinically suspected prostate cancer improves the diagnosis of clinically significant disease, reduces adverse effects from biopsy, and can potentially prevent unnecessary biopsies in some individuals. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8097.html" rel="external">"Prostate biopsy", section on 'Choice of biopsy method by indication'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97482.html" rel="external">"The role of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer", section on 'Initial presentation with no prior biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>MRI of the prostate has emerged as an important component of optimizing patient selection for AS.

Prostate MRI may aid in the identification of occult higher grade tumors, even among patients with known clinically low-risk disease.</p><p>While MRI has a moderate diagnostic accuracy for detecting otherwise missed grade group 2 or higher disease, the strength of MRI in this setting comes from its high negative predictive value (NPV; 68 to 100 percent) for clinically significant disease (defined as grade group ≥2 disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)) [<a href="#rid43">43-52</a>].

Other secondary endpoints also favored enzalutamide at one year but not later. As an example, the odds of a negative biopsy at one year was 3.5-fold higher with enzalutamide (35 versus 14.2 percent, OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.76-6.92), but the difference was no longer statistically significant at two years (19 versus 12 percent, OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.66-4.0). The number of patients who went on to receive primary therapy in each group was not reported. The time to PSA rise was delayed by six months, but the total number of patients with PSA progression through the end of the observation period was not different (84.2 versus 84.1 percent).</p><p>The most commonly reported adverse events during <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86370" href="/z/d/drug information/86370.html" rel="external">enzalutamide</a> therapy were fatigue (55 percent), gynecomastia (37 percent), breast tenderness (26 percent), and erectile dysfunction (18 percent). Although drug-related adverse events were reported by almost 90 percent of individuals, only 2.7 percent were considered serious, and 7 percent led to study discontinuation. Treatment with enzalutamide was associated with clinically meaningful declines in sexual and physical function, which resolved by month 24 after treatment cessation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2294395872"><span class="h2">Can exercise help?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We encourage males to pursue lifestyle interventions such as exercise that may improve psychologic and emotional health [<a href="#rid129">129</a>] and cardiorespiratory fitness, and possibly, slow disease progression. This recommendation is consistent with guidelines from the American Cancer Society Nutrition and Physical Activity Guideline for Cancer Survivors that suggest that survivors without physical limitations or contraindications should aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, which should also include routine resistance exercises [<a href="#rid130">130</a>].</p><p>Observational studies have shown an association between physical activity patterns after cancer diagnosis and prognosis in individuals diagnosed with early-stage cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate. However, there are limited data from randomized trials evaluating the impact of increased physical activity on rates of cancer recurrence or mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14222.html" rel="external">"The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivors", section on 'Prostate cancer'</a>.)</p><p>New data from a small randomized clinical trial suggest the possibility that high-intensity interval training might slow disease progression in males undergoing AS for localized prostate cancer. In the ERASE trial, 52 males under AS for mostly low-risk localized disease were randomly assigned to high-intensity interval training (HIIT; which consisted of 12 weeks of thrice weekly supervised aerobic sessions at 85 to 95 percent of peak oxygen consumption), or usual care (which included maintaining normal exercise levels) [<a href="#rid131">131</a>]. Compared with the usual care group, those randomized to HIIT experienced a decreased PSA level (mean change -0.4 microgram/L, 95% CI -0.8 to 0.0) while PSA level increased in the control group (mean change 0.3 microgram/L, 95% CI -0.7 to 1.3); adjusted between group difference was -1.1 microgram/L (95% CI -2.1 to 0.0). Males in the HIIT group also had slower PSA velocity (adjusted between group difference -1.3 microgram/L per year, 95% CI -2.5 to -0.1), although there were no significant differences in PSA doubling time.</p><p>Confirmation of these results is needed in larger trials before definitive conclusions can be drawn as to the influence of structured aerobic exercise on outcomes from AS.
