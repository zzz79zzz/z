Recognizing abnormal labor progression in the second stage and initiating appropriate interventions are important because a prolonged second stage is associated with increased risks for operative delivery and maternal and neonatal morbidity.</p><p>This topic will discuss the diagnosis and management of a prolonged second stage of labor. An overview of labor progress, risk factors for protraction and arrest disorders, diagnosis and management of first stage labor abnormalities, and management of normal labor and delivery are reviewed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4464.html" rel="external">"Labor: Overview of normal and abnormal progression"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4473.html" rel="external">"Labor: Diagnosis and management of the latent phase"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132061.html" rel="external">"Labor: Diagnosis and management of an abnormal first stage"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4445.html" rel="external">"Labor and delivery: Management of the normal first stage"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H632299704"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The second stage of labor is typically much shorter than the first stage and characterized by considerable variation in duration; it is often brief but may extend for many hours. The identification and management of a prolonged second stage are based on a combination of high-quality evidence and expert consensus. Historically, analyses of second-stage duration have been descriptive, retrospective, and influenced by both demographic and obstetric factors, which have varied across time and practice settings. For example, demographic factors that may increase second-stage duration include nulliparity and high maternal body mass index. Obstetric factors include increased birth weight, high fetal station at complete dilation, occiput posterior position, neuraxial analgesia, delayed pushing, willingness to initiate <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/z/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a> in the second stage, and the skill, judgment, and ability of the provider to safely perform a rotation or operative vaginal delivery.</p><p>A major focus of efforts to reduce the rate of primary cesarean births performed in the second stage is to allow a longer maximum time in the second stage before considering it prolonged. Reduction of the cesarean birth rate is an important goal, but must be balanced against the rare but considerable perinatal morbidity reported in prolonged second stage [<a href="#rid1">1-7</a>]. The diagnosis of a prolonged second stage per se does not imply delivery must occur, but should prompt reassessment of maternal and fetal status, labor progress, and the chances of vaginal birth. (See <a class="local">'Risks of prolonging the second stage'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1200742748"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The appropriate duration and maximum length of time recommended for the second stage of labor in an individual patient varies based on clinical factors, likelihood of vaginal birth, discussion of the risks and benefits of interventions, and patient preference. A specific absolute maximum length of time spent in the second stage beyond which all patients should undergo operative delivery has not been identified. One consideration is that the start of the second stage is not precise because it is diagnosed when the cervix is completely dilated (usually defined as 10 cm), which might have occurred before the manual cervical examination that first detects complete dilation.</p><p>We diagnose a prolonged second stage based on an American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical practice guideline [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>In nulliparous patients</strong>, the second stage generally is considered prolonged:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>After three hours of pushing. However, a longer duration (commonly, up to four hours of pushing) may be appropriate for patients with epidural anesthesia or with a fetal malposition as long as progress is documented.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>In parous patients</strong>, the second stage generally is considered prolonged:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>After two hours of pushing. However, a longer duration (commonly, up to three hours of pushing) may be appropriate for patients with epidural anesthesia or with a fetal malposition as long as progress is documented.</p><p></p><p>Importantly, arrest in the second stage can be identified earlier if there is lack of rotation or descent despite adequate contractions, pushing efforts, and time [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Concerning fetal or maternal status necessitates consideration of delivery prior to reaching the described time limits. </p><p>We acknowledge that some clinicians use total duration of the second stage instead of duration of pushing. These times are the same, except in patients who delay pushing after complete cervical dilation and thus have 'active' and 'passive' phases of the second stage; however, there is now strong evidence that delayed pushing does not increase vaginal birth rates and has adverse effects. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/134953.html" rel="external">"Labor and delivery: Management of the normal second stage", section on 'Early versus delayed'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical experience and judgment are of great importance in individual case decision-making during the second stage of labor. Factors such as the fetal station, estimated fetal weight, obstetric history, fetal status, pelvic size and shape, and adequacy of maternal pushing should be considered. In select scenarios where the probability of a vaginal birth appears to be low, such as when a patient has been pushing effectively without any descent or rotation, it is reasonable to make a diagnosis of second stage arrest and proceed with operative birth prior to these times. On the other hand, a diagnosis of a prolonged second stage does not mandate prompt operative intervention when the maternal and fetal status is reassuring and some progress is occurring. (See <a class="local">'Timing of operative delivery'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2789843772"><span class="h2">Evidence and controversy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Criteria for diagnosis of a prolonged second stage were derived from an analysis of data from the Consortium on Safe Labor by Zhang and co-investigators in 2010 [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], and then validated by a randomized trial [<a href="#rid10">10</a>] and large observational study [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. These data describe the normal duration for the second stage of labor (median and<sup> </sup>95<sup>th</sup> percentile) in contemporary patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69170" href="/z/d/graphic/69170.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and are the foundation for ACOG and SMFM second-stage management guidelines. However, this approach has been challenged by some experts, including Emanuel Friedman, MD, who believe that the safety of extending the duration of the second stage to these lengths before making a diagnosis of arrest, particularly up to four hours in nulliparous patients with neuraxial anesthesia, has not been established [<a href="#rid6">6,12,13</a>]. </p><p>It is unclear whether a specific threshold exists for the duration of the second stage of labor beyond which operative delivery is absolutely indicated. In our practice, we follow the criteria recommended in an ACOG Practice Guideline [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, we recommend increased vigilance when monitoring the fetal heart rate tracing and considering assisted-vaginal birth, in some cases prior to reaching the time criteria for diagnosis of a prolonged second stage. As discussed above (see <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above), lack of progress or concerning fetal or maternal status necessitates considering delivery prior to reaching the described time limits; however, a reassuring assessment does not require prolonging the second stage indefinitely. In addition, the provider and patient will need to engage in shared decision-making when weighing the likelihood of vaginal birth against the risk of serious maternal and neonatal morbidity from expectant management when considering how long to continue the second stage.</p><p>Our approach is based on the following evidence:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis that combined data from five retrospective cohort studies and two randomized trials performed worldwide found similar rates of cesarean birth and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in nulliparous patients whether contemporary or historic labor curves were used in the second stage [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. A considerable degree of unexplained heterogeneity limited interpretation of the findings. The authors concluded that it was not possible to establish a specific threshold for the duration of the second stage beyond which all patients should undergo operative delivery. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another systematic review including 33 studies (&gt;215,000 nulliparous individuals and &gt;250,000 multiparous individuals) noted considerable variation in the mean, median, and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for duration of second stage among the included studies [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In 10 of the studies, increasing second-stage duration, with the exception of the first half hour, was associated with newborn morbidity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with prolonged labor report a negative childbirth experience more often than those who had a labor of normal duration (34 versus 5 percent) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1226728777"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a retrospective study including over 15,000 nulliparous term cephalic singleton births from 1976 to 2001 in which 56 percent of the entire cohort had epidural anesthesia, the frequency of patients giving birth during each hour of the second stage was as follows [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>0 to 1 hours – 46 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>1 to 2 hours – 23 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>2 to 3 hours – 14 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>3 to 4 hours – 10 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>&gt;4 hours – 7 percent</p><p></p><p>The route of birth among patients who gave birth during each hour was:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>0 to 1 hours – nearly 100 percent vaginal (spontaneous or assisted)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>1 to 2 hours – nearly 100 percent vaginal (spontaneous or assisted)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>2 to 3 hours – nearly 95 percent vaginal (spontaneous or assisted)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>3 to 4 hours – approximately 85 percent vaginal (spontaneous or assisted)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>&gt;4 hours – 67 percent vaginal (spontaneous or assisted)</p><p></p><p>In a similar retrospective study of over 5000 multiparous patients, of whom 44 percent had epidural, the frequency of patients giving birth during each hour of the second stage was as follows [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>0 to 1 hours – 80 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>1 to 2 hours – 11 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>2 to 3 hours – 5 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>&gt;3 hours – 5 percent</p><p></p><p>The route of birth among patients who gave birth during each hour was:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>0 to 1 hours – 96 percent vaginal (spontaneous or assisted)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>1 to 2 hours – 99 percent vaginal (spontaneous or assisted)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>2 to 3 hours – 93 percent vaginal (spontaneous or assisted)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>&gt;3 hours – 73 percent vaginal (spontaneous or assisted)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3594495485"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4270708927"><span class="h2">Approach to patients undelivered after pushing for 60 to 90 minutes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>More than half of parturients who give birth vaginally will do so within 60 to 90 minutes of beginning to push, regardless of parity or use of neuraxial anesthesia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69170" href="/z/d/graphic/69170.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

The options of an operative delivery (forceps- or vacuum-assisted vaginal, cesarean) versus continued pushing are considered and discussed with the patient when approaching the times established for the upper limit of a normal second stage of labor (see <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above). At that time, if the station and position do not permit a safe assisted-vaginal delivery and further progress seems unlikely, we advise cesarean birth. However, we will consider continuing the second stage beyond the time diagnostic of a prolonged second stage when, in our judgment, a safe assisted-vaginal or spontaneous birth seems to be achievable within the next 30 to 45 minutes. This is a shared decision; we discuss the options of continued pushing versus vacuum- or forceps-assisted vaginal delivery (if the patient is an appropriate candidate) versus cesarean birth.

The identification and management of abnormalities of duration are based on high-quality evidence, expert consensus, and agreed-upon definitions for what is normal and safe. A major focus of efforts to reduce the rate of primary cesarean births performed in the second stage is to allow a longer maximum time in the second stage before considering it prolonged. (See <a class="local">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – We diagnose a prolonged second stage based on an American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) consensus group statement for prevention of the primary cesarean birth (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>In nulliparous patients</strong> – The second stage generally can be considered prolonged:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>After three hours of pushing. However, a longer duration (commonly, up to four hours of pushing) may be appropriate for patients with epidural anesthesia or with a fetal malposition as long as progress is documented.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>In parous patients</strong> – The second stage generally can be considered prolonged:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>After two hours of pushing. However, a longer duration (commonly, up to three hours of pushing) may be appropriate for patients with epidural anesthesia or with a fetal malposition as long as progress is documented.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Arrest in the second stage can be identified earlier if there is lack of rotation or descent despite adequate contractions, pushing efforts, and time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Concerning fetal or maternal status necessitates consideration of operative delivery prior to reaching the described time limits.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who have not met criteria for a prolonged second stage, we continue expectant management as long as the mother is stable, the fetal heart rate pattern does not necessitate urgent delivery, and the fetus continues to descend and/or rotate to a more favorable position. (See <a class="local">'Approach to patients undelivered after pushing for 60 to 90 minutes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If descent is &lt;1 cm over the first 60 to 90 minutes of the second stage and contractions are less frequent than every three minutes, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/z/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a> is initiated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If contractions are adequate, but maternal expulsive efforts are suboptimal, coaching from an experienced and engaged nurse or physician can be helpful.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If descent is minimal &lt;1 cm over the first 60 to 90 minutes of the second stage and uterine contractions and maternal expulsive efforts are adequate, the possibility of a physical issue (eg, malposition, macrosomia, small maternal pelvis) should be considered. Fetal position can be diagnosed digitally, but with greater accuracy sonographically. Manual rotation from the occiput posterior to occiput anterior position has a high success rate, can shorten the second stage, and increase the chances of vaginal birth. Similar considerations apply to occiput transverse position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients approaching the times established for a prolonged second stage, if the station and position do not permit a safe assisted-vaginal delivery and further progress seems unlikely, we generally advise the patient to undergo cesarean birth. However, we will consider continuing the second stage beyond the time diagnostic of a prolonged second stage when, in our judgment, a safe assisted-vaginal or spontaneous birth seems to be achievable within the next 30 to 45 minutes. This is a shared decision; we discuss the options of continued pushing versus vacuum- or forceps-assisted vaginal delivery (if the patient is an appropriate candidate) versus cesarean birth. (See <a class="local">'Timing of operative delivery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risks of a prolonged second stage</strong> – A prolonged second stage of labor is associated with small increases in neonatal and maternal complications.
