         Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a rare inborn error of immunity characterized by dysregulation of the immune system due to an inability to regulate lymphocyte homeostasis through the process of lymphocyte apoptosis (a form of programmed cell death). The consequences include lymphoproliferative disease, manifested by lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and an increased risk of lymphoma, as well as autoimmune disease, typically involving blood cells.

         Patients with evidence of lymphoproliferation, as manifested by enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, and/or hepatomegaly, should be referred to an expert in oncology with experience in evaluating benign and malignant lymphoproliferative disease. In addition, patients with autoimmune cytopenias should be seen by an expert in hematology. Referral to a center of excellence for ALPS is an option either initially or after evaluation by an expert in hematology/oncology has taken place and a diagnosis of ALPS is suspected, likely, or confirmed.

         A basic investigation of the integrity of the immune system should be performed in patients deemed to need immunosuppressive therapy, particularly in young patients. In addition to the complete blood count with differential, these studies include quantitative immunoglobulin levels, antibody titers to protein (and, if over two years old, polysaccharide) vaccines, and CH50, as well as lymphocyte subsets and T cell function studies if contemplating long-term immunosuppressive therapy with

         The initial evaluation should also include an assessment for lymphoma in patients with extensive lymphadenopathy, especially in those with constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, night sweats). Use of positron emission tomography (PET) based imaging to help distinguishing "good" from "bad" nodes on the basis of presumed higher metabolic activity of malignant lymphoid tissue has been investigated, but this approach is not validated

         [
         <a href="#rid3">

         ]. PET scans fluctuate with respect to the localization of "hot" (chemically active) versus "cold" nodes in individual patients, contrasting with nodes that are more likely to be persistently hot. However, nonmalignant lymphadenopathy similarly varies over time. Other considerations are exposure to radiation and cost. Thus, PET imaging is not used as a routine surveillance tool. Education of patients/caregivers as to signs and symptoms of lymphoma (ie, different than "typical" ALPS) and routine follow-up may be as effective as imaging for lymphoma surveillance. However, all questionable nodes require biopsy and histologic evaluation, and PET scans can be useful in directing the surgeon to the node or nodes with high metabolic activity that are most likely to be of value for diagnostic excisional biopsy if there is suspicion of a lymphoma. Investigation for lymphoma is particularly important if immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulating agents are contemplated since lymphoma development may be altered and/or masked by use of these agents.

         The management of disease manifestations is focused on the control/treatment of lymphoproliferation and/or autoimmunity and the treatment of lymphoma [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4-9
         </a>
         ]. Most experience is confined to patients with ALPS-FAS, for whom lymphoproliferative disease begins early in life and tends to become less frequent in adolescence and adulthood. Patients can have mild cytopenias due to hypersplenism, which is different from the autoimmune cytopenias. Development of autoimmune manifestations, which invariably involve combinations of the autoimmune cytopenias (autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia with or without neutropenia), signals a transition in the natural history of ALPS in many patients that is often characterized by the need to initiate or escalate therapy. Treatment of lymphoproliferation and autoimmune disease in ALPS is based upon observational data and clinical experience since there are no randomized trials. Therapy is individualized, and the choice of agent depends upon many patient-specific factors and practitioner preference and experience.

         Autoimmune manifestations typically respond to therapy, but patients with autoimmune manifestations usually have a more difficult time coming off immunosuppressive agents than patients with lymphoproliferation only. Cumulative data (including published reports) favors the use of

          sirolimus

         Glucocorticoids given orally or in intravenous boluses, as is done to treat other autoimmune cytopenias, can be effective in acute, severe bouts of anemia or thrombocytopenia in ALPS. However, glucocorticoids are typically needed for prolonged periods of time. In addition, approximately 50 to 60 percent of patients are not adequately managed by glucocorticoid monotherapy, due to an incomplete initial response and/or recurrence with tapering/weaning glucocorticoids, and require additional immunosuppressive drugs to control autoimmunity [

         Lymphoproliferative complications alone (eg, airway obstruction from enlarged tonsillar tissue, massive splenomegaly) are almost never severe enough to require treatment with immunosuppressive agents. In addition, lymphoproliferation typically returns after cessation of immunosuppressive therapy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ] or, in the case of enlarged tonsillar tissue, after tonsillectomy [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, adenopathy generally recedes over time and organomegaly may as well. Thus, we suggest observation and expectant management rather than immunosuppressive therapy for most patients with lymphoproliferation without autoimmune manifestations. Typical protective measures (eg, avoidance of contact sports to avoid splenic rupture) are taken in patients with splenomegaly. We recommend against splenectomy, because of lack of sustained benefit and a clear increased risk of post-splenectomy sepsis, which may be rapidly fatal. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Avoidance of splenectomy'

        <p>
         Immunosuppressive therapy is an alternative to observation, particularly in patients with a degree of lymphoproliferation that causes chronic symptoms and/or significantly compromises quality of life. The benefits of immunosuppression must be weighed against the side effects, particularly since lymphadenopathy as well as splenomegaly and/or hepatomegaly return once immunosuppression is discontinued [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         /day). Mycophenolate mofetil is then slowly weaned as guided by clinical response and/or side effects, including tolerability of the agent, physical examination (eg, degree of splenomegaly), and biomarkers to determine response and guide changes in drug dose (duration in therapy). It can be difficult to distinguish between spontaneous improvement of lymphoproliferation and medication effect, particularly in patients &lt;10 years of age. The author typically follows clinical response and biomarkers at three-month intervals and treats for a least one year before contemplating a taper but rarely treats beyond five years. One approach to tapering is to not adjust the dose over time as the child grows, which gradually decreases the mg/kg dose the child receives.

         suggests that this agent may affect lymphoproliferation in a more sustained manner than other immunosuppressive agents, as demonstrated by more significant reduction in adenopathy, splenomegaly, and biomarkers (eg, soluble IL-2 receptor alpha [sIL-2Ralpha], soluble Fas ligand, IL-10, IL-18, and vitamin B12) [

         If the decision is made not to initiate treatment, periodic follow-up is recommended, employing the same tools used in the initial assessment (see

          'Evaluation following initial diagnosis'

         Once initiated, immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulating therapy may be difficult to stop. This should be taken into consideration before starting therapy because of the side effects, risks, and high cost of long-term immunosuppressive treatment. The development of symptomatic autoimmune cytopenias often indicates a new phase of ALPS in a particular patient. Therapies that affect the immune system should not be used for extended periods of time (years), particularly in children, because of their complications. For example, long-term use of glucocorticoids is associated with obesity, growth retardation, hypertension, cataracts, osteopenia/osteoporosis leading to pathologic bone fractures, and diabetes, among others. Long-term use of antiproliferative T cell agents (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9217" href="/z/d/drug information/9217.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ) may cause significant infections and kidney impairment. In addition, the immune system may not withstand suppression for prolonged periods of time, and secondary immunodeficiency may persist. Resolution of ALPS manifestations after years of therapy may be due to chronic immunosuppression rather than permanent remission of ALPS, indicating the need for periodic assessment of overall immune competence. This is particularly important in younger patients as they experience common viral infections, such as those due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). (See

Young age was a risk factor for sepsis after splenectomy. Antimicrobial prophylaxis and appropriate vaccinations had been prescribed in the majority of the episodes of sepsis, although poor adherence was found to be a risk factor for sepsis in the French cohort.

In addition, they show normal response to vaccines, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine.

         Genetic counseling is recommended to provide patients and families with information on the nature of the disease, its inheritance, and implications for affected relatives and carriers. Patients with ALPS due to somatic Fas pathogenic variants (ALPS-sFAS) did not inherit the genetic defect in
         <em>
          FAS
         </em>
         from either of the parents and do not appear to carry the pathogenic variant in their germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Consequently, their offspring will not inherit the somatic variant. In contrast, those with a constitutional
         <em>
          FAS
         </em>
         variant are at 50 percent risk of passing the variant on to each of their offspring, who may be affected to a greater or lesser degree than their parents due to the variable penetrance and expressivity of ALPS manifestations. In addition, manifestations of ALPS at an early age are not predictive of later life course.

         </span>
         Many patients with ALPS have a favorable prognosis, with lymphadenopathy decreasing over time (even without treatment in mild disease) and autoimmune features remaining absent or manageable with limited need for immunosuppressive therapy. Some patients with particular pathogenic variants affecting the intracellular death domain of the Fas molecule may have a poorer prognosis, while those with defects in the extracellular domain may have more mild disease. However, it is impossible to predict which path each individual patient will follow, regardless of the genotype, and severe disease may arise for the first time in adulthood. Thus, long-term follow-up is indicated for the majority of patients to carefully monitor the course of each person's disease. A significant component of follow-up care should focus on education and empowerment of patients and their parents/caregivers. In addition, patients may need to be monitored for subsequent pathogenic events affecting Fas-mediated apoptosis, lymphocyte homeostasis in general, or other (still unknown) events [

This optimism needs to be balanced with the recognition of second genetic hits affecting

          Treatment of disease manifestations

         – Management of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) focuses on control/treatment of lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity and early diagnosis and treatment of lymphoma. Therapy is individualized, and the choice of treatment depends upon patient-specific factors and clinician preference and experience. Our general approach is as follows:

         – The development of symptomatic autoimmune cytopenias (eg, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia with or without neutropenia) often indicates a new phase of ALPS and signals a need to initiate or escalate therapy.

          Lymphoproliferation
         </strong>
         – We suggest observation and expectant management rather than immunosuppressive therapy for most patients with lymphoproliferation (eg, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly) without autoimmune manifestations (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Patients with splenomegaly should use typical protective measures (eg, avoidance of contact sports due to risk of splenic rupture). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Lymphoproliferation'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Observation is preferred in most cases because adenopathy and organomegaly generally recede over time. Furthermore, when immunosuppressive therapy is used in these patients, lymphoproliferation typically returns after cessation of therapy. Similarly, tonsillar enlargement recurs after tonsillectomy.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         However, immunosuppressive therapy is a reasonable alternative to observation in selected patients with isolated lymphoproliferation who have chronic symptoms that significantly compromise quality of life. The benefits of immunosuppression must be weighed against the side effects, particularly since lymphadenopathy and organomegaly return once immunosuppression is discontinued. If the decision is made to treat, we suggest

          Severe or recalcitrant disease
         </strong>
         – HCT is an option for patients with ALPS who have severe and recalcitrant autoimmune cytopenias, severe immunodeficiency during or after treatment, lymphoma, or a high-risk genotype (including patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous
         <em>
          FAS

         <strong>

         </strong>
         splenectomy as a treatment for refractory autoimmune cytopenias or massive splenomegaly in patients with ALPS (

          Grade 1C

          Prognosis

         – In many patients, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly decrease in later childhood and adulthood and autoimmune features remain absent or manageable with limited need for immunosuppressive therapy. However, the prognosis is unpredictable and depends to some degree on the genotype, with some variants (eg, those affecting the intracellular domain of the Fas molecule and homozygous and compound heterozygous
