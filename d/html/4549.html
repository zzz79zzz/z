This approach to CVD prevention is called primary prevention. The rationale for LDL-C reduction is based upon clinical trial evidence that lowering of LDL-C in patients across a broad range of LDL-C levels reduces a patient's risk of CVD [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>CVD in this context refers to fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, sudden cardiac death, coronary artery revascularization, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.</p><p>The decision about whether to lower LDL-C with pharmacotherapy incorporates both LDL-C level and a patient's estimated 10-year CVD risk. These factors help guide shared decision-making (ie, risk and benefit) discussions between patients and their providers.</p><p>This topic reviews the management and evidence for LDL-C lowering in patients for the purpose of primary CVD prevention. Such management and evidence in patients with established disease is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112841.html" rel="external">"Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H109404759"><span class="h1">CVD RISK ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We conduct CVD risk evaluation and discussion with our patients when they reach 20 years of age or at their first encounter with the health care system if they are older than 20 years of age. A 10-year CVD risk assessment (for patients who are 40 years of age or older) can help guide LDL-C-lowering strategies (including statin therapy) and a 10-year or lifetime CVD risk assessment can guide preventive care. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1546.html" rel="external">"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention in adults: Our approach", section on 'Our approach to ASCVD risk assessment'</a>.)</p><p>As an initial step, we measure total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, and LDL-C (often calculated, but measured directly if triglycerides are &gt;400); measurement methods are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4556.html" rel="external">"Measurement of blood lipids and lipoproteins", section on 'LDL cholesterol'</a>.) </p><p>We also determine a patient's CVD risk using risk assessment tools that estimate the patient's 10-year risk of CVD based upon their baseline LDL-C and other risk factors (eg, blood pressure, smoking). Recommendations for the use of risk calculators are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114029.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators"</a>.)</p><p>We define the following risk categories based on a person's estimated 10-year risk of CVD:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low – &lt;5 percent </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intermediate – 5 to 7.4 percent </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High – 7.5 to 19.9 percent </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Very High – ≥20 percent </p><p></p><p>Based on their estimated 10-year CVD risk, the patient and their provider(s) can decide whether a 30 percent relative risk reduction, which is a reasonable expectation for statin therapy, translates into an absolute risk reduction large enough to be worth the cost, burdens, and potential side effects of daily therapy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Irrespective of their LDL-C, patients who have other modifiable risk factors for CVD (ie, hypertension, diabetes, smoking) should be treated with aggressive risk factor reduction, including lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy, as indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7573.html" rel="external">"Overview of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3067201896"><span class="h1">LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We obtain a dietary history in patients with high LDL-C to identify specific dietary patterns that can raise LDL-C (eg, ketogenic or paleolithic diets). If the patient is on such a diet, we recommend lifestyle changes, remeasure LDL-C, and then treat with statin as necessary to further reduce LDL-C.</p><p>In all patients, a healthy diet, physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight are all important for overall health and should be pursued apart from whether they reduce LDL-C. Therefore, we recommend that all patients with high LDL-C undergo lifestyle modifications of aerobic exercise and consuming a healthy diet. For patients with a body mass index in the overweight or more adiposity category, we also suggest weight loss. Specific recommendations are provided separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1510.html" rel="external">"Exercise and fitness in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5364.html" rel="external">"Healthy diet in adults"</a>.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5372.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation"</a>.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4561.html" rel="external">"Lipid management with diet or dietary supplements", section on 'Our approach'</a>.) </p><p></p><p>In most patients (unless they are on a diet particularly high in saturated fat such as the ketogenic diet), there is reasonable evidence that dietary modification alone improves cardiovascular risk, but prior trials have not shown material decreases in cardiovascular events and mortality [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. One explanation is that some prior trials have only achieved modest decreases (eg, 3.5 and 6.6 mg/dL decreases) in LDL-C with dietary intervention aimed at lowering dietary fat [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. The Mediterranean [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], DASH, vegetarian, and vegan [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] diets have been shown to lower a person's LDL-C levels and/or 10-year cardiovascular risk [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Whereas the Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of incident CVD, this does not appear to be mediated though lower levels of LDL-C; the lower CVD risk may be mediated through lower blood pressure and improvements in dysglycemia [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Both the vegan [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] and lacto-ovo vegetarian [<a href="#rid8">8</a>] diets were associated with lower LDL-C. This is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4561.html" rel="external">"Lipid management with diet or dietary supplements", section on 'Our approach'</a>.) </p><p>Concomitant exercise and dietary modification have been shown in one study to lower LDL-C levels compared with either exercise or dietary modification alone or compared with no lifestyle changes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1510.html" rel="external">"Exercise and fitness in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p>Weight reduction has the added benefit of lowering other CVD risk factors such as blood pressure in patients with hypertension and hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes. This is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3875.html" rel="external">"Overweight, obesity, and weight reduction in hypertension"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1779.html" rel="external">"Initial management of hyperglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Weight management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1755241916"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR STATIN THERAPY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H765503147"><span class="h2">Rationale for our approach and treatment goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our recommendations for statin therapy are based upon the LDL-C level and baseline CVD risk as discussed in the sections that follow. Our goal is to reduce CVD events via LDL-C lowering. A shared decision-making approach is very important; in particular, in those at intermediate 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), patient preferences are very important. (See <a class="local">'CVD risk assessment'</a> above.)</p><p>Although lipid-lowering therapy with statins reduces <strong>relative</strong> CVD risk by approximately 30 percent regardless of baseline LDL-C, the <strong>absolute</strong> benefit of treatment will be proportional to the patient's underlying absolute risk of CVD. Thus, patients with a low baseline CVD risk will have a lower absolute benefit from treatment than a patient with high baseline CVD risk. In contrast, the adverse effects and burdens of treatment will be experienced equally by high- and low-risk patients. Thus, the risk-benefit calculation for treatment may be more favorable for patients with high baseline CVD risk and less favorable for those at low baseline CVD risk. </p><p>The following are two patient examples for which the decision to start statin therapy may differ despite both patients having the same baseline LDL-C:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A patient with lower absolute risk reduction</strong> – A 45-year-old nonsmoking normotensive white woman with an LDL-C of 140 mg/dL (3.62 mmol/L) and a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) of 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) has a 10-year risk of ASCVD events of approximately 1 percent. This could result in a 30 percent relative risk reduction likely be reduced from 1 to 0.7 percentage points if she were treated with a statin daily for 10 years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A patient with higher absolute risk reduction</strong> – A 60-year-old nonsmoking normotensive man with an LDL-C of 140 mg/dL (4.7 mmol/L) and an HDL-C of 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) has a 10-year risk of a myocardial infarction of approximately 9 percent. Use of a statin would reduce this risk to 6 percent, a 3 percentage-point reduction if he were treated with a statin daily for 10 years.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3089185093"><span class="h2">LDL-C greater than or equal to 190 mg/dL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (≥4.9 mmol/L), we do a work-up for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and, if present, treat accordingly. The work-up and management of FH are discussed separately but include intensive lipid lowering. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107507.html" rel="external">"Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111815.html" rel="external">"Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Whether or not patients have FH, we treat them with a high-dose statin therapy. As an example, we may start these patients on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8949" href="/z/d/drug information/8949.html" rel="external">atorvastatin</a> 40 (or 80) mg daily or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/z/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">rosuvastatin</a> 20 mg daily.</p><p>A CVD risk calculation is not needed prior to treatment for individuals with an LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (≥4.9 mmol/L), because we usually prescribe statin therapy for them based on the elevated LDL-C level alone. It is useful to estimate anticipated absolute benefit for the patient.</p><p>There are unique and important considerations of statin therapy in women of childbearing age. (See <a class="local">'Childbearing potential'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H800035189"><span class="h2">LDL-C lesser than 190 mg/dL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to patients with this level of LDL-C and diabetes is described below. (See <a class="local">'Diabetes'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients without diabetes who have LDL-C &lt;190 mg/dL (or &lt;4.9 mmol/L), the indication for statin therapy is guided by the patient's 10-year estimated CVD risk group (ie, low, intermediate, or high). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1011496907"><span class="h3">High (7.5 to 19.9 percent) 10-year CVD risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with an LDL-C &gt;100 mg/dL (&gt;2.59 mmol/L) and a predicted 10-year CVD risk of greater than 10 percent, we initiate statin therapy. This approach may differ in special populations. (See <a class="local">'Special populations'</a> below.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dosing</strong> – We usually choose a moderate-dose statin as initial therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117853" href="/z/d/graphic/117853.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Examples of a moderate dose of a statin are 10 to 20 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8949" href="/z/d/drug information/8949.html" rel="external">atorvastatin</a> or 5 to 10 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/z/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">rosuvastatin</a>. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, it is reasonable to start with high-intensity statin therapy for patients found to be at particularly high CVD risk, such as those with a 10-year risk of 20 percent or higher. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The reason we most commonly use moderate-intensity statin therapy is that these doses were the ones studied in a majority of clinical trials of statin therapy in primary prevention. These moderate doses of statin were shown to reduce CVD events by 30 percent [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, most trials compared a fixed dose of a single pharmacologic agent with placebo, and none of the trials in primary prevention have directly compared the effects of low-to-moderate- with high-intensity statin therapy; these comparisons were done in patients with ASCVD. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Supporting evidence</strong> – Several individual randomized trials and meta-analyses of clinical trials of statin therapy for LDL-C lowering (or total cholesterol lowering) have shown a benefit of statins in preventing the combined outcomes of CVD events and CVD mortality [<a href="#rid1">1,10-12</a>]. In these studies, the benefits of reducing CVD and mortality were shown regardless of the patient's baseline LDL-C levels (ie, there was even a benefit seen at low baseline LDL-C levels). In these studies, statin therapy was especially effective at reducing the risk of myocardial infarction (as compared with other types of CVD events). In general, there are stronger data supporting that LDL-C lowering reduces CVD and mortality in secondary compared with primary prevention.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' collaboration used pooled data from 27 trials in over 175,000 patients examining statin therapy in primary and secondary prevention patients [<a href="#rid10">10,12</a>]. This study demonstrated that statins can reduce CVD outcomes in both primary and secondary prevention patients [<a href="#rid10">10,12</a>]. Per each 1 mmol reduction in LDL-C, the following rate ratios (RRs) were observed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Major coronary event – (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.77–0.81)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Stroke – (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.89)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Coronary revascularization – (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.73-0.79)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Major vascular event – (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.77-0.81)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3442928609"><span class="h3">Intermediate (5 to 7.4 percent) 10-year CVD risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with LDL-C &lt;190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/dL) and a 10-year risk between 5 and 7.5 percent, we undertake shared decision-making with the patient, including a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and costs/risks. The reason that we do not uniformly recommend statins in such patients is because they may have a similar relative risk compared with high-risk patients, but their absolute risk is lower; therefore, the absolute benefits are smaller and vary within this group. </p><p></p><p>The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' meta-analysis of 22 trials of over 175,000 participants showed that among the 28,362 patients at intermediate CVD risk, statins reduced the relative risk of vascular events compared with the placebo group (RR 0.62 95% CI 0.60-0.79); however, the absolute risk reduction for any vascular event was more modest (absolute risk reduction 0.47 percent over five-year period given the lower observed event rates in those assigned statins versus placebo [1.10 versus 1.57 percent]) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>For patients at intermediate CVD risk, we consider additional factors that if elevated will lead us to suggest statin and lipid-lowering therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>LDL-C &gt;160 mg/dL (&gt;4.14 mmol/L)</strong> – In patients with LDL-C levels &gt;160 mg/dL and a calculated 10-year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk of 5 to 7.4 percent, we recommend statin therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presence of other risk-enhancing factors </strong> (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131708" href="/z/d/graphic/131708.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) – We agree with the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA; and others) guideline on management of blood cholesterol, which states that other risk-enhancing factors may favor initiation of statin therapy [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. It is reasonable to gather relevant history of risk-enhancing factors during the medical encounter; coronary artery calcium (CAC) and other tests may also provide useful information to help guide treatment decisions.

(See <a class="local">'Lifestyle modification'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (or ≥4.9 mmol/L)</strong> – For all such patients, we perform a work-up for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and, if present, we treat accordingly. Whether or not the patient has FH, we recommend statin treatment. We use high-dose statin therapy for such individuals. (See <a class="local">'LDL-C greater than or equal to 190 mg/dL'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>LDL-C 100 to &lt;190 mg/dL (or 2.6 to &lt;4.9 mmol/L)</strong> – In such patients, the indication for a statin therapy is guided by the patient's 10-year estimated CVD risk group. (See <a class="local">'CVD risk assessment'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>High-risk patients</strong> – For patients with a high CVD risk (7.5 to 19.9 percent 10-year risk of CVD) and LDL-C in the range of 100 to &lt;190 mg/dL, we recommend moderate-dose statin therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">Grade 1A</a>).

Our general goal LDL-C is &lt;100 mg/dL; if upon repeat screening the LDL-C is above this level, we consider intensifying the dose of statin and/or dual therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> and, if needed, add <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="127184" href="/z/d/drug information/127184.html" rel="external">bempedoic acid</a> and/or a bile acid sequestrant. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Managing side effects</strong> – Adverse effects can vary among the statins.

(See <a class="local">'Monitoring and managing side effects'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4564.html" rel="external">"Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Statin-intolerant patients</strong> – In patients in the above risk categories, if statin is not tolerated, both <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="127184" href="/z/d/drug information/127184.html" rel="external">bempedoic acid</a> are reasonable effective alternatives to statins. We prefer ezetimibe due to its lower side effect profile. Alternative therapy includes bile acid sequestrants.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Special populations</strong> – In people &gt;75 years of age, we use the same approach to guide therapy as we do for patients &lt;75 years old. (See <a class="local">'Age &gt;75 years'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Statins are stopped in pregnant patients due to higher potential risk versus benefits. Therefore, we counsel some of our female patients of childbearing age who are on statin therapy to also use contraceptive therapy.
