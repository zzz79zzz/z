This topic will focus on the approach to patients scheduled to undergo elective noncardiac surgery after PCI with stenting and who are taking dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), which is the combination of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> plus a P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9533" href="/z/d/drug information/9533.html" rel="external">prasugrel</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16784" href="/z/d/drug information/16784.html" rel="external">ticagrelor</a>. After one year, many of these patients will be taking only aspirin. Our recommendations for the perioperative use of aspirin are presented separately. </p><p>The approach to antiplatelet therapy in patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1556.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass surgery: Perioperative medical management", section on 'Preoperative aspirin'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1556.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass surgery: Perioperative medical management", section on 'Platelet P2Y12 receptor blocker therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The larger discussion of the risk of coronary artery stent thrombosis, one of the potential complications of discontinuing antiplatelet therapy prior to noncardiac surgery, is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1572.html" rel="external">"Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1582.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H350963235"><span class="h1">STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients taking dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after PCI who need to undergo major noncardiac surgery, continuation of DAPT may increase the risk of major bleeding, while discontinuation of one or both agents may increase risk of a thrombotic event. It is estimated that approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients with coronary stents undergo major noncardiac surgery within one year of stent implantation [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. Thus, the optimal management of DAPT is a common clinical issue.</p><p>Major noncardiac surgery is defined as any surgery for which the surgeon might recommend the discontinuation of DAPT due to a concern for an increase in bleeding risk. Most studies that have evaluated this issue have included patients scheduled to undergo peripheral arterial, orthopedic, abdominal, or thoracic surgery, or radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy, or cystectomy.</p><p>Perioperative thrombotic cardiac events related to DAPT discontinuation include myocardial infarction (MI), death, stent thrombosis, and the need for urgent repeat revascularization. Stent thrombosis is a proximate cause of death or MI.</p><p>The premature cessation of DAPT is the strongest predictor of stent thrombosis, especially discontinuation of both agents (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1582.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors", section on 'Risk factors'</a>). Stent thrombosis can lead to high rates of MI (50 to 70 percent) and death (10 to 40 percent), both of which are included as components of composite outcomes in the studies discussed below [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Timing, incidence, and predictors of adverse outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, the prothrombotic and proinflammatory effects of surgery may predispose the coronary circulation to thrombosis, both at the site of prior stent placement and at other sites of atherosclerotic lesions [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>]. The perioperative prothrombotic state may be mediated by increased platelet aggregation and decreased fibrinolysis [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H109480018"><span class="h1">TIMING, INCIDENCE, AND PREDICTORS OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple observational studies have evaluated the timing, incidence, and clinical predictors of adverse outcomes in stented patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. They have shown that patients who undergo major noncardiac surgery within six weeks, and particularly within two weeks, of PCI with bare-metal (BMS) or drug-eluting stents (DES) have a markedly increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events [<a href="#rid1">1,4,14-19</a>]. In general, they also show that the risk remains relatively higher until approximately six months after PCI. Findings from the following five large studies are representative.</p><p>In a case-control study of 24,313 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery (1120 stented patients), the following findings were noted [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The 30-day rates of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (death, MI, cardiac arrest, or stroke) were 3.7 and 1.5 percent in stented and unstented patients (p&lt;0.001).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The risk was related to the time from stent implantation to surgery, with a significantly elevated risk during the first year (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.59, 95% CI 1.36-4.94).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The risk was increased in patients with DES and BMS.</p><p></p><p>In a study of over 200,000 patients who underwent PCI and survived to hospital discharge, 3.5 percent were readmitted for noncardiac surgery within six months of PCI, and 41 percent of these hospitalizations were elective [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Surgery was complicated by MI in 4.7 percent of cases, and 21 percent of perioperative MIs were fatal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bleeding was found in 32 percent of patients, and all-cause mortality occurred in 4.4 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The risk of death or MI was greatest when noncardiac surgery was performed within the first month after PCI.</p><p></p><p>In a retrospective cohort study of 28,029 individuals (41,989 operations) who underwent noncardiac surgery within 24 months of stent implantation, the following was noted [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a combination of all-cause mortality, MI, and cardiac revascularization, was 4.7 percent at 30 days.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The time between stenting and surgery was associated with MACE (&lt;6 weeks, 11.6 percent; 6 weeks to &lt;6 months, 6.4 percent; 6 to 12 months, 4.2 percent; &gt;12 to 24 months, 3.5 percent). Thus, rates appeared to stabilize after six months; there was only a minor decrease in the risk of MACE between 6 and 12 months.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The factors most strongly associated with MACE were nonelective surgical admission (AOR 4.77), history of MI in the six months preceding surgery (AOR 2.63), and revised cardiac risk index  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57075" href="/z/d/graphic/57075.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) &gt;2 (AOR 2.13).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The rate of MACE was 5.1 percent for BMS and 4.3 percent for DES (p&lt;0.001). The odds of MACE for surgery between six weeks and six months were actually lower for DES, with no difference before six weeks or after six months.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a nested case-control study comparing 284 patients with confirmed MACE who had surgery &gt;6 weeks after stenting with matched pairs who were free of MACE, the likelihood of completely stopping all antiplatelet therapy for at least five days was similar (22.9 versus 25.4 percent). Of note, patients with surgery followed by death as the only MACE event were excluded. Given multiple issues with confounding, we do not believe these data are compelling enough to suggest it is safe to discontinue all antiplatelet therapy prior to surgery. (See <a class="local">'Summary and recommendations'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>In a cohort study of 8116 patients who underwent intermediate- to high-risk elective noncardiac surgery and received coronary stents within 10 years before surgery (approximately one-third were within two years), the following were noted [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For the 8116 surgical patients who underwent PCI within 10 years, the primary outcome (30-day composite of mortality, readmission for acute coronary syndrome, or repeat revascularization) occurred in 2.1 percent. This rate was comparable to that of intermediate-risk individuals who had never received PCI. Intermediate risk was defined using the revised cardiac risk index [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery", section on 'Using risk assessment tools'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When the interval between stent placement and surgery was less than 45 days, the event rates for BMS and DES were very high, at 6.7 and 20 percent, respectively. Comparing these patients operated on during this time interval with those whose surgery was at least two years after PCI, the AOR for 30-day events was 2.35 (95% CI 0.98-5.64) and 11.58 (95% CI 4.08-32.80), respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When the interval was 45 to 180 days, the event rates for BMS and DES were 2.6 and approximately 4 percent, respectively. The AOR was 1.06 (95% CI 0.58-1.92) and 1.71 (95% CI 0.73-4.01), respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When the interval was 181 to 365 days, the event rate for DES was 1.2 percent (AOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.20-2.04). Surprisingly, the event rate for BMS increased to approximately 3.5 percent during this time period, perhaps due to an increased rate of restenosis with BMS.</p><p></p><p>In a retrospective Veterans Affairs (United States) cohort study of patients treated with coronary stents, outcomes in 20,590 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery within 24 months of stent placement were compared with those in 41,180 nonsurgical patients [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Within 30 days after surgery, the surgical cohort had higher rates of the composite end point of MI and/or cardiac revascularization compared with nonsurgical patients at a similar time interval from stent placement (3.1 versus 1.9 percent; risk difference 1.3 percent, 95% CI 1.0-1.5).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The risk difference (incremental risk for surgery) was 3.5 percent immediately following stenting, 2.8 percent during the first six weeks, 2 percent between six weeks and six months, and fell to approximately 1 percent at six months, after which the risk difference seemed to remain stable [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p>There are several limitations that impact the usefulness of these studies for guiding timing of surgery and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). These include unmeasured confounding related to the indication for earlier surgery, which in itself may have selected patients at higher risk. There is also limited information as to whether DAPT was interrupted or continued. Finally, most of these data are for first-generation DES, for which risks of interruption of DAPT were higher.</p><p>The following observations regarding the timing and incidence of adverse outcomes following the premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy <strong>in patients not undergoing surgery</strong> also help inform our recommendations for managing antiplatelet therapy in patients who require noncardiac surgery:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with stable coronary artery disease, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> is recommended indefinitely to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events and discontinuation of aspirin has been estimated to be responsible for at least 15 percent of all recurrent events in this population [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4814.html" rel="external">"Perioperative medication management", section on 'Aspirin'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110006.html" rel="external">"Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most cases of stent thrombosis occur within the first 30 days after placement, irrespective of stent type. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1582.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors", section on 'Timing and incidence'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The importance of the continuation of antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period was evaluated and confirmed in a multicenter, retrospective study of 666 patients with prior coronary stenting who subsequently underwent cardiac or noncardiac (86 percent) surgery [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Of these, 371 (55.7 percent) discontinued all or part of their antiplatelet therapy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>, or both) ≥5 days before surgery. The primary efficacy end point was the 30-day incidence of MACE, a combination of cardiac death, MI, or stroke, and the primary safety end point was 30-day Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) bleeding ≥2  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77838" href="/z/d/graphic/77838.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The overall mean time from PCI to surgery was approximately 500 days, and the mean time from discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy to surgery was five days. Among those who discontinued some antiplatelet therapy, approximately 10 percent remained on aspirin. Comparing those who discontinued therapy to those who did not, the following findings were noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The rate of MACE was higher (7.5 versus 0.3 percent; p = 0.027).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After adjustment, perioperative antiplatelet discontinuation was the strongest independent predictor of MACE (odds ratio [OR] 25.8, 95% CI 3.37-198).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Continuation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> was associated with a significantly lower risk of MACE (AOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.71).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After adjustment, there was no significant difference in the rate of the safety end point.</p><p></p><p>Another study compared outcomes in 847 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery after coronary artery stenting. There was no difference in the risk of MACE between no antiplatelet treatment and monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.31-3.46). In a propensity-matched analysis of 177 patients who received DAPT and 177 monotherapy patients, the risk ratio for MACE with DAPT was 1.83 (95% CI 0.69-4.85) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. The finding of no difference in MACE is unexpected. This study does not influence our recommendations given the small number of patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H350963390"><span class="h1">BLEEDING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of a serious complication related to perioperative bleeding in patients taking one or two antiplatelet agents is not well studied, except in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). In these patients, preoperative dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) increases that rate of bleeding as well as the need for reoperation and transfusion. Given concerns for the need for reoperation, discontinuation of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker at least five days for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>, seven days for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9533" href="/z/d/drug information/9533.html" rel="external">prasugrel</a>, and three to five days for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16784" href="/z/d/drug information/16784.html" rel="external">ticagrelor</a> before surgery is recommended.

This excess bleeding leads to an increase in red blood cell transfusion but not to an increase in surgical mortality or morbidity [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>Despite the lack of definitive evidence of an increase in surgical mortality or morbidity in patients taking DAPT, many surgeons recommend discontinuing P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker before surgery. In some situations, such as neurosurgery, where the consequence of bleeding might be catastrophic, both <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and P2Y<sub>12</sub> therapy are stopped.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H350963316"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following discussion applies to patients scheduled to undergo noncardiac surgery who have undergone PCI with stenting within the prior 12 months.</p><p>In such patients, it may be necessary to stop one or both antiplatelet agents prior to our recommended minimum duration of such therapy for the general population, which is at least six months after either bare metal stenting (BMS) or drug-eluting stenting (DES). In patients at high bleeding risk, we sometimes shorten the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to one to three months. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1572.html" rel="external">"Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients", section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>Noncardiac surgery impacts our minimum duration recommendations based on whether or not the surgery can be deferred, but in general is not different for BMS and DES. Although noncardiac surgery which cannot be deferred is itself considered a criterion for high bleeding risk [<a href="#rid31">31</a>], we favor deferring truly elective surgery for six months rather than adopting shorter-term DAPT strategies after either BMS or DES. For nonemergency noncardiac surgery that cannot be deferred, we believe that durations from one to three months may be acceptable depending on the urgency of surgery. As with other high bleeding risk indications, and consistent with the majority of data above, there is not a preference for BMS over DES in these shorter DAPT strategies.</p><p>We believe that our recommendations (below) for the management of these patients who need nonemergency noncardiac surgery are based on low-quality evidence [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. These recommendations are based on the observations presented above regarding the rates of stent thrombosis in patients with premature cessation of DAPT and rates of adverse cardiovascular events found in studies of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery (see <a class="local">'Timing, incidence, and predictors of adverse outcomes'</a> above). No randomized trials comparing different times for surgery after PCI or differing antiplatelet strategies have been performed. These recommendations attempt to take into account what is known about the risk of perioperative bleeding on one or two antiplatelet agents.</p><p>The continuation of DAPT should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relative benefits and risks [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Prior to surgery, the patient, primary care physician, cardiologist, anesthesiologist, and surgeon should be involved in decision making.</p><p>An occasional patient may be scheduled for both nonemergency noncardiac surgery and PCI. It is critically important for all managing clinicians to discuss the optimal timing of each procedure. Prior to a decision for PCI and selection of PCI strategy, the timing and need for noncardiac surgery should be considered. Given the balanced risks of discontinuation of DAPT and proceeding with surgery despite DAPT, the first critical decision is the absolute need for PCI. As in other situations, a decision for appropriate PCI should be based on evidence of clinically significant ischemia and size of the territory at risk and not on angiographic findings alone. Once this decision is made, consideration should be given to timing of surgery. (See <a class="local">'Timing, incidence, and predictors of adverse outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p>In cases where PCI cannot be deferred and noncardiac surgery is urgent (&lt;30 days), balloon angioplasty may be reasonable to avoid risk of stent thrombosis or absolute requirement for DAPT, as long as a successful result is obtained. When stenting is required prior to urgent (&lt;30 days) noncardiac surgery for which discontinuation of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker is likely, many of our experts still prefer DES over BMS, extrapolating from studies showing safety of reduced DAPT duration with second-generation DES and otherwise superior outcomes of DES versus BMS among patients not undergoing noncardiac surgery (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108359.html" rel="external">"High bleeding risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'BMS versus DES'</a>). Other experts favor BMS &lt;30 days, based on reports above of higher risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) for DES within six weeks. After 30 days, most of our experts prefer DES [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Recommendations for minimum DAPT prior to noncardiac surgery according to stent type or after POBA are included in the sections below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H350963808"><span class="h2">Nonemergency noncardiac surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who have undergone previous stenting with either BMS or DES and who will need cessation of one or both antiplatelet agents, we prefer to defer planned nonemergency, nonurgent noncardiac surgery until at least six months after stent implantation. The risks of noncardiac surgery before six months are increased after both BMS and DES.</p><p>For patients whose surgery requires cessation of one or both antiplatelet agents and cannot wait six months, and where the risks of delaying surgery outweigh the benefits, our recommended <strong>minimal</strong> duration of DAPT is four to six weeks, depending on the urgency of surgery and risk of thrombotic complication [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. This is based in part on evidence suggesting that the increased risk of MI and cardiac death is highest within the first month after stent placement and no clear difference in risk between BMS and DES [<a href="#rid34">34,36</a>]. Although we prefer to wait at least six weeks when possible, in patients for whom earlier surgery is in their best interest after weighing risks and benefits, we sometimes refer patients as early as four weeks after stent placement.</p><p>The proinflammatory and prothrombotic risks of surgery may increase the baseline risk of stent thrombosis even in the presence of DAPT and regardless of stent type during this early period after stenting. We believe this risk to be higher prior to the minimum duration of DAPT recommended above, but the final decision to continue or discontinue antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period should be made only after an informed discussion among the surgeon, managing cardiologist (and other health care providers), and patient has taken place. In many cases, DAPT can be continued in the perioperative period, although for some surgeries, such as neurosurgery, posterior eye surgery, or prostatic surgery, the risk of major bleeding may be greater than the risk of stent thrombosis.</p><p>In these patients who undergo noncardiac surgery before the recommended minimum duration of DAPT, a platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker should be discontinued for as brief a period as possible. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">Aspirin</a> should be continued through the perioperative period, since the risk of stent thrombosis is further increased with the cessation of both aspirin and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> and surgery can usually be safely performed on aspirin.

Cessation of DAPT prior to the recommended duration of its use and the prothrombotic and proinflammatory state associated with surgery contribute to an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), or death. On the other hand, for some patients, such as those undergoing neurosurgical procedures, the risk of bleeding attributable to DAPT may be greater than the risk of an adverse cardiovascular event off such therapy.
