Older individuals who are physically active report better overall health, lower health care expenditures, and fewer mobility limitations than their sedentary counterparts [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. However, the prevalence of older adults performing activities for aerobic conditioning, muscle strengthening, flexibility, and balance is low, and many older adults are not aware of the recommended components of a physical activity plan.</p><p>This topic will review the benefits of physical activity in older adults and make recommendations for how to engage older adults in appropriate exercise. Several other topics in UpToDate discuss the role of exercise in the general population:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2786.html" rel="external">"The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1510.html" rel="external">"Exercise and fitness in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1433.html" rel="external">"Exercise physiology"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120020.html" rel="external">"Exercise prescription and guidance for adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107636.html" rel="external">"Exercise for adults: Terminology, patient assessment, and medical clearance"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H96786655"><span class="h1">BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN OLDER ADULTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physical activity has multiple health benefits for people of all ages  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59285" href="/d/graphic/59285.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Among older adults in particular, physical activity is associated with decreased mortality and a greater likelihood of healthy aging (survival with intact physical and cognitive functioning) [<a href="#rid5">5-10</a>]. All older adults can benefit from physical activity, and participation in any amount of physical activity, even unstructured “leisure-time” activity, will result in some health benefit [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>In older adults, the key benefits of increasing physical activity include improved strength, flexibility, mobility, and fitness, all of which can improve daily function, help to maintain independence, and reduce the risk of falls and fall-related injuries [<a href="#rid12">12-15</a>]. In a single-group intervention study of 206 healthy older adults, six months of aerobic exercise improved several elements of cognition, including executive function and verbal memory [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In addition, exercise can reduce depressive symptoms, and group exercise programs can provide social engagement.</p><p>Exercise can lessen the normal age-related declines in aerobic capacity, muscle mass, and strength and mitigate the detrimental effects these changes have on function. For example, although aerobic capacity declines at about 1 percent per year from mid-life forward, it declines at only half that rate among habitually active persons [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Similarly, while muscle loss occurs with normal aging, muscle strengthening activities can slow this loss. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14605.html" rel="external">"Normal aging", section on 'Muscle'</a>.)</p><p>It is never too late to become physically active. Even individuals who have been sedentary but initiate exercise in their 80s demonstrate a survival benefit compared with individuals who remain sedentary [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Improved fitness and strength with exercise has been noted among very frail older adults and those in nursing homes [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>].</p><p>Although epidemiologic evidence suggests that physical activity may confer a cognitive benefit, systematic reviews have found no evidence that aerobic activities provide cognitive benefit for healthy older adults [<a href="#rid21">21</a>] or improved cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5079.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia", section on 'Lifestyle and activity'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5075.html" rel="external">"Prevention of dementia", section on 'Lifestyle and activity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1457994466"><span class="h1">RISKS OF EXERCISE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no evidence that the risks of physical activity outweigh the benefits for healthy older adults. However, there may be risks associated with medical conditions which are more prevalent in older adults, such as cardiovascular, renal, or metabolic disease. The risk of falls and fall-related injuries are also greater in older adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2786.html" rel="external">"The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise", section on 'Risks of exercise'</a>.)</p><p>The Exercise Assessment and Screening for You (EASY) Tool is a six-item patient questionnaire for older adults that can be used to screen for health issues and concerns and develop a tailored physical activity program appropriate for different health circumstances and situations [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. The EASY tool offers recommended guidance and resources for individuals with joint pain or swelling, with chest pressure with activity, or at high risk for falls. The questions are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do you have pains, tightness, or pressure in your chest during physical activity (walking, climbing stairs, household chores, similar activities)?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do you currently experience dizziness or lightheadedness?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Have you ever been told that you have high blood pressure?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do you have pain, stiffness, or swelling that limits or prevents you from doing what you want or need to do?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do you fall, feel unsteady, or use an assistive device while standing or walking?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there a reason not mentioned why you would be concerned about starting an exercise program?</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H787930574"><span class="h1">THE ROLE OF THE PROVIDER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Useful provider actions include motivating patients to exercise, providing pre-exercise evaluation if needed, facilitating referral to physical therapists or other health professionals, and directing patients to online or community resources. Many patients will benefit from a combination of such provider interventions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1349833624"><span class="h2">Motivating patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Health care providers are perceived as respected sources of health information and should take an active role in promoting physical activity. Primary care clinicians should emphasize the importance of physical activity for health maintenance, ask patients if they are physically active, and advise patients to become physically active.</p><p>Initial motivational strategies should focus on personally meaningful and immediate benefits such as improved mood, better sleep, maintaining weight, and increased energy to do desired activities with family and friends. Identifying patient-specific goals for continued physical function (eg, being able to play with a grandchild, maintaining independence to walk to the grocery store, being able to continue to climb stairs in the home) can be helpful motivators for ongoing participation. Clinicians should discuss that interruptions in physical activity due to illness, caregiving, or other obligations are normal, and that patients should return to physical activity as soon as possible.</p><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has no specific recommendation for behavioral counseling for physical activity for older adults and recommends that clinicians selectively counsel patients based on risk factors, readiness for change, social support, and other health care priorities [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The evidence of the effectiveness of physical activity counseling among older adults is sparse [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>Specific strategies for assessing patient willingness to engage in exercise are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107636.html" rel="external">"Exercise for adults: Terminology, patient assessment, and medical clearance", section on 'Assessment of patient willingness to begin exercising'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2949271271"><span class="h2">Patient evaluation prior to initiating exercise</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We agree with recommendations from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) regarding patient evaluations prior to initiating physical activity [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. These recommendations are based on the individual’s current level of activity, the presence of signs and symptoms of known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease, and the desired exercise intensity. There are no special considerations based on age. The approach described in the ACSM’s guidelines is summarized in the following algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116688" href="/d/graphic/116688.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The recommendations and are also discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107636.html" rel="external">"Exercise for adults: Terminology, patient assessment, and medical clearance", section on 'Medical assessment and clearance for exercise'</a>.)</p><p>Routine testing by either electrocardiogram (ECG) or cardiac exercise testing is not indicated for asymptomatic adults who are preparing to undertake a physical activity program [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. Evaluation of symptomatic adults is always indicated, whether or not they are planning to initiate an exercise program, and is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1483.html" rel="external">"Chronic coronary syndrome: Overview of care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2416586952"><span class="h2">Resources for patients and providers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Providers may suggest that patients explore specific websites designed to encourage activity for older adults.

Examples of aerobic activities include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, water aerobics, tennis, golf without use of a cart, aerobic exercise classes, dancing, bicycle riding, and use of "cardio" equipment (eg, elliptical machines, stair climbing machines, stationary bicycles, and treadmills).</p><p>Some guidance for implementing aerobic activity for older adults is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Activities do not have to be done at one time but can be accumulated throughout the day [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals with chronic disabling conditions may not be able to achieve the minimal recommended amount of physical activity (described below) but should be as physically active as can be achieved without harm. An emphasis on reducing sedentary behavior (to sit less, move more) and adding light activity, such as short walks, may be more reasonable goals for some older adults who are unable to adopt more intensive exercise prescriptions [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p>Guidelines from the AHA and ACSM for older adults suggest a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (30 minutes on five days each week), or a minimum of 60 minutes per week of vigorous activity (20 minutes on three days each week), or some combination of the two [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>Physical activity guidelines from the United States Department of Health and Human Services suggest 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week for all adults, including older adults [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Recommendations specific to older adults include incorporation of multicomponent activities that include balance training and muscle strengthening. In addition, clinician should help older adults with chronic conditions to understand whether and how their conditions affect their ability to do regular physical activity safely. Patients whose chronic conditions limit the intensity of aerobic activity should be as physically active as their abilities allow. If sedentary, these patients should begin activities that are easy to do and then gradually build up to more moderate intensity over time. The emphasis should be on reducing the amount of sedentary time and encouraging activities that are feasible and where small successes can be achieved with gradual progression.</p><p>Definitions for moderate and vigorous aerobic activity depend on the person's baseline conditioning and are based on a perceived relative exertion of effort. In older adults, intensity of effort is best measured on a relative scale of required effort. Using a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 considered the amount of effort used while sitting and 10 considered the greatest effort possible, moderate-intensity activity would be defined as between 5 and 6 and should produce a noticeable increase in breathing and heart rate, while 7 and 8 would indicate vigorous intensity and should produce a large increase in breathing and heart rate [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. A good rule of thumb for moderate to vigorous aerobic activity is that the individual should be able to carry on a conversation during activity; if the person cannot sustain a conversation, the effort is too high.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H96786693"><span class="h2">Muscle strengthening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Activities to maintain and increase muscle strength include weight training, weightbearing calisthenics, or resistance training. Development of muscle strength and muscle endurance is progressive and requires gradual increases in resistance over time. Muscle-strengthening activities, including guidance for training in older adults, are described in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116613.html" rel="external">"Practical guidelines for implementing a strength training program for adults", section on 'Important considerations for strength training in older adult patients'</a>.)</p><p>Muscle strengthening for frail older adults is described below.

A video of tai chi is available  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef81128" href="/d/graphic/81128.html" rel="external">movie 2</a>).</p><p>In addition to tai chi, balance training may involve activities that challenge gait patterns, such as heel-to-toe walking; increase awareness of use of the center of gravity for basic movements; and augment different sensorial systems involved in balance maintenance. Examples of balance exercises are shown  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66423 graphicRef54690 graphicRef77740" href="/d/graphic/66423.html" rel="external">picture 4A-C</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef59269" href="/d/graphic/59269.html" rel="external">movie 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef68978" href="/d/graphic/68978.html" rel="external">movie 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80218" href="/d/graphic/80218.html" rel="external">movie 5</a>).</p><p>Many patients at risk for falls will likely benefit from a physical therapy referral to enhance strength and balance.

Older adults are a heterogeneous population, and many persons over 65 can participate in physical activity at the same levels as younger persons. It is therefore important for any activity plan to have individualized recommendations based on the particular abilities of the patient. Patients who are in the oldest segment of the population (over 75 years), who are frail, or who have been previously sedentary should likely initiate exercise of lighter intensity and duration than younger or more robust older adults. “Start low and go slow” is a good rule of thumb with the recognition that patients can start well below recommended guidelines and gradually build up. As little as 5 to 10 minutes a day of aerobic exercise with one or two simple functional strength-based exercises may be a good starting point for some patients.</p><p>The plan should have patient-specific recommended levels of physical activity and specific instructions for how the individual will meet each recommended type of activity. It should specify what, how, when, where, and how often each activity will be done and include a progressive and stepwise approach to increase physical activity to meet recommended goals. An example of an activity plan is shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82111" href="/d/graphic/82111.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). However, it should be noted that even exercise that does not meet recommended goals still has a mortality benefit in older adults [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>For patients of all ages, maintaining motivation to continue an exercise routine can be challenging. A successful exercise program will likely incorporate activities that the patient enjoys and finds interesting, which can be incorporated easily into the patient’s daily routine, and which offer social engagement. Older adults in particular may find that having a companion or “exercise buddy” can help to maintain motivation and make activities more enjoyable. Many adult day health programs, community senior centers, and assisted living accommodations have supervised group exercise programs.</p><p>For patients with certain chronic conditions, the development of an activity plan may need input from physical therapists/exercise physiologists or referral to specialty programs (eg, cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation). Individuals who have difficulty performing basic self-care tasks or who are at high risk of falls would likely benefit from a physical and/or occupational therapy intervention prior to transitioning to a physical activity program. (See <a class="local">'Special populations'</a> below.)</p><p>Greater detail about prescribing an exercise program can be found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120020.html" rel="external">"Exercise prescription and guidance for adults"</a>.)</p><p>In addition to an exercise plan, patients should be encouraged to limit sedentary behavior, which is an independent risk factor for adverse health outcomes, above and beyond low physical activity [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Providers can help patients strategize ways to incorporate more movement into their day, as breaking up periods of sedentary time is associated with better physical function [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4894213"><span class="h2">Special populations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with specific health conditions may require special instruction or consideration. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)'s initiative, Exercise is Medicine, has prepared an <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.exerciseismedicine.org%2Fassets%2Fpage_documents%2FYPH_All.pdf&amp;token=Yjz7eOReGpFqWG1YnupQFkno43yc%2BvWd9kUsBa16pnfbKyWg7N6PfItunCc%2FHILv57EOFxaTmAq7kwOtjxlmiPBmbLZtjYwyvBoHdDABsE4%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=16524" target="_blank">online library</a> of patient handouts with specific exercise prescriptions for a wide variety of specific health problems (eg, Alzheimer disease, atrial fibrillation, anxiety, peripheral arterial disease). Some specific populations are discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H96786743"><span class="h3">Functionally limited or frail</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although functionally limited or frail individuals may not be able to meet minimum recommended activity levels, even modest activity and muscle strengthening can impact the progression of functional limitations [<a href="#rid12">12,20</a>]. While all elements of the physical activity recommendations should be incorporated into an activity plan, the adage "start low and go slow" should be kept in mind. It is acceptable to begin a baseline physical activity recommendation of walking for five minutes twice a day as a starting point. The key is to identify a set of activities the patient feels capable of doing, thus incorporating the concept of self-efficacy into the physical activity recommendation [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Functional exercises that focus on particular skills or daily tasks (eg, getting up from a chair, climbing stairs) are likely to be particularly useful. Physical and occupational therapy consults may be needed.</p><p>For frail adults, sample exercises for strengthening are shown in the following pictures and movies  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53922 graphicRef58676 graphicRef72489 graphicRef61047 graphicRef51521 graphicRef79809 graphicRef74052 graphicRef72859" href="/d/graphic/53922.html" rel="external">picture 5A-H</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73796" href="/d/graphic/73796.html" rel="external">movie 6</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef58435" href="/d/graphic/58435.html" rel="external">movie 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef72241" href="/d/graphic/72241.html" rel="external">movie 8</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51229" href="/d/graphic/51229.html" rel="external">movie 9</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef50656" href="/d/graphic/50656.html" rel="external">movie 10</a>).</p><p>Some guidance for muscle strengthening, including frail adults, is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The initial weight should be one that an individual can lift about eight times before experiencing muscle fatigue. This weight should be maintained until the person can easily lift the weight 10 to 15 times, then increased to a weight that again they can only lift eight times, continuing with this gradual approach to progression. If a weight cannot be lifted eight times, it is too heavy and should be decreased. Resistance bands, color coded for degree of difficulty, can be used instead of weights following similar guidance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Breathing should be normal while lifting weights, exhaling as the weight is lifted or as the elastic band is pulled.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Movements should be slow through a repetition: two to three seconds to lift, hold for one second, and three to four seconds to return to the starting position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Joints should not be locked in a tightened position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients should be advised that muscle soreness is normal at first and should subside in a few weeks. For individuals with painful chronic conditions, muscle-strengthening activities should not exacerbate pain. More gradual incremental strengthening is advised for patients with chronic pain to maximize tolerance and their long-term commitment to a strengthening program.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Muscle strengthening can be performed at home, using standard exercise equipment, or if needed, homemade weights such as soup cans, water bottles, or empty milk jugs filled with water or sand.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4894227"><span class="h3">Arthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with osteoarthritis, aerobic activities should be selected, if possible, that minimize joint stress (eg, swimming, water aerobics, stationary cycling). Some local fitness or city recreation facilities have access to warm water aquatic programs or pool-based arthritis classes that are non-weightbearing. Any water-based, low weightbearing activities, eg, lap swimming, water walking, or water aerobics, are beneficial.</p><p>If non-joint-bearing options are not available, the focus should be on gradual initiation and progression of aerobic activities that can be tolerated. Strengthening activities should start at a relatively low intensity and gradually progress as pain tolerates. Maintaining/developing flexibility and full range of motion in affected joints is a major goal. Patients should be advised that although they may experience discomfort during or following physical activity, activity is viewed as beneficial for joint health. Icing the affected area for 10 minutes following physical activity will provide symptom relief and can prevent inflammation. Activity should be moderated if pain persists. Consideration should be given to timing physical activities to the optimal timing of prescribed pain medications [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Detailed information on exercise in patients with knee osteoarthritis is provided elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111177.html" rel="external">"Management of knee osteoarthritis", section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p>Rheumatoid arthritis differs from osteoarthritis in that it is an autoimmune disease with chronic inflammation of the synovial fluids surrounding the joints. There is insufficient research to determine whether exercise activity should be avoided during acute flares. However, exercise remains important in maintain function [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. A more detailed discussion of exercise in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7498.html" rel="external">"Nonpharmacologic therapies for patients with rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Physical activity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4894234"><span class="h3">Cognitive impairment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The standard recommendations for physical activity apply to individuals with cognitive impairment. In many instances, it may be useful to have a partner or caregiver monitor and provide ongoing support for activities performed. This may be necessary for teaching the physical activity and for safety reasons or to help patients keep track of their exercise efforts. For example, activity logs to track physical activities may present difficulties for individuals with cognitive impairment and may become a barrier to exercise compliance, rather than a facilitating tool as intended. In addition, patients with cognitive impairment may require assistance with equipment that uses electronic display boards.</p><p>Although there is no evidence that aerobic activities provide improve cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia, exercise may improve the ability of patients with dementia to perform activities of daily living [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].
