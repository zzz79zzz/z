         Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), which can result in right ventricular (RV) failure. In children, PH is most commonly associated with underlying cardiac or lung disease (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia). PH may also be idiopathic or familial. Other causes of PH are rare in childhood  (

         ). PH can be associated with considerable risk of morbidity and mortality. Management of children with PH requires a multidisciplinary team with experience and expertise in this area.

         The diagnostic evaluation of PH in pediatric patients should be carried out by or in close collaboration with practitioners with considerable experience and expertise in this area. Early referral is critical since treatment for many types of PH is less effective if provided at a late stage of the disease.

          Pulmonary hypertension (PH)
         </strong>
         – PH refers to elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP; mean PAP &gt;20 mmHg). PH can be due to a primary elevation of pressure in the pulmonary arterial system alone, increased blood flow through the pulmonary circulation (eg, systemic-to-pulmonary shunting lesions), or elevation of pressure in the pulmonary veins.

         – PVR is a measurement of the resistance in the pulmonary circulation. It provides an estimation of whether the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed is reduced (elevated PVR indicates reduced cross-section area). PVR is the ratio of the TPG to pulmonary blood flow (Qp): PVR = TPG/Qp (

         </span>
         For children and infants &gt;3 months old, the definition of PH is the same as in adults: mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) &gt;20 mmHg at sea level [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. This definition is based on the 2018 6
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Earlier guidelines used a slightly higher cutoff of ≥25 mmHg [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. However, the pressure cutoff for assigning the diagnosis of PH is somewhat arbitrary and the concept of PH as being a disease (implying the need for therapy) is useful only when it acquires nuance.

         <strong>
          Neonates
         </strong>
         – PVR is high in utero and falls rapidly after birth. PAP normally reaches adult levels during the first few weeks of life. However, even if the PAP has fallen at the usual rate, the neonatal lung reacts to vasoconstrictive stimuli (eg, alveolar hypoxia) much more vigorously than does the mature lung, so stressors provoke a greater response than later in life. In addition, occasionally the neonatal transition to a low-resistance pulmonary circulation is delayed, and despite otherwise healthy lungs, the mean PAP remains elevated at ≥20 mmHg (sometimes even suprasystemic). These asymptomatic neonates require close follow-up; however, in most cases, the PH resolves over the first one to three months and they are generally not considered to have pathologic PH despite elevated PAP levels.

         <strong>
          Cardiac shunting lesions or left heart disease
         </strong>
         – Patients with systemic-to-pulmonary cardiac shunting lesions may have PH due to increased pulmonary blood flow (Qp) rather than pulmonary vascular disease, per se. Similarly, left heart disease that is associated with elevated left atrial pressure (Lap; eg, left ventricular failure, cardiomyopathy, mitral or aortic valve stenosis or other left ventricular obstructive lesions) may cause PH due to pressure "back-up" (ie, pulmonary venous hypertension). Patients in these categories may actually have healthy pulmonary vessels or reversible pulmonary vascular abnormalities. Defining PH solely on the basis of only the PAP fails to take into account the amount of Qp or pulmonary venous pressure as a determinant of PAP. By contrast, the PVR takes these variables into consideration (PVR = [mean PAP – mean LAp]/Qp). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Terminology'
         </a>

         <strong>
          RV function
         </strong>
         – The RV is the primary end organ of interest in PH. Elevated PAP is mostly relevant insofar as it impacts RV systolic and diastolic function (ie, its capacity to generate blood flow) at rest and with exercise. A mean PAP considerably exceeding 20 mmHg may be well tolerated in a patient whose RV is well adapted to high pressure. Conversely, a seemingly minor increase in PVR may have critical impact on RV function in certain patients, even with mean PAP levels that are &lt;20 mmHg. For patients with single-ventricle physiology (eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome) and cavopulmonary palliation (eg, Fontan palliation), there is no pump to drive blood across the pulmonary circulation and a relatively minor increase in PVR can severely compromise cardiac output. (See

         <strong>
          Conditions at time of measurement
         </strong>
         – Measurements of PAP in the echocardiography or cardiac catheterization laboratory may not reflect the PAP at other times and under different conditions. For example, patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia may have little elevation of PAP when healthy but a marked and clinically important increase in the setting of viral respiratory infection. In addition, patients with PH have relatively noncompliant pulmonary vascular beds, so a modestly elevated PAP at rest (with no appreciable impact on the patient's resting physiology) can increase substantially with exercise.

         As previously noted, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) provides an estimation of whether the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed is reduced (elevated PVR indicates reduced cross-section area). Reduced cross-sectional area is due to reduced luminal diameter of small pulmonary vessels and/or a decreased number of these vessels. In most types of PH, small pulmonary arteries are most affected, although small or large pulmonary veins may be the primary site of obstruction in some forms of PH [

          Anatomic changes
         </strong>
         – Pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease (PHVD; previously referred to as pulmonary vascular obstructive disease) refers to pathologic remodeling of small vessels and narrowing of the vascular lumen through medial hypertrophy, proliferation of "neointimal cells" (whose origin is unclear [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]), and deposition of connective tissue in pulmonary arteries. The number of small pulmonary arteries may also be reduced by virtue of complete occlusion of the lumen by neointimal cells or by in situ thrombi [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. A paucity of small pulmonary arteries can also result from the failure of such vessels to develop (eg, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, or, possibly, high pressure/high flow cardiac defects) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Medial hypertrophy can resolve when the inciting stimulus is removed (eg, repair of a large ventricular septal defect in the first year of life). In infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease usually gradually improves with growth of new pulmonary arterioles as a part of normal lung growth during the first few years of life. By contrast, pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease due to intimal proliferation and connective tissue deposition has much less potential to resolve with therapy.

          Cellular and molecular mechanisms

         – A variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms have been invoked to explain this disorder: abnormalities of endothelium, imbalance of endogenous vasoconstrictors and vasodilators, clonal expansion of abnormal pulmonary vascular cells, epigenetic mechanisms, abnormal expression of proteases, endogenous growth factors and/or their receptors, and other molecules. Abnormal intracellular molecules involved with smooth muscle contraction/relaxation (eg, cyclic guanosine monophosphate) and cellular growth may also play a role. The precise role of these and other factors in causing pulmonary vascular remodeling is yet to be defined [

         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) updated clinical classification of PH includes five disease categories based upon etiology and mechanism  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348" href="/z/d/graphic/66348.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. There is considerable overlap in some these disease categories; many aspects of PH physiology span across all categories, and some varieties of PH in one category closely resemble those in other categories. In addition, some of the groupings are quite broad and lack a consistent clinical or biologic theme (groups 1 and 5), while others are fairly tightly-themed (groups 2, 3, and 4).
        </p>
        <p>
         It has long been appreciated that the WSPH classification is insufficient for pediatric PH, which often is related to fetal and developmental abnormalities and can have very different clinical characteristics from that seen in older patients [
         <a href="#rid13">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite its limitations, the WSPH classification does correspond to the categories of patients included in targeted PH pharmacologic therapy trials (nearly all of which have included only adult patients), which inform treatment decisions. Most large drug trials have investigated group 1 PH (ie, pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH], especially idiopathic PAH [including heritable PAH] and PAH associated with collagen vascular disease or congenital heart disease). By contrast, there are very few large trials involving patients with group 2 to 4 PH. (See

         Only a small minority of patients with congenital heart disease develop clinically significant PH. The two broad categories of congenital heart disease that can cause PH include shunting lesions and left heart disease associated with elevated left atrial pressure (LAp).

         <strong>
          Systemic-to-pulmonary shunting
         </strong>
         – By definition, PH occurs in any defect that by virtue of its size and location exposes the pulmonary circulation to systemic-level arterial pressure. Large ventricular septal defects are the most common example of this. In infants with such lesions, the right ventricle (RV) is usually well adapted to high pressure and, thus, the elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), per se, is of little consequence in the short term, though they may have symptoms of congestive heart failure. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5787.html" rel="external">
          "Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         From the point of view of the pulmonary circulation, the greater significance of unrepaired high-pressure shunting defects is that, during the first year or two, the patient may develop high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease, which can be irreversible and progressive [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. PH can persist and increase in patients after closure of intracardiac shunts, especially when closed late. If PVR increases to systemic or greater levels, unrepaired defects that are typically acyanotic (eg, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect) may become cyanotic by virtue of shunt reversal. This is referred to as Eisenmenger syndrome. In addition to cyanosis, potential complications of Eisenmenger syndrome include stroke, renal insufficiency, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, polycythemia, and thrombocytopenia [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Eisenmenger syndrome is discussed in greater detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105507.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Timely repair of high-pressure shunting defects is therefore of great importance. By contrast, atrial septal defects are associated with low-pressure shunting (at least initially) and they very infrequently lead to PH during childhood; when PH develops, it typically occurs only after the first two decades of life [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Unlike ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus, the timing of atrial septal defect repair (when indicated) is usually after the first year of life. (See

          Left heart disease

         – Conditions that increase LAp (eg, mitral valve disease, noncompliance of the left ventricle), can also cause PH; however, these are not common in childhood [

          39
         </a>

          Pulmonary vein stenosis

         – Pulmonary vein stenosis is an uncommon cause of PH. It is a rare disease that may be idiopathic or may be associated with total or partial anomalous pulmonary venous return or prematurity [

         ]. Maldevelopment of and acquired injury to pulmonary blood vessels underlies PH in this setting, and the vascular bed is especially prone to vasoconstriction with viral infection or other stresses [

          11
         </a>
         ]. Most patients with PH due to bronchopulmonary dysplasia are only mildly to moderately affected, especially when healthy, and PAP generally falls with growth and development [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,43

         ]. However, when PH is severe and persistent in this patient population, it is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>

Heritable PH includes patients with a known PH genetic mutation and those with a family history of PH. Idiopathic PH refers to patients with PH in whom no underlying cause has been identified. Heritable PH is likely underdiagnosed, and some patients with idiopathic PH may actually have genetic causes of their disease. [

         PH is associated with a large number of chromosomal abnormalities, syndromes, and complex, multiorgan diseases. In data from pediatric PH registries, 12 to 17 percent of children had underlying chromosomal or undefined syndromes [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32,36,37
         </a>
         ]. Down syndrome is the most common disorder in this category; others include DiGeorge, Pierre-Robin, and Noonan syndromes [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,32,36,45
         </a>
         ]. However, the number of conditions associated with PH is growing and too numerous to comprehensively list here. In patients with these conditions, PH may develop as a result of cardiac or pulmonary disease associated with the syndrome (eg, airway abnormalities, chronic aspiration, disordered breathing, restrictive lung disease from neuromuscular weakness or scoliosis) or may be due to genetic factors resulting from chromosomal abnormalities. PH is likely multifactorial in many cases.

         Mildly or even moderately elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) may cause no or only subtle symptoms, especially in the sedentary. Symptoms may be more notable if there is a supervening infection or other stressor. In one study, the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was approximately 17 months [
         <a href="#rid36">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The degree of symptoms depends in large part on how well the RV adapts to the increased pressure load. Some patients (especially those with PH since birth) develop RV hypertrophy and have preserved RV contractile function. Such individuals may be relatively asymptomatic for many years despite very high PAP. In other patients with similarly elevated PAP, the RV adapts poorly, and reduced systolic and diastolic function limit cardiac output at exercise and even rest.
        </p>
        <p>
         The physical examination may be unremarkable, especially with only modestly increased PAP. With RV dilation, there may be a left parasternal heave. The second heart sound (S2) may be narrowly split (or single), with an increased pulmonic component  (

          movie 1
         </a>
         ), but, even with markedly elevated PAP, this may escape detection. A systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation or diastolic murmur of pulmonary regurgitation may be present with severely elevated RV pressure. Hepatomegaly and peripheral edema generally indicate RV dysfunction and may not be present even with severe PH.

          PH associated with lung disease
         </strong>
         — In patients with PH due to underlying lung disease, the clinical presentation is largely determined by the primary disease, and the impact of PH may be difficult to assess. Clinically significant elevations in RV pressure can result in RV systolic dysfunction (usually demonstrated by echocardiography) with consequent poor systemic perfusion and/or a tendency to retain fluid. On the other hand, difficulty with gas exchange alone does not necessarily imply a significant role for PH.

         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Cardiac catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosis of PH as it affords the most accurate measure of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and provides additional valuable information (eg, estimates of cardiac output, atrial pressures, response to pulmonary vasodilators); however, this invasive test is not always necessary during the initial evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional testing is performed to evaluate functional capacity, better evaluate right ventricle (RV) size and function (if not adequately assessed with echocardiography), and identify the underlying etiology of PH if a cause is not identified in the initial evaluation. The diagnostic evaluation is guided by the clinical findings. A thorough cardiopulmonary assessment is required in all patients. For patients without a known predisposing condition (ie, idiopathic PH), a comprehensive evaluation is required.

         Trending BNP levels can be a useful component of globally assessing the patient's clinical course and monitoring response to treatment. BNP and N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) are biomarkers that are commonly used to assess severity and monitor response to therapy in children and adults with heart failure. BNP is elevated in patients with PH and may have prognostic value; however, data in pediatric patients are limited [

         Dilation of the main and proximal branch pulmonary arteries is a common finding in patients with severe PH. Cardiomegaly suggests RV dysfunction and dilation. Pulmonary edema may be present with heart failure (even if the RV is the failing chamber) but also raises the possibility of pulmonary venous obstruction. If present, pulmonary parenchymal disease is often apparent on the chest radiograph; this finding should prompt consideration of chest computed tomography (CT). (See

         Estimation of RV pressure – The most accurate echocardiographic method for measuring RV (and hence pulmonary artery) systolic pressure is to determine the velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet. However, not all patients have appreciable tricuspid regurgitant and, even for those who do, careful interrogation of the jet is required. Lacking an adequate tricuspid regurgitant jet, the position of the interventricular septum at end systole may be helpful. The septal position provides only a rough estimate of RV systolic pressure, and accurate quantification is not possible without a tricuspid regurgitant jet [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. High RV pressure is also suggested if right-to-left shunting is seen across communications that normally shunt left-to-right (eg, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect). (See

         Cardiac catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosis of PH; however, it is not always necessary during the initial evaluation. Because it is an invasive procedure that carries risks, cardiac catheterization is sometimes deferred until initiation of targeted PH therapy is under consideration. (See

         <a href="#rid1">
          1

          Procedural risks
         </strong>
         – The main disadvantages of cardiac catheterization are the invasive nature of the procedure, its inherent risks, and the need for general anesthesia or sedation. Cardiac catheterizations in children with PH should be performed in centers with experience and expertise in management of PH patients. In this setting, the risks associated with the procedure are low, except for the most compromised patients [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61,62
         </a>
         ]. The risk of cardiac arrest is 0.8 to 2 percent, and the risk of pulmonary hypertensive crisis is approximately 5 percent [

          Cardiac MRI
         </strong>
         – Cardiac MRI more accurately quantifies RV size and ejection fraction than does echocardiography. Some cardiac structural abnormalities (eg, abnormally connected pulmonary veins) are also better defined on MRI than on echocardiography. Also, pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output can be measured using this modality. The need for sedation or even general anesthesia limits the use of this modality in younger children.

         – For children with clinical and/or radiographic findings suggestive of parenchymal lung disease, chest CT with contrast can be helpful in the diagnostic evaluation. Chest CT with contrast can also reveal large and small airways disease, pulmonary emboli, and pulmonary vein stenosis. If pulmonary embolus is suspected, formal CT pulmonary angiography should be performed (rather than a simple contrast study). Chest CT can also suggest (but not confirm) the diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease [

         – Nuclear lung scintigraphy or pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scanning is routinely used in many centers for initial evaluation of patients with PH. The primary reason for this testing is to detect evidence of chronic pulmonary thromboemboli, although perfusion abnormalities are also seen with pulmonary vein stenosis and multiple large pulmonary arterial stenoses. Ventilation/perfusion scan may be performed if the suspected etiology for PH is multiple pulmonary emboli. Since this is an exceedingly uncommon cause of PH in pediatric patients, the ventilation/perfusion scan is a low-yield test in the pediatric population. It has a high sensitivity but low specificity due to variable perfusion in hypertensive lungs and/or pulmonary vein obstruction. CT angiography is the preferred imaging modality for detecting acute pulmonary thromboembolism.

Definitive diagnosis of PH requires cardiac catheterization; however, because this test is invasive, it is sometimes deferred until initiation of targeted PH therapy is under consideration.

         The differential diagnosis of PH is broad, given the variable presenting signs and symptoms. Other causes of undue dyspnea with exertion (which is the most common presenting symptom in older children with PH) include structural heart disease, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, pericarditis, endocarditis, endocrine disorders (eg, hypothyroidism), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, lung disease (eg, asthma), malignancy, renal disease, liver disease, viral syndrome, anemia, and psychiatric disorders (eg, depression, anxiety). The clinical history and physical examination can distinguish some of these conditions from PH; however, a formal cardiac evaluation including echocardiography is ultimately required to make the diagnosis.

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), which may result in right ventricular (RV) failure. For children and infants &gt;3 months old, the definition of PH is the same as in adults: mean PAP &gt;20 mmHg at sea level. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definition'
         </a>
         above.)

          Causes and classification
         </strong>
         – Causes of PH are summarized in the table  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). In children, PH is usually associated with underlying cardiac or lung disease (eg, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia). PH may also be idiopathic or familial. Other causes of PH are rare in childhood. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Common types of pulmonary hypertension in children'
         </a>
         above.)

         PH is classified according to etiology/mechanism  (

         – The diagnostic evaluation of PH in pediatric patients should be carried out by or in close collaboration with practitioners with considerable experience and expertise in this area.

          Cardiac catheterization
         </strong>
         – Cardiac catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosis of PH as it affords the most accurate measure of PAP and provides additional valuable information; however, it is not always necessary during the initial evaluation. Because it is an invasive procedure that carries risks, cardiac catheterization is sometimes deferred until initiation of targeted PH therapy is under consideration. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Cardiac catheterization'

         <strong>
          Additional testing
         </strong>
         – Additional testing is performed to evaluate functional capacity, better evaluate RV size and function (if not adequately assessed with echocardiography), and identify the underlying etiology of PH if a cause is not identified in the initial evaluation. The diagnostic evaluation is guided by the clinical findings. A thorough cardiopulmonary assessment is required in all patients. For patients without a known predisposing condition, a comprehensive evaluation is required. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Additional testing'

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – A presumptive diagnosis of PH can be established with echocardiography showing quantitatively or qualitatively elevated RV pressure. Definitive diagnosis of PH requires cardiac catheterization; mean PAP &gt;20 mmHg confirms the diagnosis. (See
