         Megaureter is defined as a ureter that exceeds the upper limits of normal size. In children, any ureter greater than 7 mm in diameter is considered a megaureter based on measurements in fetuses greater than 30 weeks gestation and children &lt;12 years [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Primary megaureter is a result of a functional or anatomical abnormality involving the ureterovesical junction  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59252" href="/z/d/graphic/59252.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ), whereas secondary megaureter results from abnormalities that involve the bladder or urethra (eg, myelomeningocele/neurogenic bladder, prune-belly syndrome, and posterior urethral valves [PUV]).

         Primary megaureter is classified according to the presence or absence of reflux and obstruction, which are key characteristics for management decisions. (See

         Primary megaureter is the second most common cause of hydronephrosis in the newborn (after ureteropelvic obstruction), accounting for approximately 20 percent of cases. The incidence of primary megaureter is estimated as 0.36 per 1000 live births [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Boys are affected more commonly than girls, and lesions are found more frequently on the left than on the right side [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Megaureter is bilateral in approximately 30 to 40 percent of cases  (

         The pathogenesis of primary megaureter is uncertain. It appears to be most commonly due to an abnormality or delay in the development of the muscle in the distal ureter adjacent to the ureterovesical junction at 20 weeks gestation [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. This results in the formation of an aperistaltic segment  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef121867" href="/z/d/graphic/121867.html" rel="external">
          movie 1
         </a>
         ), which leads to functional obstruction. Much rarer causes of megaureter include congenital ureteral strictures or ureteral valves.
        </p>
        <p>
         The refluxing megaureter also has an abnormal ureterovesical tunnel that allows urine to reflux up the ureter. The reflux primarily occurs during voiding when the bladder pressure is highest but also may occur during bladder filling. (See

         Primary megaureter usually is detected on antenatal ultrasonography. The ultrasound demonstrates a dilated ureter (&gt;7 mm in diameter), often with associated hydronephrosis [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>

         When the condition is not detected antenatally, children can present at any age after the newborn period with urinary tract infection, hematuria, abdominal pain and/or mass, or uremia. For some patients, the finding may be detected incidentally during evaluation of other conditions. Symptomatic presentation is typically due to an obstructed ureter.

         Primary megaureter due to ureterovesical junction obstruction has a good prognosis. These fetuses can be followed expectantly in the prenatal period, without intervention or early delivery. Expectant routine prenatal management is recommended as long as the amniotic fluid volume remains normal.

         The antenatal management of hydronephrosis and the management of pregnancies with severe oligohydramnios are discussed in detail separately. (See

         Ultrasonography confirms the diagnosis of megaureter. If an antenatal diagnosis is made, a postnatal ultrasound is obtained to confirm the presence of megaureter  (

         ). In our practice, we perform postnatal ultrasonography within the first few weeks of life for infants with unilateral megaureter and within 24 to 72 hours for those with signs of possible lower urinary tract obstruction (eg, posterior urethral valves [PUV]) on prenatal ultrasound, including bilateral hydronephrosis, bilateral ureteral dilation and/or dilated bladder, or thickened bladder wall  (

          algorithm 1

         ). For patients with any of these findings, we start continuous prophylactic antibiotics until a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is obtained to evaluate for PUV and/or significant reflux.

          Megaureter
         </strong>
         – Megaureter is defined as ureter diameter &gt;7 mm in an individual between &gt;30 weeks gestation and 12 years of age. In many cases of primary megaureter, the distal ureter is more dilated more than the proximal ureter or renal collecting system. The ureter may be tortuous.

          Hydronephrosis
         </strong>
         – Megaureter usually presents as hydroureteronephrosis (dilation of both the renal pelvis and ureter). Less frequently, megaureter can occur without hydronephrosis or dilation of the upper collecting system. Ultrasound examination should be performed after the first two days after birth (preferably at one week of age or later) because hydronephrosis may not be detected, due to physiologic volume depletion and relative oliguria. The severity of hydronephrosis can be graded by the Society for Fetal Urology system  (

          Normal bladder size
         </strong>
         – A normal bladder size distinguishes primary megaureter from secondary megaureter (due to lower urinary tract obstruction, eg, neurogenic bladder, PUV, or prune-belly syndrome). Ultrasound findings suggesting lower urinary tract obstruction include a dilated bladder and/or increased thickness and trabeculation of the bladder wall.

          VCUG
         </strong>
         – A VCUG must be performed to detect reflux and any evidence of urethral obstruction (eg, PUV in males); this is particularly important for infants with bilateral megaureters. If severe reflux is present and the ureter drains poorly, the megaureter is likely a refluxing, obstructed type.

          Diuretic renography
         </strong>
         – If no reflux is detected on VCUG and the hydronephrosis is severe (Society for Fetal Urology grade 4 or urinary tract dilation category 3), diuretic renography is used to detect relative renal function in each kidney and the presence of urinary tract obstruction  (

         Diuretic renography consists of a renal scan and administration of a diuretic. In our institution, we use 99mTc-mercaptotriglycylglycine (MAG-3 or MAG3) as a radiotracer and

         as the diuretic (MAG3 furosemide renogram). This study measures the drainage time from the renal pelvis (referred to as washout) and assesses each individual kidney's relative renal function. For patients with a primary megaureter, a delayed washout curve is difficult to interpret (in contrast with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), in which delayed washout is a more reliable indicator of obstruction). For the diuretic renogram to be most reliable, regions of interest over the kidney, ureter, and a combination of the two to assess drainage should be assessed. (See

         Surgical treatment of the obstructed megaureter consists of excision of the distal obstructive segment, tapering of the dilated ureter, and reimplantation into the bladder using a reflux prevention technique  (

          movie 1
         </a>
         ). In some cases, a temporary cutaneous ureterostomy is needed to allow for the caliber of the ureter to decrease to a more normal size. An alternative approach to reconstruction in the small baby is creation of a simple, refluxing ureteral reimplantation to avoid upper tract diversion [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The success rate of these procedures is determined by decreased ureteral and renal dilation on the ultrasound [

         ].

         Several case series suggest that high-pressure balloon dilation or prolonged ureteral stenting may be a promising approach to treat primary obstructive megaureter in neonates or infants, in whom surgical reconstruction is more challenging [

          14-17

         – Surgical correction should be performed in patients with obstructive lesions, which are identified by increasing hydroureteronephrosis and/or the presence of a prolonged diuretic renographic drainage pattern. Surgical correction of obstructed megaureters improves renal drainage, as detected by a reduction in hydroureteronephrosis on ultrasound [

In this cohort, multivariate analysis showed that perinatal presentation and a nonobstructive pattern on diuretic renography were associated with spontaneous resolution. In contrast, the grade of hydronephrosis was not predictive of spontaneous resolution.

         We suggest surgical correction for most children with nonrefluxing megaureter who present with signs or symptoms suggesting obstruction. Obstruction may be detected on diuretic renography or diagnosed clinically based on suggestive symptoms (flank pain) or other concerning findings (eg, recurrent urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, calculi, hematuria, or declining kidney function). Symptoms almost always resolve after surgical correction, and the long-term outcome for kidney function is excellent [

         Primary megaureter is defined as a ureter that is &gt;7 mm in diameter and is caused by a functional or anatomical abnormality that involves the ureterovesical junction. It is classified based on the presence of reflux or obstruction into four categories (nonrefluxing, nonobstructed; nonrefluxing, obstructed; refluxing, nonobstructed; and refluxing obstructed). (See

         Secondary megaureter results from lower urinary tract obstruction (bladder or urethra). Causes of secondary megaureter (eg, posterior urethral valves [PUV], myelomeningocele/neurogenic bladder, prune-belly syndrome) are discussed separately. (See

          Postnatal evaluation
         </strong>
         – Infants with megaureter identified on prenatal ultrasound should be reevaluated after birth. For those with unilateral megaureter, the postnatal ultrasound should be performed within the first few weeks of life. For those with any signs of lower urinary tract obstruction (bilateral involvement, dilated bladder, or thickened bladder wall), the postnatal ultrasound should be performed within 24 to 72 hours after birth and antibiotic prophylaxis should be initiated pending further evaluation  (

          Further evaluation
