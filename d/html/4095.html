         Systemic allergic reactions to the venom of insects in the order Hymenoptera (which includes bees, yellow jackets, wasps, and hornets) can be life-threatening. Accurate diagnosis of venom allergy is important because patients with venom allergy are candidates for venom immunotherapy, a treatment which can dramatically reduce the risk of recurrent severe reactions [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The diagnosis of Hymenoptera allergy (not including stinging ants), which is based upon the clinical history and supported by testing for the presence of venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, will be reviewed here. The indications and protocols for venom immunotherapy are presented separately.

         Reactions to Hymenoptera stings are broadly divided into local and systemic reactions. These reactions are described briefly here and discussed in more detail separately. (See

         A local reaction is defined as any reaction in which the signs and symptoms are confined to tissues contiguous with the sting site. Most people develop only minor local reactions to Hymenoptera stings, which are not considered a form of allergic reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Less commonly, patients may develop large local reactions (LLRs). A LLR consists of painful swelling and erythema limited to skin and subcutaneous tissues

          contiguous with the sting site
         </strong>
         . The affected area is typically &gt;10 cm and may be much larger. The reaction usually peaks at 24 to 48 hours and may last 3 to 10 days [

         Hymenoptera stings are acutely painful, and patients are usually aware that a sting has occurred, although they may not have visualized the insect clearly. Witnesses who know the patient's normal appearance and behavior may have noticed signs and symptoms during anaphylaxis that the patient does not recall, including changes in voice (laryngeal angioedema), fluctuating or reduced level of consciousness, inability to communicate clearly, flushing, or visible angioedema.
        </p>
        <p>
         A comprehensive history should review the patient's past stings and risk for future stings (ie, occupation and hobbies) and determine whether the patient's reaction was local or systemic. The following questions need to be addressed:

         Were there any previous stings, and if so, did those result in normal, large local, or systemic symptoms? A large local reaction (LLR) consists of an area of redness and swelling at the site of the sting (typically approximately 10 cm in diameter) that enlarges over 48 hours and gradually resolves over 5 to 10 days.

         Patients with systemic reactions should be evaluated further with testing for venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). Testing of patients with local reactions is not usually necessary, although there are exceptions. (See

         The evaluation and diagnosis of venom allergy can be challenging. Venom skin testing, which should only be performed by clinicians trained in the technique, is preferred over IgE immunoassays as an initial testing modality in most cases. In addition, patients with demonstrable IgE-mediated venom allergy should be offered venom immunotherapy, which is highly effective and significantly reduces the patient's chance of experiencing systemic reactions to future stings. For these reasons, any patient with a possible systemic reaction to a Hymenoptera sting should be referred to an allergy specialist for evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment. Patients with other types of sting reactions (eg, bothersome large local reactions [LLRs] or cutaneous systemic reactions) may also benefit from referral.

         the history of a systemic reaction to a previous sting, is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of a venom allergy or predict that the patient is at elevated risk for a systemic reaction to a future sting. This is true because depending on the study, 27 to 40 percent of adults in the general population have detectable venom-specific IgE in the serum [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8

          9-11

         Testing is most clearly indicated in patients with suspected or known systemic allergic reactions to stings. The purpose of testing in these patients is the confirmation of venom allergy and determination of which venoms should be used in immunotherapy. Testing is occasionally indicated in patients with other types of reactions. The indications for testing parallel the indications for venom immunotherapy, which are reviewed separately. (See

         Testing for venom allergy is indicated in any patient with a history that is suggestive or convincing for a past systemic allergic reaction to a sting that involved organs other than the skin (ie, with or without cutaneous symptoms). This includes patients in whom the sting event and systemic reaction occurred decades earlier because the risk of another reaction can persist for many years [

         </span>
         In patients with isolated urticaria/angioedema, the chance of a future systemic reaction has been estimated at about 7 to 10 percent per sting, and most of these reactions will also be limited to the skin (ie, fewer than 3 percent will have severe anaphylaxis). Therefore, testing and immunotherapy are not indicated in most cases. Studies supporting a low risk of future severe systemic reactions are reviewed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4090.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         However, there may be individuals who find these reactions sufficiently distressing or have unavoidable exposure (eg, bee keepers, landscapers, outdoor enthusiasts) and are motivated to undergo venom immunotherapy to mitigate future similar reactions. In such cases, testing would be appropriate to determine which venoms to include in treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the low risk of future anaphylaxis, it is the author's and editors' approach not to prescribe

          epinephrine

         autoinjectors in this situation. However, some allergists do prescribe epinephrine for such patients. If this is done or if there are other quality of life issues affecting the patient/family (such as fear surrounding stings), the allergist should follow-up with the patient in one year to review any subsequent stings and determine if epinephrine is still needed.

         On occasion, an individual who has no history of an allergic reaction may present with concern about the possibility of developing a severe reaction to a sting, often because one or more family members has Hymenoptera venom allergy. Testing for venom-specific IgE is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         indicated in this situation. Asymptomatic sensitization to honey bee and vespid venoms may be as high as 40 percent, and the meaning of a positive result without the history of a systemic reaction is unclear [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Epidemiologic studies have shown that most patients with venom anaphylaxis have no family history of venom allergy, although there are occasional families in which several members are affected [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The best approach to assisting such patients is to recommend against testing and instead explain that the patient's risk of ever experiencing a systemic reaction is approximately 0.4 to 0.8 percent in children and 3 percent in adults (as in the general population in the United States), and then address any specific issues that concern the patient [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         Testing is not indicated in most patients with large local reactions (LLRs). LLRs carry no more than a 5 to 10 percent risk of a future systemic reaction (with a &lt;3 percent risk of severe anaphylaxis) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ], so venom testing and venom immunotherapy are generally not indicated. However, as in the case of cutaneous systemic reactions, there may be individuals with frequent, severe LLRs that compromise quality of life or ability to work. Such patients may be motivated to undergo venom immunotherapy, in which case testing is indicated to determine which venoms to include in treatment. LLRs are usually caused by an IgE-mediated late-phase response, and venom immunotherapy can successfully reduce future LLRs [

         Testing for venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) can be performed by skin testing or in vitro testing. Skin testing is preferred over in vitro methods for initial testing in most patients because skin testing is somewhat more sensitive and less expensive than in vitro tests in most health care systems. Skin testing is positive in 66 to 90 percent of patients with a history suggestive of venom allergy [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,11,21-24
         </a>
         ]. In addition, 15 to 20 percent of patients with positive skin tests will have negative in vitro testing. Therefore, if skin testing is positive and the results support the clinical history (ie, reliable identification of culprit insect), then in vitro testing is not needed. However, 5 to 10 percent of patients with negative skin tests may have positive in vitro results [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,25,26
         </a>
         ]. Thus, if skin testing is negative with a suggestive clinical history or skin testing cannot be performed, then in vitro testing is indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
         In vitro testing is also helpful when the results of skin testing and the clinical history are not fully consistent or leave unanswered questions. An example would be the patient who developed anaphylaxis following a sting while eating outdoors but never visualized the insect, and skin testing shows sensitization only to honey bee. The clinician might be reasonably concerned that honey bee was not the true culprit insect, based on the tendency of yellow jackets to be more aggressive and attracted to human food. In this case, in vitro testing might be pursued in order to determine if the patient was sensitized to yellow jacket or other species, as well as to honey bee, before initiating venom immunotherapy. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The combination of skin testing and in vitro testing with the commercial assays in common use should detect approximately 95 percent of patients who will have a systemic reaction to a subsequent sting. The remaining patients pose a diagnostic dilemma that is discussed below. (See

         If the sting event was recent, we suggest waiting at least four to six weeks before performing skin testing, when possible. Many patients demonstrate reduced skin sensitivity to venom within the first few weeks after a systemic reaction [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Despite these issues, there are clinical scenarios in which it is advantageous to test immediately in order to initiate venom immunotherapy. However, if testing is performed during this period, a negative result (ie, lack of response) should be interpreted with great caution, and testing should be repeated at a later date.

         Allergic reactions to bumble bee field stings are rare compared with honey bees and other Hymenoptera because of their nonaggressive behavior. However, allergic reactions have been reported, particularly among greenhouse workers, as a result of occupational exposure [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>
         ]. In the absence of a specific history to suggest a bumble bee sting, patients with sting reactions do not need to be screened for this allergy. If a bumble bee allergy is suspected, specific bumble bee venom would be optimal for skin testing. This is available in some countries (not in the United States). However, there is a commercially available immunoglobulin E (IgE) immunoassay to bumble bee venom available in the United States and elsewhere. Bumble bee-allergic patients should also be tested for allergy to honey bee because there is some cross-reactivity between the two venoms, and some individuals may be sensitized to both. Once a bumble bee venom allergy is confirmed, bumble bee venom would be the best choice for immunotherapy if available (eg, in limited areas of Europe) because honey bee venom immunotherapy may not protect the patient against bumble bee stings. If the patient is sensitized only to bumble bee and bumble bee venom is not available, then the best management is avoidance and the availability of self-administered

         Skin testing with Hymenoptera venoms is most commonly performed using the intracutaneous (intradermal) technique, accompanied by appropriate positive and negative controls. Unlike skin testing for other types of allergies, prick (epicutaneous) testing is not necessarily done first, although this may be prudent in patients who experienced severe anaphylaxis and may be highly sensitive to venom. A concentration of 100 mcg/mL is used for prick testing.

         Skin testing to venom allergens rarely results in systemic allergic reactions, and the amount of venom introduced into the skin is significantly less than that of a single sting. However, this adverse effect is possible with any type of skin testing, as discussed elsewhere. (See

         The most widely practiced approach to intradermal venom testing is to begin with venom concentrations between 0.001 to 0.01 mcg/mL. Testing then proceeds at intervals of 20 to 30 minutes with incremental 10-fold increases in concentration until a positive skin test response occurs or a maximum concentration of 1 mcg/mL is reached. Concentrations higher than 1 mcg/mL should not be used, because they may result in irritant reactions [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. This sequential approach is generally considered the safest and is recommended by practice parameters. It is also the preferred approach in research studies because changes in sensitivity can be assessed over time using an "endpoint dilution" technique. (See

         In one series of 478 consecutive patients with a history of sting anaphylaxis, testing was performed with intradermal injections of 0.02 mL of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mcg/mL of honey bee and wasp venom, administered simultaneously. Three presumed allergic reactions occurred, but two of these patients had positive reactions only to the 1 mcg/mL concentration and thus would have had all of the other skin tests placed anyway with the traditional approach [

The patient population included individuals with all severities of sting reactions (24 percent had severe anaphylaxis), as well as those taking beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. All patients had at least one positive skin test. There were no immediate reactions to skin testing and just one delayed reaction (hours later) consisting of generalized urticaria.

If in vitro testing is also negative, skin testing should be repeated after 6 to 12 weeks. (See

         Patients may test positive to species to which they have no known exposure, which is attributed to various patterns of cross-sensitivity. Many patients show sensitivity to both yellow jackets and hornets, whereas cross-sensitivity between honey bee and other venoms is unusual [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40-42

However, positivity to both honey bee and yellow jacket venom is occasionally observed and is believed to be due to cross-reacting carbohydrate determinants, which are not believed to be clinically relevant. Despite this, the approach to treatment in the United States is to include all of the venoms to which the patient tested positive in immunotherapy to maximize the patient's chance of avoiding future systemic reactions. Practice varies around the world. Choice of venoms for use in immunotherapy is discussed in more detail separately. (See

         To screen for mast cell disorders, a baseline serum tryptase level should be obtained once the systemic reaction has fully subsided and the patient has returned to a baseline state. Further evaluation for systemic mastocytosis (ie, with additional laboratory studies and bone marrow biopsy) is indicated in patients with baseline serum tryptase &gt;20 ng/mL and should be considered for levels &gt;11.4 ng/mL if the patient has signs or symptoms suggestive of a mast cell disorder. The threshold baseline tryptase that is considered abnormal is evolving, and other experts may use slightly different values in this setting. There are data to suggest that baseline tryptase levels &gt;8 ng/mL are associated with more severe insect sting anaphylaxis. Note that the most likely explanation for an elevated baseline tryptase is not systemic mastocytosis, but rather hereditary alpha tryptasemia (HaT), which is far more common than mastocytosis and occurs in approximately 5 percent of the general population [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ] and in more than 15 percent of patients with mastocytosis, insect sting anaphylaxis, or idiopathic anaphylaxis [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64,65
         </a>
         ]. HaT may also present with severe sting reactions, but data about this associations are still limited. Patients with HaT have baseline tryptase values &gt;6 ng/mL. HaT is discussed in greater detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/389.html" rel="external">
          "Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis", section on 'Hereditary alpha tryptasemia'

         Consensus is lacking about how extensively patients should be screened for mast cell disorders beyond obtaining a baseline serum tryptase level. Some experts suggest that all patients who develop hypotensive syncope after a sting should be tested for the presence of the D816V mutation in the peripheral blood or even have a bone marrow biopsy, as individuals have been described who presented in this manner and were found to have occult mast cell disorders despite normal serum tryptase and no cutaneous findings suggestive of mastocytosis [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66-69
         </a>
         ]. In the largest prospective series, 374 adults with Hymenoptera allergy and no obvious signs of mastocytosis were screened for the
         <em>
          KIT
         </em>
         D816V mutation in peripheral blood [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. The presence of the mutation was highly correlated with severe venom anaphylaxis. Among patients with normal baseline tryptase, the frequency of
         <em>
          KIT
         </em>
         D816V was 18.2 percent in the subgroup with the most severe anaphylaxis, compared with 1.8 percent of patients with lower grade reactions. Thus, testing of peripheral blood for
         <em>
          KIT
         </em>
         D816V can detect occult mastocytosis in patients with venom anaphylaxis, even when baseline tryptase is normal. The diagnosis of mastocytosis is discussed in more detail separately. (See

         The initial step in diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom allergy is to determine whether the patient's past sting reaction was local or systemic, based upon the clinical history. (See

         The diagnosis of Hymenoptera allergy requires
         <strong>
          both
         </strong>
         a history of a sting event that resulted in a systemic reaction
         <strong>
          and
         </strong>
         evidence of venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), either by skin testing or in vitro testing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis of venom allergy'

         Testing is most clearly indicated in patients with suspected or known systemic allergic reactions to stings, for the purpose of confirming venom allergy and determining which venoms should be used in immunotherapy. Testing is occasionally indicated in patients with other types of reactions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for testing'

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In most cases, skin testing is the preferred initial method for demonstrating venom-specific IgE because it is more sensitive. Venom skin testing is positive in 70 to 90 percent of patients with a history suggestive of venom allergy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Skin testing'
         </a>
         above.)

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Skin testing should be performed using the venoms of all the Hymenoptera insects known to reside in the patient's geographic area. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choice of venoms for testing'
         </a>

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         If skin testing is negative, venom-specific IgE immunoassays should be obtained. The combination of skin testing and in vitro testing can detect about 95 percent of patients who will suffer another systemic reaction if stung again. (See
         <a class="local">
          'In vitro testing'
         </a>

         All patients who experienced a moderate or severe systemic reaction to a Hymenoptera sting should be screened with a baseline serum tryptase to detect hereditary alpha tryptasemia and occult mast cell disorders. Any elevation in serum tryptase should be evaluated further. Some experts recommend screening any patient for whom venom immunotherapy is recommended, and practice in this area is evolving as data become available. Additionally, patients with severe anaphylaxis but normal baseline tryptase can still have occult mast cell disease, and screening of peripheral blood for the
         <em>
          KIT
         </em>
         D816V mutation is prudent if available. (See
         <a class="local">

         </span>
         If both skin testing and venom-specific IgE are negative and serum tryptase is normal and yet there is a convincing history of a systemic reaction, then the patient should be retested for venom-specific IgE in three to six months. In addition, the patient should be educated about appropriate sting avoidance and treatment of reactions. (See
