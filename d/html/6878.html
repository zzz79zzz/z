         Edema is defined as a palpable swelling produced by expansion of the interstitial fluid volume; when massive and generalized, the excess fluid accumulation is called anasarca. A variety of clinical conditions are associated with the development of edema, including heart failure, cirrhosis, and the nephrotic syndrome, as well as local conditions such as venous and lymphatic disease  (

        </p>
        <p>
         An increase in interstitial fluid volume that could lead to edema does not occur in normal subjects because of the tight balance of hemodynamic forces along the capillary wall and the function of the lymphatic vessels. For generalized edema to occur, two factors must be present:

         An alteration in capillary hemodynamics that favors the movement of fluid from the vascular space into the interstitium. Such movement requires a change in one or more components of Starling's law: increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, decreased capillary oncotic pressure (ie, hypoalbuminemia), and/or increased capillary permeability. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2309.html" rel="external">
          "Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults", section on 'Capillary hemodynamics'

         The retention of dietary or intravenously administered sodium and water by the kidneys. Edema (other than localized edema as with an allergic reaction) does not become clinically apparent until the interstitial volume has increased by 2.5 to 3 L, an amount that is almost equal to the plasma volume. Thus, patients would develop marked hemoconcentration and shock if the plasma volume were not maintained by renal retention of sodium and water to compensate for the shift of fluid to the interstitium.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The retention of sodium and water can either be a primary event, as in renal failure, or a secondary event resulting from a primary reduction in either cardiac output (as in heart failure) or systemic vascular resistance (as in cirrhosis). In the latter settings, fluid retention tends to return the effective circulating volume toward normal. Diuretic therapy in such patients may have a deleterious effect on systemic hemodynamics even though it reduces the edema. Thus, careful monitoring is required. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6884.html" rel="external">

         Edema in adults can be divided into peripheral edema, pulmonary edema, ascites, and other forms of edema, which include lymphedema, nonpitting edema, and periorbital and scrotal edema.

         </span>
         Peripheral edema can be pitting or nonpitting. Pitting edema is more common and is defined by the presence of tissue depression after pressure is applied to the edematous area for at least five seconds  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118097" href="/z/d/graphic/118097.html" rel="external">
          picture 1

         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Pitting reflects movement of the excess interstitial water in response to pressure. Nonpitting edema suggests lymphatic obstruction or hypothyroidism. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nonpitting edema'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although clinicians commonly grade pitting edema from 1+ to 4+ (mild to severe), there is no agreed-upon definition of these grades. However, this type of grading scheme may help the clinician record relative changes in edema (eg, less edema after diuretic therapy). Documenting weight loss is another component of monitoring the efficacy of diuretic therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since peripheral edema locates preferentially in the dependent areas, it is primarily found in the lower extremities in ambulatory patients and over the sacrum in patients confined to bed rest. Less commonly, peripheral edema may occur in the upper extremities. (See
         <a class="local">

         Our approach to the differential diagnosis of leg edema in adults depends upon whether the patient has unilateral/asymmetric edema or bilateral edema, and upon the acuity of the edema.
        </p>
        <p>
         Acute onset of unilateral leg edema raises concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which must be addressed promptly. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1351.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity", section on 'Suspected first DVT (risk stratification)'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Bilateral edema is particularly frequent in older adults and is usually chronic rather than acute. It is often due to chronic venous disease, heart failure, venodilating medications, or pulmonary hypertension (the most commonly missed cause of bilateral edema). The list of etiologies for bilateral edema is extensive  (

         Certain infiltrative conditions may be mistaken for edema, such as pretibial myxedema seen with thyroid disease and lipedema (a familial bilateral deposition of excess fat in the lower extremities). (See

         It is essential to consider the diagnosis of DVT in patients with acute unilateral or asymmetric leg edema. In addition to edema, patients with a DVT can have calf tenderness, pain or firmness along the course of a vein, or unilateral warmth or erythema. A larger calf circumference in the affected leg is the most useful finding, whereas Homans’ sign (calf pain upon passive dorsiflexion of the foot) is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         a reliable sign of DVT. The findings of DVT may be subtle; patients may present with only unilateral or asymmetric edema. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1351.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity", section on 'Clinical presentation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Acute leg swelling may appear asymmetric in patients who have baseline unilateral or asymmetric chronic venous disease. In such patients, causes of acute bilateral edema (eg, drug-induced edema, heart failure) may present with asymmetric leg swelling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to patients with acute unilateral or asymmetric leg edema is as follows:

         First, determine the clinical probability of DVT and perform appropriate diagnostic testing depending upon the clinical probability. The Wells score (

          calculator 2
         </a>
         ) are the best-studied prediction rules. We prefer approaches that combine an assessment of the clinical probability with D-dimer testing in select patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1351.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity", section on 'Suspected first DVT (risk stratification)'

         If DVT has been ruled out based upon the results of testing, it is important to evaluate for other causes of acute unilateral or asymmetric leg edema. DVT is not present in more than three-quarters of patients with suspected DVT. In 160 such patients, after exclusion of DVT, the following causes of leg swelling were identified [

         Cellulitis – Bacterial cellulitis is a common condition of the leg, particularly in patients who have chronic leg swelling due to venous insufficiency or lymphedema. In bacterial cellulitis, the warmth and redness often skip areas and may be associated with constitutional symptoms including fever. Some patients with venous insufficiency develop a low-grade, nonbacterial cellulitis, which resembles infectious cellulitis, but without constitutional symptoms. Although fever increases the suspicion for cellulitis, it can also be present in DVT. The approach to patients with suspected cellulitis is discussed separately. (See

         Popliteal (Baker's) cyst – The majority of popliteal cysts are due to either distention of a bursa by fluid originating from a knee joint or posterior herniation of the joint capsule due to increased intra-articular pressure. A popliteal cyst that causes calf symptoms is usually leaking or has ruptured. It is often distinguished from DVT by posterior knee pain, knee stiffness, swelling or a mass behind the knee (especially with the knee in extension), and bruising around the ankle. However, calf symptoms are common; in addition, compression of the popliteal vein may cause leg swelling or secondary DVT. Evaluation of patients with a suspected popliteal cyst is presented elsewhere. (See

         May-Thurner syndrome – May-Thurner syndrome occurs in younger females (second or third decade) who present with acute pain and swelling of the entire left lower extremity, with or without venous thrombosis. The syndrome is most often caused by a compression of the left iliac vein between the overlying right common iliac artery and the fifth lumbar vertebrae. (See

         A neoplasm should be suspected when CUS is suggestive of pelvic outflow obstruction, particularly in patients with a history of cancer or concerning symptoms such as unexplained weight loss. If a neoplasm is suspected, imaging of the pelvis should be obtained. Specifically, if ovarian or endometrial cancer is suspected, a transvaginal ultrasound should be performed. Otherwise, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis is preferred.

         Chronic venous disease is the most common cause of chronic bilateral leg edema. However, chronic venous disease tends to be overdiagnosed in such patients, whereas other important diagnostic considerations, including heart failure and pulmonary hypertension (often related to sleep apnea), tend to be underdiagnosed. In one study, for example, 32 of 45 patients presenting to a primary care practice with chronic bilateral leg edema were initially diagnosed with chronic venous disease (71 percent), and 8 of 45 patients were diagnosed with heart failure (18 percent) [
         <a href="#rid4">

         Less common causes of chronic bilateral leg edema include renal disease, liver disease, a pelvic neoplasm, constrictive pericarditis, idiopathic edema, premenstrual edema, and malnutrition. (See

         Lymphedema and myxedema are not true edematous states. Lymphedema can be primary (usually presenting in childhood) or secondary. At the onset of lymphedema, it may be pitting, but it becomes nonpitting over time as cutaneous fibrosis and adipose tissue deposition occurs. (See

         If echocardiography is unrevealing, we assess the likelihood of chronic venous disease. In such patients, the examination usually reveals skin findings, such as pigmentary changes, induration, and ulceration  (

         If typical skin findings of chronic venous disease are absent, we obtain imaging of the pelvis to exclude a pelvic neoplasm or other lesion-causing venous outflow obstruction. If ovarian cancer is suspected, we start with a transvaginal ultrasound; otherwise, we obtain a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the pelvis.

         Our approach to the differential diagnosis of arm edema in adults depends upon the acuity of the edema.
        </p>
        <p>
         Acute isolated upper extremity edema can be caused by trauma, infection, superficial thrombophlebitis, or inflammatory arthritis of the upper extremity. In such cases, the underlying etiology is typically apparent from the history and examination.

        <p>
         Upper extremity venous thrombosis should be suspected when none of the etiologies noted above are present, or if there are other significant risk factors such as the presence of a venous catheter. Spontaneous thrombosis occurs most often in muscular male athletes engaging in strenuous activity with the involved arm and usually involves anatomic abnormalities of the thoracic outlet. Acute bilateral upper extremity edema is rare but may be seen with bilateral spontaneous venous thrombosis or superior vena cava syndrome. (See

         Patients with pulmonary edema complain primarily of shortness of breath and orthopnea. Physical examination usually reveals a tachypneic patient with rales and possibly a diastolic gallop (S3). The diagnosis of pulmonary edema should be confirmed by radiologic studies because other disorders, such as a pulmonary embolus, may produce similar symptoms but will require different therapy  (

         Although cardiac disease (eg, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, mitral or aortic valvular pathologies) is the most common cause of pulmonary edema, it can also be produced by volume overload due to primary renal sodium retention (such as acute glomerulonephritis) or by increased capillary permeability in the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

         Ascites is associated with abdominal distention and both shifting dullness and a fluid wave on percussion of the abdomen. Causes of ascites include cirrhosis, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (eg, Budd-Chiari syndrome), malignancy, and infection. Right-sided heart failure and constrictive pericarditis can cause ascites, but these processes typically also cause peripheral edema. If ascites is suspected, the diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasonography. Abdominal paracentesis is used to determine the cause of ascites. (See

         The major causes of lymphedema in adults in developed countries are axillary lymph node dissection in patients with breast cancer and axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection in patients with melanoma. However, worldwide, the most common cause is filariasis. The edema in such patients is typically limited to an arm or leg. The clinical hallmark of lymphedema is the presence of cutaneous and subcutaneous thickening, as manifested by cutaneous fibrosis, peau d'orange, and a positive Stemmer sign, which refers to an inability to tent the skin at the base of the digits.

          Pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Edema is a palpable swelling produced by expansion of the interstitial fluid volume. Generalized edema is produced by one or more of the following: increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, decreased capillary oncotic pressure, and/or increased capillary permeability  (

          table 1

          Chronic bilateral edema
         </strong>
         – In patients with chronic bilateral leg edema, a diagnosis can often be made based upon clinical features  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118001" href="/z/d/graphic/118001.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). If the history and examination are not consistent with a particular diagnosis (eg, chronic venous disease, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, renal, or liver disease), we obtain a semiquantitative urine dipstick for protein and measure serum creatinine, serum albumin, prothrombin time, liver function tests, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. If those tests are unrevealing, we obtain an echocardiogram. If the echocardiogram does not suggest the etiology of the edema, and chronic venous disease does not seem likely, we obtain imaging of the pelvis to exclude venous outflow obstruction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Chronic bilateral leg edema'

          Acute
         </strong>
         – Acute isolated upper extremity edema can be caused by trauma, infection, superficial thrombophlebitis, or inflammatory arthritis of the upper extremity. Upper extremity venous thrombosis should be suspected when none of the etiologies noted above are present or if there are other significant risk factors such as the presence of a venous catheter. CUS with Doppler is the study of choice for the initial evaluation of patients with possible upper extremity venous thrombosis. (See

          Pulmonary edema
         </strong>
         – Patients with pulmonary edema complain primarily of shortness of breath and orthopnea. Physical examination usually reveals a tachypneic patient with rales and possibly a diastolic gallop (S3). The diagnosis of pulmonary edema should be confirmed by radiologic studies because other disorders, such as a pulmonary embolus, may produce similar symptoms but will require different therapy. (See
