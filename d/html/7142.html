They usually occur as intermittent attacks that are sometimes life-threatening due to neurologic complications (eg, seizures, paralysis). Symptoms may become chronic especially after many attacks.</p><p>The management of patients with attacks of AIP can be challenging because the disease manifestations are diverse and potentially life-threatening. Timely intervention can resolve and prevent attacks; any other condition (eg, infection, medication exposure) that may have triggered the acute attack must also be addressed. Close long-term monitoring for complications is also needed.</p><p>The management of AIP is reviewed here, including treatment of acute attacks, prevention, and long-term monitoring for complications. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of AIP and a general overview of the porphyrias are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7096.html" rel="external">"Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7101.html" rel="external">"Porphyrias: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H825785723"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of therapy for an acute attack of AIP (and any other acute neurovisceral porphyria, referred to collectively as acute hepatic porphyrias or AHPs) are to abate the attack as rapidly as possible with specific therapy and to provide symptomatic and supportive treatment until the attack abates. Hospitalization is usually required for acute attacks because it facilitates treatment of severe symptoms as well as monitoring of respiration, electrolytes, and nutritional status; and intravenous administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a> [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Suspected versus established diagnosis</strong> – Individuals with suspected acute porphyria (eg, a new presentation consistent with AIP without a previous diagnosis) should be tested to confirm the presence of acute porphyria, by finding a substantial elevation of urinary porphobilinogen (PBG), before primary porphyria treatment is initiated, if possible (see <a class="local">'Confirming that a patient has acute porphyria as a new or prior diagnosis'</a> below). However, testing for elevated PBG may not be immediately available. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If PBG is elevated, it is not necessary to determine the specific type of acute porphyria the patient has before starting primary therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a>, and therapy should not be delayed while awaiting the results of testing to distinguish among the acute porphyrias, as illustrated in the left side of the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709" href="/z/d/graphic/61709.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) and discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7096.html" rel="external">"Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the PBG result is not immediately available, the testing laboratory should be contacted and told there is a high index of suspicion of acute porphyria. The laboratory should be asked to expedite PBG testing and to estimate when the result will be reported. The initial result may be qualitative or expressed per liter; however, the laboratory should also be asked to report the final result as mg or micromol of PBG per gram or mmol of creatinine rather than per liter. A very high result expressed per liter is diagnostic, but a normal value per liter does not exclude the possibility of a dilute urine sample and a falsely "normal" PBG concentration. PBG is expected to be in the range of 10 to 200 mg per gram of creatinine with an attack of AIP but may be less elevated in hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria. Interpreting PBG results in terms of fold increases above normal is not recommended because upper limits of normal vary greatly between laboratories due to differences in methodology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">While the PBG result is pending, the pharmacy should be informed that a suspected case of acute porphyria may need urgent treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a>. A decision to start treatment with hemin when acute porphyria is suspected but the PBG result is not yet available may be justified if there are severe neurologic findings that are otherwise unexplained (eg, advancing paresis). Treatment with glucose should be initiated if the PBG result and/or hemin is not immediately available. Communication with the testing laboratory should continue until the result is reported. It is hoped that onsite rapid PBG testing will become more widely available in the future, to allow for more rapid diagnosis (or exclusion) of acute porphyria in patients with characteristic but nonspecific symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The choice of testing laboratory is important. Major send-out laboratories are reliable with regard to measuring urinary PBG and porphyrins. However, as noted above, laboratories often report results as concentrations (per L) and may need to be asked to report results per g or mmol of creatinine. As described in the topic on the protoporphyrias (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7125.html" rel="external">"Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>), some major laboratories are <strong>not</strong> reliable for measurement of erythrocyte protoporphyrin, making selection of the testing laboratory essential. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Testing for porphyria is appropriate even when the index of suspicion is not high, for example as part of a workup for unexplained symptoms such as abdominal pain in patients presenting to emergency units and primary clinicians. In such instances, finding substantial elevations in urine PBG and porphyrin levels may be unexpected, if porphyria was part of a diagnostic evaluation but was not strongly suspected. Such results should be acted upon as soon as possible after results are reported, to facilitate specific treatment and avoid progression of signs and symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For a patient with a previously well-established diagnosis of AIP (or other acute porphyria), the diagnosis of an acute attack is made clinically. Although testing for PBG elevation with each attack is recommended, therapy should not be delayed while awaiting the results of this testing. (See <a class="local">'Testing before treatment of an attack'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">However, it is important to be sure that a previously established diagnosis is well-founded, and this will require review of the evidence for the prior diagnosis, which should include documentation of a prior substantial elevation in PBG. Biochemical documentation of the type of acute porphyria and identification of the underlying familial mutation is considered standard of care. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7096.html" rel="external">"Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'DNA testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Porphyria-specific therapy</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">Hemin</a> and carbohydrate (glucose) loading are used to abate acute attacks. They are considered specific therapies that downregulate hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS1), the rate-limiting enzyme for heme biosynthesis in the liver. Hemin has a more potent effect and is used for severe attacks; glucose loading is sometimes used for mild attacks (eg, those that do not require hospitalization, opioid analgesia, or other intravenous medication; and are not accompanied by nausea and vomiting, motor neuropathy, paresis, seizures, agitation, delirium, psychosis, ileus that prevents oral intake, or hyponatremia). However, for most mild attacks, we suggest hemin because these attacks can progress and become more severe during glucose treatment. Glucose loading is used temporarily if hemin is not immediately available. (See <a class="local">'Acute attack: Primary treatment (hemin)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Supportive and symptomatic care</strong> – Symptomatic therapy and treatment of paralysis, seizures, and other potential disease manifestations can be initiated even before a diagnosis of porphyria is confirmed. Severe neurologic manifestations, including paralysis and seizures, are potentially life-threatening and must be addressed immediately. (See <a class="local">'Acute attack: Management of symptoms and complications'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Drugs harmful in porphyria should be avoided if possible until porphyria is excluded by a normal PBG result. (See <a class="local">'Avoidance of exacerbating factors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bedside spirometry should be available in all severe attacks to detect early respiratory impairment, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a> should be continued until neurologic function recovers. (See <a class="local">'Paresis and paralysis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluation of seizures and other central nervous system symptoms may reveal findings consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). (See <a class="local">'Seizures'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Supportive and symptomatic treatment often includes opioid analgesics, phenothiazines, antiemetics, anxiolytics, sedatives for sleep, antihypertensives, and electrolytes for correction of metabolic abnormalities. (See <a class="local">'Acute attack: Management of symptoms and complications'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Exacerbating factors that may be contributing to the attack should be corrected promptly if possible, including elimination of potentially exacerbating medications; carbohydrate and caloric repletion, especially after fasting or metabolic stress; and treatment of concomitant infections. Monitoring for electrolyte abnormalities that complicate attacks should continue until the attack has resolved. It is important to avoid medications known to exacerbate acute porphyria and choose alternatives known to be safe until the diagnosis of acute porphyria is confirmed or excluded. (See <a class="local">'Acute attack: Management of symptoms and complications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Avoidance of exacerbating factors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In women, the relationship of the attack to the menstrual cycle or to administration of progestins should be noted. Cyclic attacks typically occur premenstrually, during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are elevated, and are frequent in some women. Measuring serum progesterone at the time of an attack may help to identify this relationship. Keeping a menstrual and attack calendar can help to identify future attacks as premenstrual. (See <a class="local">'Avoidance of exacerbating factors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Latent disease</strong> – AIP remains "latent" in most individuals who inherit a pathogenic <em>PBGD</em> mutation. The term "latent" is variously defined, but often refers to individuals who have an AIP mutation but have not experienced an attack and usually have no elevations in porphyrin precursors and porphyrins. Although some individuals become susceptible to attacks at some time after puberty, most remain asymptomatic throughout life. Patients with past attacks who have been well for many years may also be referred to as having "latent" disease. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Asymptomatic individuals with elevated PBG levels are termed "asymptomatic high excreters" [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]; they may be more likely to develop attacks than those who have never had PBG elevations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7096.html" rel="external">"Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Individuals with latent disease do not require treatment but should be counseled yearly regarding potential triggers and means to avoid them, and their doctors should be made aware that they are at some risk for developing symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7096.html" rel="external">"Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3098735"><span class="h1">TESTING BEFORE TREATMENT OF AN ATTACK</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of an acute attack should include both of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confirmation that the patient has AIP (or one of the other acute porphyrias), either as a new or existing diagnosis. However, as noted above, treatment is sometimes initiated based on strong clinical suspicion before a report of porphobilinogen (PBG) elevation is available. (See <a class="local">'Overview of approach'</a> above and <a class="local">'Confirming that a patient has acute porphyria as a new or prior diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determination based on clinical evaluation that the current symptoms are due to porphyria and not another condition. Individuals with porphyria can develop other conditions, so clinical evaluation of any acute illness is always important. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7096.html" rel="external">"Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and <a class="local">'Diagnosis of an acute attack in a patient with an established diagnosis of acute porphyria'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3573911"><span class="h2">Confirming that a patient has acute porphyria as a new or prior diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Confirmation of a porphyria diagnosis is based on the finding of an elevated urinary PBG currently or in the past  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709" href="/z/d/graphic/61709.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). PBG elevation (at present or in the past) should be established by a quantitative method before <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a> therapy is started. Details related to communication with the testing laboratory are described above. (See <a class="local">'Overview of approach'</a> above.) </p><p>Patients with impaired kidney function may have measurement of plasma PBG instead, although few laboratories offer this test and results are not as rapidly available.</p><p>A substantial elevation of urinary PBG is specific for the three most common acute porphyrias (AIP, hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], and variegate porphyria [VP]) and is not found in any other medical condition. Of these porphyrias, AIP is the most commonly symptomatic  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117978" href="/z/d/graphic/117978.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Importantly, PBG may be less elevated during attacks of HCP and VP compared with AIP, so screening should also include measurement of urinary porphyrins, which are expected to be markedly elevated in AIP, HCP, and VP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7100.html" rel="external">"Hereditary coproporphyria"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7126.html" rel="external">"Variegate porphyria"</a>.) </p><p>Patients with ALA dehydratase porphyria (ADP) have elevations in urine ALA and coproporphyrin III but not PBG. Screening for acute porphyrias will identify patients with ADP if urine porphyrins are measured along with PBG. ADP is an ultra-rare disease, and all documented cases have been in males. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7095.html" rel="external">"ALA dehydratase porphyria"</a>.)</p><p>If PBG is found to be substantially elevated, further diagnostic testing is required to determine whether the patient has AIP, HCP, or VP. If urine porphyrins are elevated, which is a much less specific finding than PBG elevation, further testing is needed to exclude HCP, VP, and ADP. Particularly with substantial PBG elevation, additional samples should be obtained prior to initiating therapy if possible, but this should not delay therapy because therapy is the same for all of the acute porphyrias and does not require distinction among them. Additional details related to diagnostic confirmation include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prior diagnosis of AIP or other acute porphyria cannot be assumed to be correct without review of the prior laboratory documentation. Even a long-standing diagnosis of porphyria may be incorrect. Prior reports of DNA documentation should be examined carefully, since an identified variant may or may not be pathogenic. Therefore, the evidence for the prior diagnosis should be made available for review. If this is not available particularly for an acutely ill patient, a spot urine should be obtained and tested for PBG and porphyrins (normalized to spot urine creatinine in the same sample) as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In ADP, the fourth acute porphyria, which, as noted above, is very rare, PBG is normal or minimally elevated. Cases of ADP may be identified by measuring urinary porphyrins for screening and by secondary testing showing marked elevation in urine delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, followed by mutation analysis for confirmation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7095.html" rel="external">"ALA dehydratase porphyria"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The distinction among AIP, HCP, VP, and ADP by biochemical testing can take place simultaneously with treatment. However, samples for testing should be obtained before administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a> because treatment can decrease levels of PBG and porphyrins.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Molecular testing can also differentiate among the acute porphyrias if a known disease-causing mutation is identified, but sometimes variants identified are of uncertain significance (VUS).</p><p></p><p>Further details of the diagnostic evaluation are presented separately.

Alternatively, small-volume phlebotomy to reduce serum ferritin levels to within the normal range have been used in patients with iron overload. As an example, in patients with high ferritin levels who are benefitting from weekly hemin infusions, a small-volume phlebotomy may be done before each weekly hemin infusion. Experience with chelation therapy is limited, and chelation is avoided because iron chelators can reduce iron availably for hepatic heme synthesis in rodents, suggesting they might exacerbate AIP.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11719774"><span class="h1">PREGNANCY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most women with AIP do not consider the disease to be a barrier to having children, because pregnancy is usually well tolerated, despite elevations in circulating progesterone [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>However, some women have more frequent attacks during pregnancy, and some women experience increased symptoms in the postpartum period.

Hospitalization is usually required. (See <a class="local">'Overview of approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Confirm porphyria</strong> – Treatment of an acute attack requires confirmation of acute porphyria, based on the finding of elevated urinary porphobilinogen (PBG), either presently or in the past, but it does not require diagnosis of the specific type of acute porphyria  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709" href="/z/d/graphic/61709.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The need for rapid reporting of a PBG result should be discussed with the participating laboratory if acute porphyria is strongly suspected but not previously diagnosed. (See <a class="local">'Testing before treatment of an attack'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Determine subtype simultaneously with treatment</strong> – Testing to differentiate AIP and other acute porphyrias that elevate PBG (hereditary coproporphyria [HCP] and variegate porphyria [VP]) can continue simultaneously with treatment, using samples collected before treatment is begun. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Urine total porphyrins are markedly elevated in all acute porphyrias during attacks and should also be measured in addition to PBG when screening for acute porphyrias. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patient with known porphyria, confirm clinically</strong> – In a patient known to have an acute porphyria based on prior testing, an acute attack is largely established clinically. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis of an acute attack in a patient with an established diagnosis of acute porphyria'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute attack</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Severe</strong> – For an attack of AIP (or other acute porphyria) severe enough to require hospitalization, opioid analgesia, or other intravenous medication, or that is accompanied by paresis, seizures, agitation, delirium, psychosis, or hyponatremia, we recommend intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a> rather than carbohydrate loading (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Hemin should be administered without delay once an acute attack is diagnosed. Carbohydrate loading should be used as a temporizing measure while awaiting the availability of hemin. (See <a class="local">'Acute attack: Primary treatment (hemin)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mild</strong> – We also suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a> rather than carbohydrate loading for AIP attacks with mild pain not requiring opioids, without severe manifestations (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, an initial trial of carbohydrate loading is sometimes effective. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Dosing</strong> – A typical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a> regimen is Panhematin, 3 to 4 mg/kg reconstituted with 25 percent human albumin given intravenously as a single daily dose for four days. Typical carbohydrate regimens include oral glucose polymer solution, up to 300 grams daily; or 10 percent intravenous glucose, 300 to 400 grams per 24 hours.

Bedside spirometry should be available to detect early respiratory impairment, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a> should be continued until neurologic function recovers. (See <a class="local">'Paresis and paralysis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Seizures </strong>– Seizures may be due to hyponatremia or porphyria itself.

(See <a class="local">'Prevention of attacks'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic pain</strong> – A pain management specialist is often helpful for control of chronic pain, especially if opioids are required long term. (See <a class="local">'Chronic symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Long-term complications</strong> – Patients with AIP are at risk for developing chronic kidney disease, hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma, iron deficiency from menstrual blood loss (as in females without AIP) or iron overload from frequent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a>. Recommended monitoring includes aminotransferases and ferritin levels. Hypertension should be controlled and nephrotoxic drugs avoided. Patients over age 50 should have hepatic imaging for hepatocellular carcinoma.
