         Adverse food reactions can be subdivided into allergic and nonallergic reactions. Food allergy (or hypersensitivity) is defined broadly as an immunologic reaction to food and can be further distinguished into immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated mechanisms and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy in the United States define food allergy as "an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food" [
         <a href="#rid1">

         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Primary goals of the history are to determine if food allergy could be present and, if so, what type and which food may be responsible. The history is subsequently used to guide testing and interpret results.

         Food allergy is due to an abnormal immunologic response following exposure (usually ingestion) to a food [

         True food allergy appears to be present in up to 10 percent of the population, but many more patients suspect they have a food allergy or label themselves as allergic when they are not [

         Nonimmunologic adverse food reactions are far more common than food allergy and, as implied by the term, arise from nonimmunologic reactions to food ingestion. Examples include lactose intolerance, auriculotemporal syndrome (or Frey syndrome, a gustatory flushing appearing on the skin below the ear and along the jaw line), and disorders resulting from anatomic abnormalities, enzymatic deficiencies, metabolic diseases, toxins, gastrointestinal infections, and a host of other processes  (

         The clinical history is an essential component of the evaluation of a patient with possible food allergy. This topic review discusses how the history, supported by the physical exam, is used to accomplish specific goals:

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The history is also used to determine what type of testing should be performed and how that testing is interpreted, particularly for IgE-mediated food allergy. An extremely important point is that a "positive" result on skin testing or in vitro testing indicates sensitization (IgE antibody specific for the tested food) and is not necessarily equivalent to a clinical allergy. To diagnose clinical IgE-mediated allergy, the patient must also have a history of reacting to that food, with signs and symptoms consistent with an IgE-mediated allergy. The information obtained from the clinical history is used to assess the patient's pretest probability of having food allergy. Testing for specific allergic conditions is then performed and interpreted in the context of this assessment.

         Food allergy can be subdivided into various types, depending upon the underlying pathogenic mechanism. A primary distinction is between food allergy caused by IgE-mediated mechanisms and food allergy caused by other immunologic mechanisms. This distinction is critical because IgE-mediated reactions may progress to life-threatening anaphylaxis and must be properly identified and managed. (See

         IgE-mediated food allergy presents with some combination of the following signs and symptoms: nausea; vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; flushing; pruritus; urticaria; swelling of the lips, face, or throat; wheezing; lightheadedness; or syncope  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448" href="/z/d/graphic/79448.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         A patient may present with only one or two of these symptoms or virtually all of them. In children, a classic presentation is vomiting and urticaria. In adults, reactions frequently involve urticaria, angioedema of the lips and face, and abdominal symptoms. Extragastrointestinal symptoms are common and may be the only symptoms present (eg, urticaria).

         A more detailed discussion of the different presentations of IgE-mediated food allergy is presented separately. (See

         IgE-mediated reactions occur rapidly after ingestion of the culprit food (ie, within seconds to minutes). Uncommonly, reactions up to two hours and beyond can also occur.

         IgE-mediated food allergy occurs most often in association with certain foods, although any food has the potential to cause allergy. Understanding common triggers can assist in identifying potential culprits when diagnosing a potential food allergy. Most clinically significant (potentially severe) allergies are caused by peanut, tree nuts (eg, cashew, walnut, etc), fish, shellfish, cow's milk, hen's egg, wheat, soy, and seeds (particularly sesame) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,4-6,11
         </a>
         ]. Allergies to fresh fruits and vegetables are common but usually less severe [

         ]. (See

         In contrast with IgE-mediated disorders, food allergies caused by other mechanisms present with more subacute and chronic reactions. These disorders commonly affect the gastrointestinal tract and/or skin and are most frequent in infants and children [

         Non-IgE-mediated food allergies usually involve isolated gastrointestinal symptoms, such as reflux, nausea, vomiting, cramping, and diarrhea. These types of food allergies should also be considered in infants in the first year of life with varying degrees of blood and mucus in the stool.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with these forms of food allergy usually appear well. An exception to this statement, as mentioned previously, is seen in the infantile syndrome of dietary protein-induced enterocolitis, in which infants can present with dehydration or failure to thrive and also develop severe hypotension upon food reexposure [
         <a href="#rid14">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the symptoms of non-IgE-mediated allergic disorders are nonspecific, the history and physical alone are rarely sufficient to distinguish them from nonallergic disorders unless they present as one of several, well-recognized syndromes. Gastroenterologic tests, including blood tests, stool examinations, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and mucosal biopsy, may be required for diagnosis.

         The history is of critical importance in the evaluation of a patient with suspected food allergy. A primary goal is to determine if an IgE-mediated food allergy is probable as this type of reaction can pose an immediate threat to the patient if undetected and can be identified by specific signs and symptoms in most cases. Eliciting or augmenting factors should also be sought [

         What particular food was suspected to have provoked the reaction? Peanut, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, cow's milk, hen's egg, wheat, soy, and sesame account for the majority of serious IgE-mediated food allergies.

         It is more likely that a food eaten uncommonly is the trigger of an acute allergic reaction, rather than a food that is a routine component of the diet. Questions should be directed to disclose ingredients that are uncommon in the patient's diet.

         The possibility that a known allergen for a patient is present as a "contaminant," for example through cross-contact in preparation, should be considered in an individual with known food allergies who experiences a reaction associated with ingestion of a meal comprised of previously tolerated foods.

         How much of the suspected food was ingested? IgE-mediated reactions can be triggered by minute amounts of food proteins. However, threshold doses required to trigger a reaction vary. Some individuals are less sensitive, and larger amounts of allergen must be ingested before a reaction occurs. Other disorders (eg, lactose intolerance) more typically require larger portions to induce symptoms.

         Are all of the ingested ingredients known? There may be hidden ingredients in commercially processed foods that will only be apparent with review of labels. Processed foods also may be mislabeled or contain undeclared allergens. Packaged meat, egg, and poultry products are exempt from the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act. Food labels may be vague (eg "natural flavorings"). In some cases, the patient or clinician will need to contact the manufacturer to obtain more specific information. (See

         Did similar symptoms develop on other occasions when the food was eaten (ie, reproducibility)? IgE-mediated allergies cause symptoms with every ingestion, although there may be a threshold amount that is required. Was the food prepared in a different manner or consumed in much larger amounts? As examples, a patient may react to scrambled egg but not egg in baked goods or to raw salmon in sushi but not to canned salmon.

Contact urticaria upon exposure to raw or lightly cooked egg is common in children with egg allergy. Respiratory symptoms may develop upon inhalation of food allergens that are aerosolized during the cooking process. Some, but not all, food allergens are aerosolized during cooking. (See

         How much time elapsed between ingestion of the food and the development of symptoms? Different types of food allergy have characteristic times to onset of symptoms. IgE-mediated reactions typically occur within minutes, whereas cell-mediated reactions are more indolent and may take several hours to days to manifest. One exception is that IgE-mediated allergic reactions to meat can be relatively delayed, beginning several hours after ingestion. (See

         Does the patient have a history of avoiding or refusing to eat the suspected food? Young children sometimes display dislike for or refusal to ingest foods that are later confirmed as allergens. This presumably occurs due to mild reactions that they experience when trying the food. Although young children are often picky eaters, attention should be paid to this behavior when allergies are suspected, especially when common allergenic foods (eg, peanut, egg) are rejected. However, an underlying eating disorder should be considered in patients who avoid or refuse to eat multiple foods.

In the latter case, the potential mechanism depends upon the type of transplant and can range from temporary allergy due to transferred activated mast cells/basophils or allergen-specific IgE to longer-lasting or permanent allergy due to transfer of food allergen-specific lymphocytes or hematopoietic stem cells from the donor. Alternatively, an allergic reaction to a food can occur in an allergic patient after receiving a blood product that contains intact allergen consumed by the donor [

         IgE-mediated food allergic reactions are suggested by characteristic signs and symptoms, such as urticaria and angioedema, and respiratory, gastrointestinal, and/or cardiovascular symptoms that develop in minutes to an hour after food ingestion  (

         ). Another important disorder that may present acutely with severe vomiting progressing to dehydration and hypotension, usually one to three hours after food ingestion, is dietary protein-induced enterocolitis, which is not associated with IgE antibodies. (See

         Certain symptoms of chronic disease should prompt consideration of food allergy as a cause or contributor. Atopic dermatitis is associated with food allergy in approximately 40 percent of infants/children with moderate-to-severe disease [

          25,26

        </p>
        <p>
         Chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and failure to thrive can also be associated with food allergy in a subset of patients, usually infants/children [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

          Categories of adverse food reactions
         </strong>
         – Adverse food reactions can be subdivided into allergic and nonallergic reactions. Food allergy is defined broadly as an immunologic reaction to food and can be further distinguished into immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated mechanisms and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. IgE-mediated reactions may progress to life-threatening anaphylaxis and must be properly identified. (See
         <a class="local">

          IgE-mediated food allergy
         </strong>
         – IgE-mediated reactions are characterized by stereotypical signs and symptoms that develop rapidly after food ingestion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448" href="/z/d/graphic/79448.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Symptoms beyond the gastrointestinal tract are common and may be the only symptoms present (eg, urticaria). Combinations of the following signs and symptoms are typical: nausea; vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; flushing; pruritus; urticaria; swelling of the lips, face, or throat; wheezing; lightheadedness; or syncope. Although any food can cause IgE-mediated allergy, a few foods cause most of these reactions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'IgE-mediated allergy'

         <strong>
          Non-IgE-mediated food allergy
         </strong>
         – Non-IgE-mediated food allergies usually involve subacute or chronic symptoms that are isolated to the gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, vomiting, cramping, and diarrhea. History is often not sufficient to distinguish them from nonallergic disorders unless they present as one of several well-recognized syndromes. (See
         <a class="local">

          Nonallergic reactions
         </strong>
         – Nonallergic adverse food reactions can present similarly to food allergy and include a host of anatomic, toxic, metabolic, and/or infectious disorders  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51225" href="/z/d/graphic/51225.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Patient history
         </strong>
         – The history is of critical importance in the evaluation of a patient with possible food allergy. Certain questions are particularly useful for obtaining important information about food allergy. Primary goals of the history are to determine if food allergy may be present and, if so, what type of allergy and which food may be responsible. The history is subsequently used to guide testing and interpret results. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Role of the history in evaluation'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – The physical examination should focus on physical findings of allergic reactions if the patient is evaluated acutely or stigmata of allergic disease if the patient presents with chronic symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Physical examination'

         <strong>
          When to refer
         </strong>
         – Referral to an allergy specialist can be arranged if IgE-mediated food allergy is suspected. Skin testing is the preferred next step in most cases and should only be performed by an allergy specialist; however, in vitro tests can be ordered by the generalist if one or a few suspect foods are implicated by the history. Searching for culprit foods with panels of in vitro tests is rarely productive and should not be performed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Role of the generalist'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The diagnosis and management of non-IgE-mediated food allergy often requires the assistance of a gastroenterologist as well as an allergist. Tests by the gastroenterologist may include blood work, stool examinations, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and mucosal biopsy. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          General approach to management
         </strong>
         – Immediate management for patients with suspected food allergy includes specific instructions on food avoidance and treatment of a possible reaction after an accidental exposure. Prescription of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">
          epinephrine
         </a>
         for patients who have had or who are at risk for a systemic reaction/anaphylaxis must be accompanied by clear instructions for proper use of the specific device as well as instructions about which symptoms should prompt its use. These management approaches are discussed in greater detail separately. (See
