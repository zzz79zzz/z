All sustained ventricular arrhythmias have the potential to be lethal arrhythmias. Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including chest compressions and assisted ventilation, can provide transient circulatory support for the patient with cardiac arrest, the only effective approach for terminating VF is electrical defibrillation. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation is generally considered the first-line treatment option for the secondary prevention of SCD and for primary prevention in certain populations at high risk of SCD due to VT/VF.</p><p>This topic will review the general indications for ICD implantation as well as the components and functionalities of the ICD.

Patients with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy generally require optimal medical therapy for three months with documentation of persistent LVEF ≤35 percent at that time. However, the DANISH trial calls into question the role of prophylactic ICDs in some patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. It is recommended that patients be evaluated at least three months after revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft surgery [CABG] or stent placement).

Decades ago, ICD systems were implanted epicardially, requiring major surgery to affix separate shocking and sensing electrodes to the epicardial surface of the heart. Generators were typically placed in the upper abdomen. The need for epicardial electrodes and abdominal pulse generators has become vanishingly rare. There is also a subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) which requires no transvenous leads. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97158.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Electrodes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pacing and sensing functions require a pair of electrodes. Contemporary pacemakers and defibrillators usually use leads with two electrodes on the ventricular lead: the distal electrode at the tip of the lead and a second electrode in the shape of a ring, several millimeters back from the tip (ie, true bipolar leads). These bipolar leads provide accurate sensing, with high amplitude, narrow electrograms. Some ICD leads utilize integrated bipolar sensing in which the bipole consists of a single tip electrode and the distal shocking coil electrode. In addition to improved sensing capabilities, bipolar leads reduce the risk of extraneous interference, which could lead to inappropriate device function (eg, inappropriate shocks delivered due to sensing of muscular activity).</p><p>The defibrillation function of the electrodes requires a relatively large surface area and positioning of the lead to maximize the density of current flow through the ventricular myocardium. Contemporary ICD systems use a "coil" of wire that extends along the ventricular lead as the primary defibrillation electrode. Thus, a single transvenous lead can accomplish all pacing, sensing, and defibrillation functions. In the distant past (and in some unique cases, in persons without vascular access options), epicardial patches were used for defibrillation, but placement required a thoracotomy.</p><p>Additional defibrillation electrodes improve defibrillation efficacy and reduce the defibrillation threshold. Most contemporary ICD systems have two or three defibrillation electrodes. Along with the distal coil in the right ventricle (RV) on the transvenous lead, some ICD leads have a second defibrillation coil proximal to the RV coil. In addition, with "active can" technology, the metal housing of the ICD serves as one of the shocking electrodes. This configuration requires that the pulse generator be implanted in the pectoral region  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113994" href="/z/d/graphic/113994.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The active can and transvenous lead systems can be combined to achieve adequate defibrillation thresholds (minimum energy required for successful defibrillation, which should generally be 10 joules less than the maximum output of the device). (See <a class="local">'Defibrillation threshold testing'</a> below.)</p><p>There are three types of pacing offered by current transvenous systems. Single-chamber systems have only an RV lead. Dual-chamber systems have right atrial (RA) and RV leads. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) systems have RA, RV, and left ventricular (LV) or septal conduction system leads, or in some patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, RV and LV leads.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Pulse generator</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pulse generator  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104721" href="/z/d/graphic/104721.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) contains the sensing circuitry as well as the high voltage capacitors and battery. While the initial pulse generators were located in the abdomen, the development of small pulse generators (eg, thickness ≤15 mm) has permitted placement in the infraclavicular region of the anterior chest wall in nearly all patients [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The majority are placed in a prepectoral (ie, subcutaneous) position, but in some cases, a subpectoral position is advantageous. For most patients with the pulse generator in this location, the impulses generated are transmitted to the myocardium via transvenous leads. Epicardial systems are still available and may be necessary as a result of anatomical limitations to placing a transvenous lead(s). Additionally, a subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) system is now available in which the pulse generator is placed overlying the left lower lateral ribs. (See <a class="local">'Choosing the optimal pulse generator location'</a> below.)</p><p>Battery life in ICD pulse generators has improved over time. For example, devices implanted after 2002 have significantly longer battery lives (5.6 versus 4.9 years) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Single-chamber ICDs implanted since 2002 had the longest battery life (mean 6.7 years). Contemporary ICD devices generally have an expected longevity greater than eight years and CRT- D devices greater than six years, although some ICDs have estimated battery longevity &gt;10 years [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">IMPLANTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to implanting an ICD, the provider must determine the optimal position for placement of the leads and the pulse generator.

In more recent years, there has been a trend toward single coils rather than dual-coil defibrillation leads. Dual-coil leads were favored earlier in the era of transvenous ICD systems.

For the composite primary outcome of arrhythmic death or failed appropriate shock, no DFT testing was identified as noninferior to DFT testing (with a trend toward superiority), as patients in the no DFT testing group had a lower incidence of the primary outcome (7 percent per year versus 8 percent per year in the DFT testing group), with no significant differences in the secondary safety outcomes noted between the two groups. Similarly, in the NORDIC ICD trial, which also randomized patients receiving a first ICD to have or not have DFT testing at the time of ICD implantation, no DFT testing was identified as noninferior to DFT testing (also with a trend toward superiority) and was also associated with a trend toward fewer procedure-related adverse events [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].
