         Prostate cancer is among the most common cancers in males worldwide, and while many present with clinically localized low- or very low-risk disease there is evidence that patients are being diagnosed at a later stage given reduced rates of screening [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Some males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer have no demonstrable distant metastases, but have an extensive primary tumor (T2b or higher), regional lymph node metastases (N1), or other factors associated with an increased risk of local recurrence or progression to disseminated disease (serum prostate-specific antigen ≥10 ng/mL or Gleason grade group 3 or higher)  (

         This topic discusses the initial management approach for prostate cancer at intermediate and high risk for recurrence and dissemination based on clinical and radiographic staging. The approaches to the treatment of low-risk prostate cancer and to males with distant metastases are discussed separately. The management of patients who are managed with radical prostatectomy and are considered to be at increased risk following pathologic staging is also discussed separately.

         The approach to initial treatment is based on the initial risk stratification and an assessment of the patient's suitability for definitive local therapy. Our suggested approach is outlined in the algorithm  (

         For males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer, treatment selection is based on several factors including digital rectal examination, serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), results from prostate biopsy, and the results of imaging studies, including prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):

         Clinical staging is based on a digital rectal examination by an experienced clinician which contributes to assessing the extent of disease, a pretreatment serum PSA, the Gleason score/grade group  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) in the initial biopsy, and the number and extent of cancer involvement in the biopsy cores. This information allows the stratification of males with localized disease into clinical risk categories according to the primary tumor.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Most North American clinicians use the risk stratification system of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) to define clinical risk categories  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). This risk stratification system has been utilized in guidelines for treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer from the American Urological Association (AUA)/American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), which have been largely endorsed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [
         <a href="#rid3">

         Imaging studies (radionuclide bone scan, computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen and pelvis, multiparametric MRI, positron emission tomography [PET] using prostate specific radionuclides such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET are used selectively to assess for extraprostatic extension, regional adenopathy, or distant metastases, depending on the initial clinical stage and estimate of risk. Imaging for distant disease is not routinely recommended for very low- and low-risk prostate cancer according to the risk-based clinical staging system described above, while radionuclide bone scan (for unfavorable but not favorable intermediate-risk) and cross-sectional imaging (of the pelvis with or without abdominal imaging) are recommended for those with intermediate- and high-risk disease [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. However, recent FDA approval of PSMA PET scanning for staging of localized high-risk disease may replace bone scans and the method of staging particularly since it may also serve to identify nonosseous metastases. Indications for prostate MRI are evolving, but it is often recommended for males with high-risk disease. (See

         The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer uses the clinical stage of disease (or pathologic stage, in those who have undergone prostatectomy), the baseline serum PSA, the histologic grade group (based on the Gleason score), and the extent of prostate involvement (as assessed at the time of surgery) to divide patients into prognostic stage groups  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/z/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">
          table 1A

          table 1B
         </a>
         ). Among patients without distant metastases, these groups can also be used for selection of initial treatment according to risk, although we prefer to use the clinical risk categories as defined by the NCCN. It should be noted that a detailed evaluation of histology, and the impact of tumor size (rather than just the number of positive cores) and gene expression profiling are not fully captured by these risk groups. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94751.html" rel="external">
          "Molecular prognostic tests for prostate cancer"

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Taken together, information derived from clinical staging and imaging studies are used to inform treatment options. Guidelines from AUA/ASTRO and ASCO endorse shared decision making, which explicitly considers not only risk stratification but also patient values and preferences, life expectancy, pretreatment general functional status and genitourinary symptoms, expected post-treatment functional status, and potential for salvage treatment [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6943.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A major problem is that current stratification systems to estimate risk of progression were based on data from patients who did not undergo MRI or targeted (MRI/transrectal ultrasound) prostate biopsy. As this is becoming more of a standard of care internationally, it is believed that the accuracy of estimating disease risk according to pretreatment assessment (especially the underestimation of disease risk) will improve over time.

         Radiation therapy (RT), which may be administered using external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) alone, EBRT combined with a brachytherapy boost, or brachytherapy alone. Brachytherapy alone for intermediate-risk disease is primarily limited to those with favorable intermediate-risk disease (FIR). Patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk (UIR) disease can be treated with RT alone (EBRT with or without brachytherapy), but for most patients we suggest combined RT plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

         Males with clinically localized prostate cancer have more extensive disease based on the presence of extraprostatic extension (cT3a) or seminal vesicle invasion (cT3b). In addition, patients with less extensive disease may be classified as being at high risk because of a serum PSA ≥20 ng/mL or a histologic grade group of 4 or 5 (Gleason score of 8 to 10). Patients whose initial evaluation suggests locally advanced disease with seminal vesicle involvement, tumor fixation, or invasion of adjacent organs are classified as being at very high risk for progression or recurrence (cT3a/b or cT4). In addition, patients with grade group 5 disease are classified as very high risk. (See

         EBRT for high-/very high-risk disease should always be administered with long-term ADT. RT may be administered using EBRT alone or EBRT combined with a brachytherapy boost. (See

         For males with grade group 5 disease, some observational data suggest that dose escalation with EBRT plus brachytherapy decreases prostate cancer-specific mortality and is associated with decreased all-cause mortality compared with either EBRT alone or RP. (See

         RP with pelvic lymph node dissection is an option for males with locally advanced disease without tumor fixation to adjacent structures. Patients who initiate treatment for locally advanced disease should be counseled preoperatively that adjuvant therapy may be recommended following RP based on the histologic findings of the removed prostate and surrounding tissues, as well as margin status.

         Patients who are managed with RP are staged pathologically based on the resection specimen. Following RP, patients with more extensive local disease, positive surgical margins, or microscopic involvement of regional lymph nodes may require additional treatment or a change in their treatment plan. The management of patients with significant changes in their staging based on examination of the surgical resection specimen is discussed separately. (See

         There are no data from adequately powered randomized trials that compare RP with RT specifically for males with intermediate-, high-, or very high-risk prostate cancer, although approximately one-fourth of patients included in the phase III Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial had such disease [

         Surgery may be preferred over RT for males with intermediate- or high-risk disease who have a prior history of bladder or rectal cancer, or severe intractable non-cancer-related lower urinary tract obstructive symptoms that are not amenable to medical therapy (eg, obstruction related to benign prostatic hyperplasia or detrusor instability) or surgical therapy (eg, severe benign prostatic hyperplasia with median lobe hyperplasia). Prior transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is a relative contraindication for brachytherapy (either alone or in combination with EBRT).

With a median follow-up of eight years, the 10-year overall survival was significantly increased with the combination of RT plus ADT compared with ADT alone (55 versus 49 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85). Similarly, the death rate due to prostate cancer was decreased (15 versus 26 percent, HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34-0.61).

        </p>
        <p>
         AS is based on the assumption that initial assessment (particularly if it incorporates new tools such as prostate MRI) is reasonably accurate for risk stratification, and that serial monitoring can successfully identify subclinical progression at a time when treatment is still curative in intent, and no more morbid than definitive treatment delivered at the time of diagnosis. The primary concerns with AS are twofold:

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         A major advantage of AS is the avoidance or deferral of treatment-associated side effects. (See

         There are no trials directly comparing AS versus definitive treatment for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. None of the studies described above examining the benefits of definitive treatment had a control arm that included modern AS. (See

         The available data from prospective AS cohorts specifically reporting outcomes for intermediate-risk patients managed with AS have been mixed [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18-28
         </a>
         ]. While some institutions have shown that males with intermediate-risk prostate cancer have progression-free rates similar to those with lower-risk disease (in which AS is often the preferred strategy), others, including the PIVOT trial described above [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,20,22,29

         As an example, the group from Toronto found significantly poorer outcomes at 15 years in males undergoing AS for intermediate-risk disease compared with those with low-risk tumors [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,22
         </a>
         ]. In this analysis comparing outcomes in 237 patients with intermediate-risk disease with those in 708 patients with low-risk disease, metastasis-free, overall, cause-specific, and treatment-free survival rates were all significantly poorer at 15 years for those with intermediate-risk disease (eg, for metastasis-free survival, HR 3.14, 95% CI 1.51-6.53, 82 versus 95 percent, HR 3.75, 95% CI 1.37-10.28), and there was an increased risk of developing metastatic disease (4.6 versus 0.8 percent) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. However, this finding was driven primarily by males with predominant Gleason pattern 4 cancer in the biopsy, rather than males who were categorized as intermediate-risk based on PSA or T stage. Notably, MRI of the prostate was not used in this study to select males for AS and this might help in the detection of high-grade disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6922.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Specific subgroups of males with intermediate-risk disease (ie, those with "unfavorable-risk disease") are perceived as being at higher risk of inferior outcomes if definitive therapy is deferred. While a number of retrospective studies have sought to refine protocols for selecting males with intermediate-risk disease for AS by utilizing large datasets to examine associations of clinical risk factors with adverse pathology at RP [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,29-32
         </a>
         ], it remains unclear whether extrapolating these data to separate males into FIR and UIR disease for decisions about AS is valid. This uncertainty has led to different groups having different definitions of FIR versus UIR disease and disparate recommendations for which patients are appropriate for AS  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130140" href="/z/d/graphic/130140.html" rel="external">
          table 7
         </a>
         ). The one area of agreement is that individuals with unfavorable-risk disease, regardless of definition, are not appropriate candidates for AS.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tissue-based genomic prognostic markers can be used in males with FIR disease to discover those who might have more aggressive disease, and better served by definitive therapy. However, while these tests are currently being used for treatment decision-making, better evidence is needed before they can be considered a standard component of the decision-making process for or against AS. This subject is presented in detail elsewhere. (See

The overall rates of freedom from local recurrence were 96 and 92 percent at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and freedom from systemic progression was 96 and 89 percent at 5 and 10 years, respectively.

         For males with regionally localized intermediate-, high-, or very high-risk prostate cancer who choose RP as their primary therapy, a role for any form of neoadjuvant therapy remains uncertain, but is under active investigation. We concur with current guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) that do not recommend this as a standard approach [

         For patients with adverse histologic features (extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle involvement, positive margins, or unsuspected lymph node disease), postoperative adjuvant therapy may be indicated. This topic is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

        <p>
         Importantly, if the PSA fails to fall to undetectable levels or if the PSA subsequently rises following prostatectomy, patients are presumed to have residual or recurrent disease. Such patients should be evaluated for evidence of metastatic disease, and subsequent therapy is dictated by the results of that evaluation. Low levels of persistently elevated PSA following prostatectomy may reflect retained normal prostate tissue rather than residual disease, but these patients cannot be identified except with long-term follow-up.

         RT is an accepted standard option for both intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. For most males with intermediate risk and all males with high risk, ADT is given in combination with RT. (See

        <p>
         RT may be administered using external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) alone, EBRT combined with a brachytherapy boost, or brachytherapy. Guidelines from ASCO/Cancer Care Ontario recommend that males with unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk localized prostate cancer be offered combined brachytherapy when receiving EBRT [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ], a position that is endorsed by the American Brachytherapy Society/American Radium Society Appropriate Use Criteria Genitourinary Committee [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. However, this is a controversial area, and not all agree that combined therapy provides clinically superior outcomes [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. Guidelines from AUA/American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) suggest either dose-escalated hypofractionated EBRT or combined EBRT plus brachytherapy in this setting, along with a risk-appropriate course of ADT [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. We would endorse shared decision making, informing males that combined treatment may improve clinical outcomes (mainly biochemical recurrence rates but not overall survival) but may also worsen treatment-related toxicity. One setting in which we prefer EBRT plus brachytherapy over EBRT alone is in males with prognostic grade group 5 disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If combined therapy is chosen, multiple different brachytherapy isotopes for permanent prostate brachytherapy and varying fractionation regimens for high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy have been shown to be effective, are acceptable, and are consistent with recommendations from the American College of Radiology, the American Brachytherapy Society [

         At some institutions, males without clinical evidence of pelvic lymphadenopathy who have an estimated risk of nodal involvement &gt;15 percent are offered elective treatment of the pelvic lymph nodes (whole-pelvis radiation therapy [WPRT]). In our view, this is acceptable but not mandatory. (See

         Contemporary EBRT for prostate cancer utilizes three-dimensional conformal techniques (three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy [3D-CRT]), generally delivered by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with image guidance, often referred to as "image-guided" radiation therapy. For most males who have chosen EBRT for treatment of localized prostate cancer, professional guidelines from ASTRO, ASCO, and the AUA suggest moderate hypofractionation RT over conventional fractionation RT [

         The benefits of adding a brachytherapy boost to EBRT remain uncertain. Several randomized trials have shown that the addition of a brachytherapy boost to EBRT reduces local recurrence and improves biochemical control, but does not significantly reduce the development of metastatic disease or improve survival [

We would endorse shared decision making, informing males that combined treatment may improve clinical outcomes (mainly biochemical recurrence rates but not overall survival) but may also worsen treatment-related toxicity. One setting in which we prefer EBRT plus brachytherapy over EBRT alone is in males with prognostic grade group 5 disease  (

Although biochemical failure was associated with increased mortality and randomization to combined therapy doubled the rate of biochemical failure, this did not translate into an improvement in overall survival.

         At some institutions (including those of some, but not all, of the authors and editors of this topic), males with localized prostate cancer who have chosen RT, who are without clinical evidence of pelvic lymphadenopathy, and who have an estimated risk of nodal involvement &gt;15 percent are offered elective treatment of the pelvic lymph nodes (whole pelvis RT, WPRT) in conjunction with prostate RT and ADT, whereas others have suggested different thresholds [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. However, this is a controversial area, and many radiation oncologists do not treat the pelvic lymph nodes electively. In our view, WPRT is acceptable but not mandatory in these cases.
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, WPRT is generally recommended for males with clinical or pathologic node-positive disease. (See

         Pelvic lymph node dissection is the only accurate means of assessing pelvic lymph node involvement and is generally performed in conjunction with RP for those patients at significant risk for lymph node involvement based on local extent of disease, serum PSA, and Gleason grade group (generally for those with intermediate- or high-risk disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">
          table 3

         )). Among males with clinical T3 prostate cancer who are managed with RP and thus have full pathologic staging, approximately one-quarter will be found to have radiographically occult lymph node metastases [

        </p>
        <p>
         Pelvic lymph node dissection is generally not performed in patients who will be treated with RT rather than surgery. In this setting, the decision whether or not to treat the pelvic lymph nodes electively is often based on the estimated probability of lymph node involvement. In some cases, there may be radiographic suspicion of pelvic lymph node involvement, which may be confirmed by biopsy. Imaging studies, such as pelvic CT or MRI, can be used to assess regional lymph node enlargement prior to planned definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer. However, cross-sectional imaging, which uses shape and size criteria (typically 8 to 10 mm is the threshold) to define malignant nodes, has a low sensitivity. Micrometastases can be detected in as many as 30 percent of radiographically "normal" pelvic lymph nodes [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65,66
         </a>
         ]. However, it is highly likely that newer more sensitive imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with prostate-specific tracers (eg, gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen [Ga-68 PSMA-11],
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="131739" href="/z/d/drug information/131739.html" rel="external">

          flotufolastat F-18
         </a>
         ), will better identify males with subclinical node positivity at an earlier stage. These two PSMA-based PET radiotracers are approved in the United States for males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and suspected metastases who are candidates for initial definitive therapy, and are now widely available. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16992.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         However, for males without clinical or biopsy-proven node-positive disease, there is no consensus on what tool to use to estimate which males have an estimated risk of nodal involvement that exceeds 15 percent, and might therefore benefit from elective WPRT. Options include the Partin tables, the Roach formula [
         <a href="#rid67">

        <p>
         Elective RT to the pelvic lymph nodes (WPRT) has been advocated in males with a significant estimated likelihood of having disease in the regional nodes. This was mainly on the basis of multicenter randomized trials in favor of combining prostate EBRT and ADT, most of which included pelvic RT in the RT field. However, no randomized trial has shown a clear advantage for WPRT over ADT plus prostate RT alone, and WPRT adds more toxicity to the RT regimen. Thus, this practice remains controversial [

         Three randomized trials have directly addressed the role of WPRT compared with prostate-only RT, none of which demonstrates a clear benefit for WPRT [

        <p>
         In the latest update, at a median follow-up of 8.8 years (14.8 years for living patients), there were no significant differences in PFS or overall survival when males treated with WPRT were compared with those managed with prostate-only RT [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. However, there appeared to be an interaction between ADT and RT field size. Within the group that received WPRT, there was a trend toward better PFS and overall survival with neoadjuvant plus concurrent (two months before and during) ADT as compared with only adjuvant ADT (median PFS 30.2 versus 28.4 months, HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.43). Furthermore, when comparing neoadjuvant hormonal therapy with either prostate-only RT or WPRT, WPRT is associated with better PFS (28.4 versus 23.5 percent, HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.43), albeit at the cost of increased late grade ≥3 gastrointestinal toxicity (7 versus 2 percent). However, the study was insufficiently powered to show a statistically significant difference between these two treatment arms.

         Clinicians should inform patients considering brachytherapy that it appears to have similar effects to EBRT with regard to erectile dysfunction and proctitis, but that it can exacerbate urinary obstructive symptoms [

As a result, for males with clinically localized prostate cancer and intractable non-cancer-related lower urinary tract obstructive symptoms or who have undergone a "significant" transurethral resection of the prostate, brachytherapy is relatively contraindicated, and prostatectomy is preferred for appropriate surgical candidates. Techniques, patient selection and oncologic outcomes with brachytherapy alone are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         ADT has an established role in conjunction with EBRT for males with regionally localized high-risk or very high-risk prostate cancer, although its role is less well defined for those with intermediate-risk disease. Patients with UIR disease can be treated with RT alone (EBRT with or without brachytherapy), but for most patients, we suggest combined RT plus short-duration ADT.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach is consistent with year 2018 ASCO guidelines, which advocate ADT in conjunction with EBRT (with or without brachytherapy) for males with high- or very high-risk prostate cancer but do not provide guidance on this issue for intermediate-risk disease [

         For males with high-/very high-risk disease treated with EBRT with or without brachytherapy, we recommend long-term ADT (ie, 12 to 36 months versus 2 to 4 months) plus RT rather than RT alone. The optimal duration of ADT has not been definitively determined, but we prefer a 24-month duration of ADT for most males. Individuals who place a greater value on quality of life (QOL) during treatment might reasonably choose to limit ADT to 12 to 18 months of therapy. (See

         The use of ADT in combination with EBRT has traditionally been the standard treatment for males receiving RT for regionally localized high-risk prostate cancer, based on the improvements in cancer-specific and overall survival observed in multiple randomized trials [

         These findings are best demonstrated by the results of an individual patient data meta-analysis of six trials examining ADT use in conjunction with RT for high- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid85">
          85
         </a>
         ]. Across seven randomized trials (5136 patients, median follow-up 12.9 years), the addition of ADT to RT significantly prolonged metastasis-free survival (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.89), corresponding to a 10-year absolute benefit of 8.6 percent (95% CI 5.8-11.4). Use of ADT also improved overall survival (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.92), corresponding to an absolute 10-year benefit of 7.7 percent (95% CI 4.9-10.4). The benefits were seen regardless of risk group, patient age, or radiotherapy dose.

         <a href="#rid86">
          86,87
         </a>

         The benefits of ADT versus brachytherapy in males undergoing EBRT for intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer were addressed in a network meta-analysis of nine trials comparing EBRT with or without ADT, and three trials comparing EBRT with or without a brachytherapy boost (one of which excluded the use of ADT [

Bayesian modeling demonstrated an 88 percent probability that EBRT resulted in superior overall survival compared with EBRT plus brachytherapy. The authors concluded that if a brachytherapy boost was added to EBRT, that the addition of ADT was needed to prevent the inferior overall survival that would result from the omission of ADT.

         The addition of ADT to EBRT clearly increases the likelihood and severity of treatment-related effects on sexual function in most males [
         <a href="#rid89">
          89,90

        <p>
         All of these risks are increased with a longer duration of therapy. Efforts to minimize the impact of prolonged ADT have led to several trials that have compared shorter with longer courses of ADT. (See

         In a trial in 206 males with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer in which patients were randomly assigned to RT with or without a six-month course of ADT, at a median follow-up of 16.6 years, RT plus ADT was associated with better overall survival than RT alone for the 157 males with no or minimal comorbidity (15-year survival rate 43.8 versus 30.5 percent, p = 0.04) [

         For males with high-/very high-risk disease treated with EBRT with or without brachytherapy, we recommend long-term ADT (ie, 12 to 36 months versus 2 to 4 months) plus RT rather than RT alone.

         The optimal duration of ADT has not been definitively determined. Guidelines from ASCO, which largely endorse year 2018 guidelines from the AUA/ASTRO/Society of Urologic Oncology [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,99
         </a>
         ], generally recommend treatment for 24 to 36 months rather than a shorter duration of treatment. Updated year 2022 guidelines from AUA/ ASTRO recommend treatment for 18 to 36 months in this setting [

         The main drawback of prolonged ADT is the higher incidence of clinically important side effects, such as impotence, loss of libido, long-term hypogonadism, osteoporosis, and possibly, cardiovascular issues, although there does not appear to be an increase in cardiovascular mortality. Importantly, testosterone recovery rates have not been consistently assessed in the available studies comparing short versus longer duration of ADT. ADT regimens of various lengths have the potential for long-term and potentially life-long castration. (See
         <a class="local">

         Efforts to minimize the impact of prolonged ADT have led to several trials that have compared shorter with longer courses of ADT [

          100-112

         ]. These included comparisons of 24 versus 4 months (RTOG 9202 and DART01/01 GICOR), 18 versus 6 months (RADAR), and 36 versus 6 months (EORTC 22961). (See

         The issue of ADT duration was addressed in an individual patient data meta-analysis of trials examining adjuvant ADT prolongation when used in conjunction with RT for high- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid85">
          85
         </a>
         ]. Across four randomized trials (3774 patients, median follow-up 10.9 years), the addition of prolonged ADT (ie, 13 to 36 versus 2 to 6 months) to RT significantly prolonged metastasis-free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78-0.91), corresponding to a 10-year absolute benefit of 7.7 percent (95% CI 4.0-11.4). Prolonged ADT also improved overall survival (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.94), corresponding to an absolute 10-year benefit of 5.6 percent (95% CI 2.0-9.2). The benefits extended to all risk group, patient age, or radiotherapy dose, and the p-value for interaction in all subsets was significant.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the only trial comparing two different "prolonged therapy" ADT options, 630 males with high-risk (T3/4, PSA &gt;20 ng/mL, or Gleason score &gt;7), node-negative prostate cancer were randomly assigned to either 18 or 36 months of ADT beginning prior to RT [
         <a href="#rid108">
          108
         </a>
         ]. At a median follow-up of 9.4 years, there were no statistically significant differences between 18 and 36 months of ADT in 5-year (86 versus 91 percent) or 10-year overall survival (62 percent in both groups), the global HR for death (1.02, 95% CI 0.81-1.29), or the rates of biochemical treatment failure (31 versus 25 percent). QOL analysis showed a significant difference in 6 of 21 scales (physical, emotional, and social functioning; fatigue; hormone treatment-related symptoms; and sexual activity) and 13 items favoring 18 months of therapy, with two scales (hot flushes and enjoyable sex) judged as clinically relevant given the difference in mean scores of over 10 points.
        </p>
        <p>
         The authors concluded that 36 months was not superior to 18 months of ADT. However, the trial was not designed as a noninferiority trial, and we believe that such trials will need to meet noninferiority criteria to supplant the current standard of a longer duration of ADT. As a result, we continue to prefer a longer duration of ADT for most males (typically 24 rather than 36 months, based on RTOG 9202 [
         <a href="#rid100">
          100,101
         </a>
         ]), particularly those with very high-risk disease. Nevertheless, individuals who place a greater value on QOL during treatment and a relatively lesser value on the uncertainty of prostate cancer-related outcomes might reasonably choose to limit ADT to 12 to 18 months of therapy, an approach that was used in the ASCENDE-RT trial [

         We do not advocate lifelong ADT after RT for males with grade group 5 prostate cancer without distant metastatic spread. We treat most of these males with 24 months of ADT, followed by close PSA monitoring. Patients receiving definitive treatment for prostate cancer with histologic grade group 5 disease have a worse outcome than do those with lower grade group scores. However, in general, this is not a failure to control disease locally and, instead, reflects a high rate of micrometastases present at diagnosis. (See

         For most males with high- or intermediate-risk disease who are beginning treatment with RT, we suggest initiating ADT prior to rather than initiating in the adjuvant setting. Some data suggest initiating androgen deprivation concurrently may be an appropriate alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no consensus as to the optimal duration of neoadjuvant ADT, and practice varies. For most individuals with high-risk disease, we suggest two to eight months of neoadjuvant ADT before commencing RT, while for those with intermediate-risk disease, we suggest two to three months of neoadjuvant ADT rather than a longer duration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Longer durations of neoadjuvant therapy (ie, seven to eight months versus two to three months) may maximize cytoreduction prior to EBRT or brachytherapy, and achieve a greater prostate volume reduction [

          Is there benefit for neoadjuvant versus adjuvant ADT during RT?
         </strong>
         – Randomized trials have demonstrated conflicting results in regards to initiating ADT in the neoadjuvant setting versus during or after RT. Meta-analyses suggest some benefits with adjuvant administration in patients receiving PORT (rather than WPRT), but have methodologic issues.

         As an example, in an analysis of patient level data from 12 randomized trials that included patients receiving neoadjuvant/concurrent or concurrent/adjuvant short-term ADT with RT for localized disease, the following was observed [

         In 3049 patients receiving WPRT, ADT sequenced either before or after RT was associated with similar progression-free and overall survival; however, adjuvant/concurrent therapy was associated with higher rates of distant metastases (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1).

         In 4355 patients receiving PORT, concurrent/adjuvant ADT was associated with improved overall survival (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.83), as well as metastasis-free survival (10-year benefit 8 percent, HR 0.65), distant metastases (HR 0.52), and prostate cancer–specific mortality (HR 0.30).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         By contrast, although a previous meta-analysis of two randomized trials in males receiving PORT showed improved PFS with adjuvant versus neoadjuvant/concurrent ADT (15-year survival of 36 versus 29 percent), metastasis-free and overall survival were similar [

         Overall, we do not consider these data sufficient to justify initiating ADT in the adjuvant setting. The interpretation of the data on the sequencing of ADT and EBRT continues to evolve. Based on available evidence, the most common practice is to give ADT prior to EBRT or concomitantly.

Prolonged neoadjuvant ADT also did not improve overall survival (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82-1.10). In subset analysis, benefit for prolonged therapy could not be shown for either the high-risk or intermediate risk subgroups.

         Whether ADT should consist of a GnRH agonist alone or with the addition of an antiandrogen during treatment initiation has not been addressed in a randomized trial.

         Factors associated with a poorer prognosis and increased cancer-specific mortality included a clinical stage T2 or T3 primary tumor, a Gleason score of 8 to 10, and a higher serum PSA. A combined modality approach was used more frequently in patients with multiple negative prognostic factors, and these patients had a higher mortality. However, multivariate analysis incorporating all of these factors found that prostate cancer-specific mortality was significantly lower in patients treated with brachytherapy plus both EBRT and ADT compared with brachytherapy alone (adjusted HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.73).

With a median follow-up of 8.8 years, there was a trend toward improvement in the eight-year RFS rate with chemotherapy plus ADT versus ADT alone (62 versus 50 percent, HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.94).

         Additional evidence supporting a potential role for chemotherapy in high-risk patients comes from the STAMPEDE trial, which included males with both metastatic disease and high-risk nonmetastatic disease [

         Lymph node involvement may be diagnosed clinically based on imaging studies prior to definitive treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         For most males who are candidates for definitive therapy, radiation therapy (RT) including the whole pelvis in conjunction with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) given before, concurrently (two months before and during), and postradiation is the preferred option. Extrapolating from the experience with patients with regionally localized high-risk prostate cancer, ADT should be continued for a total of 18 to 24 months after RT.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although radical prostatectomy (RP) is not included in guideline statements (including those of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network), increasing numbers of retrospective series suggest a benefit for carefully selected patients. We reserve this approach for healthy patients with grade group 4 and 5 disease and minimal suspected regional lymphatic spread. There is no consensus on this definition, but one that we utilize is regional nodes that are positron emission tomography scan positive only or less than 2 cm on cross-sectional imaging. If surgery is chosen, we employ a combination strategy that includes postoperative ADT and/or RT.
        </p>
        <p>
         Males with clinical evidence of lymph node involvement are classified as having stage IV disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/z/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">
          table 1A

          table 1B
         </a>
         ), regardless of the extent of their primary tumor, and thus, are not officially categorized as having either intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. However, clinical evidence of lymph node involvement (stage IVA disease) in the absence of distant metastases does not preclude definitive therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16992.html" rel="external">
          "Initial staging and evaluation of males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer", section on 'Evaluation of the regional lymph nodes'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         While there are no randomized trials establishing the role of definitive therapy in males with clinically evident lymph nodes, observational data from large and comprehensive population-based studies suggest that initial radical therapy in males at high risk of disseminated prostate cancer may provide selected patients with survival benefits [
         <a href="#rid139">
          139-143
         </a>
         ]. The selection criteria remain undefined and at the discretion of a well-communicated discussion between the patient and clinician.
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefits of local therapy can be illustrated by an analysis from the National Cancer Database that identified 2967 males with clinically node-positive prostate cancer without distant metastases (stage IVA  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 graphicRef110729" href="/z/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">
          table 1A-B

         )) at presentation [
         <a href="#rid139">
          139
         </a>
         ]. Overall, 1987 males were treated with definitive local therapy (either RT, with or without ADT, or RP, with or without ADT), and 980 received ADT alone. Definitive local therapy was associated with a significantly better overall mortality-free survival at five years compared with ADT alone (78.8 versus 49.2 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.74). There was no statistically significant difference between those treated with RT and those managed with RP. Although there were important baseline differences between males treated with definitive local therapy and those managed with ADT alone, the difference in overall mortality-free survival remained significant on multivariate analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another propensity-score-adjusted analysis of outcomes for males with locally advanced (T3-4N0) or regionally advanced (T3-4N1) prostate cancer derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute concluded that males treated with RP plus RT had a lower risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality than did those undergoing RT plus ADT, albeit with higher rates of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence [
         <a href="#rid144">
          144
         </a>
         ]. However, retrospective analyses such as these are limited because of unmeasured confounding bias and selection bias that may have accounted for at least a portion of the observed survival difference.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other population-based observational series also support a survival benefit for definitive treatment in males with clinically node-positive prostate cancer [

        <p>
         While there are no randomized trials comparing RT alone with RT plus ADT that were conducted exclusively in males with clinical evidence of lymph node involvement, the available data in males with high-risk localized disease and trials that included some patients with pathologic lymph node involvement demonstrate that the addition of ADT to RT improves local control and decreases the incidence of distant metastases. We generally suggest both neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT (two months before and during RT), based on results from Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9413 [

         – For most males undergoing RP, we suggest not using neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) prior to RP (
