Early recognition that a patient's airway may be difficult to manage allows the clinician to plan the anesthetic to minimize the potential for serious airway-related morbidity.</p><p>This topic will review the incidence of difficulty with airway management in infants and children during anesthesia, and strategies for management of the anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway. Management of the difficult airway in adults and the difficult pediatric airway in the emergency setting are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6391.html" rel="external">"The difficult pediatric airway for emergency medicine"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2146312885"><span class="h1">PREDICTION OF THE PEDIATRIC DIFFICULT AIRWAY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Difficulty with airway management may be anticipated based on the preanesthesia airway assessment or may occur unexpectedly during anesthesia. The majority of children with difficult airways (ie, difficulty with mask ventilation or intubation) can be identified preoperatively, but as many as 20 percent are unanticipated. In a prospective multicenter registry including 1018 cases of difficult intubation over the course of 2.5 years, 80 percent of patients were identified preoperatively as having a high likelihood of difficult laryngoscopy, difficult mask ventilation, or both [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>However, difficult intubation is common, and is not reliably predicted by preanesthesia evaluation in neonates and infants. In a multicenter study of 4683 intubations in children less than 60 weeks postmenstrual age, the incidence of difficult intubation (defined as two failed intubation attempts) was 5.8 percent; two-thirds of the difficult intubations were not anticipated based on preoperative examination [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Airway assessment for prediction of difficulty with airway management in children is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113570.html" rel="external">"Airway management for pediatric anesthesia", section on 'Airway assessment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2463070351"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE OF DIFFICULT PEDIATRIC AIRWAY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several studies have reported the incidence of difficulty with airway management for pediatric anesthesia. In most cases, the incidence of difficulty is higher in infants compared with older children.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The incidence of difficult bag-mask ventilation appears to be similar in children and in adults, reported at 6.6 percent for children and 5 to 7.5 percent for adults [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. In a single center prospective observational study, difficult mask ventilation occurred in 6.6 percent of children aged zero to eight years without risk factors for difficult airway management, with younger age identified as a risk factor [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. There was no association between difficult mask ventilation and difficult intubation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Several other studies have reported that difficult direct laryngoscopy (DL) and endotracheal intubation are more common in very young children. Reported rates of difficult intubation in infants vary from 3 to 6 percent [<a href="#rid2">2,6,7</a>]. Representative studies include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A retrospective study of 11,219 pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation found an overall rate of difficult DL (Cormack and Lehane grade III and IV) of 1.35 percent  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef141367" href="/d/graphic/141367.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The highest rate of difficult DL was found in children younger than one year old (4.7 versus 0.7 percent in children &gt;1 year). Additional predictors of difficult intubation included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) III and IV status, higher Mallampati score (when it could be obtained), low body mass index, and presentation for oromaxillofacial or cardiac surgery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a multicenter observational study of 4683 intubations for anesthesia in children &lt;60 weeks postconceptual age, difficult intubation occurred in 5.8 percent of patients [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A single center prospective study of 511 patients age 0 to 13 years old without known airway abnormalities who were intubated for anesthesia found a 3 percent rate of poor laryngoscopic views (Cormack and Lehane grade III and IV). All instances of difficult laryngoscopy occurred in patients less than three months old [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A study with data collected from 13 pediatric centers found that among pediatric patients, those who weighed less than 10 kg and those with short thyromental distance by physical examination had higher rates of airway-related complications [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In children who were difficult to intubate by DL the most common physical findings were micrognathia and limited mouth opening  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116089" href="/d/graphic/116089.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3916185776"><span class="h1">ANTICIPATED DIFFICULT AIRWAY MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The plan for anesthesia and airway management for the patient with a predicted difficult airway may differ from the standard approach  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134461" href="/d/graphic/134461.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef135103" href="/d/graphic/135103.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2395544839"><span class="h2">General concerns</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Management of the difficult airway for anesthesia in adults is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Concerns specific for pediatric patients include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients in whom difficult laryngoscopy, face mask ventilation, or supraglottic airway (SGA) use is expected, we suggest performing airway management in a tertiary center with experience managing the pediatric difficult airway whenever possible. This may require rescheduling elective surgery or transporting patients who are stable to another institution.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest performing a Time Out prior to pediatric difficult airway management. The Time Out should include all team members involved in the patient's care, and identify the primary airway manager, backup manager, additional roles, primary technique, backup technique, equipment needed, and potential need for an otolaryngologic surgeon or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whenever possible, we suggest obtaining intravenous (IV) access prior to induction of anesthesia for children with predicted airway difficulty, to allow rapid administration of sedatives, anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking agents, and emergency drugs. If this is not possible, appropriate doses for intramuscular administration of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12809" href="/d/drug information/12809.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12875" href="/d/drug information/12875.html" rel="external">atropine</a> should be prepared.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest administration of supplemental oxygen, including during apnea, throughout induction of anesthesia and attempts at airway management. (See <a class="local">'Apneic oxygenation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with anticipated difficult airway management, we suggest using an advanced airway management technique (eg, videolaryngoscopy, flexible scope intubation) rather than direct laryngoscopy for the first attempt at intubation (see <a class="local">'Alternative intubation techniques'</a> below). If direct laryngoscopy is used initially, or if an unanticipated difficult airway is encountered, we suggest limiting direct laryngoscopy (DL) to one attempt before switching to an advanced airway technique. Multiple attempts at DL are associated with a high failure rate and an increased incidence of complications [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], including edema, bleeding, or laryngospasm, and may convert a stable situation (spontaneously breathing or easy mask ventilation) to an unstable, "cannot intubate, cannot ventilate" scenario.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bradycardia in response to hypoxemia and airway manipulation is more common in children than in adults. When difficulty is expected, we administer <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12875" href="/d/drug information/12875.html" rel="external">atropine</a> (0.02 mg/kg) prior to airway manipulation to prevent this complication, as well as to decrease oral secretions.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3482411463"><span class="h2">Apneic oxygenation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest the use of supplemental oxygen insufflation during laryngoscopy for all children thought to be at risk for prolonged or difficult intubation, or who are at risk for rapid oxygen desaturation (patients with poor pulmonary reserve, or those undergoing rapid sequence induction and intubation) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This includes all neonates (&lt;1 month of age), since neonates desaturate more quickly, have a higher incidence of difficult airways, and are more likely to have unanticipated difficult airways compared with older infants and children [<a href="#rid2">2,11</a>].</p><p>Administration of oxygen into the posterior pharynx delays oxygen desaturation during periods of apnea, as occurs during prolonged intubation attempts. In apneic patients, oxygen extraction from the alveoli results in subatmospheric alveolar pressures, and if the airway is unobstructed, oxygen will be drawn in from the glottic opening. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113243.html" rel="external">"Preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation for airway management for anesthesia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Devices for apneic oxygenation</strong> – When we expect relatively quick success at intubation with an advanced airway technique in patients with a difficult airway, we typically use a standard nasal cannula for apneic oxygenation due to availability and ease of application and removal. In small children, we use 1 to 2 liters/minute/kg oxygen from the auxiliary oxygen flowmeter. In larger children, we use the maximum flow rate available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In cases where we expect a prolonged intubation attempt, we prefer either a humidified high flow nasal cannula or modified nasal trumpet.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A number of devices have been described for apneic administration of oxygen in children, including the following, which are shown in a graphic  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117387" href="/d/graphic/117387.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Standard nasal cannulae [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Humidified high-flow nasal cannulae [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>An endotracheal tube (ETT) placed through the nose into the posterior pharynx</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A laryngoscope blade with an oxygen side port [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>An ETT placed in the side channel of a videolaryngoscope [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nasal trumpet modified with an ETT adaptor [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Studies have reported variable effectiveness of these techniques, but all would likely allow an increased margin of safety for prolonged intubation attempts. As an example, in one study, the rate of oxygen desaturation was recorded in children who were intubated with conventional DL, or with apneic oxygenation with one of two types of laryngoscope modifications [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. All children were preoxygenated with 30 percent oxygen. The time for 25 percent of patients to reach a 1 percent decrease in oxygen saturation was 30 seconds without apneic oxygenation, 67 seconds with oxygen supplementation via a laryngoscope blade with an oxygen cannula attached to the side, and 75 seconds with oxygen administered via a videolaryngoscope with an oxygen sideport.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In another study, 48 children ≤2 years of age were randomly assigned to intubation with or without insufflation of oxygen through an ETT positioned in the side channel of an AirTraq videolaryngoscope [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. After intubation, patients were left apneic until oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) fell to 95 percent. Insufflation of oxygen prolonged the mean time to desaturation by an estimated 35 seconds (95% CI, 10 to 60 seconds), from 131±39 seconds without oxygen to 166±47 seconds with oxygen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High-flow nasal cannula</strong>– High flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) has been used to improve oxygenation in critically ill infants and children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/122550.html" rel="external">"High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The use of heated humidified high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is increasing in the operating room for both children and adults [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Studies in infants and children have reported maintenance of normal oxygen saturation with HFNO during prolonged periods of apnea and spontaneous ventilation [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. HFNO has also been used to maintain normoxia for tubeless airway surgery lasting up to one hour. The degree to which HFNO removes carbon dioxide is variable, with studies reporting conflicting results [<a href="#rid14">14,20,21</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113243.html" rel="external">"Preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation for airway management for anesthesia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Theoretical and usually clinically inconsequential disadvantages to apneic oxygenation include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The apneic oxygenation device may have to be removed, if the intubation attempt is aborted, to allow mask ventilation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intraoral devices (eg, catheter taped to the laryngoscope, side ports) may obstruct the laryngeal view during laryngoscopy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Oxygen may be insufflated into the stomach.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3342252023"><span class="h2">Alternative intubation techniques</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Alternatives to DL for intubation in children are similar to those that may be used in adults (eg, flexible scope intubation [FSI], videolaryngoscopy [VL], intubation through an SGA).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The appropriate advanced airway technique may depend on factors such as clinician preference and familiarity with techniques, patient size, mouth opening, neck mobility, physiologic reserve, apnea tolerance, and presence of blood or secretions in the airway. More important than the first intubation technique attempted is avoidance of repeated attempts of the same technique without adjustment. Therefore, additional equipment for secondary attempts using alternative approaches should be immediately available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>VL increases intubation success in both adults and children with difficult airways. VL is faster to perform and easier to set up than a flexible scope. However, a common problem is the inability to pass the ETT through the vocal cords despite having an adequate view of the glottic opening. This is particularly a problem when using a hyperangulated VL blade in infants, in whom the bulky, highly curved blade may make maneuvering the ETT into the pharynx more difficult. This may explain findings of lower rates of successful intubation with hyperangulated VL blades in infants than in older children [<a href="#rid22">22</a>], and lower success rates in infants less than 5 kg with a hyperangulated VL blade compared to a standard Macintosh or Miller VL blade [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107795.html" rel="external">"Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults", section on 'Intubation success and outcomes with video laryngoscopes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>FSI through an SGA may provide a first pass success rate similar to VL, with the added advantage of allowing continuous ventilation and oxygenation throughout laryngoscopy. In an analysis of data from the Pediatric Difficult Intubation (PeDI) registry that included 1603 difficult pediatric intubations, first pass success was similar overall with FSI through an SGA versus VL (59 percent for FSI through an SGA, 51 percent for VL) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. First attempt success rate in infants less than one year of age was higher with FSI though an SGA than with VL (54 percent versus 36 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Use of an SGA facilitates unobstructed passage of the flexible intubation scope (FIS) past the soft tissue of the oropharynx, and we prefer this technique over freehand FSI. However, FSI, even through an SGA, may take longer than DL or VL, and may be difficult or impossible if there are blood or secretions in the airway.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A hybrid technique using VL and FIS is increasingly being used. With this technique, the videolaryngoscope is inserted in the normal fashion. An ETT is loaded onto an FIS, which is used as a maneuverable stylet while watching the tip on the VL screen.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2469086255"><span class="h2">Awake intubation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intubation while awake, or with intravenous sedation and maintenance of spontaneous ventilation, should be considered if there is anticipated difficulty with endotracheal intubation and in addition, any one of the following (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults", section on 'Awake intubation'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Both mask ventilation and SGA ventilation are likely to be difficult, or</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is high risk of aspiration, or</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient will not tolerate an apneic period</p><p></p><p>Awake or sedated intubation may be impractical for young children because of lack of cooperation, and is therefore less commonly performed than in adults with difficult airways. In a multicenter observational study of 1839 pediatric patients with anticipated difficult intubations, the first intubation attempt was in awake or lightly sedated spontaneously breathing patients in only 75 cases; the rest had general anesthesia for the first attempt [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Twenty eight percent of the sedated patients had to be converted to general anesthesia for successful intubation.

When difficulty is encountered, this strategy recommends a best effort attempt at intubation, SGA placement, or mask ventilation. If the first attempt is unsuccessful, the provider either makes an adjustment to the technique or rapidly transitions to a different technique. Once adequate oxygenation is achieved with any technique, the patient enters what is called the green zone in which there is no longer a risk of imminent desaturation.

Laryngospasm often occurs during light planes of anesthesia, such as occurs during extubation.

Therefore, patients with difficult airways are at particular risk from laryngospasm-related morbidity at emergence and extubation.
