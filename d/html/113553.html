         Hypospadias is a congenital anomaly of the male urethra that results in abnormal ventral placement of the urethral opening. The location of the displaced urethral meatus may range anywhere within the glans penis, shaft of penis, scrotum, or perineum (

         Hypospadias is classified into the following categories based on the appearance of the foreskin, urethral location, and presence and degree of penile curvature. The indication and choice of surgical procedure are based on the characteristics of the different classes of hypospadias. (See

         Surgical correction for hypospadias is an elective procedure. The clinician's role is to provide information regarding the balance of potential benefits and complications to the family/caregivers. The need for urologic referral is based on the severity of the hypospadias and family/caregiver preference (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113912" href="/z/d/graphic/113912.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Urologic referral is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         needed for patients with mild defects unless the family/caregivers request surgical reconstruction
         <strong>
         </strong>
         [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. This includes patients with forme fruste of hypospadias (incomplete or partial presence of hypospadias) and patients with standard distal hypospadias (eg, urethral opening at the proximal glans, coronal margin, or just below the coronal margin) and without penile curvature (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113912" href="/z/d/graphic/113912.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). This conservative approach was supported by a report of 56 adult men with uncorrected hypospadias including 44 with a mild form who were satisfied with the appearance of their penis, voided in a standing position, and were not infertile [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, correction may be entertained for cosmetic reasons based on family/caregiver preference as some families/caregivers may want to correct any asymmetric foreskin defect for religious (circumcision), cultural, or social reasons.

          CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO CIRCUMCISION

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Hypospadias is a contraindication for routine neonatal circumcision as the foreskin is asymmetric with abnormal development on the ventral aspect of the penis. This anatomical configuration is not conducive to a safe neonatal circumcision using a Plastibell or Gomco device, due to the inability to properly place either device over the glans and have sufficient foreskin to complete the circumcision. In addition, for standard and severe forms of hypospadias, the foreskin needs to be preserved and reserved for use during the hypospadias reconstruction to help prevent fistula formation and, in severe cases, to reconstruct the new urethra. As a result, circumcision, should it be desired by the family/caregiver, is delayed until a freehand circumcision at the time of the hypospadias repair can be safely performed in the operating room.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, if unanticipated hypospadias (megameatus intact prepuce) is found at the time of neonatal circumcision due to an intact normal foreskin, it appears that the circumcision does not affect future successful reconstruction and can be completed [

         The goal of surgical correction is to create a penis with normal function and appearance with a urethral opening as close as possible to the ventral tip of the penis. Surgical correction should result in a properly directed urinary stream and a straightened penis upon erection [

          3

         General consensus within the pediatric urology community, including our own practice, is to perform surgery between six months and one year of age in full-term, healthy infants. For preterm infants, repair is delayed until age-adjusted catchup growth has occurred and other health issues that could affect safety of anesthesia have resolved. This timing, which is consistent with recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, allows ample time for completion of a two-stage procedure in patients with severe hypospadias [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In general, six months is the minimum time needed between staged procedures for severe hypospadias to ensure complete wound healing following the initial surgery.

         Numerous techniques to repair hypospadias are available and used based on the severity of the defect. All of the interventions are performed under general anesthesia and, in most cases, as a same-day (ambulatory) procedure without an overnight admission to the hospital. The time of surgery varies from one to three hours and depends on the severity of the hypospadias deformity.
        </p>
        <p>
         The operations used to correct hypospadias include:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Primary tubularization – Tubularized urethroplasty, with or without incision of the urethral plate (tubularized incised plate), is commonly used for glandular and penile shaft hypospadias repair [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. This procedure consists of making a new urethra by rolling a ventral strip of penile shaft skin (the urethral plate) that would have formed the urethra if development had not been arrested (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69788" href="/z/d/graphic/69788.html" rel="external">

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Onlay island flap – For more severe hypospadias, an onlay island flap is used in which the urethra is created by transferring a vascular strip of inner foreskin onto the ventral skin (urethral plate) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82255" href="/z/d/graphic/82255.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. The skin is sewn to the urethral plate in an onlay fashion, hence the name of the procedure.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Two-stage hypospadias repair – For the most extreme or severe forms of hypospadias, including cases with significant penile curvature, a two-stage approach is used to straighten the penis and create a new urethral opening [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. In the first operation, which is typically performed at six months of age, the curvature, if mild to moderate, can be corrected by the insertion of dorsal midline plication sutures in the nerve-free zone at the 12 o'clock position, which straightens the penis (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76582 graphicRef55604" href="/z/d/graphic/76582.html" rel="external">
          figure 3A-B
         </a>
         ). For moderate to severe curvature, ventral dermal grafting is indicated. Both techniques allow preservation of sexual function as they do not affect penile innervation. After correction of the curvature, excess dorsal foreskin is transferred to the ventral side of the penis as this tissue is required for the second stage. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6583.html" rel="external">
          "Hypospadias: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation", section on 'Anatomy'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The second operation is performed at least six months later, after healing is complete from the first procedure. In this stage, the urethra is reconstructed using the transferred dorsal skin that is now on the ventral aspect of the penis in a manner similar to the primary tubularization.
        </p>

         Penile curvature (chordee) – Correction of penile curvature is a critical step in successful hypospadias surgery. As noted, based on anatomical studies of the human fetal penis, a simpler approach is advocated for mild and moderate curvature that entails placement of dorsal midline plication sutures in the nerve-free zone at 12 o'clock (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64744" href="/z/d/graphic/64744.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. This allows for preservation of sexual function without manipulation of the penile innervation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In any of the procedures, the addition of a complete covering layer of subcutaneous tissue over the newly constructed urethra is recommended as this reduces the risk of developing a urethral fistula [

         The choice of surgical procedure depends on the type of hypospadias based on the appearance of the foreskin, urethral location, and presence and degree of penile curvature (

         Severe hypospadias – For severe hypospadias (ectopic urethral meatus located in the scrotum or perineum), there is no consensus on the best surgical approach (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6583.html" rel="external">
          "Hypospadias: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation", section on 'Severe hypospadias'
         </a>
         ). The choice is primarily based on the clinician's personal experience and preference. Major impediments in establishing best surgical clinical practice include the lack of a clearcut definition of severe hypospadias and penile curvature, defined outcome measures, and effect of potential concomitant conditions (eg, disorders [differences] of sex development) on outcome. In addition, rates of secondary surgery remain high regardless of the surgical technique used, especially for patients with more severe hypospadias [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Further studies are needed to establish consistency within the pediatric urology community for accurate diagnosis and definition of severe hypospadias, identification of potential confounding factors, measurable and clinically significant outcome measures, and appropriate timing of follow-up.

         These procedures are usually performed in an ambulatory setting, and patients are discharged on the same day of surgery. In our practice, we suggest that families/caregivers who have traveled a long distance spend the night nearby, so that if questions or problems arise during the night after the surgery, they can be addressed in an expeditious manner, thereby minimizing parental/caregiver's anxiety.

         It is important to review initial postoperative care with the parents/caregivers. This includes instructions on dressing care, pain control, double diapering if needed, bladder catheter care, diet, activity, prophylactic antibiotics, and findings that require clinical evaluation by care providers (eg, fever, excessive bleeding, urination difficulties, and intractable pain).

         <strong>
          Dressings
         </strong>
         – Patients usually go home with the original dressing consisting of a clear plastic cover over gauze pads that are taped over the penis (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113911" href="/z/d/graphic/113911.html" rel="external">
          picture 7
         </a>
         ). The dressing is typically removed two to three days after surgery, which can be done by soaking the child in the bath. The dressing may become soiled from old blood from the procedure, urine, and, rarely, a bowel movement. If this occurs in the first few days after surgery, the dressing is typically left in place and caregivers should clean around the dressing with soapy warm water (wiping away from the child's penis toward the rectum).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Once the dressing is removed, the penis may appear swollen, discolored, and/or bruised. There may also be a bloody discharge from the penis, which may result in blood spots on the dressing, diaper, or underpants. These findings are normal and will resolve with time. Bathing the area twice daily will help resolve the swelling and facilitate dissolving of the absorbable sutures.

         <strong>
          Diapers
         </strong>
         – In infants that require a catheter after the repair, we use the double diaper technique (ie, use of two diapers) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113910" href="/z/d/graphic/113910.html" rel="external">
          picture 8
         </a>
         ). The parents/caregivers should be instructed on how to arrange the double diapers, with the inner diaper used to capture stool and the outer diaper for urine drainage from the catheter. The inner diaper has a small hole cut in it where the catheter can exit, and, then, urine drains into the outer diaper.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Powder or any other ointment should not be applied to the genital area. Once the dressing soaks off, lubricant (eg, KY jelly, Vaseline, or Aquaphor) can be applied to the outer diaper where the penis will touch the diaper to prevent the child's penis from sticking to the diaper.

For patients who live far away, the catheter can be removed by a urologist or pediatrician in the community and, in some cases, a family member/caregiver can be taught how to remove the catheter.

          Bladder spasms

During an episode of spasm, the child typically will arch their back and bring their knees up to their chest and squirts of urine may be noted through or around the tube. Although spasms are not harmful, they are uncomfortable. In these patients, anticholinergic medications can be used to relieve bladder spasms until the night before the tube is removed.

         Follow-up appointments are scheduled six weeks after surgery, one year from surgery, after toilet training, and as an adolescent. At each visit, patients are assessed for signs and symptoms for urinary tract infection, fistula, diverticulum, urethral stricture, and cosmetic outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
         Following surgical reconstruction, the urinary stream should be observed. Initially, there may be some spraying of urine, which is normal. This should resolve over a few months as the swelling from the operation resolves. However, two urinary streams are suggestive of a urinary fistula and a thin urinary stream is suggestive of a urethral stricture. If this occurs, the pediatric urology team should be notified. (See

         The risk of complications varies based on the degree of hypospadias, with the lowest reported complication rate for standard hypospadias (approximately 10 percent) and a range of one-third to one-half of patients with severe repairs (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58046" href="/z/d/graphic/58046.html" rel="external">

          Urethral fistula
         </strong>
         – The most common complication following hypospadias surgery is urethrocutaneous fistula (

          picture 9

         ), which is characterized as two urinary streams because of the extra urethral opening. This complication is reported in approximately 4 to 20 percent of patients, depending on the severity of their hypospadias [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,22,24,27
         </a>
         ]. Fistula correction requires a second operation that is performed six months after the initial procedure.

          Urethral stricture
         </strong>
         – Urethral stricture can occur within the glans, which is referred to as meatal stenosis, or, less commonly, within the reconstructed urethra in the penile shaft. These children will have symptoms of straining or pushing on urination and a thin or fine urinary stream. Correction of a urethral stricture requires a second operation at least six months following the prior surgery.

         <strong>
          Urethral diverticulum
         </strong>
         – Urethral diverticulum is due to outpouching of the reconstructed urethra. These children can have ballooning of the ventral aspect of the penis on urination and dribbling from retained urine after they void. Correction of a urethral diverticulum requires a second operation, ideally at least six months following the prior surgery, unless recurrent infection requires more immediate intervention.

         <strong>
          Urinary extravasation
         </strong>
         – Urinary extravasation of the reconstructed urethra typically presents with excess penile or scrotal swelling a day or two after removing the urethral stent in patients with more severe hypospadias. This is a rare postoperative hypospadias complication due to urinary leak in the newly constructed urethra. Because a subcutaneous flap is used as secondary coverage of the urethroplasty, urine tracks subcutaneously into the penile shaft and scrotum, presenting as swelling and decreased wet diapers rather than flowing to the skin resulting in a fistula. The urinary leak is resolved by replacing the catheter or diverting the urine with a suprapubic tube, allowing the urethra to heal.

         With the variety of available techniques, surgical repair of hypospadias has resulted in improved cosmetic and functional outcome [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29

         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Reports based on patient surveys data suggest that individuals ≥14 years of age with severe hypospadias have similar interest in sex and sexual experiences compared with normal controls and those with distal hypospadias but are more likely to be dissatisfied with penile length and have concerns about physical contact [
         <a href="#rid31">

         </span>
         Based on a survey of 176 individuals with a history of hypospadias, one center reported that 40 percent required reintervention at a mean age of 18 and 19 years [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. The risk of reintervention was associated with proximal hypospadias and suboptimal urinary and sexual outcome. However, there is concern for potential bias as only one-half of the invited patients participated in the study.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Another center reported that subsequent surgery is seldom necessary for infants who underwent hypospadias repair as the reconstructed urethra grows appropriately and urinary flow is typically near normal flow rates [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         As a result, parents/caregivers can be counseled that surgical correction generally results in an excellent outcome in boys with standard hypospadias with a good cosmetic and functional repair and satisfactory genital self-perception, sexual performance, and fertility in the majority of patients with hypospadias. Additional psychosocial support is needed for individuals with severe hypospadias who are more likely to have a specific genetic diagnosis, such as a disorder of sex development and/or higher complication rate [

          Classification
         </strong>
         ‒ Hypospadias is a congenital anomaly in males that results in abnormal ventral placement of the urethral opening. It is divided into separate categories based on the foreskin appearance, urethral location, and presence and degree of penile curvature. These characteristics are used to determine the surgical management of hypospadias (

         <strong>
          Circumcision
         </strong>
         ‒ Routine newborn circumcision is contraindicated in patients with hypospadias as the devices (Plastibell or Gomco device) are associated with increased risk of complication. In addition, the foreskin needs to be preserved for possible reconstruction in cases of standard and severe hypospadias. Circumcision, should it be desired by the family/caregiver, is delayed until a freehand circumcision can be safely performed in the operating room later in life. (See

          Timing
         </strong>
         ‒ Hypospadias correction is performed between six months and one year of age in full-term, healthy infants. This timing allows for completion of a two-stage hypospadias repair (if necessary) by 18 months of age before the beginning of sex identification. For preterm infants, repair is delayed until age-adjusted catchup growth has occurred and other health issues that could affect safety of anesthesia have resolved. (See

          Postoperative care

         ‒ Because most of the cases are performed as ambulatory procedures, it is important to review postoperative care with the parents/caregivers. This includes instructions on dressing care, pain control, double diapering, diet, activity, prophylactic antibiotics, findings that require clinical evaluation (eg, fever, excessive bleeding, urination difficulties, and intractable pain), and bladder catheter care.

          Complications
         </strong>
         ‒ The risk of complications increases with increasing severity of the hypospadias, with the lowest risk associated with distal hypospadias and the highest with urethral openings in the scrotum or perineum. Late complications are common, and, as a result, long-term follow-up should include visits throughout childhood and adolescence. Surgical complications include urethral fistula, stricture, and diverticulum. (See
