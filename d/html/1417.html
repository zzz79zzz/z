Although the defect often causes no symptoms until adulthood, potential complications of an undetected ASD include atrial arrhythmias, paradoxical embolization, cerebral abscess, right ventricular (RV) volume overload with late RV failure, and pulmonary hypertension that can become irreversible and lead to right-to-left shunting (Eisenmenger syndrome).</p><p>This topic will review indications for closure and medical management of ASDs in adults. Surgical and percutaneous closure of ASDs; pathophysiology, anatomy, natural history, and clinical features of ASDs in adults; the identification and assessment of ASDs; and issues related to ASDs in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95760.html" rel="external">"Surgical and percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1418.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrial septal defects in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5779.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Management and outcome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4025259744"><span class="h1">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following issues may arise in patients with unrepaired or repaired ASDs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1132598519"><span class="h2">Atrial arrhythmias</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with ASDs are at increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter, particularly if defect closure occurs after age 25. AF should be managed according to standard recommendations. An attempt at cardioversion is generally recommended. Arrhythmia interventions can be considered in conjunction with defect closure when appropriate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1031.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1338495974"><span class="h2">Pulmonary hypertension</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Management of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) (including ASD) with secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) and Eisenmenger syndrome is discussed separately. There are a number of conditions or procedures that are associated with increased risk in patients with PH-CHD, including volume depletion, exercise, endocardial pacing, pregnancy, and traveling to or living at high altitude; patients with Eisenmenger syndrome are at particularly high risk for complications related to these conditions and also face complications related to cyanosis and pulmonary artery thrombosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119400.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension in adults with congenital heart disease: General management and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>Selected patients with PH secondary to CHD are candidates for advanced therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension, which may improve symptoms, and in some cases, may enable the patient to meet criteria for ASD closure, with advanced therapy continued after ASD closure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119400.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension in adults with congenital heart disease: General management and prognosis"</a> and <a class="local">'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2151171783"><span class="h2">Endocarditis prophylaxis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with ASDs should receive education regarding the importance of good oral hygiene and prompt medical attention for infections to reduce the risk of infective endocarditis (IE).</p><p>Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of IE is recommended during the six months after ASD closure (percutaneous or surgical) when a relevant procedure likely to result in bacteremia with a microorganism that has the potential ability to cause endocarditis is performed [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is also recommended in patients with an ASD who have a prior history of IE or a residual shunt adjacent to a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2147.html" rel="external">"Prevention of endocarditis: Antibiotic prophylaxis and other measures"</a>.)</p><p>We agree with the 2007 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on endocarditis prophylaxis, which state that an isolated or repaired ASD with no residual shunt is associated with negligible risk of endocarditis and that antibiotic prophylaxis is <strong>not</strong> warranted in these settings [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The very low risk of endocarditis was illustrated in a review of 882 adults with a secundum ASD; only three had a history of endocarditis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2147.html" rel="external">"Prevention of endocarditis: Antibiotic prophylaxis and other measures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H631362679"><span class="h2">Pregnancy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1884291097"><span class="h3">Unrepaired ASD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Young women with a small, uncomplicated ASD generally tolerate pregnancy well. A prepregnancy consultation with an adult CHD specialist is suggested.</p><p>Longevity in patients with an unoperated ostium secundum ASD spans the reproductive years. ASD is the most common repaired or unrepaired lesion occurring in pregnant women with CHD other than bicuspid aortic valve [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Many women with an ASD are unaware of their heart defect prior to pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1418.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrial septal defects in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Despite the gestational increase in cardiac output and stroke volume, young women with an uncomplicated ASD generally tolerate pregnancy (even multiple pregnancies) with no apparent ill effects [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, when women with secundum ASDs also have a history of supraventricular arrhythmias, especially AF or atrial flutter, or RV failure, the pregnancy risk increases [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>].</p><p>An important concern is the risk of paradoxical embolization from leg or pelvic vein deep venous thrombosis because emboli carried by the inferior vena cava can be directed across the ASD into the systemic circulation [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Meticulous leg care and ambulation minimizes venous stasis during gestation and in the puerperium and reduces the risk of paradoxical embolization. Use of filters on all intravenous lines should be employed to decrease the risk of paradoxical air emboli. Anticoagulation should be considered in select patients at very high risk for venous thrombosis and paradoxical embolism. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1092.html" rel="external">"Atrial septal abnormalities (PFO, ASD, and ASA) and risk of cerebral emboli in adults", section on 'Paradoxical emboli'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1339.html" rel="external">"Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in adult nonorthopedic surgical patients"</a>.)</p><p>Also important, but less well known, are the potentially deleterious effects of acute blood loss. Hemorrhage during delivery results in a rise in systemic vascular resistance and a fall in systemic venous return, a combination that augments the left-to-right shunt [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>When ASDs are associated with significant pulmonary vascular disease, pregnancy should be avoided due to the high risk of maternal and fetal mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139887.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension with congenital heart disease: Pregnancy and contraception"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2072540415"><span class="h3">Repaired ASD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women who have successfully undergone closure of a secundum ASD and have no significant residua can anticipate very low maternal cardiac risk during pregnancy. Successful closure of the defect also eliminates the hazard of paradoxical embolization.</p><p>Residual postoperative sequelae are uncommon except for atrial tachyarrhythmias with frequency related to age at intervention and prior history of arrhythmia [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The decision to close an ASD in the setting of elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures is complex given uncertain benefit and substantial risk.

(See <a class="local">'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For patients with ASD, PH, and left heart disease, test balloon occlusion of the ASD and reassessment of hemodynamics may aid in the assessment of whether ASD closure is likely to be beneficial [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. ASD test occlusion involves temporarily closing the ASD with a balloon in the cardiac catheterization laboratory by an operator experienced in performing the procedure and interpreting the hemodynamic data. Hemodynamics are assessed before and after ASD balloon occlusion and may be helpful in determining suitability for ASD closure. Features that suggest that ASD closure will not be tolerated include decrease in cardiac output and/or increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The limited data on the effects of ASD closure in this setting are discussed separately.

In some patients with ASD and moderate to severe PH, it may be possible to reduce pulmonary artery pressure and PVR to meet the threshold for ASD closure. (See <a class="local">'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119400.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension in adults with congenital heart disease: General management and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In contrast, patients with severe irreversible PH (PVR greater than two-thirds of systemic vascular resistance or pulmonary artery pressure greater than two-thirds of systemic arterial pressure) should not undergo ASD closure [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. Irreversible severe PH identifies a group of patients with reduced expected survival with prohibitively high morbidity and mortality with attempted defect repair, as discussed separately [<a href="#rid13">13,17,18</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95760.html" rel="external">"Surgical and percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects in adults", section on 'With pulmonary hypertension'</a>). It has been suggested that, in this setting, maintenance of interatrial communication provides a mechanism to maintain cardiac output at the expense of desaturation, and this may be advantageous.

However, cardiac catheterization is helpful in cases in which the cause of right atrial or RV enlargement is uncertain or PH is possible. In the absence of PH, Qp/Qs is closely correlated with the size of the ASD [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>There are no systematic data that identify a threshold value for Qp/Qs for repair of an ASD. Authors have advocated Qp/Qs thresholds ranging from Qp/Qs &gt;2:1 [<a href="#rid20">20</a>] to 1.7:1 [<a href="#rid21">21</a>] and 1.5:1 [<a href="#rid13">13,22</a>].

This syndrome has been described with ASD and patent foramen ovale (PFO), as well as with intrapulmonary shunting or ventilation perfusion mismatch [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In a patient with ASD and platypnea-orthodeoxia, the right atrial pressure may or may not be elevated; in patients with normal right atrial pressure, blood flow may be directed from the right atrium across the ASD as a consequence of altered anatomic relationships caused by an intracardiac condition (eg, prominent Eustachian valve) or an extracardiac condition (eg, severe kyphosis) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

The evaluation of the likely cause of stroke should include consideration of cardiovascular risk factors (eg, AF, age, and presence of diabetes mellitus) associated with increased risk of alternate causes of stroke. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1090.html" rel="external">"Cryptogenic stroke and embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS)", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of ASD in adults who present with paradoxical embolism is higher than expected, thus ASD should be considered as a possible cause in patients with cryptogenic stroke [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. The risk for paradoxical embolism with ASD appears to be highest in patients with other risk factors, such as tricuspid regurgitation related to Ebstein anomaly [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. There are limited data on the efficacy of ASD closure in patients with ASD and presumed paradoxical embolism. The evidence for ASD closure is largely indirect from randomized trials in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke showing decreased risk of recurrent stroke after PFO closure compared with medical therapy alone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1100.html" rel="external">"Stroke associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO): Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with an ASD are at risk for paradoxical embolization when right-to-left shunting occurs (leading to stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral emboli). In the majority of patients with net left-to-right shunts, intermittent right-to-left shunting can occur during transient increases in right-sided pressure (eg, with a Valsalva maneuver or coughing). For patients with primarily right-to-left shunting in the presence of severe PH, ASD closure is contraindicated.

Surgical closure is recommended for patients with secundum ASD requiring closure when percutaneous repair is not feasible or appropriate [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Sinus venosus, coronary sinus, and ostium primum defects are closed surgically by congenital heart surgeons, as they are not generally amenable to percutaneous device closure (although there are case reports of percutaneous closure of these defects). In addition, most of these ASDs have associated cardiac lesions that benefit from intervention, such as anomalous pulmonary veins and atrioventricular valve abnormalities.

More frequent follow-up is recommended for patients with symptoms or hemodynamic sequelae such as RV enlargement or PH or other complications.
