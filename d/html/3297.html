         A surgical robot is a computer-controlled device that can be programmed to aid the positioning and manipulation of surgical instruments. Surgical robotics is typically used in laparoscopy rather than open surgical approaches. Since the 1980s, surgical robots have been developed to address the limitations of laparoscopy, including two-dimensional visualization, incomplete articulation of instruments, and ergonomic limitations. The goal of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery is to help surgeons improve patient care by converting procedures that would have otherwise been performed by laparotomy into minimally invasive procedures. Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery has all of the advantages of minimally invasive surgery, including less postoperative pain, smaller and possibly more cosmetically appealing incisions, shorter hospital stay, shorter recovery time, and faster return to work.
        </p>
        <p>
         In its initial phase, robot-assisted procedures were performed almost exclusively by surgeons with advanced laparoscopic skills. However, since the da Vinci robot (one type of robot-assisted surgical platform) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in gynecologic surgery in 2005, there has been rapid adoption of robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures in gynecology by surgeons of all skill levels. Based on data published in 2008 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], there were more than 645 da Vinci systems in use worldwide, and since then, there continued to be an exponential rise in the use of these surgical systems to 3477 units by late 2014 [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ] and over 5000 units installed in 2018 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Barriers to the adoption of robotics in surgery include the expense, training requirements for physicians and nurses, and lack of high quality data. Similar to conventional laparoscopy, robot-assisted laparoscopy has been widely adopted prior to emergence of data supporting efficacy and safety.

         Supervisory – Robot serves as a navigational aid or a precise positioning system (usually using preoperative imaging studies) to direct the surgeon to a lesion or other surgical target (eg, Minerva). Intraoperative ultrasound may be used to guide a surgeon to a tumor within an organ such as the liver or kidney. As an example, gynecologic oncologists use colorimetric or fluorometric sentinel lymph node mapping during robot-assisted surgery for endometrial cancer [

         Immersive – Surgeons are using the robot as a tool, but are deeply engaged in the operative field as if they were actually right at the operative field. This is made possible by high quality imaging, magnification of the three-dimensional (3D) laparoscope, and use of a direct line of sight to position the instruments that the surgeon's hands are controlling.

         Haptics – The lack of haptics (ie, tactile feedback) is a limitation of robot-assisted surgery. The surgeon cannot actually feel the resistance of the tissue as the instrument meets or manipulates the tissue, but accommodates for this by using visual cues and knowledge of anatomy and surgical planes based upon previous surgical experience and study of anatomy.

         Robot-assisted laparoscopic camera holder introduced (1994). The Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning (AESOP) was the first robot-assisted device approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in intraabdominal surgery; AESOP would later be included in an integrated robotic surgical system, however, this system is no longer available (2001, Zeus) [

         While conventional laparoscopy has led to notable improvements in surgery, challenges include limitations in optics and instrumentation, need for advanced surgical training to perform complex procedures (specifically in laparoscopic suturing and knot-tying, ureterolysis, and dissection of and within the retroperitoneal space), and poor surgeon ergonomics remain challenges [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,10
         </a>
         ]. Robot-assisted laparoscopy has features which overcome the difficulties of conventional laparoscopy and may also introduce new surgical options (eg, remotely performed surgery). However, cost is higher and operative time (including time for robot set-up and disassembly) is typically longer, particularly when a surgeon is learning the technique. Surgeon fatigue is minimized by use of a console at which the surgeon may sit comfortably.

         <strong>
          Comparison with laparotomy
         </strong>
         – Conventional and robot-assisted laparoscopy share similar advantages over laparotomy, including decreased morbidity, rapid recovery, and improved aesthetics of incisions. However, both of these minimally invasive routes have introduced trocar injuries, insufflation related problems, and trocar-site abdominal wall hematomas when compared with laparotomy. As with conventional laparoscopy, there is an increased risk of bladder and ureteral injury with robot-assisted laparoscopy compared to open surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Delayed thermal injuries are also increased compared with laparotomy because of increased use of electrosurgical instruments in conventional and robot-assisted laparoscopy procedures. Increased incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence has also been reported with robot-assisted and conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. This has been attributed to the use of monopolar energy to perform the colpotomy incision and risk of lateral spread of thermal energy and subsequent inadequate closure due to inadequate purchase of tissue during suturing of the vaginal cuff. Many surgeons advocate barbed suture to facilitate vaginal cuff closure, while others favor closing the vagina from below as in routine vaginal hysterectomy. (See

         <strong>
          Unique complications of robot-assisted surgery
         </strong>
         – Unique complications that may occur with robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery include mechanical breakdown of the robot equipment, use of excessive pressure on various tissues due to lack of tactile feedback, erroneous activation of a control, errant movement or positioning of a robotic arm, or loss of a needle outside of direct vision while the console surgeon is zooming in on various structures. Newer system designs have reduced or eliminated some of these complications.

          Data specific to gynecologic surgery for benign indications

          Superior visualization
         </strong>
         – Conventional laparoscopy provides two-dimensional (2D) imaging of the operative field. A robotic system affords a 3D vision while allowing rapid zooming and panning of the camera. The newer systems have enhanced visualization with automatic white balancing, calibration, and focus.

         <strong>
          Mechanical improvements
         </strong>
         – A fulcrum effect is created when rigid conventional instruments pass through the incision, thereby leading to inversion of movement from the surgeon's hand to the working end of the instrument [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. When an instrument is introduced into a trocar, the abdominal wall is the fulcrum. When a surgeon's hand moves in one direction, the instrument moves in the opposite direction. If a patient is obese, there is more torque placed on an instrument and the rigid smaller caliber instruments, such as laparoscopes, may fracture. Robotic instruments are less likely to break, thus, many surgeons prefer robot-assisted laparoscopy in patients with obesity. This is because all robotic instruments are 8 mm wide and attached to the robotic arms, which in turn are attached to the robotic cannulas (trocars). The force that the abdominal wall places on each instrument is sustained by the trocar and mechanical robotic arm. The robotic laparoscope is 8 or 11 mm in diameter and is also introduced through a trocar, which is docked to the robotic scope arm. In contrast, conventional laparoscopy is performed with 3 or 5 mm instruments that are introduced through smaller trocars.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Also, similar to the human arm and hand, robotic instruments have seven degrees of freedom, which allow wrist-like or "EndoWrist" movement that facilitates suturing, especially for trainees. Conventional rigid laparoscopic instruments only have four degrees of freedom. While flexible laparoscopic instruments (eg, Autonomy Laparo-Angle) can also move with seven degrees of freedom, their use requires additional training because the movements are not intuitive [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         The older da Vinci systems are not designed for abdominal surgery involving more than two quadrants (the device needs to be redocked and repositioned to operate in the quadrants it is not facing). The upgraded da Vinci Si and "X" systems have 50 percent more range of motion in the robotic arms but may still require redocking. The newer, more costly da Vinci Xi models do not need to be redocked to operate in opposite quadrants because the arms, which rotate as a group, are connected to an overhead boom allowing unobstructed access to the patient.

In simplified terms, there are several mechanical checks and balances built into current robotic surgical systems so that the risk of mechanical failure is minimized.

         Prior to docking the robot, it may be appropriate to use a conventional laparoscope to explore the entire abdomen if the surgeon prefers a 5 mm visual port entry. In some circumstances, conventional laparoscopy can be used to free adhesions, or mobilize bowel, to allow the needed ports for the robot. Simply because a robotic procedure is possible does not mean that conventional laparoscopy cannot be used. For gynecologic procedures, the following incisions are typically made, although care is taken to both limit the number of incisions and types of instruments  (

For newer surgical systems, the port placement is closer and equidistant (8 cm between instruments) because the laser targeting placement allows ease in positioning of the arms, which rotate as a unit  (

         The equipment tower supporting the robotic arms can be docked centrally (ie, placed between the patient's legs  (

         ), depending on the system. Side-dock location provides unobstructed access to the lower abdominal quadrant and pelvic structures (eg, vagina, perineum). Side docking can be performed with the robot tower positioned 45 degrees to the patient's left or right leg stirrup or in parallel to the patient's bed. For gynecologic surgery, side docking has been reported to improve access to the vagina and perineum and reduce assistant fatigue and the potential for injury due to a collision with the robotic arms. In our practice, we perform parallel side docking of the robot tower in the majority of procedures due to improved efficiency and ease and greater access to the vagina and perineum [

         ]. The da Vinci Xi system has an overhead arm architecture that can provide the surgeon with anatomical access from virtually any position, simplifying multiquadrant surgeries. Smaller, thinner arms coupled with longer instrument shafts also permit a greater range of motion and more flexibility. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Vaginal access for gynecologic surgery'

        <p>
         Surgeons are seated at a console, view the operative field via a binocular device, and place their hands in the "masters" hand controls, which translate the movements of their hands into an electric signal which travels via a cord to the surgical cart and activates the robotic arms. These "masters" can be modified to adjust the ratio of motion of the surgeon's hand to that of the robotic arms (motion scaling). As an example, a 3:1 ratio allows for every 3 cm of movement by the surgeon, only 1 cm movement by the robotic arm. Another "masters" modification adjusts the speed at which the instruments move. The hand controls also filter hand tremors, resulting in error reduction and more efficient suturing and dissection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surgeons supinate and pronate their hands while stepping on the camera foot pedal to focus the picture. There are buttons on the hand controls to clutch the arms and thus the instruments in order to improve instrument precision. The dual console system improves a surgeon's ability to teach a trainee because both surgeons are able to sit at a console simultaneously, visualize the operative field in 3D, and swap control of various instruments  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79637" href="/z/d/graphic/79637.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Foot pedals control the camera, energy devices, and "masters." The pedals act to toggle each of these functions (ie, if you press on the camera foot pedal, the movement of the hand controls moves the camera in the same direction; if you press down on another foot pedal [corresponding to a robotic arm], you activate the energy source associated with the attached instrument).
        </p>
        <p>
         The robotic arms, located on the surgical cart, are attached to surgical instruments through a robotic instrument adapter. An 11 mm telescope is connected to the central robotic arm and contains two 5 mm telescopes, producing 3D vision  (

         <a href="#rid4">

        <p>
         Disadvantages of the da Vinci system are similar to those of other robotic systems, including a lack of tactile feedback and the bulkiness of equipment (restricts placement of accessory ports in small patients and movement of operating room staff), limited instrumentation, and difficulty changing the patient's position. TransEnterix's Senhance system is less bulky as it has individual units that are brought into the surgical table  (

         ). The control unit is not immersive and special glasses are used to obtain a 3D image. Cost remains a major drawback for all robotic systems and instrumentation, which in the current economic environment cannot be underestimated.

         There are several available uterine and vaginal manipulators. Placement of the uterine manipulator is performed during set up of laparoscopic equipment. Some of these can be attached to a device that is placed between the patient's legs, thus replacing the role of a vaginal surgical assistant. As an example, RUMI instruments are attached to the Uterine Positioning System. With this system, the device may be held in place by one or two stitches in the cervix. Other manipulators, such as VCare and Valchev, do not require stay sutures. Choice of uterine manipulator is a matter of surgeon preference.

         Surgical simulation, telementoring, and telepresence surgery are potential novel benefits of robot-assisted technology. Physical distance between an expert surgeon in a telementoring or telepresence set-up requires safeguards in case of mechanical failure or surgical complication (eg, latency of signal from mentoring to operating surgeon, failure of internet lines), although these have not yet been established.
        </p>

         Robot workstations can transmit video and audio information to a surgical simulator [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,33
         </a>
         ]. Robotic simulation could allow rehearsal of procedures with the potential for reduction in complication rates and learning curves, and even for the development of new technical approaches. In addition to providing input integration of imaging registered with an interventional robotic platform, robots can capture data regarding how a surgeon performs specific tasks. In one study, robotic surgery training based upon simulation was equally effective as that based upon live animal models [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. However, simulation-based training in robotic surgery is still under investigation and not in wide use because of cost and access.
        </p>
        <p>
         Telementoring provides the ability for an experienced physician at a remote site to be able to mentor a less experienced surgeon in training or in real time [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35-38
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in one report, transmission of audio and 3D video with telestration between a group of surgeons in the United States and Italy allowed telementoring of urologic procedures [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. However, this function was provided only by the Zeus system, which is no longer available. When two consoles are available with the da Vinci Si system, the surgeon is able to mentor another surgeon by maintaining control of various instruments and swapping instruments. There are no published data yet to support routine use of a dual console system compared with an attending surgeon standing at bedside to assist a training surgeon.
        </p>
        <p>
         Telepresence surgery is another innovation which may be possible with robotic technology. The largest series (n = 21) is from Canada, where a group of general hospital surgeons performed surgery at a distance of 400 km using the Zeus system [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. There were no conversions to laparotomy, however, a skilled surgeon was present at the remote site to manage complications and complete the surgery conventionally, if necessary. Information was transmitted using commercially available internet lines with a signal latency of 135 to 140 milliseconds, which was easily perceived by the surgeons. The US Food and Drug Administration requires that all operations using a telerobotic system are performed in the same room as the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         The speed of information transmission is a key element in telepresence surgery. Surgeons are able to complete tasks with a delay in operating room to console signal transmission of up to 500 milliseconds [

         Surgeons should set up three robotic cases prior to scheduled training in an animal laboratory at various robotic-training centers so that they can immediately implement the training and reinforce what they learned in the animal or cadaver laboratory. Trainees are also required to pass five online training modules in order to obtain a certificate that documents their training experience. The number of mentored patient procedures leading to independent practice varies from institution to institution and will likely be individualized based on surgical experience and technical ability. Additionally, many institutions are imposing a certain volume of cases so that surgeons maintain a competent skill level, although individual differences in acquiring skills make an arbitrary number of completed cases illogical. Additionally, performance of one type of pelvic surgery does not necessarily mean another type of pelvic procedure can also be performed safely. Credentialing requirements vary among institutions, and many institutions are in the process or have recently established criteria for credentialing surgeons to perform procedures on robotic platforms. Finally, in the United States, there is no current residency curriculum requirement established by the Residency Review Committee for robot-assisted surgery.

         Surgical learning curves depend on two aspects of surgical volume: total number of procedures performed and the time interval between procedures [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43,44
         </a>
         ]. Experience from urologic surgery suggests that acquiring robotic skills is possible with intensive training (eg, a five-day course) [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45-47
         </a>
         ], but further study is needed for other surgical specialties. Proficiency in a new procedure includes both the procedure itself and the ability to manage complications [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. In addition, safe surgical practice also depends upon continued surgical volume after training, just as for open procedures. Additionally, most experts agree that a surgeon should be competent in performing a procedure via laparotomy before learning a robotic approach. However, if a procedure is performed almost exclusively via a minimally invasive, rather than open, approach, then the trainees may learn to perform it with robot-assisted or conventional laparoscopy as the standard approach.

          Examples of purchase costs

         ]. The da Vinci system cost ranges between USD $1.8 and 2.3 million, depending on the system, and each instrument attached to the robotic arm costs between USD $2200 and $3500. These arms must be replaced after 10 uses. For example, in our practice, for a robot-assisted sacral colpopexy, we use a pair of scissors, electrosurgical and bowel grasping forceps, and two needle drivers, which each cost USD $220 to $350 per case, for a total procedure cost of USD $1270. However, this cost could be decreased if we used a grasper as a needle driver; nevertheless, this may decrease suturing efficiency and increase total operating room time, and thus cost, as a result.

          Cost-effectiveness analysis

As noted above, robot-assisted cases cost approximately $2000 more per case than the same procedure performed by conventional laparoscopy. (See

More prospective studies are required to analyze overall costs (direct and indirect) of robot-assisted procedures to health care systems. Further investigation is warranted.

          What is a surgical robot?
         </strong>
         – A surgical robot is a computer-controlled device that can be programmed to aid the positioning and manipulation of surgical instruments. The goal of robotic gynecologic surgery is to use a minimally invasive approach to perform procedures which are generally performed by laparotomy or are too complex for conventional laparoscopy or surgeons who are novices in laparoscopic surgery.

The major advantage to the patient is a potentially shorter hospital stay, and more rapid postoperative recovery and return to full function. (See
