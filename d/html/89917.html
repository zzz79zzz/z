         The flexible bronchoscope is a device that can be used for indirect laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation, and it is particularly useful when direct laryngoscopy is difficult or impossible or would be dangerous to perform. For endotracheal intubation prior to induction of general anesthesia, flexible bronchoscopy is better tolerated than direct or video-assisted laryngoscopy.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the equipment and techniques used for flexible bronchoscopic intubation, including patient preparation and sedation for awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation. Retrograde intubation using a percutaneous wire will also be discussed.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the term "flexible fiberoptic intubation" has been used for this technique in anesthesia, newer bronchoscopes no longer use fiberoptic technology. Therefore, this topic will use the terms "flexible scope intubation" (FSI) for the technique and "flexible intubating scope" (FIS) for the device.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other airway devices, techniques for endotracheal intubation, and management of the difficult airway for anesthesia are discussed separately.

         FSI may be performed before or after the induction of general anesthesia. Indications for awake intubation include anticipated difficult airway management and the need for a postintubation neurologic exam (eg, unstable cervical spine)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94754" href="/z/d/graphic/94754.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">
          "Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults", section on 'Awake intubation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         FSI is more difficult to perform under general anesthesia than in the awake patient, as the loss of pharyngeal muscle tone leads to upper airway collapse and limited fiberoptic visualization [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most cases are performed using the oral route. The nasal route may be preferred for the patient with a severely limited mouth opening or a strong gag reflex, or if a nasotracheal intubation is necessary for the surgical procedure. Nasal intubation may be better tolerated than oral intubation by the awake patient. In addition, a laryngeal view is often easier to obtain using the nasal approach because the flexible intubating scope (FIS) tends to remain in the midline, with the tip directed at the glottis as it enters the oropharynx.
        </p>
        <p>
         The risks of nasal intubation include epistaxis, trauma to the nasal turbinates, and submucosal tunneling in the nasopharynx. Preparation of the nasopharynx is necessary prior to the procedure in order to minimize the chance of bleeding. (See
         <a class="local">

         An assortment of equipment is required for FSI, including the flexible intubating scope (FIS), bite blocks or specialized oral airways, adaptors for ventilation, endoscopy facemasks, antifogging and lubricating agents, equipment for topicalization, and a video monitor. In addition, supraglottic devices designed to facilitate endotracheal intubation can be used along with flexible scopes and may be included with routinely stocked equipment. Equipment for FSI is often kept on a cart that is transported to the intubating location.

         The FIS is used to locate the vocal cords and acts as a stylet for the endotracheal tube (ETT) once the FIS is placed into the trachea.
        </p>
        <p>
         The FIS consists of a flexible insertion cord that contains either optical fibers or a small camera and a light source at the tip, used to transmit images to an eyepiece or camera head  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67231" href="/z/d/graphic/67231.html" rel="external">

          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The cord includes a working channel for suction or administration of oxygen or local anesthetic and a cable that allows the operator to flex the tip of the scope. The cord attaches to a handle with a control lever for flexion/extension of the tip, a working channel port, and either an intrinsic video monitor or a connection to an external monitor.
        </p>
        <p>
         The FIS is available in various sizes. Bronchoscopes used for intubation need to be narrow enough to fit through an appropriately-sized ETT and long enough for the tip to pass beyond the larynx (including the length of the ETT threaded over the shaft):

         </span>
         Specialized oral airways for FSI are designed to keep the scope in the midline and to act as a bite block for awake oral FSI. Flexible scopes are delicate instruments; a bite block is used to prevent damage to the scope if the patient bites down on it.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are several types of oral airways for FSI (eg, Ovassapian, Berman, and Williams)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99992" href="/z/d/graphic/99992.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ). The shape is similar to that of a standard oropharyngeal airway used to maintain an open airway for spontaneous or mask ventilation in deeply sedated or anesthetized patients. Because it rests on the base of the tongue and the posterior pharynx, placement of an oral airway may elicit a gag reflex in conscious patients. Therefore, they are used only in patients with general anesthesia, heavy sedation, or with excellent local anesthetic topicalization of the tongue and pharynx.

         Healthy patients are unlikely to require oxygen administration or ventilation during the brief period required for fiberoptic intubation. However, supplemental oxygen should be administered in patients with decreased physiologic reserve or functional residual capacity (ie, pediatric, pregnant, and obese patients), or during difficult FSI, including awake intubation. The use of high-flow nasal oxygen through nasal cannulae or transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE) is easy to implement during transoral FSI and should be strongly considered. Oxygen delivery with or without ventilation may also be provided with a standard facemask with a bronchoscopic adapter attached, or with a specialized endoscopy mask constructed with a port for the bronchoscope  (

          Endotracheal tube

         – Difficulty advancing the ETT through the vocal cords over the FIS is a relatively common problem during FSI. The ETT can be placed in warm

A flexible ETT, the tapered-tip ETT for use with the intubating laryngeal mask airway (LMA), or a specialized ETT with a bull-nose tip (Parker Flex-Tip) may facilitate advancement. We usually use a Parker ETT for FSI. (See

          Lubricating agent
         </strong>
         – A lubricant facilitates passage of the ETT over the FIS. We use water-based lubricants applied shortly before laryngoscopy, keeping in mind that they can become sticky as they dry. Petroleum-based lubricants have traditionally been avoided in the past in order to minimize damage to the outer coating of the FIS shaft, but this is not a problem with newer scopes. There is a theoretical concern for the development of exogenous lipoid pneumonia with petroleum- or silicone-based lubricants due to deposition of lipids in the lung, however the small amounts needed for FSI are likely insufficient to be clinically significant. Lubricant should be kept away from the tip of the FIS because it may obscure the view [

         The airway begins at the nares, the external openings of the nasal passages. The nasal cavity leads to the nasopharynx, followed by the oropharynx, which extends inferiorly to the level of the epiglottis. The hypopharynx begins at the level of the epiglottis and terminates at the level of the cricoid cartilage, where it is continuous with the esophagus  (

         The larynx is a complex structure of cartilage, muscles, and ligaments, which serves as the inlet to the trachea. When viewed from the pharynx, as during fiberoptic bronchoscopy, the larynx begins at the epiglottis  (

          picture 3

         ). The most superior structures within the laryngeal cavity are the false vocal cords. Beneath these are the true vocal cords. The space between the vocal cords is termed the glottis [

         Most often, FSI is performed using the oral route. The endotracheal tube (ETT) may be loaded on the flexible intubating scope (FIS) prior to inserting it and moved up the full length of the shaft to the handle in order to avoid interference with movement of the scope. We tape the ETT directly to the scope handle using the pilot balloon to keep it from sliding. If the ETT connector is removed prior to placement on the FIS, it must not be lost; we tape it to the breathing circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
         A bite block or intubating oral airway may be placed, if desired. When using an intubating oral airway, it is usually easier to place the ETT into the oral airway to a depth of 5 cm, rather than loading it directly onto the FIS. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Oral airway'

         above.)

        <p>
         The oropharynx should be suctioned prior to inserting the FIS.
        </p>
        <p>
         The FIS should be oriented so that the tip can be moved up and down in the midline. The FIS is inserted (without a bend at the tip) along the midline of the oropharynx. The FIS must remain in the midline as it is directed around the base of the tongue in order to achieve a satisfactory view of the larynx. When the posterior oropharynx is encountered, the tip should be flexed and advanced around the base of the tongue until the epiglottis or glottis is seen  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94913" href="/z/d/graphic/94913.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). Suction or insufflation of oxygen may be used to clear additional secretions that obscure the view.
        </p>
        <p>
         Local anesthetic may be sprayed on the cords to decrease reactivity (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">
          lidocaine
         </a>
         4%, 1 mL). The FIS should be advanced through the vocal cords to the level of the carina  (

         ), and the ETT advanced over it. The initial depth for oral intubation should be 22 cm for women and 24 cm for men. After visualization of tracheal rings with the FIS, the FIS may then be withdrawn from the ETT, and the position of the ETT can be confirmed with end-tidal carbon dioxide and breath sounds in the usual manner.

         For nasal intubation, the ETT should be placed in warm

         for several minutes to soften it and make it more flexible in order to minimize bleeding caused by trauma to the nasal mucosa.
        </p>
        <p>
         The more patent nostril should be selected for intubation. This can be determined by manually occluding each nostril separately and asking the patient to inhale through the nose. The patient will usually be able to inhale more easily through one naris. Alternatively, one can use the scope to visualize the nasal passages or use soft plastic nasopharyngeal airways to gauge patency of the nasal airway.
        </p>
        <p>
         The ETT should be lubricated, and lubricant should be applied to the selected naris by passing a nasopharyngeal airway liberally coated with 4%

         ointment.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are two methods for navigating the nasal passage during flexible scope nasal intubation. Loading the ETT onto the FIS and first performing nasal endoscopy ensures that the more favorable route through the nasal passage is taken (beneath the inferior turbinate). This route is associated with less epistaxis and may decrease the incidence of avulsion of a nasal turbinate. The disadvantage of this technique is that one may navigate the FIS through the nasal passage and into the trachea only to find that the nasal passage is insufficient to accommodate the ETT. Gauging nasal patency with a nasopharyngeal airway with an outer diameter at least 1 mm larger than the ETT to be placed can help to mitigate this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alternatively, a warmed, softened ETT is inserted into the naris to a depth of approximately 14 to 15 cm prior to inserting the FIS [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The bevel of the ETT should face the lateral wall of the nasal passage, and cephalad traction should be applied to the ETT as it is advanced in order to minimize the risk of damage to a nasal turbinate and to maximize the odds of the ETT passing inferiorly to the inferior turbinate. The FIS is then passed through the ETT; most often, the larynx is visible as soon as the scope tip exits the ETT. The authors prefer this technique.
        </p>
        <p>
         The oropharynx should be suctioned prior to inserting the FIS. Secretions that obscure the view may be cleared using suction or insufflation of oxygen through the working channel. The tip should be directed by using the control lever, rotating the entire FIS, and advancing or withdrawing the scope until the cords are directly ahead of the tip. Local anesthetic (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">
          lidocaine
         </a>
         4%, 2 to 3 mL) may be sprayed on the cords to decrease reactivity prior to passing through the larynx. The FIS should be advanced through the cords to the level of the carina, and the ETT advanced over it. The initial depth of insertion of the ETT for nasal intubation should be 26 cm for women and 28 cm for men [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. After visualization of tracheal rings with the FIS, the FIS may then be withdrawn from the ETT and the position of the ETT can be confirmed with end-tidal carbon dioxide and breath sounds in the usual manner. (See

         Retrograde intubation is used most commonly in the unstable cervical spine, in upper airway malignancy, in mandibular fracture, or when the vocal cords cannot be visualized due to blood, secretions, or anatomic variations; it may be used in combination with a FIS. A wire (or catheter) is inserted percutaneously through the cricothyroid membrane and blindly cephalad along the trachea, larynx, pharynx, and out of the mouth or naris; this wire is then used to guide passage of an ETT from the mouth or nose into the trachea.
        </p>
        <p>
         This technique may be used with or without a FIS. Commercially available retrograde intubation kits have a 0.037-inch guidewire that may not fit through the working channel of some FISs, so compatibility must be checked prior to using this technique with a FIS.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the guidewire is retrieved from either the mouth or naris, retrograde intubation begins by securing the wire with a hemostat outside the cricothyroid insertion site in order to avoid pulling through and to maintain tension. When this is performed without an FIS, an airway exchange catheter (AEC) is then threaded over the taut wire until it passes the larynx. After removing the wire, an ETT is advanced over the AEC to the appropriate distance (usually to 22 cm for women, 24 cm for men), confirmed in the usual fashion, and secured.
        </p>
        <p>
         When a FIS is used for assistance, an ETT is placed on the FIS prior to retrieving the end of the wire from the mouth or naris and passing it through the working channel of the FIS from distal to proximal. The FIS is then passed over the guidewire and into the glottis until resistance is met at the cricothyroid membrane. The hemostat that held the guidewire taut may now be released and the guidewire removed. The FIS is advanced until the carina is visualized and the ETT is passed into the trachea.

         The primary advantages to using an FIS for this technique are [

         When laryngoscopy is difficult, it is critical to keep the tip of the FIS in the midline at all times in order to allow visualization of the larynx. The clinician should always be able to recognize the airway structures; if not, the FIS should be withdrawn until the location can be identified.

         Collapse of the upper airway, whether from induction of general anesthesia, administration of neuromuscular blocking agents, or from anatomic pathology, can cause difficult visualization or navigation of the oropharynx.

         The gap between the FIS and the larger ETT may allow the ETT to shift off-center and catch as it passes through the larynx. An Aintree catheter loaded over the FIS within the ETT will minimize this gap, but this must be done prior to inserting the FIS.

         Flexible scope intubation (FSI) is an indirect technique for endotracheal intubation using a flexible bronchoscope. FSI is particularly useful for patients in whom direct laryngoscopy may be difficult or dangerous (eg, limited mouth opening, abnormal airway anatomy, unstable cervical spine). (See

          Retrograde intubation
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         When other methods for intubation are not possible, retrograde intubation can be performed with or without the use of a FIS. A wire is inserted into the trachea through the cricothyroid membrane and passed cephalad, exiting the mouth or nose. The wire can be fed through the working channel of the FIS; the FIS, loaded with an ETT over it, is passed over the wire into the trachea. The ETT is then passed over the FIS into the trachea. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Retrograde intubation'
         </a>
         above.)
