The features and diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children, and the evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5990.html" rel="external">"Urinary tract infections in infants and children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6605.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4030658425"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dysuria describes symptoms of pain and/or burning associated with urination. This commonly reported sensation is produced by the muscular contraction of the bladder and the peristaltic activity of the urethra, both of which stimulate the pain fibers of the edematous and inflamed mucosa. In addition, pain may occur when urine comes into contact with the inflamed mucosa.</p><p>In young children, the caregiver may report dysuria because of crying associated with urination or a wet diaper. In these patients, the chief complaint of dysuria is not as specific and may reflect other sources of discomfort. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Young children may complain of painful urination when they are instead experiencing related symptoms, such as pruritus as is seen with <em>Enterobius vermicularis</em> (pinworms). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/134115.html" rel="external">"Vulvovaginitis in the prepubertal child: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment", section on 'Pinworms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diaper dermatitis may present with dysuria caused by skin irritation after voiding. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5795.html" rel="external">"Diaper dermatitis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Children who have experienced sexual abuse may present with a complaint of dysuria, which has no physical basis, or they may exhibit behaviors that are interpreted by adult observers as indicative of genital pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6605.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents", section on 'Presentation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dysuria has a wide range of infectious and noninfectious causes, but it usually stems from one of several common disorders of childhood and adolescence  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55819" href="/z/d/graphic/55819.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Most children with dysuria as a chief complaint will have primary disorders of the genitourinary tract. Although patients with urethritis secondary to systemic illnesses may have dysuria as one of their many symptoms, this specific complaint is only occasionally the principal reason for seeking care.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Life-threatening conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe mucocutaneous reactions, most commonly triggered by medications, characterized by extensive necrosis and detachment of the epidermis, which may affect the mucous membranes throughout the body; this produces conjunctivitis, oral ulceration, and urethritis. Infection with <em>Mycoplasma</em> <em>pneumoniae</em> may cause a similar constellation of findings, referred to as reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME, formerly known as <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>-induced rash and mucositis [MIRM]). Dysuria may be present, but the primary finding is a rash consisting of ill-defined, coalescing erythematous macules with purpuric centers, although many cases of SJS/TEN may present with diffuse erythema  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67632 graphicRef68458 graphicRef59418 graphicRef66134" href="/z/d/graphic/67632.html" rel="external">picture 1A-D</a>). The skin is often tender to the touch and skin pain can be prominent and out of proportion to the cutaneous findings. Lesions start on the face and thorax before spreading to other areas and are symmetrically distributed. The scalp is typically spared, and palms and soles are rarely involved. Atypical target lesions with darker centers may be present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2091.html" rel="external">"Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120346.html" rel="external">"Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Common conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although children with dysuria may have an infection of the genitourinary tract, noninfectious processes that irritate periurethral tissue also often cause dysuria, especially in the prepubertal female.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Infectious causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infections of the genitourinary tract and perineum, and less commonly systemic infections, frequently cause dysuria.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5582841"><span class="h4">Urethritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Urethritis is a localized infection that commonly produces a discharge. In adolescents, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> are the most commonly isolated pathogens [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. When herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes urethritis, vesicles and/or ulcers are usually apparent on examination [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Note that HSV in prepubertal children may occur from autoinoculation, in conjunction with either herpetic stomatitis or herpetic whitlow, or may result from sexual contact. Autoinoculation of HSV in prepubertal children is more common in males. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115.html" rel="external">"Sexually transmitted infections: Issues specific to adolescents", section on 'STI clinical patterns'</a>.)</p><p>A sexually transmitted etiology in prepubertal children should raise concern for sexual abuse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6605.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p>Bulbar urethritis, a urological problem that affects adolescent males, presents with dysuria and microscopic hematuria. It is presumably of viral origin [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H865257733"><span class="h4">Cystitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with cystitis or lower urinary tract infection (UTI) often present with suprapubic pain or tenderness. They may or may not have fever, which, if present, is usually low grade. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6012.html" rel="external">"Acute infectious cystitis: Clinical features and diagnosis in children older than two years and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5990.html" rel="external">"Urinary tract infections in infants and children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5582849"><span class="h4">Balanitis and balanoposthitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Younger males may develop a nonspecific bacterial infection of the distal penis with involvement of the glans penis (balanitis) or, if uncircumcised, both the glans and the prepuce (balanoposthitis)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67724" href="/z/d/graphic/67724.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Painful swelling of the glans penis and foreskin are typically present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6483.html" rel="external">"Balanitis and balanoposthitis in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5582857"><span class="h4">Vaginitis and cervicitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaginitis may cause dysuria in both prepubertal females and adolescents [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. In many cases, the physical examination reveals a discharge, which varies from scant (nonspecific vaginitis) to thick and green (gonorrhea) to white and cheesy (<em>Candida</em>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/134115.html" rel="external">"Vulvovaginitis in the prepubertal child: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115.html" rel="external">"Sexually transmitted infections: Issues specific to adolescents", section on 'STI clinical patterns'</a>.)</p><p>Sexually transmitted pathogens and <em>Candida albicans</em> are frequently isolated in postpubertal females. Cervicitis is seen in postpubertal females and is associated with sexually transmitted infection (STI). Like vaginitis, it typically presents with vaginal discharge. However, isolated dysuria is also well described. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5460.html" rel="external">"Acute cervicitis"</a>.)</p><p>These same organisms occur much less frequently in prepubertal females, one must consider nonsexually transmitted agents, such as Group A <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Shigella</em> species. When sexually transmitted pathogens are isolated in prepubertal females, the clinician should suspect sexual abuse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6605.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents", section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3726851146"><span class="h4">Pyelonephritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pyelonephritis, defined as infection of the upper genitourinary tract, is the most serious infection of the genitourinary tract among nonsexually active children and adolescents. It usually manifests with fever, frequently above 38.5 to 39°C, and flank pain or tenderness (older children and adolescents). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5990.html" rel="external">"Urinary tract infections in infants and children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Older children'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5582873"><span class="h4">Pelvic inflammatory disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Asymptomatic infections of the lower genitourinary tract by <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em> may lead to the development of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in postpubertal females, which can have serious consequences if left untreated. Although PID may be accompanied by dysuria, fever and abdominal/pelvic pain are usually the chief complaints. Vaginal discharge and cervical motion tenderness are frequently present upon examination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7581.html" rel="external">"Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Noninfectious conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Irritation around the urethra from any source can cause dysuria.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5582889"><span class="h4">Nonspecific (chemical) urethritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Potential local irritants include detergents, fabric softeners, perfumed soaps, and possibly bubble baths. Patients may have either no physical findings or only mild erythema, but they generally do not develop a discharge.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5582897"><span class="h4">Local trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Minor injury is another relatively common cause of urethral irritation. In both older children and adolescents, normal self-exploratory sexual play, masturbation, voluntary sexual activity, placement of a urethral foreign body, or sexual abuse may be the source of the trauma. As in patients with chemical urethritis, the examination is generally unremarkable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3615848145"><span class="h4">Urinary stones</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Urinary stones (nephrolithiasis) develop occasionally in children and adolescents, often in the setting of anatomic abnormalities and/or recurrent infection. Although flank pain and hematuria is the usual presentation, stone passage may occasionally be associated with a complaint of dysuria. Children with idiopathic hypercalciuria and idiopathic hyperuricosuria, known antecedents of renal calculi, may complain of dysuria even in the absence of an observable stone and may also have hematuria. A minority of patients with urinary stones may also have a UTI. The evaluation of children with hematuria due to kidney stones, hypercalciuria, or hyperuricosuria is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6123.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6089.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of microscopic hematuria in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6108.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of gross hematuria in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Other conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of other conditions may uncommonly cause dysuria in children.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Urethral strictures</strong> – Urethral strictures, both congenital and acquired, may present with signs of obstruction such as urinary retention, as well as dysuria [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dysfunctional elimination</strong> – Dysfunctional elimination is a condition that may mimic UTI or urethritis, but it does not usually present acutely.

After two to three days, a characteristic pruritic rash appears centrally and then spreads peripherally  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55533" href="/z/d/graphic/55533.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef122504" href="/z/d/graphic/122504.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). By the second or third day of the eruption, lesions may involve the perineum and vagina and lead to a complaint of itching and/or dysuria.

Affected females most often seek care for a perineal rash, but they may complain of pruritus. The appearance of lichen sclerosus, which consists of a depigmentation around the vagina and anus in the shape of an hourglass, is usually diagnostic  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55275" href="/z/d/graphic/55275.html" rel="external">picture 6</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57910" href="/z/d/graphic/57910.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>).

(See <a class="local">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Most causes of dysuria in children can be identified based upon careful history, physical examination, and targeted ancillary testing:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>History</strong> – Important historic questions for children with dysuria relate to the presence of symptoms outside of the genitourinary tract, fever, local exposures, trauma, and sexual activity. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – On physical examination, key findings include fever, evidence of systemic disease (eg, conjunctivitis, arthritis, or rash), genital discharge, or genital lesions.

(See <a class="local">'All patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</strong> – Patients with urethral, vaginal, or cervical discharge; sexually active patients; or those with suggestive genital lesions warrant testing for STIs. The choice of specific testing depends upon whether the evaluation is due to suspicion of sexual abuse or relates to evaluation of an adolescent engaging in consensual sexual intercourse. (See <a class="local">'Possible sexually transmitted infection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Postmenarcheal females</strong> – Postmenarcheal females warrant pregnancy testing in addition to urine tests and, if indicated based upon clinical findings, testing for sexually transmitted infection. Several of the conditions causing dysuria occur more frequently in sexually active and/or gravid women. In addition, pregnancy may influence the subsequent therapeutic choices.
