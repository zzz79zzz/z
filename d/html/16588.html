The events are most common in preschool-aged children and gradually decrease in frequency over the first decade of life [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The events may mimic sleep-related epileptic seizures; thus, it is important to understand their clinical and sleep laboratory diagnostic features. Sometimes, parasomnias are isolated symptoms in an otherwise healthy child, while on other occasions, they coexist with neurologic, psychiatric, or medical disorders. This article provides an overview of common parasomnias of childhood.</p><p>Parasomnias involve relatively complex behaviors. Simpler and stereotyped movements are categorized as sleep-related movement disorders. These include restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movements of sleep, sleep-related bruxism, and sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder and are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97856.html" rel="external">"Sleep-related movement disorders in childhood"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16995.html" rel="external">"Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6357.html" rel="external">"Assessment of sleep disorders in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172745"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most studies of parasomnias in childhood have provided cross-sectional data. There are few longitudinal studies.</p><p>Young children (aged 2.5 to 6 years) were evaluated in a large study in Quebec, Canada [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Parasomnias were ubiquitous: 88 percent of the cohort manifested at least one parasomnia during the study period. Parasomnias or other sleep-related movements were noted at the following frequencies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleep (night) terrors – 40 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleepwalking – 15 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleep enuresis – 25 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bruxism (teeth grinding) – 46 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rhythmic movement disorder (eg, head banging) – 9 percent</p><p></p><p>Older children (aged 6 to 11 years) were evaluated as part of the Tucson Children's Assessment of Sleep Apnea study [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Each parasomnia was noted by parents with the following frequency at baseline and remission rate approximately five years later:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleep terrors – 0.6 percent at baseline, 100 percent resolved</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleepwalking – 6 percent at baseline, 65 percent resolved</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleep talking – 1 percent at baseline, 50 percent resolved</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleep enuresis – 0.3 percent at baseline, 71 percent resolved</p><p></p><p>One limitation in estimates of incidence and prevalence of parasomnias during childhood is that they are based mainly on parental recall. Another is that mild and infrequent parasomnias, such as a confusional arousal with no vocalization, may not even come to parental attention. There does not seem to be a sex predisposition for any specific parasomnia. Some parasomnias show a familial predisposition. Additionally, the presence of a parasomnia in childhood predicts a predisposition for development of other types of parasomnias in the future. For example, a study found that one-third of children with night terrors subsequently developed sleepwalking [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172752"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION OF PARASOMNIAS BY TYPE OF SLEEP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sleep can be broadly segmented into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. NREM sleep is divided into stages ranging from N1 (the lightest and often initial stage of sleep) to N3 (deep NREM sleep with a high arousal threshold). These sleep states occur in cycles throughout the night, typically with an increasing percentage of REM sleep and decreasing percentage of N3 sleep in each cycle as sleep progresses.</p><p>There is an expected ontogeny of sleep during maturation, including changes in duration of total sleep time in 24 hours, evolving consolidation of sleep to nocturnal sleep without daytime napping, and change in ultradian rhythm:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infants sleep 14 to 17 hours distributed across a 24-hour-period. At sleep onset, they enter the REM-equivalent stage of sleep (stage R, also called active sleep) and have relatively rapid sleep cycles between this stage and the NREM-equivalent stage of sleep (stage N, also called quiet sleep), every 50 to 60 minutes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>With maturation, children have progressively lower needs for daytime napping. At sleep onset, they initially enter NREM. Children and adolescents spend a significant portion of sleep in N3 sleep (25 to 35 percent) compared with adults (13 to 23 percent). The largest percentage of N3 sleep typically occurs in the beginning of the night, with the initial REM sleep stage occurring 90 to 140 minutes later. As night sleep progresses, the proportion of REM sleep gradually increases (normal progression of REM), while N3 sleep decreases  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142872" href="/z/d/graphic/142872.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6354.html" rel="external">"Sleep physiology in children", section on 'Maturation of sleep architecture'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Understanding the pattern of ultradian cycling can help in distinguishing NREM, REM, and nonparasomnia disorders. Most parasomnias are associated with either REM or NREM sleep. This characteristic is used in the classification scheme outlined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition, Text Revision (ICSD-3-TR) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Because of the characteristic association with type of sleep, the occurrence of parasomnias tends to reflect the expected ultradian pattern across the night. Parasomnias that are associated with arousal from NREM sleep are more common in the first one-third of the night, when deep NREM (N3) sleep is most abundant, whereas REM sleep-associated parasomnias are more common in the last one-third of the night, when REM sleep is more prominent  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142979" href="/z/d/graphic/142979.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). An exception to this would be in individuals with narcolepsy who can have inappropriate REM sleep intrusion with sleep onset and fragmented sleep across the night. This can be an important clue to improve recognition of narcolepsy, especially in individuals with frequent, recurrent REM parasomnias. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97853.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in children"</a>.)</p><p>Common parasomnias and other behaviors during sleep are outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69704" href="/z/d/graphic/69704.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and detailed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172788"><span class="h1">DISORDERS OF AROUSAL FROM NON-RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Confusional arousals, sleep (night) terrors, and sleepwalking are the most significant parasomnias associated with non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. They are also termed disorders of partial arousal as they result from incomplete arousal from NREM sleep. Typically, they occur at the transition from deep NREM (stage N3) sleep into the lighter stages of NREM sleep (N1 or N2) or into the awake state  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142979" href="/z/d/graphic/142979.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). They are most likely to arise during the first one-third of nocturnal sleep because N3 sleep is most prevalent at this time of the night [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17024214"><span class="h2">Pathophysiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The abovementioned three parasomnias that occur on arousal from NREM sleep have similar predisposing characteristics and triggers  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81349" href="/z/d/graphic/81349.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), suggesting common pathophysiology:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Genetic predisposition – A familial predilection to parasomnias is suggested by several studies [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>]. In a study of 323 pairs of twins (199 monozygotic, 124 dizygotic), the pair-wise concordance for sleepwalking was six times higher in the monozygotic twins than in the dizygotic twins [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Another study found that sleepwalking was twice as common in children whose parents had exhibited sleepwalking (47.4 percent) compared with children whose parents did not (22.5 percent) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased arousal from sleep – Disorders that increase arousals from sleep such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movement of sleep, or gastroesophageal reflux are common triggers for arousal parasomnias. In a study of 84 children with recurrent or chronic sleepwalking, 58 percent had a history suggestive of OSA, the treatment of which frequently led to resolution of sleepwalking [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In a study of 30 children with RLS and NREM parasomnias, the correction of iron deficiency led to resolution of the parasomnias in 40 percent [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Separation anxiety also may be a predisposing factor for both sleep terrors and sleepwalking [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other triggers – Sleep deprivation and fever are common triggers for NREM parasomnias, possibly because they cause increased N3 sleep.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age – Vulnerability to these parasomnias is also influenced by age; these disorders are most common in childhood and gradually resolve by adolescence.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Electroencephalogram (EEG) – Arousal parasomnias are associated with increased frequency of cyclic alternating patterns on sleep EEG. These are repeated, spontaneous high-voltage patterns that recur at regular intervals of up to one minute [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. They are a reliable marker of unstable sleep and are increased during the slow-wave sleep of children with sleep terrors [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17024133"><span class="h2">Clinical features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Confusional arousals, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking are typically seen in toddlers and school-aged children. Sometimes, more than one of these parasomnias may be seen in the same child. When there are no underlying triggers (primary or with familial predisposition), patients show gradual, spontaneous resolution of the events over months to years, although sleepwalking is somewhat more likely to persist into adolescence compared with sleep terrors or confusional arousals. Those with identifiable triggers such as OSA, RLS, or anxiety tend to improve when these conditions are addressed. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172803"><span class="h3">Confusional arousals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Confusional arousals are most commonly reported in toddlers and usually diminish in frequency after five years of age. In a population-based study, the prevalence in children 3 to 13 years of age was 17.3 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The onset of symptoms is typically within two to three hours of sleep onset but also may occur upon attempted awakening from sleep during the night or in the morning. The child will typically sit up in bed, whimper, cry, or moan and may utter words like "no" or "go away," appear distressed, and remain inconsolable regardless of all effort at soothing [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. There is generally no sweating, flushing of the face, or stereotypic motor behavior. The child may remain sitting in the bed. The duration is 5 to 30 minutes. A simultaneously recorded EEG may show generalized, high-amplitude rhythmic delta or theta activity.<em> </em>The following morning, the patient awakens, feeling alert and refreshed, and has no recollection of the event whatsoever. Although these events are benign, they often cause parents or caregivers to be concerned or puzzled about the nature of the events and how to deal with them.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172810"><span class="h3">Sleep terrors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sleep terrors (often called night terrors) typically occur between 4 and 12 years of age.<em> </em>The events occur during the first one-third of nocturnal sleep. The child awakens abruptly from sleep with a loud scream, is agitated, and has a flushed face, sweating, and tachycardia. The child may jump out of bed as if running away from an unseen threat [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], is usually unresponsive, and, paradoxically, may become even more agitated by the parent/caregiver's efforts at calming. The child usually does not remember the episode later.</p><p>A simultaneously obtained EEG may show high-amplitude rhythmic delta or theta activity. There is a strong genetic predisposition.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172817"><span class="h3">Sleepwalking</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sleepwalking, like the other parasomnias associated with NREM sleep, occurs in approximately 15 percent of children, peaking between age 8 and 12 years [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>]. Mild episodes, in which a toddler sits up and crawls around the bed or walks up quietly to stand by the bed of the parents, may initially go unnoticed [<a href="#rid4">4,12,13</a>]. Other children may become agitated and run around the house or have confused, inappropriate behaviors. Some patients have injured themselves by unconsciously carrying out dangerous behaviors like leaving the house on cold, wintry nights and have had consequences like accidental hypothermia. Autonomic dysfunction may coexist in the form of sweating and flushing of the face. Some patients exhibit a combination of sleep terrors and sleepwalking, though one type may predominate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172825"><span class="h2">Differential diagnosis</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nocturnal seizures</strong> – Nocturnal seizures can mimic sleepwalking, confusional arousals, or sleep terrors. Disorganized bodily movements, staring, unresponsiveness, vocalizations, and confused behavior are common to both seizures and parasomnias [<a href="#rid14">14-17</a>]. A number of features including age of onset and ictal pattern help distinguish parasomnias from seizures  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60188" href="/z/d/graphic/60188.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE; previously named autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy) can be sporadic or familial. It may be related to mutations in the <em>CHRNA2</em>, <em>CHRNA4</em>, or <em>CHRNB2 </em>genes<em> </em>that<em> </em>regulate the expression of nicotinic acetyl choline receptors [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>]. For investigation of any nocturnal events that are suspected to be seizures, a 16- to 18-channel EEG montage should be routinely incorporated into the polysomnogram (PSG). Correlating the event to the sleep stage can help to distinguish between seizures and parasomnias: Sleep-related seizures more commonly arise from N1 or N2 sleep, while NREM parasomnias more typically arise from N3 sleep  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142979" href="/z/d/graphic/142979.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). However, in clinical practice, it may be difficult to distinguish NREM parasomnias from nocturnal seizures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Features that suggest the possibility of nocturnal seizure rather than an NREM parasomnia include recurrent stereotyped events occurring close to sleep onset or recurrently through the night, injury to the sides of the tongue, or urinary incontinence with the episodes. It is important to recognize that conditions that cause partial arousals and sleep fragmentation (eg, OSA, RLS, or anxiety) can predispose to either NREM parasomnias or nocturnal seizures. Home video recordings of the spells made by the parents can help in this regard because they capture the features of the nocturnal events in the natural home environment, which may not recur in the artificial environment of the sleep laboratory. Sleep-related epilepsy syndromes and the clinical features that help distinguish nocturnal epileptic seizures from parasomnias are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97852.html" rel="external">"Sleep-related epilepsy syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6155.html" rel="external">"Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children", section on 'Sleep disorders'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux</strong> – Gastroesophageal reflux can lead to episodes of abrupt arousal from sleep in association with crying or tonic extension of the trunk and extremities. It can also exacerbate sleep-disordered breathing. A simultaneously obtained EEG fails to reveal epileptiform abnormalities. There may be an associated cough. Reflux episodes may also occur during wakefulness. The suspicion of reflux can be supported by esophageal pH monitoring (obtained after consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist), but a firm association between reflux and the arousal is difficult to establish unless the events are captured simultaneously during the pH monitoring study.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Panic attacks</strong> – Panic attacks are characterized by an abrupt awakening from NREM sleep with a sensation of choking or tightness in the chest [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The EEG remains normal. The events may last a few minutes and then subside. Daytime episodes of anxiety also may occur. The patient typically can recount the uncomfortable sensation the following day.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)</strong> – RBD is characterized by aggressive motor behavior as part of dream enactment, resulting from loss of the physiologic muscle atonia of REM sleep. RBD events typically occur during the early morning hours when REM sleep is more abundant. RBD occurs infrequently in children and is more common in adults. RBD observed in a child or adolescent should raise suspicion of narcolepsy, though it also may be induced by abrupt withdrawal of REM-suppressing medications. In contrast with adults, childhood RBD is not associated with synucleinopathies. (See <a class="local">'Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172832"><span class="h2">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most healthy children presenting with sleepwalking, confusional arousals, or night terrors require only a focused history and physical examination for diagnosis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6357.html" rel="external">"Assessment of sleep disorders in children"</a>). Parasomnias that are infrequent (one to two times per month) or that have typical triggers such as sleep deprivation or fever generally do not require further investigation, especially if there is a family history of childhood parasomnias.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172840"><span class="h3">Investigations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children with frequent parasomnias, indications for nocturnal PSG (sleep study) include [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Habitual snoring, observed apneas, and/or daytime somnolence; behavioral problem or mood disturbance, suggesting underlying OSA as a potential trigger [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Leg discomfort or involuntary jerking movements during sleep, suggesting restless leg syndrome or periodic limb movements of sleep.

Parents should be informed that NREM parasomnias themselves are typically benign and self-limited, with symptoms typically resolving spontaneously over one to two years. However, if they identify an increase in frequency or severity of events, they should seek reevaluation. Increased frequency or severity can be a sign of poor quality or inadequate sleep. Reinforcement of good sleep hygiene and age-appropriate hours of sleep is recommended. Toddlers should be given adequate time to nap during the day because sleep deprivation may be a trigger for the parasomnia.</p><p>In the case of sleepwalking or parasomnia behaviors resulting in the child leaving the bed or room, the clinician should discuss environmental safety issues with the parent(s), such as ensuring that the child is not able to leave the house or otherwise injure him- or herself while sleepwalking.

In addition, sleep hygiene measures should be reviewed and all patients should be encouraged to maintain a regular sleep schedule seven days a week.</p><p>Anticipatory awakening (scheduled awakening) is a behavioral technique that can be utilized to prevent these parasomnias [<a href="#rid28">28-30</a>]. To effectively utilize this strategy, the first step is to have the family keep a sleep diary to record the child's typical sleep-wake patterns and timing, quality, and frequency of events. This information will guide when the awakening should be performed. For instance, if the unwanted behavior typically occurs between 10:00 and 10:30 PM, scheduling the awakening 15 to 20 minutes prior is appropriate. This may alter the sleep state and abort the event. During the scheduled awakening attempt, the parent comforts the child and generally behaves as they would during a spontaneous awakening. Efficacy can be determined by maintaining the sleep diary to record interventions and monitor changes in the frequency of unwanted behavior. In one report of three children with frequent sleepwalking, nightly anticipatory awakenings for one month led to near-resolution of the symptom and the improvement continued at follow-up six months later [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Anecdotal reports from the children's parents suggest that the scheduled awakenings may have conditioned the children to self-arouse prior to transitioning from slow-wave sleep, but this hypothesis has not been further examined. If resolution of parasomnia events is achieved with this technique, weaning of scheduled awakening can be performed after a period of time.</p><p>Although the efficacy of scheduled awakenings has not been well tested in clinical studies, the technique may be worth trying when the family is reluctant to administer medications and is inclined towards nonpharmacologic management. It has the potential drawback of actually triggering a parasomnia by the awakening procedure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172877"><span class="h1">PARASOMNIAS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172885"><span class="h2">Nightmare disorders</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1307965388"><span class="h3">Clinical features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nightmares are disturbing dreams that awaken the dreamer. They are also referred to as dream anxiety attacks. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition, Text Revision (ICSD-3-TR) defines nightmares as "an internally generated conscious experience or dream sequence that seems vivid and real. They have a tendency to become increasingly more disturbing as they unfold. Emotions are characteristically negative and most frequently involve anxiety, fear, or terror but may also involve anger, rage, embarrassment, and disgust" [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Full alertness generally returns immediately upon awakening after a nightmare, and recall of the dream experience remains intact. Since rapid eye movement (REM) sleep predominates during the final one-third of the night, nightmares generally occur in the early hours of the morning  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142979" href="/z/d/graphic/142979.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The recall of dream content is good in children who are verbal. The description of dreams in preschool-age children may be simple but more elaborate in older children. Nightmares are more common in children with post-traumatic stress disorder, and their dream content may be particularly distressing, with themes of inflicted violence, death, or separation from close family members.</p><p>Bodily movement during nightmares is infrequent because muscle tone and mobility are actively inhibited during REM sleep. Autonomic manifestations like sweating and flushing of the face also do not occur. Mild tachycardia may occur. The duration of the event is generally brief. After waking up, the child may find it hard to fall back asleep.</p><p>The association between anxiety symptoms and nightmares was explored in a group of 610 children who were evaluated at the ages of 13 and 16 years [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Anxiety symptoms were classified based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition (DSM-3) criteria for separation anxiety, overanxious disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. As compared with boys, girls were more likely to report disturbing dreams, and the symptom tended to increase over time. The frequent occurrence of disturbing dreams at age 13 years was associated with generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety, or overanxious disorder at age 16 years for both boys and girls.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27172892"><span class="h3">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Polysomnography is not routinely indicated for the investigation of nightmares. When nightmares are recurrent and problematic, psychological evaluation is indicated to assess for anxiety and determine its underlying causes.</p><p>Medications are rarely indicated for treatment of nightmares. Triggers for nightmares include certain medications, including antidepressants, antihypertensives, and antihistamines. Behavioral techniques to manage nightmares in children are based on observations from small, nonrandomized case series and include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reassurance – Some nightmares may subside simply with reassurance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rescripting – Rescripting or imagery rehearsal therapy are techniques in which children are taught to create new, more pleasant endings to recurring nightmares may lessen their distress.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Desensitization – Desensitization techniques may also help alleviate the fear of nightmares [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Some therapists have found it useful to encourage the child to write down the content of the nightmare or draw pictures of the object(s), which may help make the experience less scary. Parents or caregivers may be able to help a child process negative experiences by discussing them with the child; this approach has been suggested but not proven as an intervention for nightmares [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypnotherapy – A small case series suggested that one or two sessions of hypnotherapy will help adults and children with nightmares, with 5 of 7 (71 percent) remaining free of nightmares or much improved at 18 months follow-up and 4 of 6 (67 percent) remaining free of nightmares after five years [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) – CBT may be of value in cases of intense, disturbing nightmares but is not well studied in children or adults [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

At the end of an episode, the dreamer typically awakens quickly and is able to recall the dream content, which tends to correspond to the observed sleep behaviors [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In contrast with the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) arousal parasomnias discussed above, RBD tends to occur during the later part of the night, when REM sleep predominates  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142979" href="/z/d/graphic/142979.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In contrast to sleep terrors, in which there is no recollection of the event the following morning, patients with RBD may exhibit vivid dream recall. They also tend to remain in bed rather than jump out of bed and move about, as in sleep terrors or sleepwalking. (See <a class="local">'Disorders of arousal from non-rapid eye movement sleep'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology and comorbidities</strong> – RBD is infrequently recognized in children. The main exceptions occur in childhood narcolepsy, neurodevelopmental disorders, and use of certain medications [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">RBD has been reported in one-third of children with narcolepsy type 1 and may occur during sleep or during an episode of daytime cataplexy (status cataplecticus) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. In narcolepsy type 1, the central nervous system orexin (hypocretin) deficiency predisposes to reduced suppression of the pontine "REM off" neurons during REM sleep. This can, in turn, predispose to motor dream enactment [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Case reports describe two girls aged seven and nine years with combined RBD and narcolepsy-cataplexy [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. A reasonably large series of children with RBD (n = 15) found a preponderance of narcolepsy, neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, Smith-Magenis syndrome and Rett syndrome, structural brainstem abnormalities such as Chiari type I malformation, a medication effect from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or withdrawal from barbiturates or alcohol [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].

Home video observations are helpful in diagnosis and often document yelling, agitation, or flailing of the limbs, although these behaviors may be absent when sleep is recorded in a sleep laboratory. These aggressive motor behaviors help to distinguish RBD from sleepwalking and other parasomnias (which are far more common). The nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) demonstrates a lack of the chin muscle atonia that normally characterizes physiologic REM sleep. This is known as REM sleep without atonia and is a neurophysiologic correlate of RBD, even in the absence of RBD episodes [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Excessive twitching and movement of the limbs during REM sleep also may occur.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Treatment recommendations for RBD are based on small case series in adults and anecdotal experience in children. If the patient is taking medications known to exacerbate RBD (which include SSRIs), discontinuation of the medication (when possible) may lead to improvement or resolution of the RBD. As in adults, RBD in children responds promptly to treatment with benzodiazepines like <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13170" href="/z/d/drug information/13170.html" rel="external">clonazepam</a>, 0.125 to 0.5 mg at bedtime.

Like RBD, many of the cases are associated with underlying neurologic disease. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or other causes of partial arousal from both NREM and REM sleep should also be considered. However, idiopathic disease also occurs and is more common among patients presenting with parasomnia overlap disorder at a younger age [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].

These phenomena may, however, sometimes intrude onto wakefulness around the time of sleep onset or at the time of waking up from sleep. The resulting transient inability to move the body is called sleep paralysis. Recurrent sleep paralysis is often associated with narcolepsy. If it is not associated with narcolepsy, it is known as isolated sleep paralysis (ISP).</p><p>During a sleep paralysis episode, consciousness remains intact and the individual is perfectly aware of the surroundings. For a patient unfamiliar with the phenomenon, a terrifying feeling can arise from the sudden inability to move the body while being fully awake, albeit momentarily. The child may also experience hallucinations such as feeling the presence of others nearby, feeling pressure on the chest, or hearing footsteps [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of young adults with anxiety disorder may manifest ISP [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Sleep deprivation in otherwise healthy teenagers is also a common trigger.

Most parasomnias occur at sleep onset or are associated with a specific type of sleep (rapid eye movement [REM] or non-rapid eye movement [NREM] sleep). (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Classification of parasomnias by type of sleep'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Confusional arousals, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking (NREM parasomnias)</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Types and clinical manifestations</strong> – Confusional arousals, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking have distinct clinical manifestations, but the underlying pathophysiology and course is similar  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81349" href="/z/d/graphic/81349.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Because they are associated with arousal from deep NREM sleep, they tend to occur during the first one-third of the night  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142979" href="/z/d/graphic/142979.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). There is a strong familial tendency. Triggers include any disorder that increases arousals from sleep, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), restless legs syndrome (RLS), sleep deprivation, or fever. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Evaluation and management</strong> – Otherwise healthy children who present with these parasomnias often require only a focused history and physical examination for diagnosis. Parasomnias that are infrequent (one to two times per month) or that have typical triggers such as sleep deprivation or fever generally do not require further investigation. The clinician can reassure the parent or caregiver about the benign nature of the disturbance and that it will probably resolve spontaneously over one to two years. The family should ensure that the child has adequate sleep. In the case of sleepwalking, environmental safety issues should also be discussed. (See <a class="local">'General strategies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Polysomnography (PSG)</strong> – In children with frequent parasomnias (either NREM- or REM-associated), indications for nocturnal PSG include (see <a class="local">'Investigations'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Habitual snoring, observed apneas, nocturnal enuresis, or other symptoms suggesting OSA. Symptoms of OSA can be an indication for PSG even if the parasomnia does not occur frequently.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Significant safety concerns, excessive disruption of the family members' sleep, or contemplation of pharmacotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Atypical features that raise concern for nocturnal seizures, such as daytime neurologic symptoms, older age group, family history of seizures, and multiple occurrences on a single night  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60188" href="/z/d/graphic/60188.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Presence of excessive daytime sleepiness and/or features concerning for RBD. Children with these features should be evaluated with a PSG and next-day multiple sleep latency test to evaluate for narcolepsy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97853.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Other evaluation</strong> – If the PSG or history suggests RLS, the serum ferritin level should be measured because RLS is associated with iron deficiency. If iron deficiency is present, iron supplementation may relieve the RLS and associated parasomnia. (See <a class="local">'Investigations'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16995.html" rel="external">"Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Management of problematic cases</strong> – If no specific underlying triggers are found and the parasomnia remains problematic, we suggest treatment with a low dose of a benzodiazepine (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13170" href="/z/d/drug information/13170.html" rel="external">clonazepam</a> at a dose of 0.125 to 0.5 mg at bedtime) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Anticipatory awakening is an alternative strategy but also can trigger the parasomnia. (See <a class="local">'Medical/surgical strategies'</a> above and <a class="local">'Behavioral measures'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other parasomnias</strong> <strong>and sleep-related movement disorders</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nightmares are disturbing dreams that awaken the dreamer, usually involving fear or anxiety. They are more common among children with anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder and can be triggered by certain medications, including antihypertensives and antihistamines. When nightmares are recurrent and problematic, the child should be evaluated and treated for anxiety and psychological stressors. Several cognitive-behavioral techniques have been used to treat nightmares, supported by limited evidence. (See <a class="local">'Nightmare disorders'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Sleep enuresis (nocturnal enuresis) is defined as discrete episodes of incontinence during sleep at least twice per week in children older than five years of age. It affects approximately 15 percent of five-year-old children and gradually declines to approximately 5 percent by 10 years of age  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58087" href="/z/d/graphic/58087.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). Causes include nocturnal polyuria, maturational delay, and genetic predisposition. OSA is increasingly recognized as a treatable cause of some cases of nocturnal enuresis. (See <a class="local">'Sleep enuresis'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2862.html" rel="external">"Nocturnal enuresis in children: Etiology and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rhythmic movements in infants and toddlers at the time of sleep onset are physiologic and generally resolve spontaneously by three to four years of age. (See <a class="local">'Sleep-related movement disorders'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97856.html" rel="external">"Sleep-related movement disorders in childhood", section on 'Rhythmic movement disorder'</a>.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Furet O, Goodwin JL, Quan SF.
