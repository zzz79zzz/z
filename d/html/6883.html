         Acute urinary retention (AUR) is the inability to voluntarily pass urine. It is the most common urologic emergency [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In males, AUR is most often secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); AUR is rare in females [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         AUR is a urologic emergency that requires immediate treatment by insertion of a urinary catheter that allows the bladder to empty. Potential complications of an AUR event are pain, loss of bladder contractibility, urinary tract infections, kidney damage, incontinence, urosepsis, increased risk of another episode of AUR, and psychologic distress. Clinically, even one episode may result in permanent damage to the bladder with longstanding pathologic effects and symptoms [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review issues related to evaluation and management of AUR. The diagnosis and treatment of BPH and chronic urinary retention in females are discussed separately.

         AUR is common in males. The incidence increases with age, occurring most frequently in males over age 60 [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3,5,6
         </a>
         ]. It is estimated that, over a five-year period, approximately 10 percent of males over the age of 70 and almost one-third of males in their 80s will develop AUR [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3,7
         </a>
         ]. Demographic studies show that Black and Latinx patients present more frequently with AUR, suggesting undertreatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia in these populations as an underlying cause [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, AUR is rare in females [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. It is estimated that there are three cases of AUR per 100,000 females per year [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The female to male incidence rate ratio is 1:13.

         </span>
         The etiology of AUR is poorly understood, although several contributory factors may lead to AUR; several mechanisms may occur concurrently. The most common mechanisms are outflow obstruction, neurologic impairment, or an inefficient detrusor muscle [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>

         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The flow of urine can be impeded by mechanical factors (physical narrowing of the urethral channel) and/or dynamic factors (increased muscle tone within and around the urethra) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,14,15

         In males, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common single cause of AUR and is a contributing factor in up to 60 percent of AUR cases [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3,5,6,13,16
         </a>
         ]. Three to five percent of the AUR cases secondary to BPH are in treatment-naïve patients who discover their condition at the time of the episode [

          Neurologic impairment

         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Incomplete relaxation of the urinary sphincter mechanism (dyssynergia) can also result in elevations in both voiding pressures and postvoid residual volumes.

         AUR can occur with spinal cord injuries from trauma, infarct or demyelination, epidural abscess and epidural metastasis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, and stroke [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. AUR is typically accompanied by back pain and/or other neurologic deficits. Patients with neurologic impairment may develop acute-on-chronic urinary retention. (See

          Inefficient detrusor muscle
         </strong>
         – AUR may occur in patients with an inefficient detrusor muscle when a precipitating event results in an acute distended bladder (eg, with a fluid challenge, during general or epidural analgesia without an indwelling catheter) [

          33
         </a>
         ]. Nasal decongestants that contain sympathomimetic agents increase smooth muscle tone in the region of the bladder neck.

         Patients with acute-on-chronic urinary retention may present with recurrent urinary tract infections, declining renal function, or overflow incontinence, rather than an inability to pass urine. Discomfort may be less pronounced as well, as chronic urinary retention is often painless [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37

The patient should also be asked about the presence of hematuria, dysuria, fever, low back pain, neurologic symptoms, long-term systemic disease such as diabetes mellitus, or rash. Finally, a complete list of medications should be obtained to identify any agents associated with urinary retention  (

         With few exceptions, urethral catheterization is the appropriate initial method for decompression in AUR, particularly in patients for whom AUR is expected to resolve (eg, patients with urinary tract infections or AUR secondary to medication effect). A 14 to 18 French catheter should be inserted as first line in most patients with AUR [

          13

        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient has had recent urologic surgery, acute prostatitis, or anatomic abnormalities, a coude tip catheter or SP catheter may be indicated. (See

        <p>
         Regardless of the modality (urethral or SP), we recommend complete drainage of the bladder in patients with AUR. Historically, rapid complete bladder decompression was thought to increase the rate of potential complications (transient hematuria, hypotension, and postobstructive diuresis). However, partial drainage and clamping does not reduce these complications and may increase risk for urinary tract infection [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37-40

         Some patients may have an obstruction that does not readily allow passage of the catheter. A partially obstructing urethral or prostatic scar may be present if the patient has had a prior transurethral procedure (eg, transurethral resection of the prostate), pelvic trauma, or radiation [

          12

        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of prior instrumentation or injury, the more common cause of obstruction would be an enlarged prostate. For these patients, a larger catheter (20 or 22 gauge) with a firm coude tip may be needed and may require urologic consultation. (See

         Placement of a SP catheter is sometimes necessary for bladder decompression in patients who have contraindications to or fail urethral catheterization (eg, those with recent urologic surgery, acute prostatitis, urethral stricture disease, severe benign prostatic hyperplasia, or other anatomic abnormalities). SP catheterization may also be pursued for patients expected to require long-term bladder drainage.
        </p>
        <p>
         SP catheters are usually placed by a urologist. SP tubes can be placed in the operating room, the emergency department, or occasionally an outpatient clinic. However, patient factors (age, health, medications, body mass index, prior surgical history, etc) may preclude placement outside of the operating room.
        </p>
        <p>
         In cases when no urologist or appropriately trained clinician is available and the patient is in distress, bladder distention can be temporarily relieved with SP aspiration via a needle. However, this treatment can make subsequent SP placement more difficult or even dangerous due to bladder decompression. If an appropriately trained medical professional will be available in the near future, needle decompression should be deferred. (See

         SP catheters have some benefits over indwelling urethral catheters and are preferred in patients who are expected to require long-term bladder drainage. SP catheters prevent bladder neck and urethral dilatation and, therefore, prevent urinary incontinence due to sphincter dysfunction. They also have the advantage of allowing assessment of the patient's ability to void before removing the catheter, they may be associated with fewer infections than an indwelling urethral catheter [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ], and they are less uncomfortable than urethral catheters. Lastly, SP catheters in males avoid the risk of subsequent urethral stricture, a common complication in males requiring long-term urethral catheterization [

          Postobstructive diuresis
         </strong>
         – Relief of urinary tract obstruction can lead to a postobstructive diuresis, defined as a diuresis that persists after decompression of the bladder. Postobstructive diuresis is uncommon with AUR; it usually represents an appropriate attempt to excrete excess fluid retained during obstruction associated with chronic urinary retention [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Postobstructive diuresis may require additional fluid management. Many patients can manage the increase in urine output by increasing oral fluid intake. In patients who are unable to do so or have severe postobstructive diuresis, we measure the urine output and replace one-half the urine volume with one-half isotonic

          AUR due to BPH
         </strong>
         – In patients with suspected or documented benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) presenting with AUR, medical therapy should be started at the time of initial catheterization. Patients newly started on medical therapy should complete at least three days of medical therapy prior to voiding trial. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The optimal timing of voiding trial in patients with AUR due to BPH is uncertain, and clinical practice varies. In general, we suggest a voiding trial 7 to 10 days after the catheter is placed; however, in patients with AUR and BPH who have been started on medical therapy and do not have high volume retention &gt;800 mL, it is reasonable to offer a voiding trial as early as three days after the catheter is placed. We provide self-catheterization teaching at the time of voiding trial, if manageable by the patient or care team. This practice avoids future episodes of retention and facilitates monitoring of postvoid residual (PVR). (See

          50
         </a>
         ]. In particular, patients with retention volumes &gt;1300 mL may benefit from more prolonged catheterization. In contrast, a subsequent observational study of 2600 males with AUR and BPH suggested that males who were catheterized for three days or less had greater success with spontaneous voiding compared with males catheterized for more than three days [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51

         – Patients who have underlying etiologies not likely to resolve within one week (eg, stricture, spinal cord injury) and/or who have acute-on-chronic urinary retention should have a voiding trial one to two weeks after the catheter is placed.

         In our practice, a voiding trial starts with catheter removal early in the morning either at home, in the office, or in the inpatient setting if hospitalized. Patients are encouraged to hydrate aggressively and have a PVR measured four to six hours later in the office or while inpatient. The outcome of the voiding trial is determined by PVR measurement, as below.

         PVR &gt;200 mL is considered equivocal. In such patients, we provide instruction on clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), if manageable by the patient or care team, as it can be used as an adjunct to voiding or for AUR recurrences that may require rescue bladder drainage. In patients with AUR, CIC is preferred, as it is associated with an increased rate of spontaneous voiding and reduction in urinary tract infections compared with indwelling catheters [

         Patients who have two or more unsuccessful voiding trials should be evaluated for surgery, which remains the definitive treatment for AUR. These patients should undergo urodynamic studies to determine if a surgical procedure to reduce bladder outlet resistance would be beneficial. If urodynamic studies show elevated bladder pressures suggestive of outlet obstruction, surgery may have a role in alleviating symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among symptomatic patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, transurethral resection of the prostate reduces the risk of developing AUR by 85 to 90 percent [

         <a href="#rid49">
          49,55
         </a>
         ]. In one cohort study, 1242 males who underwent prostatectomy for AUR had an increased risk of perioperative complications in addition to an excess risk of death at 30 and 90 days after the procedure compared with males undergoing elective prostatectomy (relative risk 26.6 and 4.4, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49

          Etiologies
         </strong>
         – Acute urinary retention (AUR) is the most common urologic emergency and is seen more often in males than females. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common underlying condition in males, but there are many possible etiologies, including neurologic disorders, trauma, and infection. Medications are frequently implicated  (

          When to suspect AUR
         </strong>
         – Patients generally present with the abrupt inability to pass urine. It is typically associated with lower abdominal and/or suprapubic (SP) discomfort. Patients who have chronic urinary retention may not have abdominal pain but may complain of symptoms of overflow incontinence. Persons with dementia or other forms of cognitive impairment may present with an acute change in mental status. (See
         <a class="local">
          'When to suspect acute urinary retention'

         <strong>
          Making the diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis is made by demonstrating &gt;300 mL retained urine by bladder ultrasound or &gt;200 mL by catheterization.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If the procedure can be performed relatively quickly, a bladder ultrasound is a good first choice for patients who are not in extreme distress because it is noninvasive, it is more comfortable for the patient, and bladder decompression can be avoided if results are normal.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients whose history and physical examination strongly suggest a diagnosis of AUR, including SP discomfort and/or palpable bladder fullness, it is reasonable to proceed directly to catheterization, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic. (See

          Acute bladder decompression
         </strong>
         – Initial management of AUR consists of prompt bladder decompression, usually with an indwelling urethral catheter. Urethral catheterization is contraindicated in patients who have had recent urologic surgery (eg, radical prostatectomy or urethral reconstruction). A SP catheter may be necessary when obstruction precludes a urethral catheter and is also preferred in patients who are expected to require longer-term catheterization. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In males with BPH or presumed BPH, treatment also includes an alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist initiated at the time of initial catheterization. Combination treatment for BPH, including addition of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor is indicated to prevent recurrence of AUR and symptomatic progression of BPH. (See

          Limited need for hospitalization

          Timing of voiding trial
         </strong>
         – Patients with AUR that is expected to resolve with treatment (eg, urinary tract infection, postoperative urinary retention, medication effect) can undergo voiding trial as soon as the underlying condition has been treated. We wait at least one to two weeks to perform voiding trial in patients with underlying etiologies not likely to resolve within one week (eg, spinal cord injury, stricture) and/or acute-on-chronic urinary retention. This timing allows for therapeutic bladder decompression and initiation of medical therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         The optimal timing of voiding trial in patients with AUR due to BPH is uncertain, and practice varies. For these patients, we suggest initiating medical therapy and deferring the voiding trial for at least 7 to 10 days after the catheter is placed to increase the likelihood of a successful trial (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). However, in patients who do not have high retention volume (eg, ≤800 mL), it is reasonable to offer a voiding trial as early as three days after initiation of medical therapy.

         We provide self-catheterization teaching at the time of voiding trial, if manageable by the patient or care team. This practice avoids future episodes of retention and facilitates monitoring of postvoid residual (PVR). (See

          Management of unsuccessful voiding trial
         </strong>
         – Chronic catheterization either through long-term CIC, indwelling urethral catheter, or SP catheter may be necessary in patients with unsuccessful voiding trials. Surgical therapy may be warranted for definitive treatment in some patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management after initial voiding trial'
         </a>
         above and
