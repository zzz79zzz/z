Working pregnant women often request advice and assistance from their clinicians to manage challenges that occur while being pregnant at work. This topic will review issues including the impact of pregnancy on work, the impact of work on pregnancy, workplace exposure, leave time and discrimination, and requesting accommodations to enable pregnant women to continue working.</p><p>Topics related to occupational risks and exposure are presented separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5447.html" rel="external">"Overview of occupational and environmental risks to reproduction in females"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111468.html" rel="external">"Occupational and environmental risks to reproduction in females: Specific exposures and impact"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2749.html" rel="external">"Overview of occupational and environmental health"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "women" or "patients" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we recognize that not all persons capable of pregnancy identify as women, and we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender non-binary individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1482894867"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As the number of women in the workforce has risen, so has the number of women working while pregnant. Globally, 67 percent of women in developed countries between the ages of 15 and 64 years old were employed in 2014 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Specific to the United States:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 2019, 72.3 percent of women with children under age 18 were in the labor force (defined as either employed or seeking work), up from approximately 30 percent in 1950 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 2015, the Pew Research Center reported [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fifty-six percent of women worked full time during their first pregnancy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Eighty-two percent of nulliparous women continued to work to within the month before they were due.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Most (73 percent) returned to work within six months after delivery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For comparison, in the early 1960s, only 44 percent worked during pregnancy, and 65 percent of them stopped work more than a month prior to delivery.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2804792733"><span class="h1">IMPACT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16490767"><span class="h2">Pregnancy on work performance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pregnancy is associated with a wide variety of physical, functional, and emotional changes. While many women work while pregnant without any interference from pregnancy-related changes, problems of nausea and vomiting, pain, and fatigue can negatively impact a woman's work performance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/440.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nausea and/or vomiting</strong> – Nausea and/or vomiting can be provoked by workplace odors or restrictions around eating [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. These problems can usually be managed with hydration, snacking as needed, taking a brief break, medication, and scheduling the most demanding work for times when the individual tends to feel less nauseous, if possible. One retrospective survey study suggested an inverse relationship between first-trimester level of nausea [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], physical activity, and standing. Clinicians may need to request accommodations for their patients to allow for such non-medical interventions. In cases of severe vomiting requiring intensive outpatient intravenous or hospital-based therapy, a short-term absence from work can be necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6811.html" rel="external">"Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: Treatment and outcome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fatigue</strong> – In an interview study of first-time pregnant working women, the dominant theme was described as "living on the edge of being overstretched" [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Being exhausted from adapting to professional life while pregnant was a major contributor to this theme.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Discomfort and pain</strong> – By the end of the second trimester and continuing through term, physical and physiologic changes can bring on heartburn, back pain, joint pain, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, and physical discomfort from the enlarging uterus. Ideally, the individual and their employer will be able to make reasonable adjustments to deal with these discomforts in the workplace. Simple precautions that can help reduce excessive fatigue, discomfort, and potentially reduce the risk of pregnancy complications include modifying shift times and tasks; minimizing lifting, bending, and prolonged standing; using proper lifting techniques; taking regular breaks every few hours and a longer break after five hours; and drinking plenty of fluids [<a href="#rid7">7-13</a>]. However, lost work time and interruptions in workflow can be necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/427.html" rel="external">"Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Musculoskeletal changes and pain"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cognitive function</strong> – Reduced cognitive function during pregnancy is often referred to as "baby brain." One meta-analysis including over 700 pregnant individuals reported that up to 80 percent noted this symptom during pregnancy with forgetfulness being the most common complaint [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Compared with control individuals, pregnant individuals report more subjective difficulties with memory, mood, and quality of life [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. However, such subjective perceptions may not be replicated by objective testing. While numerous changes in specific brain regions in humans occur during pregnancy and persist thereafter, they may have adaptive functions [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. More data are needed to understand the impact of pregnancy on cognitive function.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16490619"><span class="h2">Work on pregnancy and child development</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite data limitations, working while pregnant generally does not appear to negatively impact maternal or fetal health. However, the effect of work on pregnancy outcome is difficult to assess because available data are often contradictory, largely retrospective, and subject to multiple sources of bias, including inadequate adjustment for confounders, recall bias, selective participation, and subjective assessment of exposures. In particular, a potential bias in observational studies of outcomes of pregnant women who work or do not work is the "healthy worker" effect whereby healthier workers are more likely to continue to work and work in more demanding jobs than women with less robust health.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> – Systematic reviews have generally concluded that standard working conditions present little hazard to maternal or child health [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. A woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy who is employed where there are no greater potential hazards than those encountered in routine daily life may continue to work without interruption until the onset of labor. However, the physical demands of the woman's job are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, especially in women who have medical or obstetric disorders that are unstable or associated with impaired placental perfusion (eg, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction). As an example, studies of the effect of work on a woman's risk of developing hypertension during pregnancy generally report no significant association; however, the risk may depend on the occupational classification [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. While available evidence is inadequate to support a change in occupational responsibilities for prevention of pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, limited data do support changes in physical activity in the management of some women who develop these disorders. (See <a class="local">'Selected workplace exposures'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6761.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous preterm birth: Overview of risk factors and prognosis", section on 'Occupational physical activity'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Child development</strong> – Assessing the impact of maternal employment on children's development is difficult because of selection bias and missing data (eg, quality of childcare, home environment, maternal sensitivity to the child's needs, paternal factors). While the literature is conflicting, the body of evidence generally reports that if there are any adverse effects of maternal employment on child development, these effects are likely to be small [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Impact of socioeconomic status</strong> – Women in lower socioeconomic groups may represent an exception to the above information. In a 2014 survey study of 1400 pregnant French workers, women classified as deprived were more likely to encounter occupational hazards, have three or more occupational exposures during a pregnancy, and, for those with three or more occupational exposures, have a preterm delivery when compared with non-deprived women [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. Similarly, in a study from the national Swedish Registry, low levels of job control and high levels of physical demands and job hazards were more common in manual compared with non-manual labor classes. In multivariate analyses, class differences in maternal working conditions explained 14 to 38 percent of low-birth-weight births and 20 to 46 percent of preterm births [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Impact of job type</strong> – Some jobs may increase risk of poor pregnancy outcomes, likely through a combination of physical demand, mental stress, fatigue, and work schedule (work duration and shift timing). For example, a survey study reported female surgeons, as compared with female partners of male surgeons, were more likely to experience pregnancy complications (48.3 versus 27.2 percent) or pregnancy loss (42 percent, or more than double that of an age-matched population [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]) in adjusted analysis [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Compared with their male surgeon counterparts, female surgeons were more likely to delay childbearing because of surgical training (65 versus 44 percent), have fewer children (mean 1.8 versus 2.3), and use assisted reproductive technology (25 versus 17 percent). While it is not known which component(s) most contributes to these outcomes, the female surgeons who operated more than 12 hours per week during the third trimester had increased risk of major pregnancy complications than those operating fewer than 12 hours, which suggests work duration and/or physicality may play a role and provide an area for modification. Although recall bias is one limitation of survey studies, maternal recall of obstetric complications has been reported to be highly correlated with medical record data [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2433848899"><span class="h1">WORK CHARACTERISTICS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16490625"><span class="h2">Hours, shift, and type of work</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For women with healthy uncomplicated singleton pregnancies, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) and the Faculty of Occupational Medicine (FOM) of the United Kingdom concluded that available evidence did not justify imposing mandatory restrictions to working hours, shift work, lifting, standing, and physical work during pregnancy [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Challenges to writing such guidelines include lack of data demonstrating a clear cut-off at which work is detrimental to the health of most women and fetuses as well as the reality that some women must continue working while pregnant for economic reasons, regardless of medical advice. Any guidelines must also balance data suggesting that some level of physical activity while pregnant is healthy. Both the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) state that physical activity during pregnancy is beneficial to most women, exercise is safe for both mother and fetus, and exercising while pregnant carries little risk [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. In addition, abstaining from work can create hardships that need to be considered and balanced with the anxiety and uncertainty of possible low levels of risk. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/412.html" rel="external">"Exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period"</a>.)</p><p>One United States analysis of "occupational physical activity" reported that high activity levels were significantly associated with small for gestational age (SGA) for the highest quartile compared with lowest quartile and were also positively associated with preterm birth [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. In contrast, analysis of the impact of nonoccupational activity suggests that low physical activity may increase at least preterm birth risk compared to higher levels [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. While activity during pregnancy is generally encouraged, the point at which extreme activity (such as that imposed by extended work-hours or heavy work) transitions from benefit to harm is less clear. Challenges to understanding the impact of work factors during pregnancy include that data are derived from observational studies, the definition of important outcomes varies by patient, and pregnant individuals interpret and tolerate risk differently. Thus, the physical demands of a pregnant person's job should be considered on a case-by-case basis, especially in those at higher risk of preterm delivery or who have medical or obstetric disorders that are unstable or associated with impaired placental perfusion (eg, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction).</p><p>In one large nationally representative dataset, 31 percent of women reported standing for more than 75 percent of their time at their jobs [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis found prolonged standing to be associated with increased odds of prematurity (OR 1.11, 1.02-1.22) and SGA (OR 1.17, 1.01-1.35) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>Concurrent physical and psychological stressors may have a cumulative effect. A Danish cohort study of women expecting one child and who worked 30 or more hours per week found a significant interaction between lifting and psychosocial job strain for SGA and LGA [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. For each additional 250 kg lifted per day, high-strain women (high demand/low control) had increased odds of giving birth to an LGA child (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.26), whereas women with high demand/high control had increased odds of giving birth to an SGA child (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.23). In the same study, the adjusted hazard ratio for absence from work increased from 1.3 (1.1 to 1.5) for one exposure to 2.9 (2.5 to 3.3) for four to five exposures compared with no occupational exposure. The occupational exposures included job demands, job control, work posture, work shift, and lifting [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3217600321"><span class="h2">Shift and night work schedules</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A review of studies assessing the impact of fixed and rotating shift work schedules reported that, while the studies were not conclusive, the evidence suggested that both work schedules were associated with menstrual cycle disturbances and pregnancy loss [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. However, the effect size was uncertain. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Night shift work</strong> – Night shift work has been associated with a 20 to 30 percent increased risk of pregnancy loss (miscarriage), but the data regarding preterm birth are mixed, which may reflect the quantity of night shift work, gestational age of pregnancy, or other factors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A Danish nationwide register-based cohort study that used payroll data to verify shift measurement reported that women who had two or more night shifts the previous week had an increased risk of miscarriage after pregnancy week 8 (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.07-1.62) and that the risk increased in a dose-dependent pattern with the cumulative number of night shifts [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. The same study found that risk of preterm birth was not elevated among women working night shifts during either the first or second trimester and that, for night-shift workers, the risk did not relate to the number or duration of night shifts, consecutive night shifts, or quick returns defined as short intervals between shifts [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Working consecutive night shifts and quick returns after night shifts during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly among obese women who had up to a four- to fivefold increase [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A meta-analysis of 62 observational studies reported working fixed night shifts was associated with increased risk of miscarriage (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.47) and preterm birth (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.42) [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. However, the quality of the data was reported as being low to very low.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rotating and/or longer shifts</strong> – As compared with working a fixed-day shift, a meta-analysis of 62 studies found that working rotating shifts was associated with small increases in risk of preterm birth (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.28), small-for-gestational age (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.38), preeclampsia (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.01-3.01), and gestational hypertension (OR 1.19, 95% 1.10-1.29) [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Working longer than 40-hour shifts was associated with miscarriage (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08-1.77), preterm birth (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11-1.33), low birth weight (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.11-1.84), and small-for-gestational age (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00-1.36). Dose-response analysis showed that women working more than 55.5 hours (versus 40 hours) per week had a 10 percent increase in the odds of preterm birth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Shift work and child neurodevelopment</strong> – A national birth cohort study from Taiwan reported that persistent maternal shift work was associated with increased risks of delays in gross-motor neurodevelopmental milestones (adjusted OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06-1.76 for walking steadily), fine-motor neurodevelopmental milestones (adjusted OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.07-1.80 for scribbling), and social neurodevelopmental milestones (adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03-1.76 for coming when called) [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].

As stress has been associated with poor reproductive outcomes, clinicians are encouraged to ask women about all sources of stress in their lives. In a national population-based control study in the United State, the most common source of emotional stress at work was dealing with unpleasant or angry people [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Women who identified as non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic were more likely to be in jobs in which they had to address angry or unpleasant people ≥75 percent of the time compared with non-Hispanic White women or women who identified as other.</p><p>While issues related to work, the occupational setting, and job requirements may increase stress, they also may have a positive influence both directly (eg, social support from coworkers) and indirectly (eg, income stability, maintenance of medical insurance, available nutrition, protection from interpersonal violence) [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. In addition, significant stressors can develop in non-work-related aspects of the patient's life (eg, childcare, family illness). The influence of psychosocial factors on pregnancy outcomes may occur either directly via physiological pathways, or indirectly via behavioral pathways, or both. Psychosocial stress may also lead to unhealthy behaviors, including key behavioral risk factors for preterm birth such as poor diet/nutrition and smoking.</p><p>Maternal-placental-fetal neuroendocrine, immune/inflammatory and vascular processes all are responsive to stress, participate in the physiology of parturition, and may provide biological pathways that influence pregnancy outcome [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Stress is a common element activating a series of physiologic adaptive responses in the maternal and fetal compartments. Emerging data suggest that greater cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to acute stressors are predictive of poorer birth outcomes, but data are limited [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. In addition, maternal stress may also play a role in the development (or mis-development) of neural networks, also known as the connectome [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. One response involves activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which can initiate preterm birth [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Another response involves chronic extended activation of the sympathetic nervous system with increased secretion of catecholamines, which may decrease uterine blood flow and, in turn, lead to increased secretion of placental CRH [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. While a population-based cohort study reported that psychosocial work stress (high demands and low control) was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were not studied [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].

In pregnant women, blood lead elevations of 20 mcg/dL are of high concern because of the potential for adverse effects on the developing fetus, which is more susceptible to lead's toxic effects.

A synopsis of laws that serve as the basis of the United States federal legal framework, which applies in all states, is described below. These laws include the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) of 1978, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, and the Family Medical Act (FMLA) of 1993. These and related court rulings clarify legal expectations related to potential discrimination of pregnant women, their protection related to any occupation related disability, and employer provided benefits to which they are entitled.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1812201459"><span class="h3">Pregnancy Discrimination Act</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) of 1978 amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. This act requires employers with 15 or more employees to offer medical disability benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities just like all other temporary disabilities under any health, disability, insurance or sick leave plan [<a href="#rid101">101</a>]. Pregnant workers must be provided the same insurance benefits, accommodations, sick leave, seniority credits, and reinstatement privileges awarded workers disabled by other causes. In March 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a pregnant employee can make a prima facie case of discrimination by demonstrating that "she belongs to the protected class, that she sought accommodation, that the employer did not accommodate her." Such circumstances may merit a summary judgement standard "by providing evidence that the employer accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnant workers while failing to accommodate a large percentage of pregnant workers."</p><p>If an employer requires employees to obtain a clinician's note when taking sick leaves and collecting benefits, the same rule can be applied to pregnant employees.</p><p>In the United States, federal law prohibits discrimination due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions under the PDA and ADA [<a href="#rid102">102,103</a>]. The ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) in 2008 directed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to modify the degree of limitation defined as a disability replacing "severely or significantly" with "substantially limits," a more lenient standard. The ADA and ADAAA also apply to employers with 15 or more employees, including state and local governments. Provisions include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnant employees must be allowed to work so long as they can perform their jobs. Women who are pregnant or affected by related conditions must be treated in the same manner as other applicants or employees with similar abilities or limitations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Accommodations must be provided for pregnant women, regardless of the severity of their pregnancy-related work limitations, if similar accommodations are provided to other employees with similar abilities or inabilities to work.

Although several toxic substances found in the workplace also could harm men of reproductive age, men were not banned from jobs on that basis. Therefore, it is illegal for an employer to ban a woman from certain jobs because she might become pregnant while working there.</p><p>Despite these legal protections, literature suggests that women may not be able to take advantage of full PDA policies.
