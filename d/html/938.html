The majority of these impulses do not conduct to the ventricles because of the electrophysiologic properties of the AV node. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16402.html" rel="external">"Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation", section on 'Role of the atrioventricular node'</a>.)</p><p>AV nodal tissue consists of so-called "slow response" fibers, giving it decremental conduction properties. In most myocardial tissue, the initial depolarizing phase of the action potential (phase 0) is mediated by rapid sodium channels. In contrast, in the slow response fibers of the AV node, phase 0 is mediated by an inward calcium current, which uses a kinetically slow channel. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/895.html" rel="external">"Cardiac excitability, mechanisms of arrhythmia, and action of antiarrhythmic drugs"</a>.)</p><p>The relatively slow kinetics of the inward calcium current limit conduction velocity through the AV node, and therefore the ventricular rate during AF. In addition to these intrinsic properties, the AV node is also richly supplied and affected by both components of the autonomic nervous system. AV conduction is enhanced by sympathetic fibers and slowed by parasympathetic fibers  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75699" href="/z/d/graphic/75699.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In the typical patient with untreated AF, the ventricular rate during the day varies between 90 and 170 beats/min. The ventricular rate may be slower (eg, less than 60 beats/min) in the following settings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased vagal tone</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Drugs that affect AV nodal conduction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>AV nodal disease, which should be suspected if the ventricular rate is below 60 beats/min in the absence of a drug that slows AV conduction</p><p></p><p>A ventricular rate above 200 beats/min suggests one or more of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Catecholamine excess</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Enhanced AV nodal conduction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Parasympathetic withdrawal</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hyperthyroidism</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An accessory pathway as occurs in the preexcitation syndrome (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/976.html" rel="external">"Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2677831657"><span class="h2">Drug mechanisms of action</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ventricular rate in AF is slowed using beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, and to a lesser extent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/z/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">digoxin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/z/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a>. In general, calcium channel blockers are effective at rest and during exercise, beta blockers are similarly effective at rest but more effective during exercise, and digoxin is reasonably effective at rest but less effective than the other drugs during exercise. Thus, it is particularly important to assess ventricular rate with exertion in patients treated with digoxin alone. These agents slow AV nodal conduction based upon the following physiologic mechanisms  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51932" href="/z/d/graphic/51932.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Calcium channel blockade </strong>– Blockade of the calcium channel with the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10043" href="/z/d/drug information/10043.html" rel="external">verapamil</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9365" href="/z/d/drug information/9365.html" rel="external">diltiazem</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Beta blockade </strong>– Decreased sympathetic tone and slowed AV nodal conduction with beta blockers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Enhancement of parasympathetic tone </strong>– This is done with vagotonic drugs, the most important of which is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/z/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">digoxin</a>.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2317372003"><span class="h1">RATIONALE FOR RATE LOWERING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Specific reasons for slowing the ventricular rate in patients with AF include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemodynamic instability </strong>–<strong> </strong>This may be acute and may require urgent therapy. This is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1041.html" rel="external">"Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms </strong>– Patients with AF may or may not have associated symptoms, and the spectrum of symptoms is broad. Typical symptoms include palpitations, tachycardia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, reduced exercise capacity, increased urination, or mild dyspnea. Symptoms of AF are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation", section on 'Symptoms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy </strong>– Persistently increased ventricular rates in AF have been associated with left ventricular cardiomyopathy. While this issue has not been well studied, we believe that this phenomenon is unlikely to occur if the ventricular rate is kept below 110 beats/min, which is the recommended ventricular rate goal. This is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1062.html" rel="external">"Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Potential mortality benefit </strong>– There is some evidence to suggest a mortality benefit from rate control. In a large, population-based cohort study in Taiwan, mortality in individuals receiving beta blockers (43,879), nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (18,466), and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/z/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">digoxin</a> (38,898) was compared with mortality in individuals not taking a rate-control drug. Patients were excluded if they were taking more than one rate-slowing drug. After adjustment for baseline differences, the risk of death was lower in patients receiving beta blockers (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.76; 95% CI 0.74-0.78) and calcium channel blockers (adjusted HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.90-0.96). However, the risk of death was higher in the group receiving digoxin (adjusted HR 1.12; 95% CI 1.10-1.14). We recommend caution in applying to clinical practice the findings in this nonrandomized study.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm </strong>–<strong> </strong>Some patients whose rate has been slowed and who then tolerate AF may spontaneously convert to normal sinus rhythm without the need for electrical cardioversion. Spontaneous conversion is most likely to occur in patients with a duration of AF of less than 48 hours, or in patients with a history of short, self-limited episodes [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The rate of spontaneous conversion has been reported to be around 50 percent at 48 hours [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In a retrospective study of 438 patients with AF, if the AF onset was &lt;48 hours, spontaneous conversion occurred in 77 percent compared with 36 percent in the group with first onset AF &gt;48 hours [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In a separate study of 943 patients, spontaneous conversion was shown to occur most frequently in patients with first-onset AF &lt;24 hours, a lower body mass index, and normal left atrial size [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">EVALUATION AND GOAL VENTRICULAR RATE</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation and monitoring of ventricular rate </strong>– In practice, the ventricular rate can be assessed by measurement of both the resting ventricular rate and use of one of the following to assess exercise:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Six-minute walk test (at moderate exercise)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90285" href="/z/d/graphic/90285.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Either submaximal or maximal exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1494.html" rel="external">"Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 24-hour ambulatory monitor can also be used to evaluate efficacy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/958.html" rel="external">"Ambulatory ECG monitoring"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with an implantable pacemaker or defibrillator, device interrogation provides useful diagnostic data to assess rate control, including a ventricular rate histogram during episodes of AF.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For young active patients, we recommend either an exercise ECG test or ambulatory monitoring during exercise. For older or sedentary patients, measuring ventricular rate after walking briskly around the office or upstairs may provide sufficient information. Wearable devices, such as an electronic watch that connects with a smartphone application, also can provide ventricular rate data. Caution is advised with relying entirely on photoplethysmography, which may undersense individual beats in AF and report an inaccurately low heart rate [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Heart rate reports should be verified with ECG strips, which may also be obtainable from some wearable technologies.</p><p></p><p>These methods of assessing ventricular rate can be used both at the start of therapy and for long-term follow-up.</p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the assessment of ventricular rate control, average ventricular rate is considered the most important parameter. Ventricular rates during peak exercise may also be valuable. Assessment of rate control can be confusing when using monitors that display continuous beat-to-beat ventricular rate rather than average ventricular rate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Goal ventricular rate </strong>– The optimal long-term ventricular rate for patients in AF has not been firmly established [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. For most symptomatic patients with AF, we suggest a ventricular rate goal of 85 beats/min. In general, the goal is to control the rate during activity to prevent or treat symptoms. If the ventricular rate during AF is faster than would be expected during sinus rhythm and occurs at a time that correlates with the patient's symptoms, then rate control medications are usually titrated upwards.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the subset of patients with AF who are asymptomatic and have permanent AF, a less strict rate control goal of &lt;110 beats/min may be reasonable. These patients should be monitored for the development of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1062.html" rel="external">"Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Alternative goal rates that are similar to those recommended for patients in sinus rhythm with heart disease can also be used: resting heart rate ≤80 beats/min and ≤110 beats/min during moderate exercise such as with the six-minute walk. Goals similar to these were used in many of the trials of rate versus rhythm control, such as AFFIRM [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The AFFIRM study is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1045.html" rel="external">"Management of atrial fibrillation: Rhythm control versus rate control", section on 'High cardiovascular risk'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The prevention of symptoms during normal activities or exercise is a primary goal of therapy. It is important to consider that symptoms may be due to either inadequate rate control or relative bradycardia (eg, in patients with tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/940.html" rel="external">"Sinus node dysfunction: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Thus, for those patients in whom a lenient strategy is chosen but who remain symptomatic, an attempt should be made to decrease symptoms by setting a lower rate goal. A more lenient rate-control strategy offers the advantages of less medication (fewer drug side effects, lower cost) and fewer outpatient visits to achieve ventricular rate control.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The recommended goal rate is based on the observation that 85 beats/min was the mean achieved rate for patients assigned lenient rate control in the RACE study [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In this trial of patients with permanent AF, adhering to a strict rather than lenient rate-control strategy did not improve cardiovascular or safety outcomes. This study also supports our practice in which achieving strict rate control is not necessary in many physically active patients with AF who are minimally symptomatic. In the RACE study, 614 physically active patients with permanent AF were randomly assigned either lenient rate control (resting heart rate &lt;110 beats/min) or a strict rate control (resting heart rate &lt;80 beats/min and heart rate during moderate exercise &lt;110 beats per minute). Patients were followed for the primary outcome of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, systemic embolism, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmic events. The following findings were noted:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Similar efficacy of lenient and strict rate control </strong>– After three years, the estimated cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was similar in both groups (12.9 versus 14.9 percent, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.84; 90% CI 0.58-1.21).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Fewer people in strict versus lenient group met heart rate target </strong>– The percentage of patients was 98 and 75 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>More medical visits in strict rate-control group </strong>– There were nearly nine times as many visits (684 versus 75) to achieve rate control target(s) in the strict control.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Low resting heart rates were achieved in the lenient group too </strong>– In patients assigned to lenient rate control, the mean resting rates at the end of follow-up was 85+14 beats/min compared with 76+14 beats/min in those assigned to strict control.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The results of the RACE trial must be tempered given that the lenient-control group was in fact treated more aggressively than the protocol required. In addition, RACE included only patients with permanent AF, so the results are not generalizable to those with paroxysmal or persistent AF.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3110611850"><span class="h1">INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial management of patients with AF and a rapid ventricular response involves the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determining if urgent therapy is needed</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Choosing between a rate and rhythm control strategy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determining if there is preexcitation</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1021631"><span class="h2">Determining urgency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a patient with new or recurrent AF with a rapid ventricular response, the immediate goals are to stabilize hemodynamics (if necessary) and to improve symptoms.

Magnesium does have physiologic properties suggesting that it might have efficacy for rate control in AF. Initial small studies provided the rationale for a clinical trial in which 199 patients presenting with rapid AF (mean baseline ventricular rate 142 beats/min) were treated with usual therapy for rate control (most often <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/z/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">digoxin</a>) and randomly assigned to IV <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9585" href="/z/d/drug information/9585.html" rel="external">magnesium sulfate</a> (2.5 g over 20 minutes followed by 2.5 g over two hours) or placebo [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Magnesium therapy increased the likelihood of achieving a ventricular rate &lt;100 beats/min (65 versus 34 percent with placebo) and conversion to sinus rhythm (27 versus 12 percent with placebo). However, the difference in mean ventricular rate never exceeded 12 beats/min. The benefit of magnesium was modest, preferred primary therapies (calcium channel blocker, beta blocker) were used in only 12 to 13 percent of the patients, and magnesium was associated with side effects such as flushing and hypotension. A separate meta-analysis of six trials and 745 patients showed similar results [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="101166" href="/z/d/drug information/101166.html" rel="external">Ivabradine</a> blocks the pacemaker current, which is primarily thought to affect the sinoatrial node; however, some studies have shown that this current is also expressed in the atrioventricular node. Accordingly, a few studies are investigating the use of ivabradine for ventricular rate control in AF. One retrospective study of 18 patients with permanent AF showed average reduction in ventricular rate from 104.6 to 89 [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The BRAKE-AF trial randomized patients with permanent AF to ivabradine or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/z/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">digoxin</a>. Ivabradine was found to reduce the average ventricular rate by an average of 11.6 beats/minute, which was significantly less than the reduction observed with digoxin (19.6 beats/minute). Though the number of serious adverse events were similar in each group, ivabradine was better tolerated and had a higher compliance through the study [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. At present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of ivabradine for ventricular rate control in AF; it can be used if more commonly used rate control agents are unsuccessful or not tolerated [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3496752725"><span class="h2">Transition to oral medications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When making a transition from IV to oral therapy, we first ensure that the patient has tolerated the IV medication well.
