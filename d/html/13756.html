         Calcinosis cutis is a descriptive term for the deposition of insoluble calcium salts in the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Based upon the etiology of calcium deposition, there are five subtypes of calcinosis cutis: dystrophic, metastatic, idiopathic, iatrogenic, and calciphylaxis  (

          Metastatic calcinosis cutis
         </strong>
         – Metastatic calcinosis cutis results from abnormal calcium or phosphate metabolism, leading to the precipitation of calcium in skin and subcutaneous tissue.

         <strong>
          Calciphylaxis
         </strong>
         – Calciphylaxis demonstrates calcification of the small and medium-sized blood vessels, particularly of the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. This is thought to occur from disturbances in calcium and phosphate metabolism; often, hyperparathyroidism is present [
         <a href="#rid1">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with the first four subtypes of calcinosis cutis may present with skin-colored, white-yellow, or erythematous firm papules, nodules, or plaques that may exhibit ulceration or extrusion of chalky white material  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101499 graphicRef101500 graphicRef101501 graphicRef101502 graphicRef101498 graphicRef101503" href="/z/d/graphic/101499.html" rel="external">
          picture 1A-F
         </a>
         ). In calciphylaxis, the primary involvement of the vasculature typically leads to painful violaceous nodules or plaques, retiform purpura, and ulceration  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66308" href="/z/d/graphic/66308.html" rel="external">
          picture 2A
         </a>
         ). Calcinosis may also be evident only as a histologic or radiologic finding  (

         The various subtypes of calcinosis cutis (dystrophic calcinosis cutis, metastatic calcinosis cutis, idiopathic calcinosis cutis, iatrogenic calcinosis cutis, and calciphylaxis) are associated with particular inciting factors and physical features.

         Dystrophic calcinosis cutis is the result of deposition of insoluble calcium salts into previously damaged tissue despite normal serum calcium and phosphorous levels. Tissue damage, in the way of structural damage, hypovascularity, or tissue hypoxia [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], promotes an increased intracellular calcium influx, leading to mineralization of the tissue [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Dystrophic calcification is the most common type of calcinosis cutis. The clinical presentation ranges in severity from an incidental finding on radiographic imaging to subcutaneous nodules or plaques [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], which can be associated with pain or functional impairment  (

          picture 1A-D
         </a>
         ). In particular, exophytic or ulcerated areas of involvement can lead to prominent discomfort, and dystrophic calcification located over joints can become painful and may interfere with daily activities through secondary muscle atrophy or joint contractures [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. A retrospective study from a tertiary referral center found that 69 percent of 78 patients with dystrophic calcinosis cutis reported associated pain [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

          Systemic sclerosis

         – Dystrophic calcinosis cutis develops in approximately 25 percent of patients with systemic sclerosis, particularly in those with the limited variant [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ] or CREST (calcification, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome  (

          image 1A-B
         </a>
         ). The calcium deposits are composed of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals and most frequently form at sites of recurrent microtrauma. The most frequently involved sites are the feet and hands (particularly fingers), followed by the extremities (excluding hands and feet) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. As the calcified deposits enlarge, they may ulcerate or become exophytic, exuding a chalky white-yellow material. Calcinosis cutis may be more prominent in patients with anticentromere antibodies than in other patients with systemic sclerosis [

         Chronic renal failure leads to hyperphosphatemia through a variety of mechanisms. Diseased kidneys are inefficient at clearing phosphate from the blood, leading to an increasing serum level. This high serum phosphate leads both directly and indirectly to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Additionally, the vitamin D3 level is decreased given malfunction of the kidneys, which leads to decreased calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and thus serum hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia induces secondary hyperparathyroidism, which in turn stimulates bone reabsorption, further elevating serum levels of phosphorus and calcium. Most often in metastatic calcification associated with chronic renal disease, the serum calcium is normal but the serum phosphate level is increased. (See

         Although calciphylaxis is most common in patients with end-stage kidney disease, the condition has also been increasingly documented in patients with normal renal function.

         <a href="#rid14">
          14,28

         The diagnosis of calcinosis cutis may be suspected based upon physical findings. Physical findings that should raise suspicion for this diagnosis of are firm papules or nodules, particularly when the papules or nodules ulcerate or extrude chalky white-yellow material. A skin biopsy of an involved area confirms the diagnosis and will demonstrate calcium in the dermis or subcutis manifesting as intensely basophilic deposits on hematoxylin and eosin-stained specimens. Calcium will stain black with performance of a von Kossa tissue stain. A foreign body reaction may surround the calcium deposits.

          Osteoma cutis
         </strong>
         – Osteoma cutis is a condition in which bone formation occurs in the skin, manifesting as very firm papules or plaques  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101039" href="/z/d/graphic/101039.html" rel="external">
          picture 15
         </a>
         ). Osteoma cutis may occur in sites of scarring (eg, acne scars), skin inflammation, or within cutaneous neoplasms, such as nevi, pilomatricomas, basal cell carcinomas, or cysts. Osteoma cutis is also a feature of several genetic diseases, including fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, progressive osseous heterodysplasia, and plate-like osteoma cutis. A skin biopsy can confirm a diagnosis of osteoma cutis. Osteoma cutis is also visible on radiographic images.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Knowledge of the patient history and a careful physical examination is often sufficient to recognize these conditions. When necessary, a biopsy can confirm the diagnosis.
        </p>

         The differential diagnosis of calciphylaxis is reviewed separately. (See

         A full skin examination should be performed to identify the extent of calcinosis cutis. Palpation is useful for identifying areas of involvement that are more easily felt than seen. The physical examination may also provide clues for the type of calcinosis cutis present based upon the morphology and distribution of involvement and the presence of other cutaneous and noncutaneous signs suggestive of an underlying disease.

         Calcinosis cutis is a descriptive term for the deposition of insoluble calcium salts in cutaneous or subcutaneous tissue. Calcinosis cutis can be divided into five subtypes: dystrophic calcinosis cutis, metastatic calcinosis cutis, idiopathic calcinosis cutis, iatrogenic calcinosis cutis, and calciphylaxis  (

         Dystrophic calcinosis cutis is the most common form of calcinosis cutis. Dystrophic calcinosis cutis may occur in the setting of autoimmune connective tissue disease (most common), panniculitis, porphyria cutanea tarda, select genodermatoses, cutaneous neoplasms, trauma, and infection. The autoimmune connective tissue diseases most likely to exhibit calcinosis cutis are systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis. (See

         Metastatic calcification occurs as a result of abnormal calcium or phosphate metabolism leading to precipitation of calcium in skin and subcutaneous tissue. Chronic renal failure is the most common cause of metastatic calcification. (See
         <a class="local">

         Idiopathic calcinosis cutis occurs in the absence of a detectable cause of tissue injury or metabolic disorder. Idiopathic calcification of the scrotum, subepidermal calcified nodule, and tumoral calcinosis are forms of idiopathic calcinosis cutis. (See

         Cutaneous manifestations of calciphylaxis result from calcium deposition in the walls of small and medium-sized blood vessels in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Calciphylaxis most frequently occurs in patients with end-stage kidney disease. (See

         The clinical manifestations of calcinosis cutis vary widely. Patients may present with firm papules, nodules, or plaques that are skin-colored, white-yellow, or erythematous  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101499 graphicRef101500 graphicRef101501 graphicRef101502 graphicRef101498 graphicRef101503" href="/z/d/graphic/101499.html" rel="external">
          picture 1A-F
         </a>
         ). Ulceration or extrusion of calcium may be present. Calciphylaxis usually presents with painful retiform purpura and ulceration. In some cases, calcinosis cutis is an incidental histologic or radiologic finding  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97989 graphicRef101496" href="/z/d/graphic/97989.html" rel="external">

         The diagnosis of calcinosis cutis may be suspected based upon the patient history and physical examination. A skin biopsy confirms the diagnosis. An evaluation to determine the subtype, etiology, and extent of involvement is indicated for patients with calcinosis cutis. (See
