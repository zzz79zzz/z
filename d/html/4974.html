         Infants who require neonatal intensive care remain at increased risk for morbidity and mortality following discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review discharge planning for high-risk newborns, including preterm infants, infants with complex medical problems, infants who require medical devices or technologies (eg, gastrostomy tube, tracheostomy, ventilator), and those who require prolonged NICU care for other reasons. The focus is primarily on preterm infants &lt;35 weeks gestation, as they represent the majority of NICU graduates. The care of the NICU graduate following discharge is discussed separately. (See

        <p>
         Healthy late preterm infants born at 35 to &lt;37 weeks gestation are often cared for in the well newborn nursery, usually with a relatively short hospital stay compared with that of more preterm infants. Nevertheless, late preterm infants are at increased risk for certain complications (feeding problems, temperature dysregulation, respiratory problems) after discharge. Discharge planning for late preterm neonates is discussed separately. (See

         Successful discharge preparation facilitates family readiness and, ultimately, improved outcomes in the important transition from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to home [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It helps to minimize the risk of morbidity and mortality from premature discharge and to prevent prolongation of the hospital stay in an infant ready for discharge. A successful discharge planning program provides sufficient education and support to families/caregivers to help them transition successfully to home [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. It includes assessment of the infant's medical status and readiness for discharge, preparation for families to care for their infant at home, and transitioning the ongoing care for the infant to community providers. An inadequately planned discharge to home from the NICU may increase the risk for morbidity and mortality. As a result, a comprehensive discharge planning program is needed to ensure a smooth transition from the NICU to home.
        </p>
        <p>
         Discharge planning should be developed and implemented by a multidisciplinary team consisting of the parents/caregivers, physicians, nurses, neonatal nurse practitioners, respiratory therapists, occupational and/or physical therapists, dieticians, feeding specialists, pharmacists, case managers, social workers, and the identified primary care provider whenever possible. The process begins shortly after an infant is admitted to the NICU and is continued through regularly scheduled planning sessions during hospitalization.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following are the components of discharge planning that are consistent with the 2008 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published discharge guidelines for the infant cared for in the NICU  (

         Infants ready for discharge must be medically stable and without any acute illness.
        </p>
        <p>
         For preterm infants, discharge is considered only if an infant demonstrates physiologic stability by showing competency in all of the following functions:

          Maintain normal body temperature
         </strong>
         – Infants must maintain axillary temperature between 36.5 and 37.5ºC (97.0 and 100.3ºF) or rectal temperature between 36.6 and 38.0ºC (97.8 to 100.4ºF) in an open crib with normal ambient temperature between 20 and 22.2ºC (68 and 72ºF).

         – The length of time before discharge that an infant should be free from apnea and bradycardia is controversial. However, five to eight days of observation after discontinuation of

         <strong>
          Demonstrate a consistent pattern of appropriate weight gain
         </strong>
         – There is a lack of clarity on how best to define optimal rates of growth for preterm infants. In our centers, for preterm infants with weights less than 2 kg, we use a weight gain goal of 15 to 20 g/day, and for preterm infants greater than 2 kg, a weight gain of 20 to 30 g/day. For term infants we use a goal of 25 to 35 g/day. The growth should be parallel to the normal growth curve. If the other criteria are met, attaining a specific weight is not necessary for discharge.

         <strong>
          Demonstrate stability in supine sleeping position
         </strong>
         – The infant needs to be able to sleep with head of bed flat in a supine position without compromising the infant's health and safety. Because the medical needs of the high-risk newborn may require nonsupine positioning, each NICU should have an established protocol in place to transition the infant to a safe sleep position and environment as soon as medically possible and well before discharge, consistent with the policy published in the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the medical team prepares and educates family/caregivers on the importance of maintaining a safe home environment to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6366.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, the infant is discharged before one of the above competencies is met (eg, still require supplemental gavage tube feedings). In such cases, there should be a suitable plan for home care and monitoring that is agreed upon by the family, the health care team, and the medical home. This may require additional support (eg, equipment and personal) at home, which will also need to be arranged.

          Retinopathy of prematurity
         </strong>
         – Infants at risk for developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) include those with gestational age [GA] &lt;30 weeks or birth weight &lt;1500 g and select infants &gt;30 weeks with birth weight 1500 to 2000 g who have other risk factors. These infants should have ophthalmologic screening. Examinations should continue until the infant's retinal vessels are mature and no longer at risk for developing ROP. After the retinal vessels are mature, follow-up with a pediatric ophthalmologist should be scheduled before the end of the first year of life, and sooner if concerns arise such as strabismus, nystagmus, or poor visual tracking.

          Hearing screening
         </strong>
         – Hearing screening is performed using automated auditory brainstem responses. Because of the increased risk of late-onset hearing loss in neonatal intensive care graduates, follow-up hearing evaluation should be scheduled within six to nine months after discharge, and within one to three months of age in at-risk infants (eg, infants with cytomegalovirus, meningitis, or severe hyperbilirubinemia). All infants who do not pass their NICU screen should be tested for congenital CMV infection. (See

          Brain imaging

         – In addition to performing earlier screening for intraventricular hemorrhage, brain imaging with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be recommended at a postmenstrual age close to term and prior to discharge to detect periventricular leukomalacia or white matter injury in at-risk infants.

         In addition, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis should be given to all eligible infants, as discussed separately. (See

         <strong>
          Support caregivers
         </strong>
         – Clinicians should ensure parent/caregiver readiness and acquisition of the skills and knowledge required for home care of their infant. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Caregivers' competency and understanding'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The home environment should be prepared with procurement of the necessary items required for the daily care of the infant. The clinical team should evaluate the family's social, financial, and mental health needs, and if needed, make referrals to services at the time of discharge. (See

          Identify an outpatient clinician
         </strong>
         – A primary care pediatric provider with expertise in caring for infants discharged from the NICU who will provide a medical home after discharge should be selected. Ongoing communication with the primary care provider during hospitalization and a summary of the NICU course will facilitate transition of care at discharge. (See
         <a class="local">
