         hydrochloride is a selective 5-HT3 antagonist that has been approved for the treatment of patients with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who failed to respond to conventional treatment. The drug has been reintroduced to the market after being withdrawn due to adverse effects including severe constipation and ischemic colitis. Communications from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggest that fewer than 5 percent of patients with IBS are considered to have severe disease, have symptoms that last more than six months and curtail daily activities, and that only a fraction of these have diarrhea-predominant symptoms. Thus, the proportion of IBS patients who will be eligible for alosetron is small [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We begin treatment with a low starting dose of 0.5 mg once daily, which can be increased to 0.5 mg twice daily after four weeks if the lower dose is well tolerated but does not adequately control symptoms. If the response is inadequate after four weeks of 0.5 mg twice daily and the patient is tolerating

          alosetron
         </a>
         , the dose can be increased to 1 mg twice daily (maximum 2 mg/day). This topic review will summarize the major clinical trials of alosetron in IBS. A general approach to IBS is presented separately. (See

         selectively blocks 5-HT3 receptors, which are extensively distributed on enteric motor neurons and in peripheral afferents and central locations such as the vomiting center. The receptors are cation channels that modulate visceral pain, colonic transit, and gastrointestinal secretion.
        </p>
        <p>
         In nonconstipated patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9299" href="/z/d/drug information/9299.html" rel="external">
          alosetron
         </a>
         decreases brain activity of central autonomic networks (mostly in the amygdala, ventral striatum, and dorsal pons) that mediate emotional expression in response to aversive rectal stimuli [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. It is unclear whether this reduction in activation of central structures results from a central effect of the medication or is simply the downstream effect of a reduction in the ability of peripheral visceral afferent nerves that convey sensations of pain and discomfort to the spinal cord and central nervous system [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Brain imaging studies suggest that greater symptom improvement on alosetron in IBS patients was predicted by less activity in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex and medial temporal gyrus during pre-treatment scans, which may be partially predicted by psychological factors [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. An explanation for the greater efficacy demonstrated in human clinical trials in females with IBS-diarrhea was provided by studies in serotonin-transporter (SERT) knock-out rats, in which there is visceral hypersensitivity in response to colorectal balloon distention. In this model, increased 5-HT signaling at dorsal spine 5-HT
         <sub>
          3
         </sub>
         receptors was responsible for visceral hypersensitivity in female but not male SERT-KO rats [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although effects on peripheral afferents have not been conclusively demonstrated in humans, there are ample experimental animal data to suggest that
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9299" href="/z/d/drug information/9299.html" rel="external">
          alosetron
         </a>
         reduces nociception by blocking peripheral sensory pathways. It increases the number and propagation length of high-amplitude contractions in the left colon, leading to a paradoxical decrease in stool frequency and a firming of stool consistency [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. It also significantly retards small intestinal and colonic transit in females to a much larger degree than in males [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. The degree of response to alosetron may be due to genetic polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin gene [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There is also evidence from animal studies that 5-HT3 antagonists affect intestinal secretion, which may benefit patients with IBS and diarrhea [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 2C9 (30 percent), 3A4 (18 percent), and 1A2 (10 percent). It is likely that increased exposure to alosetron occurs in patients with hepatic insufficiency, although no pharmacokinetic data are available. Renal impairment (creatinine clearance 4 to 56 mL/min) has no effect on the renal elimination. However, the effect of renal impairment on the excretion of alosetron metabolites has not been assessed.

         , which are metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. Alosetron does not alter the pharmacokinetics or efficacy for a low-dose combination oral contraceptive, and thromboembolic risk is not increased when alosetron is coadministered with an oral contraceptive [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The latter is important given the risk of ischemic colitis identified with alosetron (approximately 1 per 1000 patient-years).

         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. IBS was diagnosed based upon the Rome criteria. The mean age of the females was 46, and the majority (approximately 90 percent) were White Americans. The first of these phase III trials was published in final form [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         ]. A third phase III study compared alosetron (1 mg twice daily) with mebeverine, an antispasmodic approved in Europe for the treatment of IBS [

         The primary endpoints of the placebo-controlled trials were adequate relief of pain and discomfort, which was assessed weekly. Secondary endpoints were the percentage of days with urgency and daily assessment of stool frequency and consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
         In both of the phase III placebo-controlled studies,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9299" href="/z/d/drug information/9299.html" rel="external">
          alosetron
         </a>
         was associated with a significant improvement in the proportion of females with pain relief during treatment (41 versus 29 percent and 41 versus 26 percent in the two studies, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. The beneficial response for the primary endpoints (pain and discomfort) was observed within one to four weeks after beginning therapy, and was sustained throughout the duration of the trial  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70978" href="/z/d/graphic/70978.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Bloating was not improved. Within one week after discontinuing the drug, symptoms were comparable to those in females receiving placebo. Secondary endpoints relating to bowel movements were typically improved within one week of starting therapy. Subgroup analysis in one of the two studies revealed that the benefit appeared to be confined to patients with diarrhea-predominant symptoms.

         was associated with a significant decrease in the percentage of days with urgency compared with placebo throughout the study. Treatment was associated with firmer stools and a significant decrease in stool frequency. These symptoms improved within one week of beginning therapy, and returned to baseline (pretreatment) levels similar to those of the placebo-treated group within one week of discontinuing therapy.

        <p>
         Several issues need to be considered when interpreting the efficacy data discussed above:
        </p>
        <p>
         First, the studies discussed above used a 1 mg twice-daily dose in contrast to the 1 mg once-daily dose recommended for initiating therapy only in females with severe diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Randomized trials have also demonstrated that
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9299" href="/z/d/drug information/9299.html" rel="external">
          alosetron
         </a>
         0.5 mg every day results in statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in health-related quality of life (QOL), restriction of daily activities, and treatment satisfaction over placebo [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Postmarketing studies'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Second, although the females included in the trials were permitted to take fiber, other agents commonly used to treat IBS-D (such as antidiarrheal, antispasmodic, and anticholinergic) were not permitted. Thus, whether
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9299" href="/z/d/drug information/9299.html" rel="external">
          alosetron
         </a>
         would have an added benefit compared to standard approaches is uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Third, although the absolute proportion of females who benefited from therapy is clinically significant, nearly 30 percent of females in the placebo arm also achieved the primary endpoint. The placebo response rate of these trials approximated the mean placebo response rate described in the literature [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. While many previous trials in IBS had flawed experimental designs [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ], other trials show enhanced trial methodology. This opens the question as to how effective comparable agents or approved antispasmodics might be if evaluated by the same methods.
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9299" href="/z/d/drug information/9299.html" rel="external">
          Alosetron
         </a>
         was significantly superior in the only study in which it was directly compared with an active agent (mebeverine) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A fourth issue is that the trials described above have not necessarily identified the optimal method of administration (eg, intermittent, during exacerbation, or continuous). Thus, further phase IV studies will be needed to evaluate optimal dosing regimens, safety, and effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, the cost-effectiveness of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9299" href="/z/d/drug information/9299.html" rel="external">
          alosetron

         has been defined; its cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained is substantial [

At the end of the study, significantly more patients in the alosetron group achieved the primary outcome. Alosetron was also associated with a significant increase in stool firmness and a decrease in the proportion of days with urgency and mean stool frequency.

         These agents were more likely to cause constipation (pooled RR 4.28; 95% CI 3.28-5.60); there was less constipation with 5-HT3 antagonists in IBS-D patients than in mixed populations (nonconstipated IBS and IBS-D; RR ratio 0.65; 95% CI 0.41-0.99).

Furthermore, a greater percentage of patients had improvement on a global improvement scale at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Constipation occurred significantly more often in the alosetron group (28 versus 9 percent).

         <a href="#rid19">
          19,28

         ]. In one randomized trial, alosetron 0.5 mg and 1 mg once daily as well as 1 mg twice daily were effective in providing global improvement in IBS symptoms, adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort, and improvement in bowel symptoms in females with severe IBS-D [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. These data are important since the prevalence of constipation was 19 percent with the highest dose, 9 percent with the lowest dose of 0.5 mg/day, and 5 percent with placebo. This suggests that it is prudent to start with 0.5 mg alosetron dose and to titrate the dose up if needed. This is a clinically appealing strategy that has been used by the author as a precaution to reduce the risk of constipation and potential for associated adverse events. This strategy is particularly relevant given evidence that genetic variation in the serotonin reuptake transporter influences the response to therapy [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that one patient on the lowest dose 0.5 mg alosetron (out of 175 patients) developed ischemic colitis. Hence, caution is always necessary when using this medication in patients with IBS.

Alosetron treatment, including 0.5 mg once daily, resulted in statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in health-related QOL, restriction of daily activities, and treatment satisfaction over placebo. IBS symptom improvement was associated with positive changes in IBS QOL, lost workplace productivity, and treatment satisfaction. The incidence of adverse events with alosetron was low, with constipation being the most commonly reported event. A single case of ischemic colitis occurred in a patient receiving alosetron 0.5 mg once daily [

         <a href="#rid36">
          36

         ]. Based upon postmarketing surveillance, the rate of ischemic colitis and serious complications of constipation were estimated to be 1.1 and 0.66 per 1000 patient-years of alosetron, respectively. A nine-year evaluation of temporal trends in alosetron postmarketing safety under the risk management program showed that cumulative incidence rate of ischemic colitis (1.03 cases/1000 patient-years) is low and stable, while that of complications of constipation (0.25 cases/1000 patient-years) is low and has been decreasing over time [

          alosetron

         is uncertain. It may be due to a drug class effect given that a related drug (cilansetron) has also been associated with ischemic colitis [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. However, IBS itself has also been associated with ischemic colitis in epidemiologic studies [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Further complicating matters is the observation that focal active colitis may be seen in asymptomatic patients undergoing screening colonoscopy, and such a finding may be misclassified as being caused by ischemia [

        <p>
         In experimental settings, preconstricted arterioles exhibited normal dilatory responses to balloon distension in the presence or absence of 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 antagonists, suggesting that these classes of receptors do not change the ability of normal vessels to induce reflex vasodilatation [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41

         ]. Intravenously administered

          alosetron
         </a>
         (0.03 to 0.3 mg per kg) and cilansetron caused a small and transient constriction of the rat mesenteric vascular bed, whereas blood flow in the colon remained unaltered; oral administration of alosetron had no effects at any site [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Some authors have speculated that ischemia results from constipation that may result from the slow transit induced by 5-HT3 antagonists. Subtle changes in Doppler mucosal blood flow have been observed in patients with normal or slow transit constipation [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. However, it is unclear whether these subtle differences can overcome the pressure-flow autoregulation intrinsic to colonic blood flow; thus, even with perfusion pressures of 60 mmHg, increased oxygen extraction will maintain normal colonic oxygen uptake [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, although rise in intraluminal pressure or straining may temporarily reduce mucosal blood flow [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ], such changes are not sustained over time, and it is typical for contractile amplitudes and frequency of high-amplitude contractions to be reduced rather than increased in patients with constipation [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46,47

          Alosetron
         </a>
         hydrochloride is a selective 5-HT3 antagonist that has been approved for the treatment of females with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who failed to respond to conventional treatment. (See

          Alosetron
         </a>
         selectively blocks 5-HT3 receptors, which are extensively distributed on enteric motor neurons and in peripheral afferents and central locations such as the vomiting center. The receptors are cation channels that modulate visceral pain, colonic transit, and gastrointestinal secretion. (See

         is more effective than placebo and mebeverine in the treatment of females who have diarrhea-predominant IBS. However, the lingering safety concerns and the restrictions have limited the role of alosetron in the treatment of IBS. (See

         include constipation and ischemic colitis. A systematic review of the published literature and cases reported through the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System estimated that the risk of ischemic colitis associated with alosetron was significantly higher than with placebo (0.15 versus 0.0 percent), but there was no significant difference in the rate of serious complications of constipation.
