         Sleep-related complaints are common among older adults (ie, adults &gt;65 years old). In older adults, it is often difficult to distinguish whether such complaints are a consequence of normal aging, a primary sleep disorder, or a medical illness [

         We encourage all clinicians to evaluate older adults with a thorough history and examination in order to elucidate sleep complaints and habits. The threshold to inquire about sleep should be particularly low in those with risk factors for sleep disorders. This includes patients with heart failure and stroke (ie, risk factors for sleep apnea), a recent psychologically traumatic event (eg, death of a family member; risk factor for insomnia), dementia, depression, and anxiety (ie, risk factors for insomnia), Parkinson’s disease (ie, risk factor for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder), and anemia and renal failure (ie, risk factors for restless leg syndrome).
        </p>
        <p>
         We question patients and their bed partner (if available) regarding their typical sleep habits. At a minimum this should include their usual bedtime, how long it takes to fall asleep, number of nocturnal awakenings, typical wake time and out of bed time in the morning, snoring, and daytime sleepiness. A sleep log may be useful  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134" href="/z/d/graphic/87134.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>

          table 2
         </a>
         ). We also inquire about medications, caffeine and alcohol intake, or other drug or medication consumption, all of which can affect sleep. Key questions in the evaluation of a sleepy patient  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86812" href="/z/d/graphic/86812.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ) and a detailed approach to a patient with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are provided separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14892.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness"
         </a>
         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97865.html" rel="external">
          "Excessive daytime sleepiness due to medical disorders and medications"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A propensity for daytime napping (eg, falling asleep in a chair late evening) should not be confused with EDS, which is not normal in the healthy older adult. EDS is defined as inability to maintain wakefulness and alertness during the major waking episodes of the day, with sleep occurring unintentionally or at inappropriate times almost daily for at least three months (eg, falling asleep while talking with someone, in church, in the theater, getting dressed, eating a meal, going to the bathroom). Although not validated in older adults, the Epworth sleepiness scale (
         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13440.html" rel="external">
          calculator 1
         </a>
         ) may be helpful in this distinction with a score above 10 suggesting primary sleep pathology rather than normal aging effects on sleep. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14892.html" rel="external">

         We do not typically order sleep testing patients whose complaints are mild and/or consistent with normal aging. We counsel such patients in good sleep habits and monitor for progression of their symptoms.

         If the complaints seem out of proportion to normal aging (ie, are affecting basic activities of daily living or cognitive functioning) or there are other symptoms or signs of a primary sleep disorder, we perform diagnostic testing for coexisting sleep disorders that require treatment. For example, we generally order sleep testing in patients who report getting a reasonable amount of sleep (probably seven hours or more) but have trouble staying awake and need to nap during the day (ie, patients with EDS).
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the number of medical problems that can cause sleepiness and/or sleep disruption, we perform some basic laboratory tests including complete blood count, routine chemistries, and thyroid function tests.

        <p>
         If not revealing, we generally perform a sleep study (in-home or in-laboratory test). Selecting a home or in-laboratory sleep study is discussed separately. (See

         History of stroke or transient ischemic attack – We believe that patients with history of stroke or transient ischemic attack should be evaluated for any signs of sleep disordered breathing, and have a low threshold for sleep testing as the prevalence is very high in this population. In these patients, we prefer in-laboratory attended sleep testing since home testing is not likely to be adequate. Sleep apnea is both a risk factor for stroke (approximately two-fold increased incidence) as well as highly prevalent after stroke [
         <a href="#rid4">

         Early dementia – Similarly, we evaluate patients with early dementia for an underlying sleep disorder and have a low threshold to perform in-laboratory or home sleep apnea testing in those with any symptoms suggestive of a sleep disorder (eg, snoring or daytime sleepiness). The rationale for this approach is based upon the observation that sleep symptoms can be difficult to assess in this population and evidence suggests improvement or delayed decline when sleep apnea is treated.

          THE NORMAL EFFECTS OF AGING ON SLEEP

         Sleep-related changes as a normal consequence of aging are listed in the table  (

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,5-8
         </a>
         ]. The overall effect of these changes is that many older adults tend to go to sleep and get up earlier (advanced phase syndrome), and complain of difficulty maintaining sleep (due to increased nocturnal awakenings), more so than difficulty initiating sleep. For others, the lack of a fixed schedule (eg, from retirement) can affect sleep hygiene and may even lead to problems with a delayed sleep phase disorder (ie, they can become "night owls"). With age, as the time spent asleep at night decreases, there is increased daytime sleepiness, difficulty maintaining wakefulness, and a propensity for daytime napping. The stages and architecture of normal sleep are described separately. (See

         Sleep apnea is a disorder characterized by apneas and hypopneas during sleep. It collectively describes both obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; in which apneas and hypopneas are due to repetitive collapse of the upper airway) and central sleep apnea (CSA; in which apneas and hypopneas occur in the absence of upper airway collapse). OSA is more common than CSA in all age groups. Herein, we use the term, sleep apnea, when describing OSA and CSA collectively or when describing studies that did not distinguish the type of sleep apnea. Otherwise, we refer to OSA or CSA specifically.

         In one study, the prevalence of sleep apnea was 1.7-fold higher in older adults (&gt;60 years) compared with 40- to 60-year-old adults, using an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) cutoff of ≥15 [

         Data describing the natural history of untreated sleep apnea in older adults is weak. Nonetheless, untreated sleep apnea in older adults appears to be associated with an increased risk of stroke, cognitive abnormalities, and heart failure. Unlike younger adults, there is no robust evidence to support an increased risk of death, hypertension, or coronary artery disease. This may be because data in older adults are largely derived from subgroup analyses of studies that included adults of all ages, and the event size may not be large enough to make firm conclusions.

         – Untreated severe sleep apnea has been associated with increased risk for an ischemic stroke in older adults. In a prospective cohort study of 400 adults aged 70 to 100 years who were followed for six years, an ischemic stroke occurred in 5 percent [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

Women with sleep apnea (defined as AHI ≥15 events per hour of sleep) were more likely to develop mild cognitive defects or dementia than women without sleep apnea (45 versus 31 percent, adjusted odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.11-3.08). A subsequent study of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease showed that those with sleep disordered breathing had an earlier age of onset of MCI [

         – It is unclear whether untreated severe sleep apnea (defined as AHI ≥30 events per hour of sleep) may also be associated with the development of heart failure in older patients. In a prospective cohort study of 4422 adults, both men older and younger than 70 years with severe untreated sleep apnea exhibited a trend toward a higher rate of heart failure than men of the same age who did not have sleep apnea (adjusted hazard ratio 1.58, 95% CI 0.93-2.66) [

          Hypertension

         – In older adults, it is unclear if untreated sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of hypertension. In one study, untreated sleep apnea was associated with an increased risk of systemic hypertension in patients &gt;65 years old compared with patients &lt;65 years old (adjusted odds ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.03-2.00) [

In addition, studies that have used the AHI alone to compare older adults with untreated severe sleep apnea to adults without sleep apnea, have found that the strength of the association between sleep apnea and systemic hypertension diminishes with age [

         We manage older adult patients with sleep apnea in a similar fashion to younger adults. This includes the indications for treatment, behavior modification, selection of the sleep apnea-specific therapy (ie, positive airway pressure [PAP], oral appliance, surgery), and follow-up. (See

         Efficacy data on these options in older adults are rare. Generally, older adults are poor candidates for elective surgery, although a review of data from the ADHERE registry reported a reduction in the AHI compared with baseline in patients over age 65 years who were treated with hypoglossal nerve stimulation [

         Sleep-related complaints are common among older adults (ie, adults &gt;65 years old). The clinician needs to be able to determine the likely etiology of sleep impairment in this population so that appropriate testing and prompt treatment can occur. (See

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – When evaluating sleep in the older adult, we determine whether the patient’s symptoms are consistent with normal aging, a primary sleep condition, or other issues of sleep impairment common in older adults (eg, poor sleep hygiene, medications, and comorbid illnesses). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluating sleepiness in older adults'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         In patients whose complaints are mild and/or consistent with normal aging, we do not typically perform diagnostic testing or treatment. Sleep-related changes that are a normal consequence of aging are listed in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57544" href="/z/d/graphic/57544.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). In brief, older adults tend to complain of difficulty maintaining sleep, resulting in increased daytime sleepiness and napping. A propensity for daytime napping (eg, falling asleep in a chair late evening) should not be confused with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS; eg, falling asleep while talking with someone, getting dressed, eating a meal, going to the bathroom). The Epworth sleepiness scale (
         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13440.html" rel="external">
          calculator 1
         </a>
         ) may be helpful in this distinction with a score above 10 suggesting primary sleep pathology rather than normal aging effects on sleep. (See

         In patients whose complaints seem out of proportion to normal aging (ie, consistent with EDS) or patients who have other symptoms or signs of a primary sleep disorder, we typically perform diagnostic testing to look for coexisting sleep disorders that require treatment. This typically involves some basic laboratory tests including a complete blood count, routine chemistries, and thyroid function tests. If not revealing, we typically perform a sleep study (in-home or in-laboratory). (See

         The incidence of sleep apnea rises with age. Untreated sleep apnea in older adults has been associated with increased risk of stroke, mild cognitive defects, and dementia. Evidence to support an impact of untreated sleep apnea on mortality, coronary artery disease, and hypertension is unclear. (See

         The management of sleep apnea in older adults is similar to the management in younger adults, with positive airway pressure (PAP) as the mainstay of treatment. However, therapy is more challenging in older adults for several reasons including recurrent nocturnal awakenings, difficulty with interface or oral appliance fit, a greater need for education to enhance adherence, and comorbidities that prohibit select approaches (eg, poor surgical candidacy). Therapy improves daytime sleepiness but its impact on quality of life measures or other outcomes is unclear. (See
