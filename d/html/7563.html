         Screening for ovarian cancer first starts with a family history to identify high- versus average-risk women. Potential options for subsequent ovarian tumor screening include the serum tumor marker (cancer antigen [CA] 125) and vaginal ultrasonography. However, in average-risk women, there is no evidence to support a benefit from ovarian cancer screening; no screening strategy has been shown to reduce mortality, and all screening strategies are associated with a high rate of false-positive tests and a risk of harm from invasive testing. In individuals at average risk, we recommend against screening for ovarian cancer.

         Ovarian cancer is not a highly prevalent disease. Worldwide, there are 300,000 new cases of ovarian cancer and 185,000 ovarian-cancer related deaths annually, with the highest incidence rates in developed countries [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3

         A genetic predisposition (eg,
         <em>
          BRCA1, BRCA2
         </em>
         , Lynch syndrome, or others) is known to be present in about 10 percent of patients with ovarian cancer. In one study, the risk for ovarian cancer among those with
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         was 39 to 65 percent, with

         To reduce ovarian cancer mortality, a screening program would need to detect ovarian cancer at an early stage, because with current treatment methods, ovarian cancer mortality is closely related to stage at diagnosis. Five-year survival with distant metastases is 25 percent; with regional disease, 75 to 80 percent; and for the minority of women with stage I disease, over 90 percent. The poor overall survival rate is in large part because 75 percent of patients have spread of cancer beyond the ovary at the time of clinical detection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83397.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum", section on 'Prognosis'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Early detection efforts with imaging focused only on the ovaries may miss many tumors [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. A model of unifocal disease beginning in the ovaries and progressing to diffuse disease is plausible. However, it has been proposed that a substantial number of ovarian cancers may be multifocal and extra-ovarian at their earliest recognizable state; carcinomatosis has been seen to develop even after the removal of normal ovaries [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Little is known about the mechanism or timing of progression from localized to disseminated ovarian cancer.

         The potential harms associated with screening for ovarian cancer include risks of false-positive results, psychological stress, and surgical risks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Positive screening tests for ovarian cancer may lead to surgical evaluation (eg, laparoscopy or laparotomy). Surgical procedures are associated with physical and psychological morbidity, including a small risk for serious complications due to the surgical procedure (eg, postoperative infection), risks of anesthesia for the procedure, a postoperative recovery period, and substantial financial costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because ovarian cancer has a low prevalence, the rate of false-positive results will be high unless a screening program has a high specificity. With a high false-positive rate, many patients will be subjected to unnecessary surgery. Screening protocols with favorable specificity have not been found. Most experts feel that a screening program for ovarian cancer should have a positive predictive value (PPV) of at least 10 percent, so that for each screen-detected ovarian cancer, no more than nine women undergo unnecessary procedures for false-positive results [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. A PPV of at least 10 percent requires specificity of at least 99.6 percent, assuming a sensitivity of 80 percent for screening for all women age &gt;50 years; available tests do not meet these criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prostate, Lung, Colon, Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial reported harms due to surgery for false-positive findings [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 5 percent of patients had false-positive results at each round of screening (3285 patients), and one-third of patients with false-positive results (1080 patients) had surgical follow-up. Fifteen percent (166 patients) who had surgery for a false-positive finding experienced at least one serious complication (21 complications per 100 surgical procedures).
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with abnormal results on screening tests may also experience psychological effects (eg, anxiety) related to diagnostic uncertainty.

         Tests evaluated for screening have not detected ovarian cancer at an early enough stage to reduce mortality and have led to unnecessary surgical procedures for false-positive results.

         </span>
         CA 125, an ovarian cancer tumor marker, did not reduce mortality due to ovarian cancer when studied as a possible screening test in the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colon, Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies show CA 125 may predict ovarian cancer, but its usefulness is hampered by its limited specificity and very low positive predictive value (PPV). A prospective study of asymptomatic postmenopausal women found that elevated CA 125 (≥30 Units/mL) was a predictor of subsequent ovarian cancer risk (relative risk [RR] 35.9 at one year and 14.3 at five years) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. However, in the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, 74 percent of the CA 125-detected ovarian cancers were at an advanced stage (stage IIIC or IV) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Annual CA 125 testing alone lacks sufficient specificity for screening in average-risk patients. Specificity is limited because a variety of benign and malignant gynecologic and non-gynecologic conditions elevate CA 125  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81621" href="/z/d/graphic/81621.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67514" href="/z/d/graphic/67514.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ), leading to false-positive results. CA 125 is elevated in approximately 1 percent of healthy women, fluctuates during the menstrual cycle, increases with age, and varies with ethnicity and smoking status [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. Premenopausal women especially have a higher likelihood of benign gynecologic conditions; however, PPV is unacceptably low even in postmenopausal women. In three large screening studies, specificity of a single CA 125 for detection of ovarian neoplasms in postmenopausal women ranged from 98.6 to 99.4 percent, resulting in a low PPV of 3 percent [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-18
         </a>
         ]. In the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, among healthy women ages 55 to 74 years, PPV for invasive cancer was similarly low [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,19,20
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The change in CA 125 levels over time may be more informative, but this approach is not generally used for screening. A large prospective study in 9233 postmenopausal women, with measurements of CA 125 at two or more times, used a modeling method to estimate risk of ovarian cancer [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. The model incorporates age-specific incidence of cancer, absolute CA 125 level, and rate of change over time. Compared with a specific cutoff value of CA 125, the model improved sensitivity for detection of ovarian cancer from 62 to 86 percent when specificity was fixed at 98 percent. An algorithm incorporating change in CA 125 measurements over time was used as part of multimodal screening in the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23

         In the aggregate, studies do not suggest that screening with TVUS reduces ovarian cancer mortality [
         <a href="#rid24">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The sensitivity of TVUS is in part observer-dependent and has ranged from 80 to 100 percent in studies of women with clinically detected ovarian cancer and in several prospective screening studies [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Specificity has ranged from 94 to 99 percent in screening studies, including two studies of TVUS for women with a family history of ovarian cancer [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30
         </a>
         ]. In the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, 72 percent of TVUS-detected ovarian cancers were stage I or II [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In women at high risk of ovarian cancer, ultrasonography for screening has performed poorly in detecting early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer. In the National Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program, 4526 women at high risk for ovarian cancer based on a personal or family history of ovarian or breast cancer, other cancer syndromes, or the presence of a
         <em>
          BRCA
         </em>
         mutation were screened every six months [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. All cancers (two ovarian, four peritoneal, and four fallopian tube) detected by ultrasonography during the screening period were stage III.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another large randomized trial of women aged 50 to 74 years who did not have increased risk of familial ovarian cancer found that screening with TVUS did not reduce mortality. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) included 50,623 women who had annual TVUS [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,25,26
         </a>
         ]. Initial screening detected 45 primary ovarian and tubal cancers in the TVUS group: 13 invasive cancers were stage III or higher, 12 were stage I or II, and 20 were borderline tumors of low malignant potential. For primary ovarian and tubal cancer, sensitivity was 84.9 percent, specificity 98.2 percent, and PPV 5.3 percent. For primary invasive cancer, sensitivity was 75 percent, specificity 98.2 percent, and PPV 2.8 percent [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. After a median of 16.3 years of follow-up (approximately nine years after the final annual screening), ovarian and tubal cancers were diagnosed in 1 percent of both the unscreened and the TVUS arms [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23

         TVUS allows better visualization of the ovaries independent of body habitus as well as shorter examination times than transabdominal ultrasound. Ovarian size and morphologic characteristics (eg, presence of septae or cyst wall irregularity) are assessed when interpreting an ultrasound abnormality. Depending on these characteristics, follow-up imaging or other testing may be indicated. This is described separately. (See

Usual care and management of abnormal screening results were at the discretion of their usual clinician. Participants were followed for a median 12.4 years, and the trial was stopped prior to scheduled completion because the monitoring board determined futility. The mortality rate due to ovarian cancer was similar in screened and usual care groups: 3.1 versus 2.6 per 10,000 person-years (rate ratio 1.18, 95% CI 0.82-1.71). At initial screening, 29 tumors were detected; 20 of those were invasive, with 18 of these at stage III or IV. Compared with usual care, the incidence of ovarian cancer was not different for women screened, and there was no difference in the proportion of patients with advanced disease (stage III or IV), 77 versus 78 percent.

In the United Kingdom Familial Ovarian Cancer Screen Study (UK FOCSS) that included 3563 women with a familial ovarian cancer syndrome who had declined or deferred risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (rrSO), participants were screened annually for a mean of 3.2 years with a combination of TVUS and CA 125 [

The sensitivity for incident ovarian cancer/fallopian tube cancer was 81.0 to 87.5 percent, depending on whether occult cancers detected at the time of rrSO in women who underwent the procedure prior to the end of the study period were classified as false negative or true positive. The PPV of incident screening was 25.5 percent, which exceeds the threshold of 10 percent considered necessary for ovarian cancer screening. Four women underwent surgery for each case of detected cancer. Women who had not been screened in the year before cancer diagnosis were more likely to have stage IIIC or higher cancer than women screened in the preceding year (86 versus 26 percent); detection of lower-stage disease in women who adhered to screening has led to a decision to decrease the screening interval to four months for the next phase of the study.

         Ovarian cancer continues to have a high mortality rate, as most ovarian cancers are late stage at the time of diagnosis. (See

          'Potential benefits'
         </a>
         above.)

         Challenges to developing an effective screening strategy for ovarian cancer include that it is a low prevalence disease in average-risk women, requiring a testing strategy that has very high specificity as well as sensitivity in order to minimize false-positive tests. In addition, many ovarian cancers detected by screening tests are late stage. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Limitations and challenges of screening'
         </a>

         By contrast, ovarian cancer is more highly prevalent among patients with a family history, in particular those with a hereditary cancer syndrome (eg,
         <em>
          BRCA1, BRCA2
         </em>
         , Lynch syndrome, or others). Such patients may benefit from specific risk reduction strategies such as risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (rrBSO). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Family history'
         </a>
         above.)

         A family history is essential to identifying women at high risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome who would benefit from genetic testing. Women with high-risk family history features should be referred for genetic counselling and consideration of genetic testing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Family history'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The subsequent management of women with high-risk family history is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/753.html" rel="external">
          "Genetic testing and management of individuals at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes"

         In average-risk women, we recommend against screening for ovarian cancer (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">
          Grade 1A
         </a>
         ). No screening strategy (cancer antigen [CA] 125, transvaginal ultrasound [TVUS], or multimodal testing) has been shown to reduce mortality, and all screening strategies are associated with a high rate of false-positive tests and a risk of harms from invasive testing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Average-risk patients'
