Forced hyperextension of the first toe may cause a metatarsophalangeal joint sprain.

They most frequently occur on the heels and soles of the feet due to friction from shoes and socks during walking or running. They may also occur on the toes, especially with improper fitting footwear [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. For example, narrow shoes cause blisters on the outside portions of the great and little toes; shoes that are too big may cause blisters on the tips of the toes from the foot sliding within the shoe. Blisters can be prevented by ensuring that shoes fit properly and that socks stay dry. Socks that wick moisture away from the skin (eg, acrylic, polyester, or wool socks worn over polyester socks) also decrease the likelihood of a blister. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6522.html" rel="external">"Heel pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Overview of causes", section on 'Friction blister'</a>.)</p><p>Blisters on the ball of the foot and toes should be managed similar to blisters of the heel and depend upon the size and degree of impairment (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6522.html" rel="external">"Heel pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Overview of causes", section on 'Friction blister'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Small blisters</strong> – Small blisters that are minimally painful can be cleaned and taped as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The foot should be clean and dry at the time of tape application.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Adhesive (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="118593" href="/d/drug information/118593.html" rel="external">benzoin</a> or adhesive spray) applied to the skin enhances tape grip.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The tape should be applied so that wrinkles are avoided.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The tape should be left in place as long as possible.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>When treating blisters the provider should use paper tape or similar material with a smooth outer coating so that adjacent toes do not develop skin break down or blisters [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Large or painful blisters</strong> – Large or painful blisters should undergo fluid drainage while maintaining the roof of the blister as a biologic bandage as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Clean the intact blister with isopropyl alcohol or other suitable antiseptic solution.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>With a sterile needle (eg, 22 gauge), puncture the blister distally and away from the midline.

The caregivers should be advised to watch for signs of infection, including redness, increased pain, swelling, and pus drainage and to seek prompt medical attention if they occur.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H481178939"><span class="h2">Plantar puncture wound</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Plantar puncture wounds involving the sole of the foot are a common injury. Typical objects causing these injuries include nails, pins, other metal objects, wood, stones, and glass. These wounds have a significant risk for infection. When evaluating plantar puncture wounds in children and adolescents the clinician should determine when the injury occurred, whether the patient was barefoot or wearing shoes, and what object caused the wound, if known. The wound should be examined with the patient prone and, for actively bleeding wounds, a tourniquet or blood pressure cuff applied so that the field is bloodless. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7661.html" rel="external">"Infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7661.html" rel="external">"Infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Imaging is warranted when there is a clinical suspicion of a retained foreign body. Plain radiographs can detect many radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, stones, or metallic objects). Wood, plastic, and other radiolucent objects can be located with ultrasound. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are also helpful methods of localizing a retained foreign body when plain radiographs or ultrasound fail. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot be used when metallic objects are present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7661.html" rel="external">"Infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The management of plantar puncture wounds depends upon the presence of infection and is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7661.html" rel="external">"Infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H481178946"><span class="h2">Laceration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lacerations of the sole of the foot warrant assessment, debridement, and treatment according to the general principles of wound management. Typically, nonabsorbable sutures are used for wound closure and are kept in place for approximately 10 days. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">"Minor wound evaluation and preparation for closure"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6319.html" rel="external">"Skin laceration repair with sutures"</a>.)</p><p>Lacerations to the sole of the foot frequently involve cuts caused by sharp objects that the patient steps on while barefoot and foreign bodies are an important consideration. Imaging is warranted when there is a clinical suspicion of a retained foreign body. Plain radiographs can detect many radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, stones, or metallic objects). Wood, plastic, and other radiolucent objects can be located with ultrasound. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are also helpful methods of localizing a retained foreign body when plain radiographs or ultrasound fail. MRI cannot be used when metallic objects are present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7661.html" rel="external">"Infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Relative to wounds on other parts of the body, lacerations on the sole of the foot are more painful to anesthetize by local injection. A posterior tibial nerve block provides an alternative approach that may provide better pain control during the procedure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/100070.html" rel="external">"Lower extremity nerve blocks: Techniques", section on 'Ankle block'</a>.)</p><p>Lower extremity wounds are more prone to infection than lacerations with better perfusion (eg, face or scalp lacerations). Thus, patients should have a wound check within a few days of wound closure and should be given careful instructions regarding proper wound care, including no swimming, no immersion while bathing, and how to monitor for infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6319.html" rel="external">"Skin laceration repair with sutures", section on 'Aftercare'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H310612545"><span class="h2">Subungual hematoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Trauma, to the nail or nail bed (eg, blunt trauma or repetitive injury during long distance running) can result in a subungual hematoma; blood pooled beneath the nail, that can be very painful and require nail trephination. The management of acute subungual hematomas is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6335.html" rel="external">"Subungual hematoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13693061"><span class="h2">First metatarsophalangeal joint sprain ("turf toe")</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A sprain of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint (sometimes called "turf toe") typically occurs following forced hyperextension of the great toe by the ground such as an axial load to the heel of foot when it is up on its toes. Depending upon the severity of injury, there is some degree of swelling, discoloration, and tenderness around the first MTP joint. Passive extension of the great toe may be limited in the acute setting and is most painful, but severe injuries with complete disruption may have increased motion related to the lack of structural integrity. Radiographs may demonstrate a bone avulsion of the proximal phalanx/sesamoid, and if there is more than 3 mm of retraction of the sesamoid on the anteroposterior (AP) view compared with the contralateral foot, a significant plantar plate injury is likely [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Passive gliding of the first MTP joint in a plantar direction along the plane of the joint can be performed to assess the stability of the plantar ligament complex.</p><p>The sprain is graded as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade I – Sprain of the plantar capsular ligament complex that is painful but not disabling</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade II – Partial rupture of the plantar capsular ligament complex</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade III – Sprain with severe swelling and ecchymosis, weakness of great toe flexion, and instability of the first MTP joint</p><p></p><p>The management of first metatarsophalangeal joint sprain is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113052.html" rel="external">"Evaluation, diagnosis, and select management of common causes of forefoot pain in adults", section on 'First metatarsophalangeal joint sprain ("turf toe")'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H98622573"><span class="h2">Lisfranc joint complex injuries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Lisfranc joints separate the distal portion of the cuneiforms and cuboid (midfoot) and the proximal base of the metatarsals (forefoot)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71857" href="/d/graphic/71857.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The Lisfranc ligament complex attaches the lateral aspect of the medial cuneiform to the medial aspect of the proximal second metatarsal. They may be injured when the foot is plantar-flexed and excessive weight or axial force is applied to the joint (eg, player falling onto the heel of an opponent's plantar-flexed foot) or if the forefoot is pinned and the body is pulled backwards (eg, falling backwards off a windsurfing board or horse while the foot remains in the foot strap or stirrup). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13795.html" rel="external">"Tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joint complex injuries"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13795.html" rel="external">"Tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joint complex injuries", section on 'Clinical anatomy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13795.html" rel="external">"Tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joint complex injuries", section on 'Mechanism of injury'</a>.)</p><p>Patients typically present with swelling and pain over the proximal second metatarsal and midfoot. Palpation localizes tenderness to the tarsometatarsal region. Pain is increased with passive pronation or supination of the forefoot with the heel held stationary. While often absent in isolated tarsometatarsal (TMT) sprains, plantar ecchymosis is essentially pathognomonic for Lisfranc injuries. When a Lisfranc injury is suspected, the clinician should carefully assess the dorsalis pedis pulse and for the presence of a compartment syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13795.html" rel="external">"Tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joint complex injuries", section on 'History and examination findings'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with suspected Lisfranc injuries should undergo plain radiographs, including weight-bearing anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views. Non-weightbearing radiographs may not demonstrate the clinically important instability findings. Findings of a Lisfranc injury include the following (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13795.html" rel="external">"Tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joint complex injuries", section on 'Diagnostic imaging'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13795.html" rel="external">"Tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joint complex injuries", section on 'Classification of injury'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avulsion fractures at the insertion of the Lisfranc ligament complex at the lateral base of the second metatarsal (also called the "fleck sign")</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Widening &gt;2 mm between the first and second metatarsal bases (comparison view may be necessary to appreciate)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of alignment between the medial borders of the second metatarsal and the second cuneiform bones</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of dorsal cortical alignment between the first metatarsal and the medial cuneiform bones</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of alignment between the medial borders of the fourth metatarsal and cuboid bones</p><p></p><p>For patients with clinical findings suggesting Lisfranc injuries and normal plain radiographs or who cannot tolerate weightbearing, computed tomography (CT) or MRI of the foot is warranted.</p><p>Lisfranc injuries warrant referral to an orthopedic surgeon with pediatric expertise.

Toe fractures also occur commonly while fractures of midfoot bones are rare. However, midfoot fractures have the greatest potential for causing permanent deformity or disability. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6548.html" rel="external">"Metatarsal and toe fractures in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6555.html" rel="external">"Foot fractures (other than metatarsal or phalangeal) in children"</a>.)</p><p>Children typically present for evaluation because of pain and difficulty walking. Ecchymosis and swelling are usually present and occur within the first few hours after injury. Palpation along the foot or digit frequently reveals point tenderness at the fracture site. However, the dorsum of the foot or toe may be diffusely swollen and tender, making it difficult to pinpoint the fracture location by examination alone. Of note, tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal after an inversion injury is highly suggestive of a fracture and may <strong>not</strong> be accompanied by significant swelling soon after the injury.

Bunions are the most common problem affecting the forefoot. They can occur in children and young adolescents but increase in frequency with age. Clinical diagnosis of bunions is primarily based upon a history of great toe pain and increasing valgus deformity.

In most cases, there is a prominence of the metatarsal head and a varus angle or subluxation of the fifth MTP joint. A widened fourth to fifth intermetatarsal angle suggests either genetic or structural alteration.

Sesamoid injuries occur most commonly in long-distance running and in sports that require rapid acceleration/deceleration and rotating on toes, such as tennis, racquetball, football, soccer, volleyball, and dance. Patients with a sesamoid stress fracture usually complain of poorly localized pain around the first MTP joint for several weeks. Swelling is not generally seen until the injury has progressed.

Passive dorsiflexion of the first MTP joint can elicit pain in sesamoid fractures. If this movement does not produce pain and a fracture is suspected, some suggest holding the MTP in maximal dorsiflexion and deeply palpating the suspected area, while the patient tries to plantar flex the great toe.
