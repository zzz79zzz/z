Typical acute grief reactions are often characterized by emotional and somatic distress and impaired functioning, but should not be diagnosed as a psychiatric disorder. However, bereavement is also a stressor that can precipitate or worsen psychiatric disorders (eg, unipolar major depression). In addition, acute grief may progress to prolonged grief disorder, which is a unique and identifiable syndrome marked by intense, unrelenting, and functionally debilitating symptoms that require specific treatment [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic discusses the clinical features of bereavement and grief. The management of grief is discussed separately, as is prolonged grief disorder, palliative care, and hospice:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101289.html" rel="external">"Bereavement and grief in adults: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91887.html" rel="external">"Prolonged grief disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91837.html" rel="external">"Prolonged grief disorder in adults: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14241.html" rel="external">"Palliative care: The last hours and days of life"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2200.html" rel="external">"Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12189335"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The terms bereavement, grief (acute and integrated), mourning, and prolonged grief disorder describe different aspects related to the death of a loved one [<a href="#rid1">1,4-6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bereavement</strong> – Bereavement is the situation in which someone who is close dies (rather than the reaction to that loss). (See <a class="local">'Bereavement'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Grief</strong> – Grief is the natural response to bereavement, and includes thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and physiologic reactions. Although grief can occur in response to other meaningful, nonbereavement losses (eg, loss of a job, divorce, or migration), this topic focuses upon grief in response to the death of a loved one.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The pattern and intensity of grief varies over time and evolves as bereaved individuals adapt to the loss. The experience of grief is influenced by personal, cultural, and religious rituals that vary widely, and is unique to each person and each loss. Acute grief can be intense and disruptive but is usually integrated. Progress from acute to integrated grief is often erratic and may be hard to discern as it is happening. (See <a class="local">'Typical acute grief'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mourning</strong> – Mourning is the process of adapting to a loss and integrating grief. Adaptation entails accepting the finality and consequences of the loss and a changed relationship with the deceased, restoring the capacity to thrive, and re-envisioning the future with the possibility for happiness and meaning in a world without the deceased. When mourning is successful, the painful and disruptive experience of acute grief is transformed into an experience of integrated grief that is bittersweet, in the background, and permanent. Like grief, mourning is influenced by personal, cultural, and religious beliefs and rituals that vary widely.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prolonged grief disorder </strong>– Prolonged grief disorder is a form of grief that is unusually protracted, intense, and disabling. The disorder is characterized by maladaptive thoughts, dysfunctional behaviors, dysregulated emotions, and/or serious psychosocial problems that impede adaptation to the loss. The syndrome of prolonged grief disorder is a unique and recognizable condition that can be differentiated from other psychiatric disorders. Other names that have historically been used for prolonged grief disorder include chronic grief, complex grief, complicated grief, pathological grief, persistent complex bereavement disorder, traumatic grief, and unresolved grief. Prolonged grief disorder is approved for inclusion in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases-11<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-11) and the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].

In addition to the loss itself, bereavement often requires one to redefine goals and plans to restore a meaningful and satisfying life, and may involve new responsibilities and roles. In addition, the stress of bereavement can precipitate or worsen general medical or psychiatric disorders.</p><p>Each person who dies leaves behind approximately nine close relatives and a variable number of other relatives and friends [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. People typically have a range of close relationships throughout their lives that can be portrayed with a diagram of concentric circles as “close,” “closer,” and “closest” [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Although there is no standard definition of bereavement that identifies who should be considered bereaved, those with close relationships to the deceased are most affected by a person’s death and are most vulnerable to problems with adapting to the loss. However, people may grieve the loss of anyone who is important in their lives and sometimes this can be a person (eg, mentor) to whom they have an important relationship, but not necessarily a close, personal one.</p><p>The great majority of deaths occur as a natural consequence of aging-related illness. Most people grieve with support from family and friends, naturally moving over time from acute to integrated grief. This progression occurs even when a death occurs in an untimely way by violent means. However, difficult circumstances or consequences of a death can slow or halt this process. As an example, the death of a life partner or a child, or death by violent means, increase the likelihood of prolonged grief disorder. (See <a class="local">'Type of loss'</a> below.)</p><p>Close attachments appear to be internalized in neural networks that underpin both the capacity to form and maintain relationships across the lifespan [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], and responses to their loss [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Preliminary studies suggest that the effects of bereavement may be mediated by changes in these networks [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8572782"><span class="h2">Frequency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 60 percent of the population is bereaved at any given time. As an example, a nationally representative survey in Germany found that 57 percent had lost an important person [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The average time since the death was 10 years (range 0 to 71 years).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11725959"><span class="h3">Death rates</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In 2017, worldwide deaths amounted to nearly 56 million [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].

The 10 leading causes of death were heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, kidney disease, influenza and pneumonia, and suicide. Nearly 75 percent of deaths occur in people aged 65 years or older [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. In 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic added more than 375,000 deaths, raising the overall death rate to more than 3.3 million [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11407409"><span class="h2">Loss of attachment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>According to attachment theory, humans are biologically motivated throughout life to form secure, close relationships with a few other people [<a href="#rid23">23-28</a>]. These are the people whom a person loves and who reciprocate love. A secure attachment relationship means a partner is available, sensitive, and responsive in providing a “safe haven” during periods of stress and a secure base from which one can explore the world, learn new things, and take chances. Loved ones contribute to one’s sense of identity and sense of belonging. Representations of attachment relationships are held in a person’s memory. These mental representations influence many aspects of daily functioning, both consciously and unconsciously. While attachment security may be impaired for some adults (ie, attachment insecurity), close secure adult relationships are usually reciprocal so that each person provides and receives this support.</p><p>Bereavement disrupts attachment. Generally, bereavement entails intense feelings of wanting to find the person who died (yearning and longing for the deceased), accompanied by preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the person, and frustration and sorrow associated with failure to achieve reunion [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In addition, one’s sense of identity is disrupted and exploration is inhibited, leading to reduced interest in ongoing life and an unfamiliar sense of incompetence and confusion about long-term goals.</p><p>Internalized representations of attachment relationships tend to be stable and change slowly with some resistance [<a href="#rid12">12,29-32</a>]. The internalized representation of a deceased person requires major revisions through a learning process in which a bereaved individual gradually assimilates information about the finality of the loss and its meaning. This process takes time. Acute grief occurs during the learning period when the internal representations of the deceased are out of alignment with the reality of the loss and disruption of goals and plans. The process involves grief symptoms such as emotional pain, often accompanied by a sense of internal disorganization. There may also be difficulty with habitual tasks; disrupted attention, concentration, sleep, and appetite; increased memories of the deceased; and emotional and physiologic dysregulation. As the finality and consequences of the loss are fully acknowledged, the mental representation of the attachment relationship is eventually revised, and one’s goals and plans are redefined. There is still an internalized connection to the deceased, but the nature of the connection has changed [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>Caregiving is part of adult love relationships and it too is affected by bereavement [<a href="#rid33">33-39</a>]. Just as individuals are biologically motivated to seek comfort under stress, they are also motivated to care for others. Among parents, the instinctive predisposition to care for children is especially prominent. However, adults also provide as well as receive care in their close relationships with other adults, and caregiving appears to be at least as important as receiving care [<a href="#rid36">36,39</a>]. Thus, the death of a loved one may be experienced as a failure of caregiving, albeit irrational. Mourners may rebuke themselves for minor deficiencies in how they cared for their loved one, for being unable to prevent the death, and/or failing to make the death easier. Caregiver self-blame is a common response to bereavement, contributes to dysphoria during acute grief, and if persistent can impede adaptation to the loss and increase the risk of prolonged grief disorder.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11407423"><span class="h2">Type of loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bereavement reactions may vary depending upon the circumstances of the death. As an example, there are some typical responses depending upon the type of lost relationship (eg, spouses; children; grandchildren; parents who die during one’s childhood, adolescence, or adulthood; and friends) [<a href="#rid40">40,41</a>]. In a community sample of bereaved individuals (n = 120), the intensity of acute grief was greater in parents who lost a child than it was for bereaved spouses, who in turn were more likely to have more intense grief than adult children who lost a parent or caregiver [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Other circumstances that can influence acute grief include the age of the deceased and whether the death involved a sudden loss or a chronic or terminal illness. However, there is no normative intensity of acute grief for a specific type of loss, and any important loss can result in prolonged grief disorder.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4694849"><span class="h3">Type of lost relationship</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Loss of a child typically triggers an especially strong sense of caregiver failure. Parents often blame themselves for not protecting the child, however irrational this may be [<a href="#rid43">43-45</a>]. In addition, parents or caregivers may feel that they have lost their own future and identity as a parent, and may experience high levels of survivor guilt that leads them to feel that they should not enjoy their own lives. In one study of administrative health care data, parents bereaved by a motor vehicle accident had an elevated rate of psychiatric illness in the two years after their child’s death compared with the two years before, and compared with parents who were not bereaved [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. A national registry study (n &gt;1,000,000 parents, including 17,000 parents who lost a child) found that the risk of a first lifetime psychiatric hospitalization was 67 percent greater in bereaved parents, compared with parents who did not lose a child [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. The risk of hospitalization for any psychiatric disorder was highest in the first year after the death of a child, but remained elevated for at least five years after the death.</p><p>Cultural factors may impact the persistence of grief following the loss of a child. A prospective study conducted in China (n = 29 bereaved parents) and the United States (n = 23) found that four months after the death of a child, distress in the parents was comparable for the two groups [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. However, 18 months after the loss, distress in the Chinese parents had decreased significantly, whereas the United States parents showed no decrease in distress.</p><p>The death of a spouse or partner who is part of everyday life can also be particularly challenging, especially when the relationship was positive and rewarding [<a href="#rid49">49-52</a>]. Spouses often play multiple important roles, including lover, best friend, confidant, protector, housekeeper, and breadwinner. Similar to what bereaved parents can experience, bereaved spouses may feel guilty about letting their partner down or a sense of failure as a caregiver. They may experience survivor guilt and feel anxious or angry about losing the support and comfort of their loved one. Bereaved spouses may also feel lost without the daily support and comfort of their closest companion, or intensely lonely in a world without them. In addition, the bereaved spouse often must adapt to changes in day-to-day life, such as assuming responsibility for practical issues, such as paying bills.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1035412"><span class="h3">Sudden loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The death of a loved one can be intense and painful, regardless of the manner of death. However, loss from a sudden catastrophic illness, suicide, violence, or accident is likely to produce relatively intense acute grief. The acutely bereaved may feel as though they are on autopilot, going through the motions of life while feeling disconnected from the world and from others. There may be a disconcerting feeling of numbness and difficulty comprehending the unexpected loss. Numbness usually recedes as the bereaved person begins to think about the loss and its implications, but it can be distressing as the person may question not crying or experiencing intense sadness. Although most people bereaved by a sudden loss are resilient, the rates of prolonged grief disorder and other psychiatric disorders, including depressive syndromes, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorders, are higher following violent or other sudden deaths, such as suicides [<a href="#rid53">53,54</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Suicide'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91887.html" rel="external">"Prolonged grief disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Homicide and suicide, in particular, can trigger guilt or anger about the death that can impede adaptation to the loss. The risk of psychopathology in those bereaved by homicide and suicide seems to remain elevated over many (eg, 8 to 10) years [<a href="#rid53">53,55</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2272349289"><span class="h4">Suicide</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of bereavement due to suicide varies across studies of different populations. Within families, the estimated one-year prevalence of bereavement due to suicide is 1 percent, based upon a meta-analysis of two general population studies (total n &gt;11,000 individuals) [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. Among friends and peers, the one-year prevalence of exposure to suicide is approximately 6 percent. A nationally representative survey in the United States found that the lifetime prevalence of suicide bereavement was 35 percent [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. It is estimated that worldwide, nearly 50 million people are bereaved by suicide [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].</p><p>Prior to bereavement due to suicide, relatives of individuals who die by suicide differ from individuals not exposed to suicide bereavement. As an example:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study compared parents who were bereaved due to the suicide of a child (n &gt;1400) with parents bereaved due to the death of a child who died in a motor vehicle crash (n &gt;1100) [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].

Acute grief that occurs in response to the loss may be more attenuated in severity or duration. However, chronicity sometimes has the opposite effect; because the illness is long-lasting and the patient is still alive, family members may fail to anticipate a death. Further, caregiver roles may have become prominent and add an additional level of role adaptation after the death. In any case, bereavement often evokes an intense response even among those whose loved one’s deaths are predictable, and psychiatric morbidity may ensue. In a prospective study of family caregivers (n = 217) for patients with dementia who died, depression occurred in 30 percent of the caregivers one year postdeath [<a href="#rid62">62</a>], and prolonged grief disorder occurred in 20 percent over 18 months of follow-up [<a href="#rid63">63</a>].

The caregiver’s ability to cope with the illness and death of a loved one, as well as the experience of the dying patient, are improved by mitigation of patient suffering; good communication between the medical staff and caregivers, and between caregivers and dying patients; and preparation for the death (see <a class="local">'Anticipatory grief'</a> below). Although most caregivers are resilient following the death of a loved one from a terminal illness, a prospective study of caregivers (n = 668) for terminal cancer patients found that prolonged grief disorder occurred in 25 percent [<a href="#rid68">68</a>].

In addition, the loss of a loved one may lead to disability [<a href="#rid40">40,78</a>]. These outcomes may stem from bereavement-related unhealthy behaviors, including worsened nutrition, increased alcohol consumption and smoking, poor sleep quality, and involuntary weight loss [<a href="#rid40">40,52,77,79</a>].

After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, smoking and history of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease), the incidence of myocardial infarction or stroke within 30 days of bereavement was greater in the bereaved than the nonbereaved (0.2 versus 0.1 percent). In addition, a retrospective study of patients with myocardial infarction (n = 1985) found that within one day of the death of a significant person, the risk of myocardial infarction was 21 times greater than the risk 31 to 180 days after the death [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. The risk was still elevated 7 to 30 days after the loss (incidence rate ratio 4). The increased risk of cardiovascular events in the weeks following loss may be related in part to the association of early bereavement with neglecting one’s health care [<a href="#rid80">80</a>], as well as adverse physiologic responses, such as increased heart rate, systolic blood pressure [<a href="#rid82">82,83</a>], cortisol [<a href="#rid84">84-86</a>], and pro-inflammatory cytokines [<a href="#rid87">87</a>].

The course of acute grief varies from person to person and in the same person after different losses and over time, depending upon the individual and the relationship to the deceased, available resources and supports, the circumstances and consequences of the death, and social and cultural expectations [<a href="#rid1">1,115</a>].</p><p>Some individuals cope better with losses than others [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].

In some people there is relatively little distress or disruption in functioning [<a href="#rid152">152</a>]. These may include people who have lost someone to whom they were not so close or someone whose death they had anticipated (see <a class="local">'Anticipatory grief'</a> below). Many people ultimately find that bereavement leads to psychological growth [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>Acute grief usually evolves over time [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. For most people, considerable progress in adapting to the loss occurs within six months and re-engagement in ongoing life is well underway within 6 to 12 months [<a href="#rid156">156</a>]; in some cases, adjustment occurs more quickly (eg, within weeks of the loss) [<a href="#rid162">162</a>] and in some cases adapting to a loss takes longer. As a person adapts to the loss, grief becomes more subdued; thoughts and memories of the deceased are no longer insistent and recede to the background, and overall emotionality diminishes. Grief becomes integrated as the finality and consequences of the death are understood and adaptations occur. One way of thinking about adaptation to loss is that the sense of connection to the deceased gradually moves from preoccupying the mind to residing comfortably in the heart.</p><p>However, the response to the loss of a loved one does not end. Reminders of the deceased might still evoke intense emotional reactions many years after the death. The deceased person is not forgotten and is still missed, and the intensity of grief may flare during anniversaries of the death, holidays, or periods of heightened stress without being pathological.</p><p>In some instances, the intensity and frequency of grief does not abate because certain thoughts and behavior derail and impede the process of adapting to the loss. Examples of this include second-guessing oneself or someone else in relation to the death, thinking “if only” something different had happened, the loved one would have lived longer and may still be alive. In addition, excessive avoidance can also stall or halt adaptation.</p><p>Inability to adapt to the loss can lead to the distressing and disabling syndrome of prolonged grief disorder.

Anticipatory grief also includes thoughts and plans for a future without the terminally ill loved one.

By contrast, patients with major depression often feel hopeless and cannot imagine being happy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For bereaved spouses or partners, changes in prior routines surrounding sleep may also contribute to a period of sleep disturbance. Sleep in bereaved individuals may be interrupted by worries about functioning without the deceased person and managing specific tasks previously performed by the deceased. These grief-related sleep difficulties differ from insomnia due to major depression, in which interruption of sleep is more likely characterized by early morning wakening or excessive sleep.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anhedonia in the bereaved typically manifests as lack of interest in things unrelated to the deceased; mourners may explain that their loved one is not there to help or to share in activities, or that they want to avoid reminders of the loss. The strong interest in the deceased differentiates this condition from the general and pervasive anhedonia in major depression.</p><p></p><p>Grieving individuals may become depressed, and increases in the severity of grief are associated with an increased risk of developing depressive syndromes [<a href="#rid170">170</a>]. The severity of grief also correlates with the severity of depressive symptoms.</p><p>Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of depression is discussed separately.

In addition, acute grief and PTSD may include frequent insistent images of someone who is deceased, or emotional or physiologic activation triggered by reminders of the deceased. However, sadness and yearning are the usual response in acute grief, rather than fear, which often occurs in PTSD. During acute grief, there may be dreams about the person who died, which are associated with deep sadness upon awakening; these dreams are distinct from the nightmares that can occur in PTSD. Reminders of the loss are avoided in acute grief, but this represents an attempt to avoid upsurges in grief symptoms rather than an overgeneralized fear of recurrent danger.

The specific pattern of grief symptoms as well as the process of adaptation is unique to each specific loss situation, influenced by individual factors as well as social, religious, and cultural norms. Nevertheless, the symptoms of typical acute grief are usually related to either separation from the deceased (eg, yearning for and seeking proximity to the deceased, loneliness, and crying) or to stress and trauma (disbelief, shock, and numbness).

However, acute grief is time-limited and integrated such that painful emotions and insistent thoughts diminish in frequency, intensity, and duration. Adaptation to the loss is usually well underway within 6 to 12 months. Grief becomes more subdued but generally does not resolve completely; the deceased person is not forgotten and is still missed, and the intensity of grief may flare during anniversaries of the death, holidays, or periods of heightened stress. (See <a class="local">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute grief is not a mental disorder and should not be diagnosed or treated as such.
