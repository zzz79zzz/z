         Hypocalcemia may be associated with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from few (if any) symptoms if the hypocalcemia is mild and/or chronic to severe life-threatening symptoms if it is severe and/or acute. Thus, the management of hypocalcemia depends upon the severity of symptoms. In patients with acute symptomatic hypocalcemia, intravenous (IV)

         is the preferred therapy, whereas chronic hypocalcemia is treated with oral calcium and vitamin D supplements.

         The treatment of hypocalcemia will be reviewed here. The etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic approach to hypocalcemia are reviewed separately. (See

          INTERPRETATION OF SERUM CALCIUM

         Calcium in serum is mainly bound to proteins, principally albumin. As a result, total serum calcium concentrations in patients with low or high serum albumin levels may not accurately reflect the physiologically important ionized (or free) calcium concentration. As a result, ionized calcium remains the gold standard for assessing calcium status, particularly if the diagnosis of hypocalcemia is in doubt, due to hypoalbuminemia, atypical or absent symptoms, or a minimally reduced serum calcium concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, ionized calcium is not performed routinely, because it is more costly and must be handled carefully and stored under appropriate conditions to preserve a sample pH of 7.4. If a laboratory known to measure ionized calcium reliably is not available, the total calcium should be corrected for any abnormalities in serum albumin, using a calcium correction formula. There are a number of formulas that have been used to correct the total calcium for serum albumin concentrations, but none appears to be universally acceptable when examined for their correlation with ionized calcium. Furthermore, different chemistry laboratories may use different correction formulas.
        </p>
        <p>
         Traditionally, one of the most widely utilized equations to estimate the total calcium concentration in clinical practice assumes the serum calcium to fall by 0.8 mg/dL (0.2 mmol/L) for every 1 g/dL (10 g/L) fall in the serum albumin concentration [(
         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13477.html" rel="external">
          calculator 1
         </a>
         ) or for standard units (
         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13475.html" rel="external">
          calculator 2
         </a>
         )]. If the measured serum total calcium concentration is 8 mg/dL (2 mmol/L), and the serum albumin concentration is 2 g/dL (20 g/L) below normal, the corrected value will be 9.6 mg/dL (2.4 mmol/L), which is normal. Despite widespread use of this formula in clinical practice over the last several decades, more contemporary studies suggest the accuracy of this estimate is quite poor in a variety of populations, including patients hospitalized with critical illness and patients with advanced-stage chronic kidney disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/845.html" rel="external">
          "Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations", section on 'Hypoalbuminemia'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with asymptomatic hypocalcemia, it is important to verify with repeat measurement of ionized calcium or total serum calcium corrected for albumin that there is a true decrease in the calcium concentration.

         There are few studies examining the optimal treatment of hypocalcemia. Most recommendations are based upon accepted practice or clinical experience [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. The treatment of hypocalcemia varies with its severity and the underlying cause. The severity of symptoms (paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, seizures) and signs (Chvostek's or Trousseau's signs, bradycardia, impaired cardiac contractility, and prolongation of the QT interval) depends upon the absolute level of calcium, as well as the rate of decrease. Patients with acute hypocalcemia will be symptomatic at serum calcium values that would not cause symptoms in patients with chronic hypocalcemia (eg, hypoparathyroidism). Clinical manifestations also vary with other factors such as the arterial pH and the cause of hypocalcemia. (See

         In asymptomatic patients with an acute decrease in serum corrected calcium to ≤7.5 mg/dL (≤1.9 mmol/L), who may develop serious complications if untreated. In an ionized calcium assay with a normal range of 4.8 to 5.6 mg/dL (1.2 to 1.4 mmol/L), the threshold is approximately ≤3 mg/dL (≤0.8 mmol/L). Acute hypocalcemia can occur when there is a rapid and progressive reduction in serum calcium (eg, acute hypoparathyroidism following radical neck dissection for head and neck cancer).

         should be monitored closely, preferably with telemetry, for acute digitalis toxicity, which can develop with IV calcium infusion.

         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The bolus dose of calcium gluconate will raise the serum calcium concentration for only two or three hours; as a result, it should be followed by a slow infusion of calcium in patients with persistent hypocalcemia.

The dose can be adjusted to maintain the serum calcium concentration at the lower end of the normal range (with the serum calcium corrected for any abnormalities in serum albumin as noted above). Patients typically require 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg of elemental calcium per hour.

         Hypomagnesemia is a common cause of hypocalcemia, both by inducing resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and by diminishing its secretion. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/848.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia is difficult to correct without first normalizing the serum magnesium concentration. Thus, if the serum magnesium concentration is low, 2 g (16 mEq) of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9585" href="/z/d/drug information/9585.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         should be infused as a 10% solution over 10 to 20 minutes, followed by 1 gram (8 mEq) in 100 mL of fluid per hour. Magnesium repletion should be continued as long as the serum magnesium concentration is less than 0.8 mEq/L (1 mg/dL or 0.4 mmol/L). More careful monitoring is required in patients who have impaired renal function and who are therefore at greater risk of developing hypermagnesemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Persistent hypomagnesemia, as occurs in some patients with ongoing gastrointestinal (eg, malabsorption) or renal losses, requires supplementation with oral magnesium, typically 300 to 400 mg daily divided into three doses. (See

         For such patients with milder degrees of acute hypocalcemia and milder symptoms of neuromuscular irritability, who do not have symptomatic improvement with oral calcium supplementation, we switch to IV calcium. IV calcium is also indicated to prevent acute hypocalcemia in patients with milder degrees of hypocalcemia or chronic hypocalcemia (due to hypoparathyroidism) who become unable to take or absorb oral supplements, as may occur after complex surgical procedures requiring prolonged recuperation.

         Hypoparathyroidism occurs when there is abnormal parathyroid gland development, destruction of the parathyroid glands (autoimmune, surgical), altered regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) production, or impaired PTH action. (See

         When hypoparathyroidism is the cause of hypocalcemia, administration of calcium alone is usually only transiently effective. Long-term management requires the addition of vitamin D. Most patients with hypoparathyroidism require lifelong calcium and vitamin D supplementation  (

         ). An exception is the occurrence of transient hypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy. (See

        <p>
         The goals of therapy in patients with hypoparathyroidism are to relieve symptoms and to raise and maintain the serum calcium concentration in the low-normal range, eg, 8.0 to 8.5 mg/dL (2.0 to 2.1 mmol/L). Attainment of higher values is not necessary and is usually limited by the development of hypercalciuria due to the loss of renal calcium-retaining effects of PTH. The management of hypoparathyroidism is reviewed in detail separately. (See

Vitamin D is available in several doses for oral administration. We typically treat nutritional vitamin D deficiency with 50,000 international units of vitamin D2 or D3 weekly for six to eight weeks. In some countries (not in the United States), vitamin D is also available for parenteral administration. Vitamin D metabolites (

The major advantage of vitamin D over vitamin D metabolites is its low cost, which is approximately 20 percent that of the vitamin D metabolites. Disadvantages include the necessity for hepatic and renal metabolism and slow onset and long duration of action. (See

         Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) is a rare disorder caused by an activating mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor (
         <em>
          CaSR
         </em>
         ) gene (ADH type 1) or by a gain-of-function mutation of G-alpha-11, a key mediator of CASR signaling (ADH type 2). ADH may rarely be accompanied by Bartter syndrome (also called Bartter syndrome type V). Increased activity of CaSR in the renal tubules results in normal or high urinary calcium excretion despite hypocalcemia; raising the patient's serum calcium concentrations with calcium and vitamin D can result in more hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal insufficiency. Fortunately, most patients with this disorder have few, if any, symptoms of hypocalcemia and usually require little or no therapy. Recombinant human PTH, which enhances calcium absorption in the tubules, may be an alternative if therapy is needed. It can raise the serum calcium concentration in this disorder with a low risk of exacerbating hypercalciuria. Alternatively, calcilytics, a class of drugs in development that inhibit the CaSR, may provide a useful therapeutic approach in the future. (See

         Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders defined by target organ (kidney and, perhaps, bone) unresponsiveness to PTH [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. It is characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and, in contrast to hypoparathyroidism, elevated rather than reduced PTH concentrations. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this disorder are reviewed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5846.html" rel="external">
          "Etiology of hypocalcemia in infants and children", section on 'End-organ resistance to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism)'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The long-term treatment of hypocalcemia in adults with PHP is similar to the treatment of hypocalcemia caused by other forms of hypoparathyroidism. However, patients with PHP infrequently develop hypercalciuria with calcium and vitamin D therapy [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, the goal of treatment with calcium and vitamin D is to maintain normocalcemia (rather than low-normal serum calcium as for other forms of hypoparathyroidism). A typical starting dose of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9183" href="/z/d/drug information/9183.html" rel="external">
          calcitriol
         </a>
         is 0.25 mcg twice daily. The dose should be increased weekly to achieve a normal serum calcium. Many patients require up to 2 mcg daily [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 1 to 2 g of elemental calcium daily (in divided doses) is recommended.

         Patients with PHP may also require screening for other endocrinopathies, particularly hypothyroidism and hypogonadism.

         IV calcium is also indicated to prevent acute hypocalcemia in patients with milder degrees of hypocalcemia or chronic hypocalcemia (due to hypoparathyroidism) who become unable to take or absorb oral supplements, as may occur after complex surgical procedures requiring prolonged recuperation.
