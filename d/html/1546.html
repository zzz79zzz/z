As a diagnostic category, ASCVD includes four major areas:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coronary heart disease (CHD) manifested by fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, and/or heart failure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cerebrovascular disease manifested by fatal or nonfatal stroke and transient ischemic attack</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Peripheral artery disease manifested by intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aortic atherosclerosis and thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm</p><p></p><p>While a general estimate of the relative risk for ASCVD can be approximated by counting the number of traditional risk factors (ie, hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, premature family history of ASCVD, chronic kidney disease, obesity) present in a patient, a more precise estimation of the absolute risk for a first ASCVD event is desirable when making treatment recommendations for a specific individual. This topic will review which patients should undergo ASCVD risk assessment, the approach to assessing risk, and the implications of the estimate risk on preventive therapies. The various ASCVD risk models are presented separately, as are discussions of the specific approach to the primary prevention treatment of various risk factors:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114029.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7573.html" rel="external">"Overview of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4549.html" rel="external">"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease", section on 'Indications for statin therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16291.html" rel="external">"Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2896379774"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH TO ASCVD RISK ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to ASCVD risk assessment in adults is generally consistent with the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) primary prevention guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] and is as follows  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114544" href="/d/graphic/114544.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1263809467"><span class="h2">Who needs ASCVD risk discussions and potentially formal ASCVD risk assessment</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We proceed with ASCVD risk discussions for all patients between 20 and 75 years of age without known ASCVD.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Periodic risk assessment offers the opportunity to identify ASCVD risk factors and offer guidance on the appropriate management of specific risk factors (eg, dietary modifications for hypertension or dyslipidemia, etc) and overall ASCVD risk (eg, maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, etc) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

The optimal time interval for reassessing risk in patients with intermediate 10-year ASCVD risk is uncertain. However, once a person reaches a threshold for lifestyle or pharmacologic intervention, the emphasis going forward should be placed on optimization of risk factors for that individual.

Formal estimates of ASCVD risk with this approach have generally been based on the experience of asymptomatic middle-aged adults 40 years of age or older. While all of the risk models have advantages and disadvantages, no single risk model will be appropriate for all patients, and we encourage clinicians to use an ASCVD risk calculator that is appropriate for patient-specific race and ethnic groups and geographic region. (See <a class="local">'Estimate ASCVD risk using a risk calculator'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114029.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with low or very low 10-year ASCVD risk, particularly for patients from 20 to 59 years of age, we also calculate 30-year (or lifetime) ASCVD risk.

This primarily relates to the fact that 10-year risk is generally extremely low in these patients, and the validated risk calculators do not provide risk estimates for patients under 40 years of age. For some persons 20 to 39 years of age, it is often helpful to make informal estimates of the individual’s ASCVD risk to help guide preventive measures.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3852820597"><span class="h2">Why assess ASCVD risk?</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with low or very low 10-year ASCVD risk can be reassured and encouraged to maintain healthy lifestyles (eg, regular exercise, healthy diet, etc).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with high 10-year ASCVD risk (≥20 percent) can be started on appropriate primary preventive therapies.

A number of multivariate risk models have been developed for estimating the risk of initial ASCVD events in apparently healthy, asymptomatic individuals based upon assessment of multiple variables. The choice of a specific risk model for ASCVD risk assessment should be individualized based on patient-specific characteristics (eg, age, sex, ethnicity). Most experts feel that the use of risk models that predict hard ASCVD events (ie, death, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke) are preferred over those that include other endpoints (ie, revascularization).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3138063404"><span class="h3">Choosing a risk calculator</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are several ASCVD risk calculators in widespread use, and the field is dynamic, with new algorithms being developed on a regular basis which are adopted by regional organizations and societies that focus on ASCVD prevention. Issues involved in selecting a particular risk calculator for an individual patient include the applicability of the data to the particular population or ethnic group being modeled, risk factors that have been assessed, and outcomes being predicted. While all of the risk models have advantages and disadvantages, no single risk model will be appropriate for all patients [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. We encourage clinicians to become familiar with and use an ASCVD risk calculator that has been locally endorsed and that has been validated for their locale and for patient-specific race and ethnic groups.

Unlike prior United States calculators, it predicts important cardiovascular events that are reduced by statin therapy. The Pooled Cohort Equations were updated in 2018 in conjunction with society guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A potential limitation of the ACC/AHA calculator is that family history of premature ASCVD is not included in the model. This may underestimate risk in patients with very strong family histories of cardiovascular events. Additionally, the ACC/AHA calculator includes DM only as a yes/no question. Issues that may affect risk with DM include patient age, sex, duration of DM, and whether the patient has type 1 or type 2 DM.

Informal calculation of lifetime risk of ASCVD for persons &lt;40 years of age may be used to help guide therapy. The 10-year risk of ASCVD is typically low, especially in younger patients, while the 30-year or lifetime risk can be moderately high.

The optimal time interval for reassessing risk in patients with intermediate 10-year ASCVD risk is uncertain.
