         <em>
          Hemiscorpius lepturus
         </em>
         , the stings of which cause skin and tissue necrosis, hemolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute kidney injury, and noninfectious hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).
         <em>

         Scorpions, which are grouped in the phylum Arthropoda, have a lobster-like body shape with seven sets of paired appendages: the chelicerae, the pedipalps (claws), four sets of legs, and the pectines (a pair of comb-like structures on the ventral surface)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78165" href="/z/d/graphic/78165.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The segmented tail curves upward dorsally, ending in a terminal bulbous segment called the telson, which contains paired venom glands and the stinger. Scorpions fluoresce when illuminated by ultraviolet light, as from a black light or a medical Wood's lamp  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54120" href="/z/d/graphic/54120.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). This physical property is used to collect scorpions and for pest control. Additional entomology of scorpions is discussed separately. (See

         <em>
          H. lepturus
         </em>
         is a translucent to yellow, thin-tailed scorpion that is 5 to 8 cm in length  (

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. It has a bead-shaped and jointed tail and displays sexual dimorphism with the adult male scorpion being larger and having a longer tail [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Unlike venom from other scorpion species,
         <em>
          H. lepturus
         </em>
         venom contains lytic enzymes (including lysophospholipase D, which lyses ester bonds in cell membranes); its venom toxins are morphologically similar to brown recluse spider toxins, and the toxic manifestations of
         <em>
          H. lepturus
         </em>
         envenomation in humans bears resemblance to loxoscelism [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. In animal models, these toxins cause severe tissue and organ necrosis and can induce intravascular hemolysis with disseminated intravascular coagulation [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,7-10
         </a>
         ]. Animal models indicate that acute kidney injury is also related to PGC-1 alpha overexpression in response to glutathione depletion [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. This finding suggests a potential role for PGC-1 alpha as a therapeutic target or glutathione for
         <em>
          H. lepturus
         </em>
         -induced acute kidney injury prevention and restoring of mitochondrial mass.

         Cardiotoxicity of the crude venom from
         <em>
          H. lepturus
         </em>
         scorpion and its isolated fractions, F-I to F-VI, has been described in rats. Elevations of troponin and decreased ejection fraction were noted [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. However, cardiotoxicity is generally not seen in humans with
         <em>
          H. lepturus
         </em>
         envenomation.

        <p>
         <em>
          H. lepturus

         venom also has the ability to cause autonomic dysfunction with cardiotoxicity similar to other medically important species in the region such as
         <em>
          Androctonus

         ,
         <em>

         has been found in hot and humid regions of the Middle East including south and southwest Iran, eastern Iraq, Yemen, West Pakistan, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. About 50,000 cases of scorpion stings are recorded in Iran annually with a majority in the southwest [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Clinical and laboratory symptoms of envenomation following
         <em>
          Hemiscorpius
         </em>
         stings are clearly different from those reported for other medically important scorpion species.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Iran, it accounts for over 10,000 scorpion stings annually or approximately 20 to 25 percent of all reported scorpion stings in the region [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Stings are most common at night while the victim is sleeping and are most prevalent during the spring and summer months [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,8
         </a>
         ]. Children younger than five years of age and adolescents are most commonly affected [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,8,13,14
         </a>
         ]. In Iran,
         <em>
          H. lepturus
         </em>
         is responsible for a majority of the approximately 20 deaths per year caused by scorpion stings [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Mortality among pediatric patients requiring acute care approaches 8 percent in some series [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Thus,
         <em>
          H. lepturus
         </em>
         is regarded as more dangerous than other medically important scorpions in this region, including

         Stings most commonly involve the lower extremities. Patients come to medical attention because of cutaneous findings or, in those with hemolysis or kidney injury, signs of hemoglobinuria or hematuria [
         <a href="#rid2">

        <p>
         In marked contrast to scorpions capable of causing autonomic storm and cardiotoxicity,
         <em>
          H. lepturus
         </em>
         causes a relatively painless sting that may go unnoticed and may not produce a skin mark because of its small stinger size (about 1 mm long). The initial symptoms typically consist of minor itching at the sting site and mild pain. The sting frequently occurs at night while the patient is sleeping and is often not noticed until the morning [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,7,8,13
         </a>
         ]. Local skin manifestations are frequently negligible within the first 24 hours. Thus, medical care is not sought until systemic toxicity has been established.

         Within the first few hours after the sting, skin findings typically consist of a sting site with a central puncta and an erythematous or purpuric macule or papule, which is mildly painful and pruritic [

Infections occur both sporadically and as institutional epidemics in nursing homes, prisons, military barracks, and athletic facilities. Risk factors and epidemiology of CA-MRSA are discussed separately. Isolation of the infectious organism from pus helps to differentiate these infections from

         <strong>
          Pyoderma gangrenosum
         </strong>
         – Pyoderma gangrenosum is an idiopathic disorder in which dark, blue-red papules progress to necrotic ulcerating lesions. Patients may report a history of antecedent trauma at the site or have associated systemic illness such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, solid organ or hematologic neoplasms, or hematologic disorders. Borders are typically irregular with undermined edges, and the lesion may have a purulent base  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53733" href="/z/d/graphic/53733.html" rel="external">

         ). Lesions may be bullous. Lack of typical signs of systemic scorpion envenomation (eg, hemolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or acute kidney injury) in a patient with a commonly associated systemic illness helps to differentiate pyoderma gangrenosa from a scorpion sting; skin biopsy may be necessary to make this distinction.

          Vasculitis
         </strong>
         – Cutaneous vasculitis results from inflammation of the small or medium-sized blood vessels in the skin. Small blood vessels are capillaries, post-capillary venules, and non-muscular arterioles in the superficial and mid-dermis (&lt;50 micrometers). Medium-sized vessels consist of 50 to 150 micrometer vessels with muscular walls in the deep dermis and subcutis. Cutaneous vasculitis occurs in a wide variety of clinical settings  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59048" href="/z/d/graphic/59048.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Ulceration and tissue necrosis occur when vasculitis results in reduced vascular perfusion in the skin  (

          picture 7A-B
         </a>
         ). Superficial ulcers can occur in patients with small vessel vasculitis; deep ulcers are usually the result of medium vessel disease. Less commonly, vasculitis and necrotizing vasculitis may present with singular lesions that show eschar or ulceration  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78697" href="/z/d/graphic/78697.html" rel="external">

         Patients with vasculitis may have the presence of systemic findings consistent with connective tissue disease, recent symptoms of infection, or introduction of a medication within the past 7 to 10 days, which helps to differentiate them from victims of scorpion stings. However, skin biopsy is most definitive to establish the diagnosis of vasculitis. (See

         <a href="#rid19">
          19

         Acute kidney injury is caused by direct toxic effects of the scorpion venom, hemolysis with hemoglobinuria, and, in patients with noninfectious HUS, microangiopathic renovascular changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Initial management for hemoglobinuria consists of aggressive fluid therapy to maintain urine output as for pigment-induced kidney injury and renal replacement therapy, as needed, for fluid overload, hyperkalemia, uremia, or metabolic acidosis. Bicarbonate therapy has not been evaluated in patients with hemolysis and many experts do not administer it unless rhabdomyolysis is also present. (See

         In patients with noninfectious HUS, initial management is supportive and includes red blood cell transfusions for anemia, platelet transfusions for thrombocytopenia with significant bleeding or DIC, and infusion of FFP to restore normal ADAMTS-13 levels. (See

          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – The sting of
         <em>
          H. lepturus
         </em>
         is relatively painless and frequently occurs at night while the patient is sleeping and is often not noticed until the morning. Patients come to medical attention because of cutaneous findings or, in those with hemolysis or kidney injury, signs of hemoglobinuria or hematuria. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Presentation'
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Initial skin findings typically consist of a sting site with a central puncta and an erythematous or purpuric macule or papule, which is mildly painful and pruritic. Over the next 24 hours after the sting, other cutaneous findings may develop including concentric pruritic plaques, sterile lymphangitis and cellulitis, local or generalized erythematous eruption, purpuric plaques, or purpuric bullae up to 5 cm in diameter at or near the sting site. Early development of hemorrhagic bullae is associated with systemic signs of envenomation and further development of an indurated blue-black necrotic plaque with eventual deep skin ulceration at the site  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117502" href="/z/d/graphic/117502.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         One to two days after envenomation, patients may develop systemic signs of fever, pallor, fatigue, generalized edema, and/or red urine. These findings are most likely to develop in children younger than five years of age and indicate the presence of acute hemolysis. Petechiae, easy bruising, and bleeding point to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). (See
