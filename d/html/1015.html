Beginning early in the 21<sup>st </sup>century, there has also been an expansion in the indications for cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs, a term which includes PPMs, ICDs, and CRT devices, as well as other devices such as insertable cardiac monitors [also sometimes referred to as implantable cardiac monitors or implantable loop recorders]), and device therapy has become more commonplace.</p><p>Issues related to follow-up of patients with a CIED (PPM, ICD, or CRT devices only) will be reviewed here. The indications for PPM, ICD, and CRT use, as well as general issues related these devices, are discussed separately.

Subsequently, transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) became available for some types of permanent pacemakers (PPMs). Current technology, however, has evolved to enable comprehensive and safe remote monitoring for nearly all types of CIEDs [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Remote monitoring provides alerts in real-time (or on a daily basis), but is not as comprehensive as a complete device interrogation. A major difference between remote monitoring and an in-person interrogation is that a CIED cannot be adjusted or reprogrammed remotely. The equipment required for remote monitoring, which is proprietary and unique to each manufacturer just as the in-person programmers are, along with requirements (eg, internet connection) and instructions for use, should be discussed with the patient as part of the implantation process.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18903171"><span class="h2">Office-based versus remote follow-up</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients, the majority of CIED follow-up device interrogations can be done either in person or remotely  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108755" href="/z/d/graphic/108755.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. Following the immediate post-implant check, an initial in-person evaluation (IPE) should occur within weeks to three months post-implantation, and ideally one IPE annually for the duration of therapy with a CIED [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. With the exception of these initial and annual IPEs, all other CIED follow-up assessments may be done either in person or remotely (if available)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91502" href="/z/d/graphic/91502.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), an approach consistent with the 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the remote device interrogation and monitoring [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Remote monitoring is strongly encouraged for patients. Multiple prospective randomized trials have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of remote CIED monitoring as well as identified a greater number of clinically significant issues and shortened the time to clinical action [<a href="#rid7">7-15</a>]. Multiple nonrandomized observational studies have suggested improved survival for patients with remote CIED monitoring; however, this has not been universally replicated in prospective randomized trials [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. In a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized trials involving 6469 ICD recipients who were randomized to either remote monitoring (3496 patients) or in-office follow-up (2973 patients), patients assigned to remote monitoring had nonsignificant reductions in total mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.83; 95% CI 0.58-1.17), cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.41-1.09), and hospitalizations (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.63-1.10) along with significantly fewer inappropriate shocks (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.38-0.80) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Further evidence of improvements in mortality was seen in a 2017 analysis using patient-level data from only three of the nine randomized trials included in the 2015 meta-analysis (IN-TIME, ECOST, and TRUST) [<a href="#rid7">7,11,13</a>], in which the absolute risk of overall mortality was reduced by 1.9 percent (95% CI 0.1-3.8 percent) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p>In the 2019 RM-ALONE trial, which included 445 patients with CIEDs (151 ICDs and 294 PPMs including 54 percent pacemaker-dependent patients), participants were randomized to in-office device interrogation or remote device interrogation every six months; all patients in both groups were remotely monitored with daily transmission of alerts with unscheduled office visits at the provider's discretion following an alert [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Over a mean follow-up of 21 months, there was no significant difference between the two groups in major adverse cardiac events (20 percent in each group). More patients in the remote interrogation group had an unscheduled office visit (55 percent versus 45 percent of office interrogation patients); however, the remote interrogation group had 79 percent fewer total office visits (136 versus 653 in the office interrogation group). Overall, a strategy of remote-only device monitoring and interrogation appears to be as safe and efficacious as a strategy that includes twice yearly in-office visits. Important limitations include the relatively small sample size and the absence of CRT devices. Additional data from a multi-center randomized trial of remote-only versus periodic IPE, published after the RM-ALONE trial, suggest that remote-only follow-up for up to two years is safe and associated with significantly fewer office visits [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. </p><p>While most patients find remote follow-up more convenient, some may find in-office follow-up preferable for a variety of reasons (eg, the desire to be seen in-person more frequently for reassurance, social interaction, etc). With this in mind, the approach to CIED follow-up must be tailored to each individual patient. At present, standard practice continues to include at least an annual office visit, which is felt to be adequate for most patients. (See <a class="local">'Frequency of CIED follow-up visits'</a> below.)</p><p>In some instances, an IPE may be associated with significant risks to patients and healthcare providers. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the risk of viral transmission was very high, it was recommended by experts to substitute IPEs with remote checks. In April of 2020, the Heart Rhythm Society COVID-19 Task Force recommended that every effort be made to perform CIED interrogation via remote monitoring rather than via IPE [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The recommendations stated that IPEs for CIEDs should be limited to potentially hazardous lead or generator issues not adequately assessed by remote monitoring, absolute need for reprogramming, or other issues per physician judgment. A creative response to the COVID-19 pandemic was the creation of drive-through pacing clinics [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18903309"><span class="h2">Frequency of CIED follow-up visits</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The frequency of follow-up visits for patients with a CIED will vary according to the type of device, age of the device, and clinical status of the patient  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91502" href="/z/d/graphic/91502.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. In general, however, most patients with a CIED should have an annual IPE, with one or more additional follow-up assessments (either remotely or in-person) throughout the year. Patients who have received therapies (eg, ICD shocks or antitachycardia pacing), as well as those whose devices are approaching the end of battery life, may require more frequent follow-up. Furthermore, patients with advisory generators and/or leads may require more frequent follow-up, or additional testing (eg, lead fluoroscopy) during follow-up. </p><p>Patients who have an ICD which was placed for primary prevention may require less frequent follow-up. In the REFORM trial of 155 patients receiving a primary prevention ICD based on MADIT II criteria, patients were randomized (following a routine 3-month post-implant visit in all patients) to either 3-month or 12-month follow-up intervals and followed for 24 months [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Patients in the 12-month interval group had significantly fewer in-office follow-up visits (1.6 versus 3.9 visits per year), with no significant differences in mortality or hospitalization. While these findings are encouraging regarding the potential for reduced frequency of follow-up in stable recipients of primary prevention ICDs, our recommendations for follow-up will remain unchanged until these data are replicated in other larger patient populations and/or until professional societies alter follow-up guidelines.

If there is loss of capture, one should also consider whether this is true failure to capture or functional loss of capture (ie, failure to sense a native QRS complex followed by the release of the pacing stimulus at a time when the myocardium is physiologically refractory and incapable of being stimulated).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14539079"><span class="h3">Evaluate sensing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To evaluate sensing, intrinsic complexes must be present.

However, the fact that the pacemaker released an output pulse does not mean that the pacing stimulus effectively captured the heart muscle and resulted in a depolarization. In addition, the fact that the system reports that it sensed an event does not mean that this was an appropriate complex to be sensed. Thus, the event markers need to be correlated with the surface ECG recordings and/or intracardiac electrogram, and are most valuable when the event markers are printed along with a simultaneously recorded surface ECG or intracardiac electrogram.</p><p>A sense marker coinciding with a native P or R wave confirms proper sensing, unless there is a P marker over a native R wave or vice versa, in which case there may be a problem such as a dislodged atrial lead, inappropriate connection of the atrial and ventricular leads into the pulse generator, or far-field sensing. If the event markers indicated that the pacemaker is sensing an event that is not visible on the surface ECG, further evaluation is required.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14539097"><span class="h3">Electrogram assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Endocardial electrograms can be particularly helpful in examining the morphology of the native complexes to determine capture as well as why a given signal may not have been sensed. It is also useful in examining the signals that are being sensed when these are not readily identified from the surface ECG. Electrogram telemetry will greatly facilitate the evaluation, allowing it to be completed more expeditiously and provide information that may not be easily acquired.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">FOLLOW-UP OF THE PATIENT WITH AN ICD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) require routine follow-up on a periodic basis as well as semi-urgent or urgent follow-up after receiving a shock from the ICD  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91502" href="/z/d/graphic/91502.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

However, the induction and termination of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia has potential complications, is unpleasant for the patient, and adds additional cost, with a benefit to the patient that has not been proven. Although DFT testing at the time of the initial implant remains somewhat controversial, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend performing DFT testing as part of routine follow-up.</p><p>The need for routine DFT testing has been assessed in large randomized clinical trials [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. Both the SAFE-ICD and SIMPLE trials demonstrated that DFT testing does not improve shock efficacy or reduce arrhythmic death.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Follow-up after ICD discharge</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who receive one or more shocks from their ICD require review of the episode and either remote or in-clinic follow-up depending on the clinical situation and the institutional guidelines.</p><p>The timing and urgency of the follow-up varies according to the clinical scenario:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who receive a single ICD shock without loss of consciousness should have office-based or remote follow-up within 24 to 48 hours. If remote review of the data reveals a single appropriate ICD shock and the patient is feeling well, an IPE may not be required. However, if neither office-based nor remote follow-up is available for longer than 24 to 48 hours, the patient may need to be seen in the emergency department.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who receive a single ICD shock with loss of consciousness or near syncope, the decision as to whether the patient needs to be seen in clinic or in the emergency department will vary according to the clinical situation and the guidelines followed by a specific follow-up center. If a patient has a single appropriate shock as determined by review of remote data, or if the patient is feeling well and was not injured with loss of consciousness, some centers may not recommend a face-to-face visit. If the clinical situation is uncertain and/or if the patient is concerned or has been injured during the loss of consciousness, then the patient should be seen in the clinic or emergency department.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who receive multiple ICD shocks within a short period of time (minutes to hours) should have more urgent evaluation in the emergency department. Patients who are seen in the emergency department should all have a brief history and physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and additional laboratory testing as the clinical presentation dictates:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Troponin level in a patient with suspected acute myocardial ischemia</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Potassium and magnesium in a patient with suspected electrolyte depletion</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Toxin screen in a patient with suspected intentional or inadvertent drug overdose</p><p></p><p>Because ICDs are placed in patients felt to be at an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death, ICD discharge is an anticipated event during the long-term follow-up of such patients. Because a single ICD shock frequently represents the appropriate termination of a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, patients who receive only a single ICD shock without loss of consciousness may have follow-up (either office-based or remotely) within 24 to 48 hours to ascertain that the device is functioning properly, to exclude other causes of the ICD shock (eg, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, device malfunction) and to provide patient reassurance.</p><p>Even though a single ICD shock often represents the appropriate termination of a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, ICD discharges that are accompanied by loss of consciousness or near syncope should be promptly reviewed. These patients may need to have programming changes or, in the event of injury related to syncope, more immediate follow-up, usually in the clinic or the emergency department.</p><p>Patients who receive multiple ICD shocks or clusters of shocks within minutes to hours require immediate evaluation in the emergency department to determine the cause. Such recurrent discharges may be either appropriate (due to recurrent VT and electrical storm) or inappropriate (due to a supraventricular tachycardia with a rapid rate, or to device malfunction).</p><p>If frequent discharges are due to recurrent VT and electrical storm, additional therapy (such as an antiarrhythmic drug or catheter ablation) may be required. These therapies are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In the SCD-HeFT trial, both appropriate and inappropriate ICD therapy were associated with a higher mortality during follow-up [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The delivery of therapy by an ICD, therefore, should prompt clinicians to re-evaluate the patient's overall clinical status and therapeutic plan.
