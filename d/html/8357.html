Updated guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend screening for depression in adults (ages 19 years and above), including pregnant and postpartum women, based upon a systematic review that suggested a net benefit from screening [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These guidelines are consistent with our suggestion that primary care clinicians routinely screen adults for depression with diagnostic evaluation and treatment for those who screen positive. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83887.html" rel="external">"Screening for depression in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143000"><span class="h2">Overdiagnosis of breast cancer in older women (October 2023)</span></p><p>Overdiagnosis, the detection of a disease that would not have caused morbidity or mortality if it had not been found, is a concern in breast cancer screening, particularly among older patients. In a 2023 study in over 54,000 women 70 years and older who had recently undergone screening, the percent of overdiagnosed breast cancer cases increased with age from 31 percent among women aged 70 to 74 years to 54 percent among women aged 85 years and older [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. We utilize a shared decision-making framework for breast cancer screening in older women to balance potential risks and benefits. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/87311.html" rel="external">"Screening for breast cancer: Evidence for effectiveness and harms", section on 'Overdiagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H340_142602"><span class="h1">IMMUNIZATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143902"><span class="h2">2024 immunization schedule for adults (January 2024)</span></p><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published the 2024 immunization schedule for adults (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634" href="/d/graphic/82634.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130" href="/d/graphic/62130.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine is a new addition to the schedule; it is recommended for pregnant people 32 to 36 weeks' gestation during RSV season and is an option for adults ≥60 years of age. Mpox vaccine has also been added and is recommended for adults of all ages who are at risk for infection. Other changes include updates to COVID-19, polio, and meningococcal vaccine recommendations. Our approach to immunization is largely consistent with these updated recommendations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3884.html" rel="external">"Standard immunizations for nonpregnant adults", section on 'Immunization schedule for nonpregnant adults'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142602"><span class="h2">ACIP recommendations for 2023-24 seasonal influenza vaccination (September 2023)</span></p><p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued new recommendations for seasonal influenza vaccination in August 2023 (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79474" href="/d/graphic/79474.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The antigenic composition has been updated. In addition, the ACIP now states that egg allergy alone no longer necessitates additional safety measures for influenza vaccination, including with egg-based vaccines, beyond those recommended for any recipient of any vaccine, regardless of severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be administered in settings where personnel and equipment needed for prompt recognition and treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions are available. This is consistent with our previous guidance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7007.html" rel="external">"Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults", section on 'Antigenic composition'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141353"><span class="h2">Updated COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recommendations (September 2023)</span></p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have updated COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and recommendations [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Available COVID-19 vaccines have been updated to target Omicron variant XBB.1.5 (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130318" href="/d/drug information/130318.html" rel="external">Moderna COVID-19 vaccine</a> 2023-2024 formula, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 2023-2024 formula, and Novavax 2023-2024 formula); bivalent vaccines are no longer available. An updated 2023-2024 formula vaccine is recommended for all individuals aged six months and older. Immunocompetent individuals five years and older should receive one updated vaccine, regardless of prior vaccination history. For individuals who are four years or younger or have an immunocompromising condition (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef132490" href="/d/graphic/132490.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), the number of recommended updated vaccines depends on their vaccination history. Our approach to COVID-19 vaccination is consistent with these recommendations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'Indications and vaccine selection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'Benefits of vaccination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12_142004"><span class="h1">GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143006"><span class="h2">Long distance effect of wildfire smoke on asthma symptoms (October 2023)</span></p><p>Wildfire fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5)</sub> has been shown to affect respiratory health; however, previous work has focused on populations residing near and directly affected by wildfires. In June 2023, smoke from wildfires in Canada drifted hundreds of miles to New York City, resulting in increased ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>. During smoke waves, emergency department visits for asthma in both pediatric and adult patients increased to 261 per day (reference during nonsmoke periods, 181.5 per day; incidence rate ratio 1.4) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Wildfires have health effects far from their source and are particularly hazardous to those with underlying lung disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/140586.html" rel="external">"Climate emergencies", section on 'Changing wildfire exposure'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142939"><span class="h2">Nurse-delivered brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (October 2023)</span></p><p>A growing body of evidence supports the use of brief, behaviorally-focused treatments for insomnia, which involve fewer sessions than traditional cognitive behavioral therapy and can be delivered by clinicians with varied levels of expertise. In an open-label randomized trial in England involving nearly 650 adults with insomnia disorder recruited from 35 general practices, four sessions of nurse-delivered sleep restriction therapy (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122801" href="/d/graphic/122801.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) improved patient-reported insomnia severity scores and six-month response rates compared with a sleep hygiene booklet alone (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122804" href="/d/graphic/122804.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Training nurses or advanced practice providers to deliver brief behavioral treatments may be a feasible and cost-effective way to improve outcomes for insomnia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97869.html" rel="external">"Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in adults", section on 'Brief behavioral treatment approaches'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142576"><span class="h2">Over-the-counter opioid antagonist for opioid overdose (September 2023)</span></p><p>Drug overdose is a major public health problem; opioids were reported to be involved in nearly 80 percent of the 600,000 overdose deaths worldwide in 2019. The increasing rate of fatal overdose is driven by the presence of the synthetic opioid <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8441" href="/d/drug information/8441.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a>. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9678" href="/d/drug information/9678.html" rel="external">Naloxone</a> 4 mg nasal spray rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdose and is now the first opioid antagonist agent available for over-the-counter purchase in the United States [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The increased availability is part of an ongoing effort by the US Food and Drug Administration Overdose Prevention Framework to encourage harm reduction through developing and expanding access to novel overdose reversal products. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99945.html" rel="external">"Prevention of lethal opioid overdose in the community", section on 'Community-based naloxone'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142004"><span class="h2">Exercise and cardiovascular risk reduction (July 2023)</span></p><p>Current guidelines from the American Heart Association and World Health Organization recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity weekly. Two recent studies suggest that how one exercises matters more than when. In one prospective cohort of over 500,000 individuals, combining twice-weekly muscle strengthening activity to at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was associated with optimal reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In a separate study of nearly 90,000 individuals, among those who had at least 150 minutes of weekly physical activity, "weekend warrior" patterns of exercise (at least 50 percent of activity occurring over one to two days) and "regular" patterns (physical activity distributed more evenly during the week) were associated with similar reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation compared with inactivity [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. These findings provide support for recommending exercise whenever it is most feasible for patients and adding regular resistance training. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1510.html" rel="external">"Exercise and fitness in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease", section on 'Type, intensity, and duration of exercise'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14_142803"><span class="h1">PRIMARY CARE CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142803"><span class="h2">Semaglutide in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity (September 2023)</span></p><p>In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), weight loss is likely to improve functional status and quality of life, but achieving weight loss in this group of patients is difficult. In a recent trial of more than 500 patients with HFpEF, patients randomly assigned to treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115980" href="/d/drug information/115980.html" rel="external">semaglutide</a> had greater improvement in exercise capacity (ie, six-minute walk distance), quality of life, and weight loss (-13 percent mean change in body weight versus -2.6 percent) at 52 weeks than patients assigned to placebo [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. An exploratory analysis suggested a lower risk of urgent HF hospitalizations in those treated with semaglutide. Similar to other patients with obesity, patients with HFpEF and obesity should receive appropriate management to achieve weight loss. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3461.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction", section on 'Obesity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17_143107"><span class="h1">PRIMARY CARE GASTROENTEROLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143883"><span class="h2">Mortality risk in alcohol-associated liver disease (January 2024)</span></p><p>Few studies have reported the long-term outcomes of patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). In a national registry study including over 23,000 patients with ALD diagnosed at median age 58 years, 67 percent died during &gt;100,000 person-years of follow-up and liver disease was the primary cause of death in 45 percent [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The 5- and 10-year mortality rates due to liver disease were 26 and 31 percent, respectively. These data emphasize the importance of treating patients with alcohol use disorder and may inform strategies to prevent liver-related mortality in those with ALD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3611.html" rel="external">"Management of alcohol-associated steatosis and alcohol-associated cirrhosis", section on 'Mortality'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143327"><span class="h2">Clinical practice update on risk stratification for colorectal cancer screening and postpolypectomy surveillance (December 2023)</span></p><p>The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recently published nine statements of best practice advice on risk stratification for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and postpolypectomy surveillance [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. They advise basing risk stratification on an individual's age, a known or suspected predisposing hereditary CRC syndrome, other CRC predisposing conditions (eg, inflammatory bowel disease), and/or a family history of CRC. They also suggest that the decision to continue postpolypectomy surveillance for individuals older than 75 years should be individualized. Shared decision-making discussions should include an assessment of the risks of incident CRC, procedure-related risks, comorbidities, and life expectancy (&gt;5 years). Our approach is consistent with this guidance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2594.html" rel="external">"Overview of colon polyps", section on 'Risk assessment for subsequent colorectal cancer'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143131"><span class="h2">Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) 3.0 for liver transplantation (October 2023, Modified December 2023)</span></p><p>The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is used to allocate livers for transplantation. Recently, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network implemented an updated score, MELD 3.0, for prioritizing liver transplantation candidates who are ages 12 and older [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. MELD 3.0 includes variables from the original model (ie, serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and international normalized ratio) in addition to other inputs (ie, serum sodium, patient sex, and serum albumin) and a lower creatinine ceiling. Goals of using MELD 3.0 include reducing overall waitlist mortality and improving access for female liver transplant candidates. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1241.html" rel="external">"Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)", section on 'MELD 3.0'</a>. and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2490.html" rel="external">"Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma", section on 'MELD 3.0'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143320"><span class="h2">Clinical practice update on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (November 2023)</span></p><p>The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recently published best practice advice on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The AGA Clinical Practice Update advises considering a diagnosis of EPI in individuals with moderate-risk clinical conditions (eg, celiac disease, previous intestinal surgery, longstanding diabetes mellitus, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). It emphasizes the importance of testing for EPI in patients with nonspecific symptoms and cautions against relying on a response to an empiric trial of pancreatic enzymes to diagnose EPI as this may be due to a placebo effect. Our approach is consistent with this guidance.

The AGA Clinical Practice Update endorses serologic evaluation for celiac disease and exclusion of carbohydrate enzyme deficiencies with dietary restriction and/or breath testing, but emphasizes reserving additional evaluation with abdominal imaging and upper endoscopy for patients with alarm features, recent worsening symptoms, or an abnormal physical examination. Our approach is consistent with this guidance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2607.html" rel="external">"Overview of intestinal gas and bloating", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143107"><span class="h2">Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants in irritable bowel syndrome (October 2023)</span></p><p>The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has not been well established in the primary care setting. In a pragmatic randomized trial, 463 patients with IBS unresponsive to dietary advice and first-line therapies in primary care practices were assigned to titrated low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8605" href="/d/drug information/8605.html" rel="external">amitriptyline</a> or placebo as a second-line therapy [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. At six months, patients treated with low-dose amitriptyline had lower IBS-symptom severity scores and a higher rate of symptom relief. The most common side effects were related to the anticholinergic effects of amitriptyline, but the majority were mild. These data support current guidelines and our recommendation to use TCAs in the management of patients with IBS.

In a worldwide study that included 761 communities, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory deaths increased after a flooded day, and this increased risk persisted for up to 60 days [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Up to 0.41 percent of respiratory deaths, 0.18 percent of cardiovascular deaths, and 0.10 percent of all-cause deaths were attributed to floods. The risk varied by local climate type, socioeconomic status, degree of human development, and proportion of older residents.

A recent systematic review identified six small randomized trials examining sleep outcomes with use of blue light-filtering lenses [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Trial results were inconsistent, and meta-analysis could not be performed due to high heterogeneity and lack of quantitative outcome data. We counsel patients to avoid use of electronics at least 30 minutes before usual bedtime and in the middle of the night if nocturnal awakenings occur (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122804" href="/d/graphic/122804.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Based on available evidence, we advise that blue light-filtering glasses are not a substitute for avoidance of screens.

In 2023, the American Society of Anesthesiologists suggested holding the day-of-surgery or weekly dose of GLP-1 agonists prior to elective surgery because of case reports of aspiration [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. For patients who have not held their GLP-1 (ie, no drug on day of procedure/surgery for daily dosing, no drug in the week prior to procedure/surgery for weekly dosing), gastric ultrasound can be used to assess for gastric contents or a rapid sequence induction and intubation should be considered.
