         Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is one of the most common congenital heart defects (second only to bicuspid aortic valve), but accounts for only 10 percent of congenital heart defects in adults because many close spontaneously [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. VSDs are of various sizes and locations and can be single or multiple. VSDs can occur as isolated defects or they can be part of complex congenital heart defects. Depending on their size, their physiology, and complications (eg, pulmonary hypertension, aortic or tricuspid valve regurgitation), clinical presentation can be variable and management may be challenging. VSDs as part of complex congenital heart defects are discussed within the pertinent topics. (See

         This topic focuses on prognosis and management of isolated congenital VSDs in adults. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of VSDs are presented separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         VSDs can also occur as an acquired condition, such as a complication after acute myocardial infarction, surgical aortic valve replacement [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ], transcatheter aortic valve implantation, septal myectomy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, from erosion of a strut of a bioprosthetic mitral valve [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>

         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         ]. These conditions differ in many aspects from congenital VSDs and are discussed separately. (See

          9
         </a>
         ]. In patients with VSDs, the magnitude and direction of shunting are dependent on the size of the defect and the ratio between systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. (See

         Small restrictive VSDs are associated with small left-to-right shunts (pulmonary to systemic flow ratio [Qp:Qs] &lt;1.5:1). There is typically no LV volume overload or pulmonary hypertension (PH).

         Moderate-sized VSDs (also called moderately restrictive VSDs) typically measure &gt;25 but &lt;75 percent of the aortic annulus diameter and result in mild to moderate volume overload of the pulmonary arteries, left atrium, and LV. Patients with this lesion typically have various degrees of PH.

         Large nonrestrictive VSDs (diameter ≥75 percent of that of the aortic annulus) cause early large left-to-right shunt and are generally closed during the first year of life. If left uncorrected, the persistent shunt can cause progressive pulmonary vascular obstructive disease and PH. The right ventricle (RV) pressure may reach systemic or suprasystemic levels, leading to reversal of the shunt (right-to-left) with resultant hypoxemia and cyanosis; this is known as Eisenmenger syndrome [

         Some adults with prior VSD closure have a residual VSD; these can be hemodynamically insignificant depending on size and relative PVR and SVR as above. Residual VSD and other post-closure sequelae are discussed below. (See

         The clinical course and prognosis of isolated VSDs depend on the type, size of the defect, and associated hemodynamic abnormalities. VSDs often decrease in size in the first few years of life or close spontaneously. Small persistent VSDs are associated with a lower risk of complications than unclosed or closed larger VSDs, but both are associated with risk of cardiovascular morbidity.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Most small VSDs close during childhood, and large defects tend to become smaller; the rate of spontaneous VSD closure is lower in adults (eg, 10 percent in adults with VSD followed for a mean of 13 years [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]). Spontaneous closure more often occurs in muscular and membranous defects but generally does not occur in inlet or infundibular (outlet) defects. Closure results from muscular growth around the defect, ingrowth of border-forming proliferative fibrous tissue, or, in the case of membranous defects, from the tricuspid valve septal leaflet adhering to the edges of the defect, which may have an aneurysmal appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
         A VSD that has closed spontaneously is generally associated with an excellent prognosis. These patients no longer face the risks of developing pulmonary hypertension (PH) and endocarditis. However, closure of a membranous defect by apposition of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve may cause tricuspid regurgitation [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Patients with a spontaneously closed VSD may still be at risk for developing a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm with occasional rupture, double-chambered right ventricle (DCRV), and heart block [

          13,14

          Hemodynamically significant shunt
         </strong>
         – The rationale for VSD closure in patients with a hemodynamically significant shunt with acceptable pulmonary artery pressures is to avoid complications observed in natural history studies, including progressive PH and HF [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,24
         </a>

         <a href="#rid20">
          20,25
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, VSD repair is warranted in adult patients who are symptomatic or have signs of LV volume overload without irreversible pulmonary vascular disease. (See

          Without significant PH
         </strong>
         – For adults with VSD with a hemodynamically significant net left-to-right shunt without significant PH, we recommend VSD closure. We define a hemodynamically significant shunt as a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio [Qp:Qs] ≥1.5:1 with LV dilation. In this context, we define lack of significant PH as pulmonary artery systolic pressure &lt;50 percent of systemic arterial pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance less than one-third of systemic vascular resistance. This recommendation is based upon natural history data suggesting that patients with a hemodynamically significant shunt are at risk for the development of PH and data showing excellent outcomes in patients without PH undergoing VSD repair.

         – For adults with a perimembranous or infundibular (outlet) VSD with significant or worsening AR who do not have other indications for VSD closure, we suggest surgical closure of the VSD. The aortic valve is commonly repaired at the time of VSD closure. Surgical aortic valve replacement is reserved for patients with AR with an indication for aortic valve surgery when the aortic valve cannot be durably repaired. (See

         – For patients with VSD with history of infective endocarditis, we suggest an individualized assessment of the risks and benefits of VSD closure. If there is no contraindication to closure, shared decision making is appropriate. Observational data suggest that surgical closure decreases the risk of endocarditis by at least one-half [

         Repair of VSD has been historically performed surgically. However, percutaneous VSD closure is also feasible for isolated uncomplicated muscular VSDs, and for membranous VSDs, in selected patients with suitable anatomy.

         Primary surgical repair for isolated VSD was originally performed through a ventriculotomy, but with the recognition of long-term risks after ventriculotomy, surgical techniques now allow repair of perimembranous VSD through a right atriotomy. Infundibular VSDs are generally repaired through a transpulmonary approach. Access to the heart is generally through a sternotomy incision [

         When aortic valve prolapse and AR are present, aortic valve repair is recommended when possible to reduce the risk of progressive AR. This often includes commissural suspension and plication of the elongated prolapsing cusp. In patients in whom aortic valve repair is not feasible because of extensive distortion, fenestration, fibrosis, or calcification, valve replacement should be considered [

         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         Transcatheter device VSD closure is a treatment option for isolated, uncomplicated, muscular VSDs, and for membranous VSDs in selected patients with suitable anatomy. Appropriate anatomy for transcatheter closure includes a VSD location remote from the tricuspid and aortic valves with an adequate rim of tissue. Successful transcatheter closure has been accomplished in the presence of multiple muscular or membranous fenestrations [

         Patients with VSD are at risk for development of aortic regurgitation (AR) and require monitoring of valve function. AR occurs 2.5 times more commonly with infundibular type VSD than membranous VSD because the associated deficiency or hypoplasia of the conal septum causes an anatomically unsupported right or left aortic valve cusp and sinus. As a result, the unsupported aortic valve cusp is driven into the RV by a Venturi effect, making the VSD smaller during systole. During diastole, intraaortic pressure causes the aortic valve cusps to close, but the unsupported cusp prolapses down into the LV outflow tract away from the opposing cusps, resulting in typically eccentric AR that may become progressive  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77305" href="/z/d/graphic/77305.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). The prevalence of AR increases with age (occurring in 87 percent of patients by age 20) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,37
         </a>
         ]. The progressive nature of the AR, the potential associated morbidity, along with improved surgical results with VSD and aortic valve repair have led to the recommendation to consider early surgical intervention. However, there is a residual risk of AR progression in children with infundibular VSD who have undergone VSD repair (eg, 7.7 percent during mean 13-year follow-up); some (eg, 43 percent) but not all progressive AR was associated with a residual VSD shunt [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In adults with infundibular VSD, the risk of progression of AR may be lower than in children, as illustrated by a series of 62 adults (median age 41 years) with infundibular VSD, in which the freedom from AR progression was 86 percent at 15 years [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In this series, age ≤40 years was a predictor of AR progression.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with VSD with significant or worsening AR, we suggest VSD closure. Surgical aortic valve repair is performed if feasible to avoid or delay the need for aortic valve replacement. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for VSD closure'

         In patients with AR and infundibular VSD who undergo VSD closure without aortic valve surgery (repair or replacement), there is a risk of late postoperative AR progression [

         Patients with infundibular VSDs are at risk for development of right sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, which may rupture. The rupture of the aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva occurs within the right atrium or right ventricle. Patients generally present with acute HF and a continuous murmur. This was illustrated in the above cited study of 62 adults with infundibular VSD in which there was a high risk of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm development (21 percent), even in those patients who had been repaired [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In a separate series of 60 adults with infundibular VSD, rupture of the sinus of Valsalva aneurysm was noted in five patients (8 percent), and endocarditis was noted in three patients (5 percent) [

          'Indications for VSD closure'

         Patients with VSD who do not meet pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance criteria for closure may become candidates for VSD closure on an individualized basis if these criteria are met after treatment with advanced therapy for pulmonary artery pressure. When this strategy is undertaken, targeted therapy is continued after VSD closure. This approach is supported by a study reporting favorable outcomes in 41 adults with nonrestrictive VSD and severe PH treated with PH-targeted therapy for 3 to 15 months followed by surgical VSD closure [

         VSD with Eisenmenger syndrome (known as Eisenmenger complex) is rarely encountered in the current era due to recognition and closure of moderately restrictive or large VSDs early in life. When such VSDs are not closed early in life, patients may develop symptoms of Eisenmenger complex in the second and third decade [

         Despite the increased risk of infective endocarditis associated with VSD, we agree with the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology(AHA/ACC) guidelines recommending
         <strong>
          no
         </strong>
         antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with acyanotic, uncomplicated VSD with no prior history of infective endocarditis; this is predominantly due to the lack of evidence supporting widespread use of antibiotic prophylaxis and concerns about developing antimicrobial resistance. For patients with a VSD patch leak or prior history of infective endocarditis, antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis is recommended. The role of VSD closure in patients with prior history of infective endocarditis is discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2147.html" rel="external">

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Proper patient education about symptoms of infective endocarditis and appropriate evaluation and management if symptoms of endocarditis develop (including the need for timely blood cultures and review by an expert multidisciplinary team) are of paramount importance to avoid delayed diagnosis of infective endocarditis, particularly since most patients with small defects and an uncomplicated clinical course are followed infrequently in specialized clinics. In addition, patients with VSD should receive education on how to minimize endocarditis risk (including careful oral hygiene and appropriate prompt treatment of infections) and the importance of seeking prompt medical attention if symptoms of endocarditis develop.
        </p>
        <p>
         When endocarditis is suspected, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is recommended to identify vegetations, which may be related to the VSD or on adjacent valves in the direction of the high velocity jet created by the VSD (often involving the tricuspid valve). Thus, endocarditis in patients with VSD often presents as right heart endocarditis, which may be complicated by septic pulmonary embolism, and this complication may be confused with pneumonia. TEE remains the diagnostic procedure of choice in the evaluation of patients with suspected endocarditis, given its greater sensitivity and specificity compared with TTE. However, TTE provides complementary imaging to TEE in patients with VSD and suspected endocarditis given the propensity to involve right heart structures; thus, both are usually performed. Advanced imaging with computed tomography or positron emission tomography may be beneficial in select patients with VSD and endocarditis, especially those with prosthetic material and in patients with suspected septic embolism.

         Arrhythmias, including atrial and ventricular premature beats and tachycardias, have been observed in adults with unrepaired or repaired VSD [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The reported incidences of ventricular tachycardias and sudden death in natural history studies of VSDs are 5.7 and 4.0 percent, respectively. In a series of patients with repaired and unrepaired VSDs, age and pulmonary artery pressure were the best predictors for ventricular arrhythmias on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. Arrhythmia may be the presenting sign of VSD in adults, and a comprehensive evaluation is recommended to assess candidacy for repair in all adults with VSD and cardiac arrhythmias.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with VSD complicated by high right ventricular pressure, such as PH, Eisenmenger complex, and double-chambered right ventricle (DCRV), the reported incidence of ventricular tachycardia is 19 percent [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The hypertrophied RV in these patients represents an ideal substrate for ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, some advocate annual Holter monitoring in patients with VSD and elevated RV pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Atrial arrhythmias, mostly atrial fibrillation, are also prevalent in adult VSD, especially with increasing age, LV dysfunction, and elevated pulmonary or right ventricular artery pressure. Treatment of these arrhythmias should be individualized, depending on their associated symptoms, severity, frequency, the presence of conduction delay, or ventricular dysfunction. (See

         DCRV most commonly occurs in association with a small membranous VSD. Progressive hypertrophy of a RV muscle bundles at the infundibular or superior margin of the VSD create a DCRV with a proximal high-pressure RV chamber in the RV inflow and a distal low-pressure RV chamber near the pulmonic valve. This condition develops in 3 to 10 percent of patients with membranous VSD. The resultant RV hypertrophy and right atrial enlargement are associated with ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, respectively. Although patients with VSD and DCRV may remain asymptomatic with severe obstruction, symptoms tend to develop during adult life. In a series of 50 patients with DCRV, symptoms occurred at a median age of 26 years [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. DCRV is characterized by the development of a loud crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur at the left sternal border, often associated with a thrill, replacing the typical holosystolic murmur of VSD [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59

        </p>
        <p>
         For adults with DCRV with moderate or greater outflow obstruction causing symptoms of HF, exercise limitation, or cyanosis, we recommend surgical repair [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Surgery for DCRV involves transatrial and/or transventricular resection of obstructing muscle bundles and closure of any accompanying VSD [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In some patients with this condition, patch enlargement of the RV outflow tract is required to relieve the obstruction. The VSD may be difficult to differentiate from DCRV by echocardiography.
        </p>
        <p>
         The above recommendations are based upon limited observational data suggesting that surgical repair of DCRV is effective in resolving the hemodynamic lesion. A study of 29 patients with DCRV described complete resolution of RV outflow obstruction after surgical repair at a mean echocardiographic follow-up period of 11 years [

         HF due to chronic volume overload of the LV occurs in patients with isolated medium or large VSDs and is rarely seen in adults, since most of these defects are repaired during childhood. However, left-sided HF can develop in the setting of severe AR in association with a residual infundibular or membranous VSD. Right-sided HF may occur in adults with VSD, particularly when there is progressive tricuspid valve regurgitation (due to leaflet adherence to the VSD), RV dysfunction and significant RV hypertension from DCRV, or PH.

          64
         </a>
         ]. In multivariate analysis, the presence of preoperative right or noncoronary cusp prolapse was independently correlated with aortic root dilatation irrespective of VSD type, but the presence of at least moderate AR was not significantly associated with aortic root dilation. Ascending aortic dilation was also noted in 7 of 47 patients (15 percent) in the Belgium Registry on Adult Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65

         VSD repair promotes normalization of LV mass and function in patients with prior LV volume overload. However, ventricular dysfunction with HF may persist or even worsen after repair, particularly in patients with residual VSD, aortic regurgitation (AR), abnormal septal wall motion, and/or concomitant acquired cardiovascular diseases such as systemic hypertension and ischemic coronary disease. The degree of persistent PH after VSD repair depends on the severity of preoperative PH and the presence of residual VSD. Persistent PH is an indicator of impaired postoperative cardiac performance and is a risk factor for late sequelae.

         Although VSD has traditionally been considered a lesion that predominantly affects the LV, a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study of 27 VSD patients (median age 20 years, repaired in childhood at median age of two years) demonstrated significant changes in RV structure and function when compared with 28 age-matched controls, including larger RV, higher RV mass index, and lower fractional area change but no change in longitudinal strain. This might be reflective of the hemodynamic alterations involving the RV in infancy and childhood or surgical technique [
         <a href="#rid66">

A study from the Belgium registry including 47 patients post-VSD repair (age 29 to 40) demonstrated abnormal echocardiographic parameters of RV function, including reduced fractional area contraction (&lt;35 percent) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (&lt;17 mm) in 15 and 36 percent, respectively, on follow-up [

Their incidence increases with higher preoperative New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, cardiomegaly, older age at time of operation, increased pulmonary artery pressure, prior ventriculotomy, and postoperative conduction disease.

There is also an increased risk of atrial flutter related to surgical scars, similar to other patients with operated congenital cardiac lesions. Thus, even patients with surgical closure of VSD early in life and a subsequently uncomplicated clinical course may be at an increased risk of developing atrial arrhythmias during long-term follow-up. Thus, even patients with no apparent complications should not be discharged from follow-up and should receive periodic follow-up in adult CHD clinics, including education about these long-term risks.

         Conduction diseases including right bundle branch block (RBBB; 18 to 100 percent) and left anterior hemiblock (30 percent), especially after ventriculotomy and patch closure of the defect, are common following surgical VSD repair.

         AR is improved in up to 80 percent of patients following surgical VSD closure and aortic valve repair, with better results achieved in younger patients [

         Tricuspid regurgitation due to septal leaflet traumatic detachment or iatrogenic entrapment during VSD repair has been reported. Tricuspid regurgitation may be aggravated by PH with associated tricuspid annular dilation and should therefore be carefully monitored. In a series of 46 patients, moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation was observed in 27 percent following VSD repair at a mean follow-up of 10 years [

         Most small VSDs close during childhood. A VSD that has closed spontaneously is generally associated with an excellent prognosis, although there is a very low risk of complications such as double chambered right ventricle and sinus of Valsalva dilatation/aneurysm. Patients with closed VSDs no longer face the risks of development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and endocarditis associated with persistent VSD. (See
         <a class="local">

         Persistent small VSD are associated with a low risk of complications. Adults with small persistent VSDs with normal pulmonary artery pressure generally do not require intervention and have an excellent prognosis; however, these patients are at risk of development of endocarditis, double-chambered right ventricle (DCRV), or aortic regurgitation (AR), and periodic follow-up by a congenital heart disease (CHD) cardiologist is recommended.

         Larger VSDs are likely to persist and entail greater risk of complications. Adults with moderately restrictive or large VSDs are at risk for development of progressive pulmonary vascular disease, which may lead to severe irreversible PH with shunt reversal and cyanosis (Eisenmenger complex), heart failure (HF), and arrhythmias. Other potential complications include AR, DCRV, and endocarditis. Indications for VSD closure should be assessed, and regular follow-up by a CHD cardiologist is recommended for these patients. (See

          Grade 1B

We define lack of significant PH as pulmonary artery systolic pressure &lt;50 percent of systemic arterial pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance less than one-third of systemic vascular resistance. This recommendation is based upon natural history data suggesting that patients with hemodynamically significant shunt are at risk for the development of PH, and data showing excellent outcomes in patients without PH undergoing VSD repair.

         Patients with VSD and PH who do not meet the above criteria for pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance may occasionally become candidates for VSD closure if these criteria are met after advanced therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
