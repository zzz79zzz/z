Thyroid hormones must be constantly available to perform these functions. To maintain their availability, there are large stores of thyroid hormone in the circulation and in the thyroid gland. Furthermore, thyroid hormone biosynthesis and secretion are maintained within narrow limits by a regulatory mechanism that is very sensitive to small changes in circulating hormone concentrations.</p><p>The processes of thyroid hormone synthesis, transport, and metabolism, and the regulation of thyroid secretion will be reviewed here. The actions of thyroid hormone are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7864.html" rel="external">"Thyroid hormone action"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The thyroid gland weighs 10 to 20 grams in normal adults in the United States [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Thyroid volume measured by ultrasonography is slightly greater in men than women, increases with age and body weight, and decreases with increasing iodine intake [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Microscopically, the thyroid is composed of spherical follicles, each composed of a single layer of follicular cells surrounding a lumen filled with colloid (mostly thyroglobulin). When stimulated, the follicular cells become columnar and the lumen is depleted of colloid; when suppressed, the follicular cells become flat and colloid accumulates in the lumen.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">THYROID HORMONE BIOSYNTHESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are two biologically active thyroid hormones: thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66175" href="/d/graphic/66175.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). They are composed of a phenyl ring attached via an ether linkage to a tyrosine molecule. Both have two iodine atoms on their tyrosine (inner) ring. They differ in that T4 has two iodine atoms on its phenyl (outer) ring, whereas T3 has only one. The compound formed if an iodine atom is removed from the inner ring of T4 is 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (reverse T3 [rT3]), which has no biological activity.</p><p>T4 is solely a product of the thyroid gland, whereas T3 is a product of the thyroid and of many other tissues, in which it is produced by deiodination of T4. The thyroid gland contains large quantities of T4 and T3 incorporated in thyroglobulin, the protein within which the hormones are both synthesized and stored. Being stored in this way, T4 and T3 can be secreted more quickly than if they had to be synthesized.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Iodine economy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Iodine is essential for normal thyroid function, and it can be obtained only by consumption of foods that contain it or to which it is added.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Foods rich in iodine include seafood, seaweed, kelp, dairy products (due to the use of iodine antiseptics on cow udders, and the equipment used to collect the milk), and some vegetables. Sea salt contains some iodine, and iodized salt is widely available (iodized salt in the United States contains 45 to 80 mcg/g). Salt iodination is legally mandated in many countries (although not in the United States). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7844.html" rel="external">"Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dietary iodine is absorbed as iodide and rapidly distributed in the extracellular fluid, which also contains iodide released from the thyroid and by extrathyroidal deiodination of the iodothyronines. Iodide leaves this pool by transport into the thyroid and excretion into the urine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The recommended daily iodine intake (Food and Nutrition Council, National Academy of Medicine [formerly the Institute of Medicine]) is: infants 0 to 6 months, 110 mcg; infants 7 to 12 months, 130 mcg; children 1 to 8 years, 90 mcg; children 9 to 13 years, 120 mcg; adolescents and adults, 150 mcg; pregnant women, 220 mcg; lactating women, 290 mcg.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Iodine deficiency is defined by urinary iodine excretion, as follows: mild iodine deficiency, 50 to 99 mcg/L; moderate iodine deficiency, 20 to 49 mcg/L; and severe iodine deficiency, &lt;20 mcg/L (urinary values are approximately 70 to 80 percent of intake). Severe iodine deficiency in fetuses and infants results in severe intellectual delay and growth retardation, and even mild iodine deficiency is associated with thyroid enlargement and learning disabilities in children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7828.html" rel="external">"Iodine deficiency disorders"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Thyroid hormones are synthesized in the thyroid gland via the following steps  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91278" href="/d/graphic/91278.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Thyroid iodide transport</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Iodide is transported into thyroid follicular cells against a chemical and electrical gradient. Iodide transport is linked to transport of sodium, is energy-dependent and saturable, and requires oxidative metabolism. The sodium iodine transporter is an intrinsic transmembrane protein located on the basolateral membrane of the thyroid follicular cells [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Other ions such as perchlorate and pertechnetate also are transported into the thyroid by the same mechanism and, therefore, are competitive inhibitors of iodide transport. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by <em>BRAF</em> mutations in differentiated thyroid cancer results in reduced synthesis of the transporter, causing radioiodine refractory tumors; BRAF inhibitors allow upregulation of the transporter and restore iodine avidity [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Tyrosyl iodination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In thyroid follicular cells, iodide rapidly diffuses to the apical surface of the cells, where it is transported by pendrin, a membrane iodide-chloride transporter, to exocytotic vesicles fused with the apical cell membrane [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In these vesicles the iodide is rapidly oxidized and covalently bound (organified) to a few of the tyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin. The oxidation of iodide is catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase in a reaction that requires hydrogen peroxide. This enzyme catalyzes iodination of approximately 10 percent of the tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Coupling of iodotyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>T4 is formed by coupling of two diiodotyrosine residues and T3 by coupling of one monoiodotyrosine and one diiodotyrosine within a thyroglobulin molecule. These reactions also are catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Thyroglobulin synthesis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Thyroglobulin is a 660-kilodalton (kD) glycoprotein composed of two identical, noncovalently linked subunits. It is found mostly in the lumen of thyroid follicles [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. It is synthesized and glycosylated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and then incorporated into exocytotic vesicles that fuse with the apical cell membrane. Only then are tyrosine residues iodinated and coupled to form T4 and T3.</p><p>The coupling process is not random. T4 and T3 are formed in regions of the thyroglobulin molecule with unique amino acid sequences [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Normal thyroglobulin contains approximately six molecules of monoiodotyrosine, four of diiodotyrosine, two of T4, and 0.2 of T3 per molecule.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Endocytosis of colloid and hormone release</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To liberate T4 and T3, thyroglobulin is resorbed into the thyroid follicular cells in the form of colloid droplets. The droplets fuse with lysosomes to form phagolysosomes, in which the thyroglobulin is hydrolyzed to T4, T3, and its other constituent amino acids, and some T4 is converted to T3. The hormones are then secreted into the extracellular fluid and enter the circulation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Recycling of iodide</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The iodotyrosines liberated from thyroglobulin are deiodinated by iodotyrosine deiodinase. Most of the iodide is then recycled for thyroid hormone synthesis. Homozygous mutations in <em>DEHAL1</em>, the gene that encodes iodotyrosine deiodinase [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], result in iodotyrosine deiodinase deficiency with hereditary and sometimes severe hypothyroidism and goiter [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5836.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism", section on 'Disorders of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Thyroglobulin secretion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 100 mcg of thyroglobulin is released from the thyroid each day. This is a tiny fraction of the 25 mg that must be hydrolyzed to yield the 100 mcg (130 nmoles) of T4 that is secreted each day [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Extrathyroidal T3 production</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 80 percent of the T3 produced is formed by 5'-deiodination (outer-ring deiodination) of T4 in extrathyroidal tissue. This reaction is catalyzed by two T4-5'-deiodinases (type I and type II), which are, respectively, plasma membrane and microsomal enzymes that require reduced sulfhydryl groups as a cofactor. The liver and kidney contain abundant deiodinase activity [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. These organs are the major sources of serum T3, but some T3 is produced in most, if not all, tissues.</p><p>The two types of T4-5'-deiodinase (types I and II) are distinguished by their location, biochemical properties, and responses to physiologic stimuli [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type I T4-5'-deiodinase is the predominant deiodinating enzyme in the liver, kidney, and thyroid. It has a high K<sub>m</sub> for T4, is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9830" href="/d/drug information/9830.html" rel="external">propylthiouracil</a> (PTU) sensitive, and deiodinates in the following order: rT3&gt;T4&gt;T3.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type II T4-5'-deiodinase is the predominant deiodinating enzyme in muscle, brain, pituitary, skin, and placenta. It has a low K<sub>m</sub> for T4, is not inhibited by PTU, and deiodinates T4&gt;rT3.</p><p></p><p>Overall, in normal subjects, approximately 65 percent of the extrathyroidally produced T3 in serum is probably contributed by type II deiodinase and 35 percent by type I deiodinase. The proportion contributed by the type II enzyme is higher in hypothyroidism and lower in hyperthyroidism [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Identification of polymorphisms in the deiodinase genes may ultimately prove to have clinical importance. For example, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the type I deiodinase (rs2235544) appears to increase deiodinase function, resulting in higher ratios of free T3/free T4 in patients, including those taking T4 (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. A polymorphism in the type 2 deiodinase (rs225014) may be associated with lower T3 concentrations [<a href="#rid14">14</a>] and compromised psychological well-being in treated hypothyroid patients, and a favorable response to combined therapy with T4 and T3 (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9563" href="/d/drug information/9563.html" rel="external">liothyronine</a>) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7855.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults", section on 'Is there a role for combination T4 and T3 therapy?'</a>). This same polymorphism may contribute to intellectual delay, low intelligence quotient (IQ), and neurodegenerative processes [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>rT3 is produced at extrathyroidal sites by 5-deiodination (inner ring deiodination) of T4 (type III T4-5-deiodinase). This enzyme is widely distributed throughout the body, and its properties are very similar to those of type I T4-5'-deiodinase. The type III T4-5-deiodinase is stimulated by hypoxia and is primarily responsible for low T3 levels in nonthyroidal illness [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3108406"><span class="h2">Selenium</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The deiodinases are selenoproteins, and the thyroid has more <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9884" href="/d/drug information/9884.html" rel="external">selenium</a> per gram of tissue than any other organ. The effects of selenium deficiency on normal thyroid function are not well described; however, selenium deficiency has been shown to exacerbate both autoimmune thyroid disease and endemic cretinism [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h1">THYROID HORMONE METABOLISM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are major differences in the production and metabolism of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), both quantitatively and qualitatively:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Thyroxine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The production rate of T4 is 80 to 100 mcg (100 to 130 nmoles) per day, all of which is produced in the thyroid [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The extrathyroidal pool of T4 contains 800 to 1000 mcg (1000 to 1300 nmoles), most of which is extracellular.</p><p>T4 is degraded at a rate of approximately 10 percent per day. Approximately 80 percent is deiodinated, 40 percent to form T3 and 40 percent to form reverse T3 (rT3). The remaining 20 percent is conjugated with glucuronide and sulfate, deaminated and decarboxylated to form tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), or cleaved between the two rings [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Deiodination of T4 to T3 leads to increased biologic activity, but the other metabolites of T4 are biologically inactive. The conversion of T4 to T3 in extrathyroidal tissues is regulated, so that production of T3 may change independently of changes in pituitary-thyroid function. (See <a class="local">'Regulation of extrathyroidal T3 production'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Triiodothyronine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most T3 (80 percent) is produced by extrathyroidal deiodination of T4 and the rest by the thyroid [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The total production rate is 30 to 40 mcg (45 to 60 nmoles) per day. The extrathyroidal T3 pool contains approximately 50 mcg (75 nmoles), most of which is intracellular. T3 is degraded, mostly by deiodination, much more rapidly than T4 (approximately 75 percent per day).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Reverse triiodothyronine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The production rate of rT3 is 30 to 40 mcg (45 to 60 nmoles) daily, nearly all by extrathyroidal deiodination of T4 [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. rT3 is degraded even more rapidly than is T3, mostly by deiodination.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3866682911"><span class="h2">Thyronamines</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>T4 and T3 are inactivated by inner ring deiodination (5'-deiodination) to form rT3 and 3,5-dioidothyronine (T2), respectively. T2 is also produced by outer ring deiodination of rT3. T2 and other iodothyronamines (eg, 3-iodothyronamine) can be detected in the serum by immunological methods and have been shown to be independent chemical messengers with direct effects on mitochondrial processes [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h1">SERUM BINDING PROTEINS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>More than 99.95 percent of the thyroxine (T4) and 99.5 percent of the triiodothyronine (T3) in serum are bound to several serum proteins, thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR, formerly called thyroxine-binding prealbumin [TBPA]), albumin, and lipoproteins  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51862" href="/d/graphic/51862.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For T4, approximately 75 percent is bound to TBG, 10 percent to TTR, 12 percent to albumin, and 3 percent to lipoproteins.

Approximately 0.5 percent, or 0.4 ng/dL (6 pmol/L), of the T3 in serum is free.</p><p></p><p>Because nearly all of the T4 and T3 in serum is bound, changes in the serum concentrations of binding proteins, especially TBG, have a large effect on serum total T4 and T3 concentrations and the fractional metabolism of T4 and T3. They do not, however, alter free hormone concentrations or the absolute rates of metabolism of T4 and T3. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7892.html" rel="external">"Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and hypothyroxinemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h2">General functions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is the serum <strong>free</strong> T4 and T3 concentrations that determine the hormones' biological activity. The binding proteins serve to maintain the serum free T4 and T3 concentrations within narrow limits, yet ensure that T4 and T3 are immediately and continuously available to tissues. These proteins, therefore, have both storage and buffer functions. The storage function also facilitates uniform distribution of T4 and T3 within tissues, particularly large solid organs [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>In the longer term, if thyroid secretion ceases, the T4 stored in serum serves to delay the onset of hypothyroidism. In contrast, the supply would be exhausted within hours if only free T4 were available. The binding proteins also protect tissues from sudden increases in thyroid secretion or extrathyroidal T3 production.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h2">Thyroxine-binding globulin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TBG is a 54-kD glycoprotein synthesized in the liver that has one binding site for T4. The affinity of TBG for T4 is very high, while that for T3 is lower [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].

T4 and T3 enter the cells of most organs by carrier-mediated transport and perhaps also by diffusion [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The monocarboxylate transporters MCT8 and MCT10 are involved in the transport of T4 and T3 (as well as reverse T3 [rT3] and 3,5-diiodothyronine [T2]) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Mutations in MCT8 result in a severe neurologic syndrome (Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Multiple other transporters have been identified [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>T3 is also available to cells because it is produced from T4 within them. Some of the locally produced T3 must leave the cells, as evidenced by the observation that serum free (and total) T3 concentrations are near normal in hypothyroid patients taking T4 (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a>) in doses that raise their serum T4 concentrations to normal. However, some of the T3 does not leave, and local production of T3 provides much of the T3 that is bound to T3 nuclear receptors in many tissues.

The mRNAs for each receptor can be spliced in several ways, so that there are at least three forms of alpha receptors and two forms of beta receptors.

It is composed of noncovalently bound alpha and beta subunits, and contains about 15 percent carbohydrate [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. The alpha subunit is the same as that of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and chorionic gonadotropin. In contrast, the beta subunit is unique and therefore determines the hormone's biologic specificity.</p><p>The TSH secretion rate in normal subjects ranges from 75 to 150 mU/day (15 to 30 mcg/day, 0.5 to 1 nmol/day). TSH secretion is pulsatile, and serum TSH concentrations are 50 to 100 percent higher in the late evening than during the day.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27"><span class="h2">Thyroid hormone regulation of TSH secretion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TSH secretion is inhibited by very small increases in serum T4 and T3 concentrations, and it increases in response to very small decreases in serum T4 and T3 concentrations. As a result of this very "tight" control of TSH secretion, thyroid hormone secretion is maintained within very narrow limits. An important exception is that the decrease in serum T3 concentrations that occurs in patients with nonthyroidal illness has little effect on TSH secretion, probably because serum T4 contributes more to the nuclear T3 content of the hypothalamus and pituitary than it does in many other tissues [<a href="#rid11">11,28</a>].</p><p>T4 and T3 inhibit the synthesis and release of both TSH and TRH [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. The inhibition of TSH synthesis is achieved primarily by inhibition of transcription of the TSH subunit genes.</p><p>The rate and extent of T4- and T3-induced inhibition of TSH secretion are dependent upon the initial serum TSH concentration, the particular hormone given, and its dose. Serum TSH concentrations decline within hours after administration of single 400 to 500 mcg doses of T3 (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9563" href="/d/drug information/9563.html" rel="external">liothyronine</a>) or T4 (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a>) to hypothyroid patients; the action of lower doses is considerably slower. The maximum inhibition of TSH secretion occurs later than the peak serum T4 or T3 concentrations. In usual doses, T3 decreases serum TSH to normal in hypothyroid patients in approximately one week, but the response to T4 is slower. When given chronically, the potency of T3 as an inhibitor of TSH secretion is approximately three times greater than that of T4 [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Conversely, serum TSH concentrations become supranormal in 10 to 14 days after cessation of T4 or T3 therapy in patients with hypothyroidism [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28"><span class="h2">Thyrotropin-releasing hormone</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TRH is the tripeptide pyroglutamyl-histidyl-prolineamide. It is distributed throughout the hypothalamus, but its content is highest in the median eminence and paraventricular nuclei [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Small amounts of TRH are found elsewhere in the central nervous system and in the pituitary gland, gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic islets, and reproductive tract. The function of TRH in these sites is unknown.</p><p>TRH is synthesized as a 26-kD protein (proTRH) containing five copies of the molecule. It is formed from proTRH by the action of peptidases and then cyclization of the glutamine residue to form a pyroglutamyl residue [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. The production of proTRH mRNA and its translation in the paraventricular nuclei are increased by hypothyroidism and decreased by local or systemic injection of T4 or T3 [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. TRH is metabolized very rapidly, its plasma half-life being approximately three minutes.</p><p>TRH stimulates TSH secretion via receptor-mediated activation of the phospholipase C-phosphoinositide pathway, which stimulates mobilization of calcium from intracellular storage sites. Chronic TRH stimulation also increases the synthesis and glycosylation of TSH; the latter action increases the biologic activity of TSH [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. TRH secretion is probably pulsatile, accounting for pulsatile TSH secretion. Hypothyroidism ensues when TRH is absent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7886.html" rel="external">"Disorders that cause hypothyroidism"</a>.)</p><p>The physiologic role of TRH is to determine the set-point of thyroid hormone regulation of TSH secretion. In animals or humans with hypothalamic lesions, thyroidectomy results in smaller increases in TSH secretion and less T4 and T3 is needed to inhibit TSH secretion than in normal subjects or animals.</p><p>Exogenous administration of TRH causes a dose-dependent increase in serum TSH concentrations in normal subjects. The response is increased in hypothyroid patients and decreased in hyperthyroid patients. Exogenous TRH administration also stimulates prolactin release in normal subjects and most patients with hyperprolactinemia, and it stimulates growth hormone secretion in normal older adult subjects and patients with acromegaly, chronic liver disease, and diabetes mellitus.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29"><span class="h2">Other factors altering TSH secretion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other factors that affect TSH secretion include somatostatin, dopamine, and glucocorticoids.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infusions of somatostatin and its long-acting analog <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9714" href="/d/drug information/9714.html" rel="external">octreotide</a> reduce serum TSH concentrations, but not as much as they reduce growth hormone secretion; patients receiving long-term treatment with octreotide do not become hypothyroid [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].

While increases in endogenous dopamine, somatostatin, or glucocorticoid secretion may transiently decrease TSH secretion, sustained increases in their production do not lead to sustained decreases in TSH secretion (and hypothyroidism).

TSH also stimulates intermediary metabolism and the expression of many genes in thyroid tissue, and it causes thyroid hyperplasia and hypertrophy.</p><p>The actions of TSH are initiated by its binding to specific plasma membrane receptors. The receptor is an 85-kD glycoprotein with an extracellular domain of approximately 400 amino acids, seven transmembrane domains of approximately 250 amino acids, and an intracytoplasmic domain of approximately 100 amino acids [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. The binding of TSH to its receptors activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation, which then activates several protein kinases. How these steps are linked to the specific steps of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion or to other thyroid metabolic processes is not known. TSH also stimulates phospholipase C activity in thyroid tissue, via the same receptor, thereby increasing phosphoinositide turnover, intracellular calcium ion concentrations, and protein kinase C activity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31"><span class="h2">Other thyroid-stimulating substances</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other factors that may be involved in thyroid growth (goiter formation) include insulin-like growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor.

On the other hand, type I T4-5'-deiodinase activity is increased by hyperthyroidism, glucose plus insulin, and a high caloric intake [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p>The biochemical mechanisms that might cause alterations in tissue T4-5'-deiodinase activity include alterations in substrate (T4) production, transport of T4 into cells, intracellular distribution of T4, enzyme activity or mass, and cofactor availability. The drugs that reduce T4-5'-deiodinase activity bind to the enzyme, whereas starvation may decrease hepatic T3 production by decreasing T4 uptake into the liver [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. In other situations, alterations of enzyme mass or activity are the likely cause(s) of decreased T3 production, but the specific nutritional, hormonal, or toxic factors or cytokines that cause these changes are not known.</p><p>In the laboratory rodent, the regulation of the type II T4-5'-deiodinase that predominates in brain, pituitary, and muscle is different  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58529" href="/d/graphic/58529.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Its activity is increased by thyroid deficiency, little affected by nutritional deficiency and PTU, and decreased by hyperthyroidism [<a href="#rid10">10,11,28,45,48</a>]. Changes in the type II deiodinase activity are due to ubiquitination; however, hypothalamic type II deiodinase ubiquitination appears to be largely independent of thyroid hormone deficiency or excess [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Such regulation serves to reduce the impact of systemic thyroid deficiency in these tissues by increasing the availability of T3 for maintenance of neural growth and function and pituitary function.</p><p>In humans, however, hypothyroidism did not modulate the expression of the type II T4-5'-deiodinase in skeletal muscle biopsies, suggesting there may be significant differences in physiology between rodents and humans [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. The increase in pituitary T4-5'-deiodinase activity that occurs in thyroid deficiency and the decrease that occurs in rodents with thyroid hormone excess probably do not include the thyrotrophs, because alterations in T3 production in these cells would blunt the changes in TSH secretion needed to defend against changes in thyroidal T4 and T3 secretion.</p><p>Overall, these findings indicate that the production of T3 in different tissues is regulated in different ways and that changes in thyroidal or extrathyroidal thyroid hormone production, as manifested by their circulating concentrations, are not the only and, perhaps, not the major determinants of intracellular T3 availability. Local regulation of T3 production may be particularly important in reducing the impact of thyroid deficiency in tissues such as the brain and pituitary, and this local regulation undoubtedly leads to differences in T3 content in different tissues in patients with nonthyroidal illness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3108421"><span class="h1">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thyroid hormone biosynthesis</strong>  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There are two biologically active thyroid hormones: thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66175" href="/d/graphic/66175.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).
