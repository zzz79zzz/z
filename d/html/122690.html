This is especially difficult in the esophagus and rectum because of high morbidity and mortality rates. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15075.html" rel="external">"Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation"</a>.)</p><p>In the past, these cases have been managed primarily by surgical intervention; however, the evolution of alternative therapies such as endoscopic stent placement provides a less invasive method for control. Unfortunately, these less invasive therapies do not always succeed. As a result, other minimally invasive options to control leaks and perforations have been developed. </p><p>Negative pressure wound therapy has long been a treatment of choice for complex external wounds [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. As the need for further options to control GI leaks has increased, it has been adapted for internal use. This has led to the development of endoluminal vacuum therapy (EVAC/EVT), which can be utilized to both avoid damage control surgeries as well as reduce morbidity and mortality rates. EVAC/EVT is still in its infancy, but the progress for its utilization is growing around the world. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2881.html" rel="external">"Negative pressure wound therapy"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will cover the patient selection, technique, postoperative care, and outcomes of EVAC/EVT.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3960049306"><span class="h1">DEVICE AND PLACEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>EVAC/EVT delivers negative pressure to a leak site in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through a nasogastric tube (NGT) terminating at a polyurethane sponge, termed endosponge (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef122748" href="/z/d/graphic/122748.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The endosponge has the ability to collapse the cavity and create a seal for obtaining source control. The endosponge is delivered to the leak site endoscopically and placed in one of two ways:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intracavitary</strong> – The endosponge is placed in the leak cavity, outside of the mucosa-lined space. This will maximize contact between the endosponge and surround tissues that can granulate, and in turn, maximize the benefit of the negative pressure therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intraluminal</strong> – The endosponge is placed within the GI tract on the mucosa and completely covers the leak site. The endosponge will seal off the leak by adhering to the adjacent mucosa.</p><p></p><p>In some instances, we have enlarged the opening to deliver the endosponge into the cavity. The inherent effect of the endosponge on nonepithelized tissue is where the granulation tissue arises. Intraluminal placement will only adhere the endosponge to the mucosa to obtain source control. Second intention healing does not occur at the endosponge/epithelial interface.</p><p>The pioneers of EVAC/EVT used a homemade device constructed from readily available GranuFoam dressing connected to a source of negative pressure (eg, Redovac) by an NGT. A manufactured device named endo-SPONGE is available in part of Europe [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. </p><p>EVAC/EVT should be performed by an endoscopist with extensive interventional endoscopic experience. This can be either a surgeon or gastroenterologist. One study demonstrated an average time for the procedure at 43 minutes and that proficiency for the procedure plateaued with respect to time at 10 procedures [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The same study indicated that procedures can be done in the operating room or the endoscopy suite, but the endoscopy suite cost was much lower. However, with critically ill patients, the operating venue should be chosen based on optimal patient care and safety rather than cost. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2099899963"><span class="h1">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>EVAC/EVT has multiple benefits to aid in the healing of leaks and perforations of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>First, it is able to obtain and maintain source control. Intracavitary or intraluminal placement of the endosponge at a leak site allows for collapse and containment once negative pressure is applied. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Second, adjacent tissue is pulled into the pores of the endosponge during active therapy. When the endosponge is removed, this causes debridement and eventual decontamination of the affected tissue. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lastly, use of EVAC/EVT encourages tissue reperfusion, encouraging eventual healing of a leak. Over time, the goal of therapy is for the cavity to contract and to reestablish continuity of the GI tract. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3090950146"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although in theory EVAC/EVT can be performed for any gastrointestinal (GI) leak that can be reached endoscopically barring a few technical limitations, in practice several clinical factors, as well as the experience of the provider, will determine its suitability. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H199594399"><span class="h2">Indications</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ongoing leak in the GI tract. Leaks most commonly treated with EVAC/EVT are postoperative anastomotic leaks of the esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum (eg, status post sleeve gastrectomy, esophagectomy, or low anterior resection). Leaks or perforations of other etiologies (eg, iatrogenic or Boerhaave tear) are also amenable to EVAC/EVT. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Leak site accessible by an endoscope.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For intracavitary placement of the endosponge, the leak site must be able to accommodate the bulk of the endosponge to be placed. Therefore, these sites need to be at least 1 cm in size to properly place the endosponge outside the lumen. (See <a class="local">'Step 3: Endoscopic placement of the endosponge'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3449572310"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A leak or cavity that connects to the atmosphere (eg, enterocutaneous fistula). EVAC/EVT placed for such leaks will not be able to maintain a seal, which is required for source control. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15157.html" rel="external">"Enterocutaneous and enteroatmospheric fistulas"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Visible vessel near or touching the endosponge.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient inability to return at regular intervals for endosponge exchange. (See <a class="local">'Step 5: Retrieval/exchange of the endosponge'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H471567215"><span class="h2">Patient selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical factors including the patient's clinical stability and the size, chronicity, and location of the leak have a significant impact on the success rate of EVAC/EVT. Novice providers should select patients with favorable profiles, whereas the more experienced providers may tackle increasingly challenging cases.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient clinical stability</strong> – In general, clinically unstable patients (eg, septic, hypotensive, rigid abdomen) should be treated with damage control surgery. EVAC/EVT should only be attempted in such patients by an experienced endoscopist/surgeon and/or when the patient is not a surgical candidate or refuses surgery (palliation) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Defect size</strong> – Large (&gt;3 cm) mucosal defects are challenging for EVAC/EVT because the size of endosponge that can be inserted is limited by the luminal diameter of the esophagus or anus [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. An undersized endosponge that does not occlude the defect will not achieve source control. However, an experienced endoscopist could potentially use a narrow but longer endosponge to seal off a large defect.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronicity of the leak</strong> – The success rate of EVAC/EVT decreases with increasing chronicity of the leak [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. The best result is achieved when EVAC/EVT is initiated within four to six weeks of the initial leak in the peritoneal cavity [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. We favor treating chronic leaks (&gt;90 days) surgically either immediately or after planned two-week EVAC/EVT therapy for debridement and source control [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fecal diversion for colorectal leaks</strong> – For colorectal leaks, continued passage of stool, luminal fluid, and air is a risk factor for EVAC/EVT failure by contaminating and obstructing the endosponge and disrupting the negative pressure suction in the cavity [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Although not mandatory, fecal diversion is recommended by experts [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Patients who already have fecal diversion from the initial operation are ideal candidates for EVAC/EVT if they develop a leak since EVAC/EVT can be performed without another operation. In a meta-analysis of 276 patients treated with EVAC/EVT, about a quarter required no diverting stoma, another quarter required permanent stoma, and the rest half required temporary diversion, which was subsequently reversed; 94 percent of the fecal diversions were performed during the initial operation [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Location (accessibility) of the leak</strong> - Certain small bowel leaks are inaccessible by the endoscope. Additionally, certain leak sites in the foregut and hindgut may be technically accessible but difficult to access given their positions in relation to the endoscope within the lumen of the GI tract. As an example, a leak just beyond the gastroesophageal junction on the gastric side is very difficult to access because it requires the endoscope to be in a retroflexed position for placement and removal of the endosponge. A rendezvous technique has been developed, which uses the endoscope to pull the endosponge into position via an alternate access (eg, gastrostomy tube or percutaneous drain tract) other than a natural orifice such as the mouth [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p></p><p>A nomogram has been developed to aid in patient selection for EVAC/EVT of the foregut. This nomogram was developed using four major factors that determine the successful use for endoscopic therapy in GI leaks. These include age, body mass index, prior gastric surgery, and days until leak identification. The probability of success using EVAC/EVT can help the managing clinician decide on surgical intervention, using endoscopic therapy, or potentially transferring to a center well versed in leak management [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H835191769"><span class="h1">EVAC/EVT MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3467918665"><span class="h2">Preoperative preparation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The EVAC/EVT procedure varies based on whether the leak is in the upper or lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For upper GI tract leaks, the procedure should be done under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. It is important to protect the airway given the size of the endosponge that will be passing through the oropharynx and by the larynx. Once intubation has occurred, the patient positioning is up to the endoscopist, whether supine or decubitus. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For lower GI tract leaks, anesthesia and positioning is up to the endoscopist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients undergoing EVAC/EVT are generally already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for the leak or perforation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although EVAC/EVT is an endoscopic procedure, it is usually performed under general anesthesia. As such, standard mechanical and pharmacologic venous thromboembolic prophylaxis should be provided per institutional protocols. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1339.html" rel="external">"Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in adult nonorthopedic surgical patients"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3835158205"><span class="h2">Operative technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The EVAC/EVT procedure can be divided into five steps [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1616250871"><span class="h3">Step 1: Diagnostic endoscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initially, the distance of the leak from the accessed orifice (mouth or anus) is noted to determine if the leak is amenable to endoscopic therapy. Once the leak is identified, the cavity is irrigated and debrided endoscopically as much as possible.</p><p>Next, additional features, including size of the perforation, level of contamination, and size of the cavity associated with the leak, must be noted (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef122749" href="/z/d/graphic/122749.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). This will determine the size of the endosponge and whether its placement will be intracavitary or intraluminal. We prefer to place the endosponge into the cavity (intracavitary) for better debridement. However, when the size of the perforation is &lt;1 cm, endosponges are generally placed intraluminally because the GranuFoam cannot be compressed to &lt;8 mm [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3599509908"><span class="h3">Step 2: Constructing the endosponge</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no commercially available endosponge in the United States; the endosponge needs to be created by the surgeon/endoscopist. There are several ways to create it, but most reports use a polyurethane GranuFoam provided for use externally by KCI, but not the polyvinyl WhiteFoam, which does not compress as much. The GranuFoam is cut to about 6 cm in length and no larger than 3 cm in width. The width is limited by the lumen of the GI tract (anus or upper esophageal sphincter and esophageal lumen) (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef122750" href="/z/d/graphic/122750.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). The endosponge should be tailored to the size of the cavity or leak site. In parts of Europe, there is a manufactured device available called endo-SPONGE that can be used. </p><p>The endosponge is attached to tubing to provide the negative pressure externally. This is usually a nasogastric tube (NGT) of varying size. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For upper GI leaks, the size of the endosponge plus the NGT is usually too large to pass through the nasopharynx. Thus, it is essential to place the tube through the nose and pull it through the mouth prior to attaching the endosponge to allow it to function as a normal NGT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For lower GI tract leaks, the endosponge/NGT complex can be directly inserted transanally.</p><p></p><p>The endosponge is secured to the tubing with a strong permanent suture. Keeping the endosponge attached to the tubing is extremely important both for maintaining a continuous seal and for ease of retrieval. A second suture is placed at the distal end of the endosponge to permit an endoscopic grasper to carry it through the GI tract (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef122751" href="/z/d/graphic/122751.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). This can be done with the same permanent suture and with an air knot placed through both the endosponge and the tip of the tubing for stability and strength (the NGT traverses the entire length of the endosponge in a tunnel made with scissors). </p><p>The air-sump port in the NGT must be occluded to prevent air to enter the endosponge. This can be accomplished by reversing the sump valve or simply occluding the port with tape. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1833647687"><span class="h3">Step 3: Endoscopic placement of the endosponge</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The endoscope is used to carry the endosponge through the GI tract with a rat tooth grasper placed through the working channel of the endoscope grasping the air knot suture. Once the desired location is reached (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef122752" href="/z/d/graphic/122752.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>), the suture securing the endosponge is released from the grasper under direct visualization. Negative pressure should only be applied after the endosponge has been placed at the ideal location (detailed in next step). Once the negative pressure is applied, the endoscope is removed gently. Pulling the endoscope prior to that may dislodge or displace the endosponge into the wrong location. Prior to removing the endoscope completely from the mouth, one should ascertain that there is no coiled tubing in the oropharynx. The NGT is then secured to the nose or nasal septum with a bridle or tape.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2299335254"><span class="h3">Step 4: Application of negative pressure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Since there is no specific device to provide negative pressure for EVAC/EVT, a portable device such as the KCI wound VAC system is commonly used. Adapting the tubing to the negative pressure device should be done in a closed system. No definitive recommendations have been made for pressure, but continuous pressure settings between 125 and 175 mmHg seem appropriate. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3381648873"><span class="h3">Step 5: Retrieval/exchange of the endosponge</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Like other external wound dressings, the endosponge needs to be changed frequently. The ideal interval for exchange is still a matter of ongoing research, but reports recommend somewhere between three and five days. This leaves the endosponge in place long enough to provide a reasonable interval break from procedures but short enough to prevent too much tissue ingrowth into the endosponge. </p><p>Removal of an endosponge should be done under endoscopic vision. The endoscope itself is used to dislodge the granulation tissue circumferentially at the tissue/endosponge interface. Pulling on the NGT without such a step may disconnect the NGT from the endosponge and make retrieval of the endosponge much more difficult.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2697801322"><span class="h2">Supportive care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients are usually kept in the hospital for the duration of the EVAC/EVT treatment. Routine care includes endoscopic reevaluation/endosponge change at regular intervals, ongoing nutritional support, and drainage of the peritoneal or pleural space (when necessary). Fecal diversion may be necessary to treat colorectal leaks.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3974922697"><span class="h3">Additional procedure to decontaminate peritoneal/pleural cavity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although EVAC/EVT is capable of achieving source control in most, if not all, patients, those with free perforation into the peritoneal or pleural cavity may have already incurred significant contamination of those spaces that cannot be fully debrided by EVAC/EVT alone. Such patients may require additional procedures, such as percutaneous drainage by interventional radiology, or even surgery to wash out the peritoneum or pleural space [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Such procedures can be performed before or after the initiation of EVAC/EVT at the discretion of the endoscopist/surgeon. Once source control is secured internally by EVAC/EVT, the peritoneal/pleural drains should be removed to promote healing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4184371043"><span class="h3">Nutritional support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wound healing ultimately depends on nutritional support, although the optimal approach varies between upper and lower GI tract leaks.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Upper GI leaks</strong> – Patients with upper GI tract leaks cannot tolerate oral nutrition; nutritional supplementation during EVAC/EVT therapy relies upon total <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/z/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) or tube feeds. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>TPN is favored given the patients will achieve their nutritional goals regardless of cessation to tube feeds for potentially upcoming procedures.

Gastric tube feeds can be pulled into the endosponge by the negative pressure, causing it to clog or contaminate the area. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is contraindicated in the presence of an esophageal or gastric leak, but if one is already placed, it can be converted to a feeding gastrojejunostomy and be used for distal feeding. It would be counterproductive to place a PEG/gastrostomy tube on suction while the EVAC/EVT is ongoing. Two sources of negative pressure may make it difficult for the endosponge to maintain a seal at the leak site. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower GI leaks</strong> – Patients with lower GI tract leaks can take normal oral nutrition, but the patient needs to have a diverting stoma proximal to the leak site. Luminal flow of the fecal contents will disrupt the function of the endosponge, causing it to be dislodged and malfunction. The stoma can be reversed shortly after (within one month of) healing.

EVAC/EVT delivers negative pressure to a leak site in the GI tract through a nasogastric tube (NGT) terminating at a polyurethane GranuFoam sponge, termed endosponge. The endosponge is delivered to the site of the leak endoscopically and can be placed outside (intracavitary) or inside (intraluminal) the GI lumen. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Device and placement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanism of action</strong> – EVAC/EVT promotes healing of leaks/perforations of the GI tract by maintaining source control, debriding wounds, and encouraging tissue reperfusion. (See <a class="local">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – EVAC/EVT can be used to treat any GI leak that is accessible by endoscope. Currently, EVAC/EVT is most commonly used to treat esophageal anastomotic leaks, gastric leaks after bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy), and colorectal anastomotic leaks. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> – EVAC/EVT is contraindicated when the cavity connects to the atmosphere (eg, enterocutaneous fistula), when there is visible vessel nearby, or when there is a lack of reliable follow-up. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient selection</strong> – Patients who are clinically unstable (eg, hypotensive, septic, rigid abdomen) should be treated surgically rather than with EVAC/EVT. Additionally, a defect size &gt;3 cm, a chronic leak of more than four to six weeks, absence of a proximal diverting stoma (in colorectal leaks), and certain unfavorable locations of the leak/cavity may make EVAC/EVT difficult or reduce the success rate. (See <a class="local">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Operative techniques</strong> – The steps of EVAC/EVT include diagnostic endoscopy to find the leak and note its characteristics, construction of the appropriate endosponge, endoscopic placement of the endosponge, application of negative pressure, and endosponge retrieval/exchange. (See <a class="local">'Operative technique'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We generally place an intracavitary endosponge when the defect is ≥1 cm in size and place an intraluminal endosponge when the defect is &lt;1 cm. Leaks &gt;3 cm in size are difficult to heal with EVAC/EVT, and therefore are better treated surgically. (See <a class="local">'Step 3: Endoscopic placement of the endosponge'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Supportive care</strong> – Patients are usually kept in the hospital for the duration of EVAC/EVT. Besides endoscopic reevaluation/endosponge change at regular intervals, supportive care includes ongoing nutritional support and drainage of the peritoneal or pleural space (when necessary). Fecal diversion may be necessary for a colorectal leak. (See <a class="local">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Termination of EVAC/EVT</strong> – EVAC/EVT therapy is usually terminated when the cavity size can no longer be reduced or is too small to accommodate an endosponge. Early surgical closure of the defect is possible for colorectal leaks. Failure of EVAC/EVT may prompt surgical intervention. (See <a class="local">'Termination of EVAC/EVT therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Outcomes</strong> – EVAC/EVT has been associated with lower mortality, complication, and stricture rate compared with endoscopic stenting in retrospective studies. Nevertheless, various techniques may be used in tandem, rather than in isolation, to heal GI leaks and limit potential complications. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Argenta LC, Morykwas MJ.
