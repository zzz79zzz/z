         Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most common treatable causes of intellectual disability. Screening programs have been established in most developed countries to detect and treat this disorder, which affects approximately 1 in 2000 to 1 in 4000 newborns [

         The treatment and neurocognitive outcome of congenital hypothyroidism will be reviewed here. The clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism are reviewed separately. (See

         Delays in diagnosis and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism will result in impaired neurocognitive outcome, as measured by intelligence quotient (IQ). Even after diagnosis, IQ and neurologic development may suffer if the infant has suboptimal management during the first two to three years of life, a time when thyroid hormone is critical for normal brain development. Thus, appropriate initial therapy and follow-up are essential to ensure optimal dosing of thyroid hormone, with monitoring and dose adjustments and support for the family to encourage close adherence to treatment [

         is the treatment of choice. Although triiodothyronine (T3) is the biologically active thyroid hormone, the majority of brain T3 is derived from local deiodination of thyroxine (T4); thus, in most cases, it is not necessary to use T3.

         Both the timing and dose of thyroid hormone replacement are important [

         To correct hypothyroxinemia as rapidly as possible, treatment should be initiated for any infant with a clearly positive screening test as soon as confirmatory blood samples have been drawn, pending results. In cases in which screening tests are borderline (eg, thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] &lt;40 mIU/L in serum units or 20 mIU/L in whole blood units), a treatment decision can be postponed until after results of the confirmatory tests return [

         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7

         ]. This usually amounts to giving 37.5 or 50 mcg/day since these doses can be readily prepared from the available levothyroxine tablets (25 or 50 mcg). Liquid levothyroxine formulations are another treatment option [
         <a href="#rid5">

         tablets have been used successfully to treat infants with congenital hypothyroidism for decades. The tablet strengths most commonly used in infants are 25, 37.5, and 50 mcg. The tablet should be crushed and mixed with a small amount of breast milk, formula (except soy-based formula), or water and fed to the infant. A medication syringe can be used to administer the medication; it should not be added to a bottle of breast milk or formula.

         </a>
         are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for children of any age. They are available as multidose ampules or dose selected by syringe volume, administered orally. However, there is limited experience with the use of liquid preparations to treat infants with congenital hypothyroidism and dosing may not be equivalent to dosing with tablets [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,13,14

         is somewhat reduced by administration with food and formula. However, requiring that the medication be given separately from meals may be difficult for the family and reduce compliance [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Thus, instead of requiring that it be administered on an empty stomach, we ask the family to be consistent in how they administer the medication, in both time of day and with or without food [

          5

         For serum fT4, the target varies with the assay method used in the testing laboratory. For example, if the reference range for a specific fT4 assay method is 0.8 to 2.3 ng/dL (10.3 to 30.0 pmol/L), the aim of treatment would be to keep the serum fT4 between 1.4 and 2.3 ng/dL (18 to 30 pmol/L).

         – Target is serum TSH in the reference range (ie, 0.5 to 5.0 mU/L) and, optimally, the lower end of this range (ie, 0.5 to 2.0 mU/L). For infants with congenital central hypothyroidism, serum free T4 should be used to guide treatment because measurement of serum TSH is not helpful.

         These fT4 and TSH target ranges are based primarily on expert opinion and rationale because clinical trial evidence to support them is lacking.

         The serum fT4 (or T4) concentration typically reaches the target range within one to two weeks after initiating

         therapy. Serum TSH may take two to four weeks to reach the target range, depending on the degree of elevation prior to treatment. However, despite what appears to be a normal levothyroxine dose, some infants with congenital hypothyroidism will manifest persistent mild serum TSH elevations (5 to 20 mU/L) despite serum fT4 (or T4) values in the target range [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. This appears to be the result of transient mild thyroid hormone resistance, due to resetting of the pituitary-thyroid feedback threshold because of intrauterine hypothyroidism. In a study of 42 patients with congenital hypothyroidism, this thyroid hormone resistance was more common in infants (less than one year of age) than in older children (43 versus 10 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. These data suggest that the thyroid hormone resistance improves with age but can persist. In such cases, if the levothyroxine dose is increased to lower serum TSH into the normal range, the infants may manifest clinical features of overtreatment. Thus, in these cases, we recommend using serum fT4 (or T4) as the primary test to adjust levothyroxine dosing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prolonged overtreatment (&gt;3 months) should be avoided because it can lead to complications. Persistently high serum fT4 or T4 concentrations for age (especially if the fT4 is above 2.4 ng/dL [30.5 pmol/L] or T4 is above 16 mcg/dL [206 nmol/L]), combined with suppressed TSH concentrations (&lt;0.5 mU/L), may adversely affect the tempo of brain development [

         In the first few decades following initiation of newborn screening, approximately 90 percent of cases had permanent congenital hypothyroidism requiring lifelong treatment. Beginning around the year 2000, the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism increased from 1:4000 to 1:2000; this increase was due to detection of milder cases of hypothyroidism, including cases in preterm or low birth weight infants with delayed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) elevation, in which the hypothyroidism is often transient. With the detection of these milder cases, follow-up studies showed that approximately 70 percent were permanent, while 30 percent had a transient form of hypothyroidism [

         Thyroid dysgenesis or a confirmed defect in thyroid hormone biosynthesis or secretion (dyshormonogenesis) – Thyroid dysgenesis is likely if ultrasonography shows absent thyroid tissue or an ectopic gland or if a scan shows an ectopic gland. If an initial radionuclide scan shows absence of thyroid tissue, this should be confirmed by ultrasonography because a scan can appear to show aplasia in infants with TSH receptor-blocking antibodies, a transient form of hypothyroidism. These tests are considered optional at initial diagnosis because in most cases, the results are not required for management decisions. Some clinicians elect to perform these studies after age three years in cases where permanent hypothyroidism has not been established. In a report of 33 children with congenital hypothyroidism who underwent reevaluation at age three years, 27 percent had an absent or ectopic thyroid, 36 percent had dyshormonogenesis, and 36 percent had transient hypothyroidism [

         Several programs, primarily in North America, Europe, and Australia, have reported long-term follow-up of infants detected through newborn screening. In general, these infants grow and develop normally. The psychometric outcome is much improved over the prescreening era, but some infants with severe hypothyroidism or those who are inadequately treated in the first two or three years of life have intelligence quotients (IQs) below those of normal children.

          Primary hypothyroidism
         </strong>
         – The long-term neurodevelopmental and functional outcome of individuals with congenital hypothyroidism is generally good for infants who are treated early (beginning at two to six weeks of life) and optimally through the first three years of life; their global IQs are similar to those of normal infants [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41-44
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a long-term observational study of 76 patients with congenital hypothyroidism reported that IQ scores were no different from those of sibling controls [

         dosing during infancy and the first few years of life adversely affects neurocognitive outcomes. In one study, infants who were inadequately treated in the first three years of life (estimated levothyroxine dose &lt;5 mcg/kg/day) had worse cognitive outcomes compared with the larger, adequately treated group (mean IQ score 87 versus 105) [

         Noncompliance can also affect cognitive performance in older children and adolescents, but, in these age groups, the deficit may be reversible. This was shown in a study of 14-year-old adolescents with congenital hypothyroidism who had thyroid function testing without forewarning at home visits [

          47

The results showed that 44 percent of these patients were poorly controlled (serum thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] concentration &gt;15 mU/L), and the majority had low serum thyroxine (T4) concentrations (&lt;6.6 mcg/dL [86 nmol/L]). Cognitive tests were normal and similar to those with better controlled hypothyroidism but still improved one year later after compliance was stressed and serum thyroid hormone concentrations normalized, with an increase in mean IQ score from 106 to 112.

         </a>
         ]. In a literature review of 30 studies comparing psychometric outcome in infants with more severe versus moderate or mild congenital hypothyroidism, nine studies reported no difference in IQ, while 21 studies reported a 5.5 to 23 point decrease in IQ in the more severely affected infants [

Hearing loss was seen more frequently in patients with athyreosis and a gland in situ (suggesting a link to dyshormonogenesis, such as Pendred syndrome) but not in patients with an ectopic gland. The hearing loss was sensorineural and associated with disease severity at the time of diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism (as measured by bone maturation delay at the time of the neonatal diagnosis); a hearing aid was required in 17 percent of affected patients [

         A national population-based study from France reported a slightly higher all-cause mortality (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 1.24) in patients with congenital hypothyroidism diagnosed in the first decade of newborn screening [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. SMR was highest for diseases of the central nervous system (SMR 5.22) and congenital malformations (SMR 3.15). In addition, the risk of developing an associated chronic disease was twice as high as the reference population. Thus, the increased mortality may be related to comorbidities associated with hypothyroidism, including congenital neurologic abnormalities or other malformations, and possibly mental illness.

          When to initiate treatment
         </strong>
         – Prompt identification and treatment of infants with congenital hypothyroidism is essential to assure normal growth and neurodevelopmental outcome. For infants with a clearly positive screening test, treatment should be initiated as soon as confirmatory serum samples for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) measurements have been drawn, rather than waiting until the diagnosis is confirmed. In cases in which screening tests are borderline, a treatment decision can be deferred until after results of the confirmatory serum tests become available. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment'

         – All infants with suspected congenital hypothyroidism should be treated with

          levothyroxine
         </a>
         by mouth. We suggest starting at a dose of 10 to 15 mcg/kg/day (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B

         For neonates with more severe hypothyroidism, we use initial doses at the upper end of this range (ie,

         </a>
         12.5 to 15 mcg/kg/day). Rapid correction of thyroid dysfunction is particularly important in infants with severe hypothyroidism to prevent neurodevelopmental deficits. Severe hypothyroidism is suggested by markedly abnormal pretreatment thyroid test results, eg, serum total T4 &lt;5 mcg/dL (&lt;65 nmol/L) or fT4 &lt;0.4 ng/dL (&lt;5 pmol/L). (See

          Monitoring and dose adjustment
         </strong>
         – For infants and young children with primary hypothyroidism, the aim of treatment is to keep the serum fT4 (or T4) concentration in the upper one-half of the pediatric reference range and serum TSH in the reference range for age. Monitoring is important to avoid prolonged under- or overtreatment. Target values during the first three years of life are (see
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment goals'

         Serum fT4 – Target varies with the assay method; for example, if the reference range is 0.8 to 2.3 ng/dL, aim for 1.4 to 2.3 ng/dL (18 to 30 pmol/L)

          Interpretation of disparate results
         </strong>
         – Some children with primary hypothyroidism have disparate results for TSH and fT4, requiring further considerations. Two patterns and possible explanations are outlined in the table (

         <strong>
          Congenital central hypothyroidism
         </strong>
         – For children with central hypothyroidism, serum fT4 should be used to guide treatment, because measurement of serum TSH is not helpful. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment goals'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Assessment of permanent versus transient hypothyroidism
         </strong>
         – Up to 30 percent of children with congenital hypothyroidism have a transient form and will regain normal endogenous thyroid function during early life. Therefore, in those cases where permanent congenital hypothyroidism has not been established, thyroid function should be reevaluated around three years of age to determine whether the hypothyroidism is permanent or transient (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140342" href="/z/d/graphic/140342.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). In most cases, this is done by discontinuing therapy for 30 days and then measuring serum TSH and fT4. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessment of permanent versus transient hypothyroidism'
         </a>
         above.)

          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – For infants with congenital hypothyroidism who are treated early (beginning between two and six weeks of life) and appropriately treated throughout the first three years of life, the prognosis for neurocognitive and physical development is good. The prognosis worsens for infants who are detected later in life, have more severe hypothyroidism, and/or receive inadequate doses of
