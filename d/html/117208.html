         Thrombocytopenia may increase bleeding risk, but it does not protect against venous thromboembolism (VTE) or stroke. Thus, caring for patients with both thrombocytopenia and an indication for anticoagulation (eg, VTE prophylaxis or treatment, stroke prophylaxis or treatment) can be challenging. Evidence to guide appropriate therapy in this setting is very limited.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses our approach to the use of anticoagulation in an individual with thrombocytopenia, including decisions about the need for anticoagulation, anticoagulant dosing, therapies to raise the platelet count, and alternatives to anticoagulation if the bleeding risk is thought to be too high.

         Decisions about whether to use anticoagulation in patients with thrombocytopenia must balance the risks of thrombosis and thrombosis progression with the risks of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia as well as due to other bleeding risk factors. Estimates of bleeding and thrombosis incidence in thrombocytopenic patients have been reported in some settings [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. However, these data have limitations and may not be available for specific scenarios.

         There is no anticoagulant that can reduce thrombotic risk without also increasing bleeding risk
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The expected duration of these risks may also factor into decision-making, along with the patient's values and preferences around which risks they feel most strongly about avoiding. The treatment plan should be reassessed based upon the actual and anticipated trajectory of the platelet counts, since thrombocytopenia may be dynamic, especially in the context of myelosuppressive cancer treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the decision to use anticoagulation has been made, the choice of anticoagulant is based on the underlying indication and other patient factors. The choice of anticoagulant and risk of bleeding with different anticoagulants is discussed separately in topics on specific indications.

         General information is presented in the following sections. Guidelines on venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation in the setting of thrombocytopenia are available from the International Society on Haemostasis and Thrombosis and the European Hematology Association [

         The presence of one or more bleeding risk factors increases concerns about bleeding that may be exacerbated by the use of an anticoagulant. Some risk factors are known from the general population, while others have been assessed in patients with thrombocytopenia with or without anticoagulation [

          Recent major bleeding
         </strong>
         – Bleeding risk is probably greatest in individuals who have already had a clinically serious bleed, especially if the bleeding occurred at a platelet count &gt;50,000/microL and if the source of bleeding has not been treated.

          Platelet count &lt;50,000/microL
         </strong>
         – It is generally accepted that bleeding risk is higher in individuals with platelet counts &lt;50,000/microL, and that severe spontaneous bleeding is most likely with platelet counts &lt;10,000/microL, especially if due to an underlying bone marrow disorder rather than due to immune destruction of platelets. However, there is not a good linear correlation between the platelet count and the risk of serious bleeding in thrombocytopenic individuals. Studies have shown that the bleeding risk increases even with mild thrombocytopenia receiving anticoagulation for VTE or atrial fibrillation (&lt;100,000/microL) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Whether this finding reflects an actual bleeding risk with platelet counts of 50,000 to 100,000/microL, an underlying disease state, or a marker of subsequent (possibly undocumented) platelet counts &lt;50,000/microL remains to be determined. (See

         For individuals with VTE or atrial fibrillation who do not have one of these increased bleeding risk factors, anticoagulation can generally be given if the platelet count is ≥50,000/microL. If the platelet count is &lt;50,000/microL, decision-making is individualized and takes into account the likelihood of VTE progression or stroke, the anticipated duration and trajectory of thrombocytopenia, and the available options for increasing the platelet count, which depend on the reason for the thrombocytopenia, as discussed below and in related topic reviews.

         For individuals with VTE who have an increased risk of bleeding, there are a number of options for preventing VTE progression or recurrence. This includes the use of lower-dose anticoagulation (either prophylactic dose or reducing the dose by one-half), temporarily holding the anticoagulant (especially if bleeding risk factors are transient), placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter (primarily when anticoagulation is held in the setting of acute pulmonary embolism [PE] or proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis [DVT]), and removal of the central venous catheter (in case of symptomatic catheter related VTE, when anticoagulation is held).
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, addition of antiplatelet agents to anticoagulation is avoided when platelet counts are &lt;50,000/microL, unless there is a very strong indication such as an intracoronary stent in the past 12 months, in which case anticoagulation dose reduction may be considered. Decisions of which of these options to use are highly patient-dependent.

         For stroke prevention, decision-making is individualized according to several risk factors, as discussed in separate topic reviews. It is worth noting that cancer patients, who have a high prevalence of thrombocytopenia, also have an increased stroke risk relative to patients without cancer if they have atrial fibrillation [

         The risk of VTE is greatest in the setting of a strongly prothrombotic risk factor, such as orthopedic or major abdominal surgery, certain cancers, active chemotherapy, and certain particularly prothrombotic disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) (unless receiving anti-complement therapy), or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

         The risk of VTE progression (or recurrence) is greatest in the initial 30 days after the acute VTE event. Thus, after 30 days, thrombotic risk is expected to decrease, and these individuals are treated as low to intermediate thrombotic risk, depending on other risk factors. Other risk factors for VTE progression are related to the thromboembolism size (eg, single subsegmental versus lobar pulmonary embolism) and location (eg, upper extremity versus low extremity deep vein thrombosis), and whether the risk factor(s) for VTE were transient (eg, surgery) or persistent (eg, metastatic cancer), or whether the VTE was unprovoked.
        </p>
        <p>
         For individuals with cancer, the presence of active cancer or chemotherapy and lower performance status are strong risk factors for VTE progression.

         The risk of arterial thrombosis is highly dependent on the patient's underlying condition, as discussed in separate topic reviews and in the sections below. (See

          'Atrial fibrillation'

        <p>
         Similar to VTE risk, thrombocytopenia does not protect against arterial thrombosis in the general population and in specific pro-thrombotic settings such as cancer or immune thrombocytopenia. This is exemplified by a series of individuals with a number of underlying risk factors such as atrial fibrillation or antiphospholipid syndrome who had immune thrombocytopenia [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. There were several instances in which discontinuation of anticoagulation for thrombocytopenia, even temporarily, was associated with thrombosis; in some cases, the thromboses were fatal.

         Platelet transfusions can be administered on an inpatient or outpatient basis to raise the platelet count and allow anticoagulation. When used to facilitate therapeutic anticoagulation, we favor a target platelet count of 50,000/microL. The frequency of platelet administration varies by patient and clinical scenario and is determined by monitoring the platelet count. This strategy is usually used for a period of days to weeks, until the acutely high thrombotic risk (or the thrombocytopenia) subsides.

         Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs; also called TPO-mimetics) are not optimal candidates to raise the platelet count to allow anticoagulation for acute VTE, since their effect is not immediate and adequate platelet response may take days to weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, there is some concern regarding increased risk of thrombosis with TPO-RAs; one of the TPO-RAs,

         , has been associated with an increased risk of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis, while there are conflicting data regarding thrombotic risk with TPO-RAs in patients with immune thrombocytopenia, and this remains an area of active research and debate [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The main consideration is whether there is evidence showing that TPO-RAs improve platelet counts in the specific setting leading to thrombocytopenia. TPO-RAs are approved for individuals with liver disease undergoing procedures and in patients with immune thrombocytopenia. There are some data showing that specific TPO-RA agents may improve platelet counts in patients with persistent chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in order to enable continued administration of the culprit chemotherapeutic agent [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, there is little published information on the usefulness of TPO-RAs to facilitate the administration of anticoagulation, and we do not routinely use these agents as a means of facilitating anticoagulation outside accepted indications such as immune thrombocytopenia. (See

         In patients with immune thrombocytopenia and a strong indication for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, it may be appropriate to start or change immune thrombocytopenia-directed therapy at a higher platelet count (eg, 50,000/microL) than would be used in patients without additional bleeding risk factors, for whom immune thrombocytopenia-specific therapy is generally initiated at a platelet count of 20,000 to 30,000/microL.

        </p>
        <p>
         It is also worthwhile to confirm that the cause of the thrombocytopenia has been correctly attributed and there are no other interventions available that might improve the platelet count. There are numerous potential causes of thrombocytopenia including drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, infection, and vitamin B12 deficiency that may be contributing to a low platelet count. In a series of 101 individuals with multiple myeloma undergoing hematopoietic stem cell collection, the incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was higher than expected at 4 percent [

          Bleeding

         – The risk of bleeding in individuals with malignancy is higher than in the general population, and this extends to anticoagulation-associated bleeding. This is due to many factors, and the contribution of thrombocytopenia to bleeding risk is likely to be greatest when it is due to bone marrow suppression, as opposed to other causes such as hypersplenism or drug-induced immune platelet destruction.

         Anticoagulation is generally well tolerated, and mortality from VTE may be greater than mortality from bleeding in most cancer populations. As an example, in data derived from the RIETE registry (a large Spanish registry that included over 40,000 patients with VTE), the rate of fatal PE in patients with VTE and a platelet count &lt;80,000/microL was 3.6 percent, compared with a rate of fatal hemorrhage of 2.0 percent [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         Exceptions to the greater risk of mortality from thrombosis than bleeding include hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, for whom bleeding (including fatal bleeding) was more common than VTE; individuals with brain tumors who have an increased bleeding risk; and catheter-associated VTE, which may be treated locally (eg, with catheter removal).

         For most individuals with cancer-associated VTE and platelet counts between 25,000 and 50,000/microL, we suggest anticoagulation. The lower threshold is an approximation, not an absolute cutoff. This practice is based on evidence from observational studies, as described below. (See

         The dose of the anticoagulant (full therapeutic dose versus half-dose or prophylactic dose) is initially stratified by the presence or absence of bleeding risk factors other than thrombocytopenia, and the thrombotic risk.

         In the absence of randomized trial data, there is true equipoise regarding optimal anticoagulation in patients with an acute VTE in the setting of concurrent thrombocytopenia. In a prospective, observational study of 121 patients with different cancer types, acute VTE and platelet counts &lt;100,000/microL, 62 percent received full-dose anticoagulation and 27 percent received modified-dose anticoagulation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. At 60 days, the cumulative incidence of major hemorrhage was 12.8 percent in the group receiving full-dose anticoagulation and 6.6 percent in the group that received modified-dose anticoagulation. The cumulative incidence of recurrent VTE at 60 days was 5.6 percent in the full-dose and 0 percent in the modified-dose anticoagulation groups. A small number of patients with acute PE were included in the modified-dose cohort.

          Higher risk for VTE progression or recurrence

         – A higher risk for VTE progression or recurrence is suggested by an acute presentation (new VTE within the prior 30 days) and a proximal symptomatic lower extremity DVT or segmental or more central PE. For these individuals, we make an effort to treat with full-dose anticoagulation with platelet transfusion support (typically, platelet transfusions to raise the platelet count to ≥50,000/microL), especially in the presence of another thromboembolic risk factor. If the platelet count is low due to immune thrombocytopenia or certain other conditions, there may be other means of increasing the platelet count. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Platelet count support'

         The rationale is that these individuals are more likely to have an adverse outcome related to thrombosis rather than bleeding, provided the platelet count can be consistently raised above 50,000/microL. However, this decision tree does not take the place of clinical judgment for the individual patient.

          If the platelet count cannot be consistently raised above 50,000/microL
         </strong>
         , or if the individual places an especially high value on avoiding full-dose anticoagulation and/or avoiding platelet transfusions (eg, due to a previous adverse reaction or alloimmunization), it may be appropriate to use another approach such as reduced-dose anticoagulation or temporarily holding anticoagulation, perhaps with the use of an IVC filter.

We generally try to administer some anticoagulation, even at reduced doses whenever possible.

         The rationale is that in these individuals, the lack of the strongest risk factors for VTE progression or recurrence results in a shift of the balance towards a slightly greater concern about bleeding, and thus we do not use full-dose anticoagulation. At the same time, the risk for VTE progression or recurrence is still increased, and thus we still favor anticoagulation at a lower dose if possible. Some individuals who place a higher value on avoiding complications related to VTE progression or recurrence may choose full-dose (therapeutic-dose) anticoagulation with platelet support, and those who place a higher value on avoiding bleeding may choose to hold anticoagulation temporarily.

          Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
         </strong>
         – In individuals undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially allogeneic, the risk of serious bleeding appears to be higher than the risk of serious complications from VTE. Thus, for individuals undergoing allogeneic transplantation who develop a VTE while thrombocytopenic, we favor dose-modified anticoagulation rather than therapeutic anticoagulation with aggressive platelet transfusion support.

         This approach is supported by a retrospective cohort study of 250 patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation and 221 patients undergoing autologous transplantation, which demonstrated that continuing anticoagulant therapy (versus temporarily holding it) appeared to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding but was not associated with lower VTE risk within the first 30 days after transplantation [
         <a href="#rid25">

         ]. In a subgroup of 250 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients at both intermediate and high risk of VTE, anticoagulation resumption upon platelet engraftment was associated with a lower risk of recurrent VTE up to 100 days (odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% CI 0.20-1.14). This emphasizes the importance of reinstating anticoagulation after platelet recovery (&gt;50,000/microL for full-dose anticoagulation and &gt;25,000/microL for reduced dose), if the initial indication still exists.

In a multivariate analysis, the features most predictive for VTE were prior VTE (odds ratio [OR] 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.6) and graft-versus-host disease (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-4.0).

         The following studies illustrate some of the larger studies that have reported on outcomes of anticoagulation with different management strategies in patients who have cancer and thrombocytopenia.

Only 22 percent of the thrombocytopenic patients in this study had cancer. A small retrospective study of patients with atrial fibrillation, leukemia, and platelet counts &lt;50,000/microL demonstrated a similar risk-benefit ratio [

         There is no strong evidence that reduced-dose anticoagulation prevents stroke in atrial fibrillation patients with thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the decision should generally be between continuing anticoagulation or holding anticoagulation temporarily or permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
         The anticipated duration of thrombocytopenia is an important consideration, since a thrombocytopenia duration of days to weeks may carry a low absolute risk of arterial thrombosis and support temporary holding of anticoagulation. Due to the high bleeding risk, the thrombotic risk should be high enough to justify the increased bleeding risk with anticoagulation, such as with recent stroke or high CHA

         The antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis and/or adverse pregnancy outcomes in the presence of persistent autoantibodies directed against phospholipid-binding proteins. It can occur as an isolated syndrome or in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus or another autoimmune disorder. The antiphospholipid antibodies may artificially prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time or, less commonly, the prothrombin time, but in vivo they promote thrombosis. (See

        <p>
         Thrombocytopenia is common in individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome, which may be isolated or associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (eg, as a form of secondary immune thrombocytopenia), with a prevalence of approximately 20 to 40 percent in some series. Typically, the thrombocytopenia is mild (platelet counts 100,000 to 149,000/microL), although more severe thrombocytopenia is seen in some individuals, especially those with systemic lupus erythematosus and/or immune thrombocytopenia.

         Thrombocytopenia is not protective against cardiovascular or VTE events related to antiphospholipid syndrome. Our approach in individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome and concurrent immune thrombocytopenia is to administer immune thrombocytopenia-directed therapies to rapidly raise the platelet count above 50,000/microL to facilitate therapeutic anticoagulation. This may include the use of intravenous

         ), and/or a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA). While these therapies may carry an increased risk of thrombosis, they would be administered to enable anticoagulation, which should be initiated at an appropriate dose according to platelet counts. (See

         Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired abnormality characterized by expansion of an abnormal clone of hematopoietic cells lacking a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, which leads to hemolysis and thrombosis. The mechanism of thrombosis is incompletely understood and probably involves release of free hemoglobin, nitric oxide scavenging, vasoconstriction, and endothelial cell activation. Many individuals with PNH also have aplastic anemia, which can result in severe thrombocytopenia. (See

         Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is an adverse drug reaction to heparin in which antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) in a complex with heparin lead to thrombocytopenia and a dramatically increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis. Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia involves scrupulous avoidance of all heparin-containing products and anticoagulation with a non-heparin anticoagulant. Typically, thrombocytopenia is moderate (eg, mean nadir platelet count approximately 60,000/microL) and resolves rapidly when heparin is discontinued, although some individuals may have more prolonged thrombocytopenia.

         – Decisions about anticoagulation in patients with thrombocytopenia must balance the risks of thrombosis and thrombosis progression with the risks of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia as well as other bleeding risk factors. Risk factors for bleeding (other than thrombocytopenia) and thrombosis are listed above, along with other factors that may contribute to decision-making. (See

          Prophylaxis

          Higher risk of VTE progression/recurrence

         – Full (therapeutic)-dose anticoagulation with platelet support (eg, platelet transfusions to raise the platelet count above 50,000/microL). For most individuals with a high risk of VTE progression or recurrence (ie, acute symptomatic proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism that is segmental or more proximal) who do not have additional bleeding risk factors other than thrombocytopenia, we suggest this approach (

Other options include prophylactic-dose anticoagulation or temporarily holding anticoagulation, possibly with removal of the central venous catheter in case of catheter-related DVT. For most individuals with a low risk for VTE progression and/or those with one or more additional bleeding risk factors besides thrombocytopenia, we suggest one of these approaches (
