Guidelines regarding appropriate levels of weight gain in pregnancy based on prepregnancy BMI have been promoted worldwide [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Although the importance of both appropriate prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain are well established, many individuals begin pregnancy overweight and many gain too much weight during pregnancy [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. Inadequate prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain can also have adverse effects on pregnancy, most importantly birth of a small for gestational age neonate. </p><p>This topic will discuss issues relating to gestational weight gain (positive or negative) in pregnancy. Detailed discussions of obstetric issues in pregnant people with obesity or an eating disorder can be found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/433.html" rel="external">"Obesity in pregnancy: Complications and maternal management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4852.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders in pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PHYSIOLOGIC WEIGHT GAIN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>On average, physiologic weight gain at term is distributed as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fetus – 7 to 8 lb (3.2 to 3.6 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fat stores – 6 to 8 lb (2.7 to 3.6 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased blood volume – 3 to 4 lb (1.4 to 1.8 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased extravascular fluid volume – 2 to 3 lb (0.9 to 1.4 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Amniotic fluid – 2 lb (0.9 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Breast enlargement – 1 to 3 lb (0.45 to 1.4 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Uterine hypertrophy – 2 lb (0.9 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Placenta – 1.5 lb (0.7 kg)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3953029300"><span class="h1">DOCUMENTATION OF TOTAL GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gestational weight gain is the weight gained during pregnancy, which is rarely measurable with precision. The starting weight is often considered the weight documented at the first prenatal visit, but a self-reported or documented periconceptional weight may be used, especially if prenatal care is initiated after the first trimester [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The ending weight is often considered the weight recorded at the last prenatal office visit, which is typically within a few days of birth in late pregnancy but may be two to four weeks before a preterm birth. Weighing the patient on the labor and delivery unit may be an option when an accurate rate is clinically important.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3633731244"><span class="h2">Background</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In 1987, the Committee on Nutritional Status During Pregnancy and Lactation of the Institute of Medicine (IOM, now National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NAM]) made a detailed analysis of all published data pertaining to prepregnancy weight, weight gain during pregnancy, and pregnancy outcome and, based on this analysis, formulated recommendations for healthy gestational weight gain in 1990 [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. These recommendations were an attempt to increase the likelihood of a favorable pregnancy outcome, which was defined as birth of a term live-born neonate with a birth weight between 3000 and 4000 grams.</p><p>The IOM concluded that prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) was an important predictor of birth weight, independent of maternal weight gain, and that prepregnancy BMI should be used to guide recommendations for gestational weight gain. Thus, determining BMI became an integral part of the physical examination of pregnant people. </p><p>The IOM initially focused on low birth weight, assuming that increasing maternal weight gain among underweight pregnant people would reduce the rate of low birth weight and its associated perinatal morbidity and mortality, without adversely affecting other obstetric outcomes. In the absence of definitive data, 1990 IOM guidelines recommended what the authors considered an optimum weight gain for pregnant people with a normal BMI (25 to 35 lb [11 to 16 kg]), with lower weight gain for those beginning pregnancy at higher BMIs (with no upper limit) and higher weight gain for those beginning pregnancy at lower BMIs. The studies on which the 1990 recommendations were based were generally not of high quality; thus, more research was needed to validate or modify these guidelines. </p><p>In 2009, the IOM modified the 1990 guidelines based on findings from research performed over almost two decades following their initial recommendations. The updated <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fnationalacademies.org%2Fhmd%2Freports%2F2009%2Fweight-gain-during-pregnancy-reexamining-the-guidelines.aspx&amp;token=K%2BOnURurzcrlP9twXanmxUdvKN8MFUFDU0C8R3j5BtL8C2h7d8fo%2FkVjX%2FiX8oWqt8Lc7DTcc3wlMYj7Rk6KD%2BDErzsZ8NmVqRmYaj8OuoYfWMGlHk8fFLcWQZvtOBOe&amp;TOPIC_ID=441" target="_blank">IOM guidelines</a> included recommendations for gestational weight gain in twin pregnancy, changes to the recommendations for pregnant people with obesity, and a recommendation that all females strive to be within the normal BMI range when they conceive [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria using BMI for defining weight categories were adopted in the revision, as well. The updated recommendations were still based on observational data, and focused on some but not all relevant clinical outcomes. While robust data were available for SGA and LGA births, cesarean birth, and postpartum weight retention, available data for gestational diabetes and preeclampsia risk were not considered adequately robust to be included. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1230637565"><span class="h2">2009 IOM weight gain recommendations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following recommendations are for the general obstetric population in the United States and are independent of age, parity, smoking history, race, and ethnic background because the relationship between weight gain and pregnancy outcome has not been evaluated extensively in subpopulations of pregnant people, and further study is needed. For example, adolescents may benefit from higher weight gain [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], and studies have suggested that pregnant people with class II or III obesity may benefit from lower weight gain target ranges than those with class I obesity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97661" href="/d/graphic/97661.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>].</p><p>IOM recommendations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Singleton pregnancy</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (underweight) – Weight gain 28 to 40 lb (12.5 to 18.0 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (normal weight) – Weight gain 25 to 35 lb (11.5 to 16.0 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight) – Weight gain 15 to 25 lb (7.0 to 11.5 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>BMI ≥30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese) – Weight gain 11 to 20 lb (5 to 9.0 kg)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Twin pregnancy</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (underweight) – No recommendation due to insufficient data</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (normal weight) – Weight gain 37 to 54 lb (16.8 to 24.5 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight) – Weight gain 31 to 50 lb (14.1 to 22.7 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>BMI ≥30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese) – Weight gain 25 to 42 lb (11.4 to 19.1 kg)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The recommendations in twin pregnancies were considered provisional because of the lack of data about the consequences of gestational weight gain on longer-term health outcomes. There were insufficient data on which to base recommendations for weight gain in triplet and higher-order multiple gestations or for the three classes of obesity.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2345208278"><span class="h3">Subsequent data that may inform guidance for gestational weight gain</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91904133"><span class="h4">LifeCycle Project weight gain recommendations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In 2019, the LifeCycle Project-Maternal Obesity and Childhood Outcomes Study Group performed an individual participant-level meta-analysis using data from over 196,000 singleton pregnancies within 25 cohort studies from Europe and North America that addressed relationships between gestational weight gain and clinical outcomes [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In this study, the total gestational weight gain ranges associated with lower risks for adverse outcomes (preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, cesarean birth, preterm birth, small or large size for gestational age at birth) are shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127435" href="/d/graphic/127435.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The larger maximum weight gain in class III versus class II obesity likely reflects the relatively small number of individuals in these categories and the lack of statistical power to achieve more precise ranges.</p><p>The 2009 IOM guidelines were written in the absence of adequate published data to allow evaluation of relationships between gestational weight gain and preeclampsia or gestational diabetes and did not provide recommendations for pregnant people with different degrees of obesity (classes I, II, III). The LifeCycle study addressed these omissions and has the added strength of utilizing pooled individual patient data from many countries.</p><p>A key finding of the analysis was that prepregnancy BMI was more strongly associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes than gestational weight gain. In particular, for almost all gestational weight gains, pregnant people with class III obesity had a greater overall risk for any adverse outcome than those with class II obesity, and those with class II obesity had a greater overall risk for any adverse outcome than those with class I obesity (eg, for weight gain ≥16 kg, the overall risks for any adverse outcome for pregnant people with class III, class II, and class I obesity were 79, 64, and 43 to 56 percent, respectively).</p><p>Although ranges of gestational weight gain associated with optimal outcomes in each obesity category were developed, the predictive power of gestational weight gain for the different adverse pregnancy outcomes was either low or moderate. These findings challenge the clinical usefulness of the ranges and suggest that prepregnancy BMI, particularly prepregnancy obesity, is a more important target for intervention than gestational weight gain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H189962242"><span class="h4">US population data 2011 to 2015</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A retrospective cohort study including nearly 16 million mother-infant dyads linked birth and infant death data in the United States between 2011 and 2015 to assess the association between gestational weight gain (standardized to 40 weeks) and the outcome "serious infant morbidity (assisted ventilation, newborn intensive care unit [NICU] admission, surfactant therapy, antibiotic therapy, seizures) and mortality" [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. As in other large studies, pregnant people in the normal weight BMI class had the lowest rates of infant morbidity and mortality (8 and 0.28 percent, respectively) and those with class III obesity had the highest rates of these outcomes (12.4 and 0.58 percent, respectively). </p><p>The authors proposed the following gestational weight gain ranges as optimal for reducing the risks of serious infant morbidity and mortality:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Underweight and normal BMI: 26 to &lt;53 lb (12 to &lt;24 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overweight BMI: 22 to &lt;44 lb (10 to &lt;20 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class I obesity: 18 to &lt;35 lb (8 to &lt;16 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class II obesity: 13 to &lt;35 lb (6 to &lt;16 kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class III obesity: 13 to &lt;22 lb (6 to &lt;10 kg)</p><p></p><p>Gestational weight gain less than these proposed lower boundaries or weight loss had a greater impact on infant mortality among underweight and normal BMI individuals compared with individuals with obesity, but the latter also experienced increased rates of infant mortality when weight gain was not optimal. </p><p>The lower boundaries of the optimal gestational weight gain ranges proposed in this study to minimize infant morbidity and mortality were higher than the lower boundaries proposed by IOM recommendations for overweight BMI (22 versus the IOM's 15 lb [10 versus 7 kg]) and for obesity BMI: class I obesity (16 versus the IOM's 11 lb [8 versus 5 kg]), and classes II and III obesity (13 versus the IOM's 11 lb [6 versus 5 kg]). Of note, IOM recommendations were not stratified by class I, II, and III obesity (ie, lower boundary 11 lb [5 kg] for all three classes) and were targeted to optimizing pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, rather than "serious infant morbidity and mortality." The relationship between the lower boundary of gestational weight gain and increased infant morbidity and mortality in this study may be a marker of pathologic maternal factors, rather than causal. For the higher classes of obesity, further study is needed to clarify the relationship between gestational weight loss, gain, and maintenance and the risk of important adverse infant outcomes. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1159273312"><span class="h4">Novel research on caloric intake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The IOM guidelines, in common with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for weight management in pregnancy, recommend that all pregnant people modestly increase their caloric intake. At diagnosis of pregnancy or the first prenatal visit, pregnant people are often advised that caloric intake does not need to increase in early pregnancy as weekly weight gain in the first trimester should be minimal (1 to 4 lb [0.45 to 1.8 kg]). In the second and third trimesters, underweight and normal weight individuals are often advised that caloric intake needs to increase by approximately 300 calories per day to achieve 1 lb (0.45 kg) weight gain per week; for overweight and obese individuals, less of an increase is needed as weight gain should be approximately 0.5 lb (0.23 kg) per week  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75820" href="/d/graphic/75820.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). As a result of this guidance, derived from studies in nonobese individuals, the majority of intervention studies have been reluctant to suggest a reduction in energy intake in pregnant people with obesity.</p><p>Traditional guidelines for energy intake, as applied to pregnant people with obesity, have been challenged by a detailed investigation of the relationship between energy intake (primary outcome), energy expenditure, energy balance, and gestational weight gain in 54 pregnant people with obesity [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Rather than estimate energy intake from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (a method often confounded by underreporting), energy intake over the second and third trimesters was directly determined by the energy intake-balance method, which is calculated as the sum of mean energy expenditure across pregnancy assessed by the gold standard doubly labeled water method and energy deposition in fat and fat-free tissues by plethysmography and isotope dilution. Energy expenditure was estimated during sleep by whole body calorimetry. </p><p>Thirty-six of the participants demonstrated excessive weight gain by IOM guidelines for pregnant people with BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 8 achieved gestational weight gain within the recommended range, and 10 did not achieve the recommended weight gain. In pregnant people who achieved gestational weight gain within the recommended range, energy intake was less than energy expenditure. By contrast, for those whose weight gain was excessive, energy intake exceeded expenditure by 186±29 kcal/day, and this was associated with an increase in maternal adiposity, not fetal growth. As the difference was not explicable on the basis of diet or activity, nor related to markers of metabolic function or diet quality, the authors concluded that the metabolic demands of pregnancy are not increased in the second and third trimesters of pregnant people with obesity. Rather, they suggest that the energy requirements are met by mobilization of fat stores. </p><p>These important new observations cannot translate into clinical practice until appropriately powered intervention studies that actively encourage a reduction in energy intake are undertaken and confirm that any observed reduction in energy intake does not adversely affect clinical outcomes. However, in contrast to the small study described above, accurate measurement of energy balance cannot be achieved in a large study and proxy measures may be inaccurate. Nevertheless, advising pregnant people with obesity to reduce energy intake may be a more effective message than the "softer" advice for consuming a healthy diet and increasing activity, which most previous trials recommended in order to align with clinical guidelines.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN AND PREGNANCY OUTCOME</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H619734167"><span class="h2">Weight gain above IOM target range</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3383655221"><span class="h3">Pregnancy outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gestational weight gain above the Institute of Medicine (IOM) target range has been associated with an increased risk of macrosomia and large for gestational age (LGA) infants [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], cesarean birth [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], pregnancy-related hypertension (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia) [<a href="#rid17">17-21</a>], and gestational diabetes [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>], but not stillbirth [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

For offspring, it has been associated with an increased risk of neonatal adiposity [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>] and childhood overweight or obesity [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. LGA neonates, in particular, are at risk for multiple adverse short- and long-term sequelae. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5059.html" rel="external">"Large for gestational age (LGA) newborn", section on 'Complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5059.html" rel="external">"Large for gestational age (LGA) newborn", section on 'Potential long-term effects'</a>.)</p><p>For the mother, it can result in postpartum weight retention. Females experience modest increases in body weight and fat distribution after a first pregnancy; these changes may be persistent and vary according to race and ethnic background [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Excessive gestational weight gain can lead to significant postpartum weight retention and eventual obesity, which has multiple adverse health consequences (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5370.html" rel="external">"Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences"</a>). In its 2009 report, the IOM stated that an analysis restricted to data collected at ≥24 weeks postpartum found that more than 60 percent of pregnant people in all racial/ethnic groups who gained above the range recommended by IOM 1990 retained &gt;10 lb (4.5 kg) postpartum and more than 40 percent of those who gained excessively retained &gt;20 lb (9.1 kg) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In a study including nearly 28,000 individuals with prepregnancy BMI in the normal range, gestational weight gain above the 2009 IOM recommendations was associated with increased all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18) and cardiovascular mortality (aHR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04-1.37) at median follow-up of 52 years, after adjustment for multiple index pregnancy covariates [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Individuals with BMIs in the overweight range also had a significant increase in all-cause mortality (aHR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24). These findings support previous evidence that gestational weight gain above 2009 IOM recommendations contributes to the accumulation of visceral adiposity, and suggests that this, in turn, increases the risk of chronic diseases and subsequent mortality.</p><p>Excessive gestational weight gain in a first pregnancy is predictive of excessive weight gain in subsequent pregnancies [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Adding to this problem, individuals are more likely to gain rather than lose weight between pregnancies, and weight gain from one pregnancy to the next increases the risks of gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertensive diseases, cesarean birth, preterm birth, LGA, stillbirth, and cleft palate [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. </p><p>Avoiding excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention are important and potentially modifiable targets to achieve lower risks of adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies and prevent future maternal obesity and its adverse consequences. A meta-analysis of postpartum interventions for weight loss demonstrated that a combined dietary and physical activity intervention produced greater postpartum weight loss compared with no intervention (mean difference -2.49 kg, 95% CI -3.34 to -1.63 kg, 12 studies, 1156 participants), and the weight loss was maintained at 12 months postpartum in four studies [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Although traditional behavioral interventions for achieving and maintaining weight loss have had limited success, some promising new approaches have been investigated. For example, a randomized trial found that an internet-based lifestyle intervention resulted in greater postpartum weight loss than usual care [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Subsequent data that may inform guidance for gestational weight gain'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>IOM gestational weight gain targets</strong> – The Institute of Medicine (IOM, now National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine) has made recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy, stratified by maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75820" href="/d/graphic/75820.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Recommendations for gestational weight gain'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Gestational weight gain above the IOM target range in the overall obstetric population has been associated with an increased risk of macrosomic and large for gestational age infants, cesarean birth, pregnancy-related hypertension (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia), and gestational diabetes. (See <a class="local">'Weight gain above IOM target range'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Gestational weight gain below the IOM target range in the overall obstetric population has been associated with lower birth weight and an increased risk for small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. Since birth weight is related to both maternal BMI and gestational weight gain, this risk is more significant in pregnant people who are underweight by BMI and do not achieve the IOM target range than in those with normal, overweight, or obese BMI who do not achieve the IOM target range. (See <a class="local">'Weight gain below IOM target range'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Underweight pregnant people </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Target</strong> – Underweight pregnant people should be encouraged to reach a normal BMI before pregnancy and to meet IOM recommendations for gestational weight gain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75820" href="/d/graphic/75820.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) to lower their risk of having an SGA infant. (See <a class="local">'Underweight pregnant people'</a> above and <a class="local">'Preconception counseling'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Weight gain below target</strong> – If weight gain between prenatal visits is inadequate (less than 0.5 lb [0.23 kg] per week), the individual's eating habits and other potential etiologies of weight gain outside of the recommended range should be evaluated. Insufficient weight gain may be due to a number factors, including but not limited to smoking, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy/hyperemesis gravidarum, medical disease, eating disorder, or food insecurity. Management depends on the etiology. Interventions that may be useful in those with inadequate weight gain include optimizing the status of related underlying medical disorders, frequent contact with nurses or nutrition specialists, suggestions for changes in diet and physical activity, and for some individuals, improved access to healthy foods. (See <a class="local">'Approach to weight gain below IOM recommendations'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Weight gain above target</strong> – Since birth weight is related to both maternal BMI and gestational weight gain, underweight pregnant people can benefit from gestational weight gain above the IOM target range because it will reduce their risk of an SGA birth. (See <a class="local">'Approach to weight gain above IOM recommendations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Overweight/obese pregnant people </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Target</strong> – Overweight/obese pregnant people should be encouraged to reach a normal BMI before pregnancy and to meet IOM recommendations for gestational weight gain. Prepregnancy and postpartum counseling of overweight/obese females should include information on the risks of obesity for the mother, pregnancy, and child and encouragement for weight reduction, which may include information about diet/dietary goals, exercise, and weight loss programs, and referral to a weight-reduction specialist for discussion of options such as behavior modification, pharmacotherapy, or bariatric surgery, if appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Preconception counseling'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Weight gain below target</strong> – Pregnant people who are obese may not require an increase in energy intake in the second and third trimesters to meet the metabolic demands of pregnancy. If gestational weight gain is below IOM recommendations, we do not encourage these individuals to increase the rate of weight gain if the fetus is growing appropriately as overweight/obese pregnant people who gain below IOM recommendations, or even gain no weight, , do not appear to be at increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome and some risks appear to be reduced (large for gestational age [LGA], preeclampsia). However, we advise against weight loss as it may increase the risk of having an SGA newborn, especially if weight loss exceeds 5 kgs. (See <a class="local">'Approach to weight gain below IOM recommendations'</a> above and <a class="local">'Approach to weight loss'</a> above and <a class="local">'Novel research on caloric intake'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Weight gain above target</strong> – If weight gain between prenatal visits is excessive (more than one and a half lb [0.68 kg]) per week, the individual's eating habits and other potential etiologies of excessive weight gain should be evaluated. In the absence of pathologic edema (eg, preeclampsia, heart failure, nephropathy), excessive gestational weight gain is primarily related to an excessive increase in maternal adiposity, generally the result of positive maternal energy balance. Data from randomized trials on lifestyle/behavioral interventions for avoiding excessive gestational weight gain do not conclusively support the efficacy of any approach for improving relevant pregnancy outcomes. (See <a class="local">'Approach to weight gain above IOM recommendations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2703437567"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges George Macones, MD, MSCE, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Alavi N, Haley S, Chow K, McDonald SD.
