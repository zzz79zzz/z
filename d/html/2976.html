         Testicular cancers, 95 percent of which are germ cell tumors (GCTs), are one of the most curable solid tumors. Testicular GCTs are more sensitive to systemic chemotherapy than most adult solid tumors. Chemotherapy is routinely administered with curative intent for men with metastatic seminomas or nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs; ie, stage III disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 graphicRef110732" href="/z/d/graphic/110731.html" rel="external">

         )) and for those with persistently elevated serum tumor markers following orchiectomy (stage Is).
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of stage II NSGCTs requires an understanding of the appropriate roles of chemotherapy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. In addition to chemotherapy, a curative approach to testicular cancer often requires surgery, in part because primary and metastatic tumors may contain teratoma, which is less prone to dissemination but more resistant to chemotherapy than other GCT histologies. (See

         Stage II disease refers to cancers that have spread to the regional (ie, retroperitoneal) lymph nodes without distant metastases or marked elevation of serum tumor markers (S0 or S1)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 graphicRef110732" href="/z/d/graphic/110731.html" rel="external">

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Stage II disease can be defined based on either imaging criteria combined with clinical judgment (clinical stage II) or a histopathologic analysis showing germ cell tumor (GCT) in lymph nodes resected during a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND; pathologic stage II). (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to recognize that there are two competing frameworks that come into play in clinical staging: the radiologic framework and the staging framework. The radiologic framework is focused on whether or not lymph nodes are enlarged, while the staging framework is focused on the clinician's judgment of whether or not lymph node metastases are present.

         Distinguishing stage I from stage II testis cancer is not always straightforward [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Imaging may detect mildly enlarged lymph nodes (measuring 1 to 2 cm in greatest dimension), but this does not necessarily indicate the presence of active disease. The positive predictive value of a computed tomography (CT) scan ranges from 64 to 88 percent, and the negative predictive value is approximately 62 percent [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. For those who ultimately undergo RPLND for clinical stage IIA disease, up to 40 percent will be diagnosed with pathologic stage I disease [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, the radiographic framework focuses on the definition of normal. Importantly, it is the length of the short axis in the transverse plane that is used to determine whether or not a lymph node is enlarged on cross-sectional imaging. All measurement criteria in this section refer to measurements in the transverse plane.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although one observational study demonstrated that craniocaudal lymph node length (measured on coronal or sagittal plane images) was associated with increased relapse risk, this particular measurement has not been definitively associated with adverse outcomes [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].

         </span>
         From a radiologic perspective, lymph nodes are considered enlarged if the short axis is ≥10 mm. Therefore, lymph nodes will generally be reported as normal unless the short axis is ≥10 mm.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, for staging purposes, the clinician must make a judgement as to whether or not lymph node metastases are present. If the clinician judges that lymph node metastases are present, then it is the long axis measurement in the transverse plane that determines whether an enlarged node (ie, a node with a short axis at least 10 mm) is stage IIA, IIB, or IIC.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, a lymph node that is 0.5 by 1.5 cm is not enlarged by radiographic criteria. But, if the clinician believes the lymph node represents a metastasis, then the clinical stage is IIA; if the clinician believes the lymph node is benign, then this is clinical stage I. Similarly, a patient with five lymph nodes measuring 9 by 9 mm could appropriately be staged clinical stage IIA if the clinician thought the nodes represented metastases, even though all these nodes fall within normal limits with regard to size.
        </p>
        <p>
         In other words, a patient is clinical stage II because they are judged to have lymph node metastases, not simply because they have nodes of a certain size. However, nodal size clearly and strongly influences clinical judgement. It is essential for clinicians caring for testis cancer patients to carefully evaluate the patient's cross-sectional imaging and other clinical data in order to form a well-considered judgement about proper staging. A reflexive response to radiology reports is strongly inappropriate in this disease.

         </span>
         The criteria for the different subcategories of clinical stage II are based on the greatest dimension of nodal metastases in the transverse plane: stage IIA refers to retroperitoneal nodal metastases measuring ≤2 cm, stage IIB refers to metastatic nodes measuring &gt;2 and ≤5 cm, and stage IIC refers to retroperitoneal nodes &gt;5 cm.

         Stages IIB and IIC are straightforward to diagnose clinically; such nodal involvement almost always represents metastatic disease.

         An accurate diagnosis of stage IIA is more complicated. A significant number of men with normal-size retroperitoneal nodes (clinical stage I) will have cancer discovered if RPLND is performed, and a significant number of men with mild adenopathy (stage IIA) will be found to have benign nodes (pathological stage I) if RPLND is performed. CT scans thus have substantial false negative and false positive rates.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For instance, in one series of 122 men with clinical stage IIA testis cancer, only 60 percent had GCT found at lymph node dissection, resulting in a false positive rate of 40 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, in another study of men undergoing primary RPLND, sensitivity and negative predictive value increased to 91 and 90 percent, respectively, if a 3 mm short axis cutoff was used for the upper limit of normal (ULN) in the primary landing zone for testis cancer (ie, the interaortocaval, precaval, and preaortic nodes for tumors of the right testis and the para-aortic and preaortic nodes for tumors of the left testis) and a 10 mm threshold was used out of the primary landing zone. However, specificity and positive predictive values declined to 52 and 53 percent [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Although this model is not used in practice, it is a reminder of the importance of using clinical judgment when reading retroperitoneal images of men with testis cancer and taking into account the different landing zones of left and right testis cancers.

         Of note, pelvic and inguinal lymph node metastases are considered distant metastases and represent stage III disease. (See

         Men with clinical stage II nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) have a high likelihood of cure. Our approach depends on the size and imaging characteristics of retroperitoneal lymph nodes and the serum tumor markers obtained postorchiectomy  (

         For men with lymph nodes ≤2 cm and normal (S0) tumor markers (stage IIA disease), we prefer retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) rather than chemotherapy. RPLND provides more accurate staging and cures 80 to 90 percent of men with stage IIA nodal disease. In addition, it spares a substantial number of patients (who would be pathologically downstaged to stage I) from unnecessary chemotherapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2992.html" rel="external">
          "Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for early-stage testicular germ cell tumors"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Alternatively, for men with stage IIA disease who do not wish to proceed with RPLND for whatever reason, we advocate chemotherapy with three cycles of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9160" href="/z/d/drug information/9160.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         (BEP) or four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP). If men treated with chemotherapy have residual adenopathy after completion of chemotherapy, then a postchemotherapy RPLND should be performed by a highly experienced surgeon.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, if the staging is ambiguous (ie, if in the clinician's judgement there is significant uncertainty over whether the patient should be staged as clinical stage I or IIA), then surveillance is the preferred alternative to RPLND. The goal of surveillance is to avoid treating the minority of men whose mild adenopathy turns out to be benign. If surveillance is chosen, strict attention to assuring close follow-up is essential since these men may have early stage metastatic disease that will progress and require chemotherapy. With close surveillance, the prognosis is excellent; even if a patient experiences progression, cure is still attainable with chemotherapy or, in select cases, RPLND.
        </p>
        <p>
         Stage IIA testis cancer is a heterogeneous entity. In patients who are borderline between stage I and stage IIA, the following factors are suggestive of lymph node metastases: location in the primary landing zone for the cancer testicle, multiple enlarged or borderline-enlarged nodes, and round rather than elliptical nodes (ie, nodes with little difference between the long and short diameter).

         Men with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases &gt;2 cm and normal (S0) tumor markers (clinical stage IIB or IIC disease) should receive chemotherapy rather than proceed with RPLND. The cure rate for these men is 65 percent if managed only with RPLND [

          table 2

         ), although four cycles of chemotherapy with EP is a reasonable alternative. This approach is based on the results of treatment using this regimen in patients with disseminated germ cell tumors (GCTs). (See

         There are no randomized trials that compare systemic chemotherapy with RPLND for patients in this clinical setting. The available data suggest that chemotherapy results in similar survival outcomes compared with RPLND for men with stage IIA disease and that it is probably superior for men with stage IIB to IIC disease [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6,12,13
         </a>
         ]. For example, a study of 252 men with clinical stage IIA and IIB NSGCT found that relapse-free survival was significantly greater with chemotherapy than with RPLND (98 versus 79 percent) [
         <a href="#rid5">

         For patients with clinical stage II disease (inclusive of stages IIA to IIC) whose serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is mildly elevated (S1) after orchiectomy, we administer chemotherapy rather than perform RPLND.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mild elevations of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) are of no known significance in this setting. The concern is that patients with an elevated beta-hCG or AFP are more likely to have distant micrometastases, and treating with chemotherapy first prevents such metastases from progressing. In addition, these men have a substantial chance of being cured with chemotherapy alone, and this potentially spares them from undergoing both RPLND and chemotherapy, with all the potential toxicities associated with combined modality treatment. However, a substantial proportion of clinical stage II patients have residual adenopathy requiring postchemotherapy RPLND, and many patients require dual modality treatment regardless of whether RPLND or chemotherapy is done first.

         In general, we suggest RPLND rather than observation for all men who have residual masses ≥1 cm in the long axis following chemotherapy. For men with small residual masses that measure &lt;1 cm in the long axis, surveillance is a reasonable alternative, provided that men are willing and able to follow a surveillance protocol. (See

         Approximately 85 to 90 percent of men with pathologic stage IIA disease are cured with RPLND, provided their tumor markers normalized following orchiectomy. We suggest active surveillance for these men rather than adjuvant chemotherapy. (See

         The equivalence between surveillance and adjuvant chemotherapy was shown in a trial involving 195 men with pathologic stage II disease who were randomly assigned to surveillance or adjuvant chemotherapy (two cycles of a cisplatin-based regimen) [
         <a href="#rid10">

         The recurrence rate was 6 (6 of 97 men) and 49 (48 of 98 men) percent following adjuvant chemotherapy or surveillance, respectively. However, of the six relapses in the group randomly assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy, five occurred in men who had either refused treatment or relapsed before adjuvant chemotherapy could be initiated.

         The risk of relapse during surveillance varied only marginally according to the volume of disease identified in the lymph nodes. For men with nodes &gt;2 cm, nodes ≤2 cm, and microscopically involved nodes, the recurrence rates were 60, 53, and 40 percent, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant. While the relapse rate of 40 to 53 percent for pathological stage IIA disease was higher in this study than in subsequent retrospective single-institution analyses, it is worth remembering that in this study, patients were randomly assigned to surveillance rather than chosen for surveillance based on an expected low risk of relapse.

         For patients who are unlikely to comply with a surveillance schedule following RPLND, chemotherapy is advised. Typically, we administer two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy using either

In addition, it is reasonable to administer chemotherapy to men who wish to be aggressive with treatment in order to reduce the risk of relapse from 10 to 15 percent down to 1 percent, provided they are aware that there is no clinically significant improvement in overall survival associated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Despite this, for some men the peace of mind this provides is worth undergoing six weeks of chemotherapy.

We prefer to use two cycles of EP because there is no evidence that adding a third drug improves outcomes in this setting. As described above, regarding the role of chemotherapy for men with clinical stage IIA disease, the benefit of chemotherapy in reducing the risk of recurrence was confirmed in a randomized controlled trial comparing surveillance with two cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

         Although tumor burden (denoted by stage) is used to make treatment recommendations, the histology of the primary tumor should also be taken into consideration. As an example, men with lymphovascular invasion and a high proportion of embryonal carcinoma in their primary tumor are at higher risk of relapse following retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) compared with those without these features. For patients who are borderline between stage IIA and stage IIB, such features would lead us to favor chemotherapy as the initial treatment. By contrast, men with pure teratomas are less likely to benefit from chemotherapy, and we tend to prefer RPLND over chemotherapy.

         Stage II nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) of the testis consist of two distinct entities: clinical stage II disease, in which radiological studies show enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and pathological stage II disease, in which retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) has resulted in histopathological documentation of retroperitoneal lymph node metastases  (

         For men with clinical stage IIA NSGCT, we suggest RPLND rather than primary chemotherapy (

          Grade 2C

Patients with evidence of metastatic testicular cancer confirmed at surgery are managed according to their pathologic stage. An alternative to RPLND is close surveillance to monitor for progressive lymph node enlargement or the appearance of distant metastatic disease. Chemotherapy for stage IIA disease should be reserved for those men whose lymphadenopathy is judged to be almost certainly malignant based on adenopathy in the primary landing zone of the cancer and the presence of multiple enlarged nodes.
