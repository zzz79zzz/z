         A left hemicolectomy includes resection of the transverse colon left of the middle colic vessels to the level of the upper rectum. A segmental left colectomy is performed when lesser resections are indicated (eg, trauma, polyp), provided the anastomosis is performed in well-vascularized bowel.
        </p>
        <p>
         The open techniques used to perform left colectomy are reviewed here.

         Right and extended right colectomy are presented separately. (See

         The colon and rectum occupy the retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal spaces, in close approximation to solid organs (

         ). The ascending and descending colon are retroperitoneal, while the transverse colon, which extends from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure, is intraperitoneal. The sigmoid colon continues from the descending colon, ending where the teniae converge to form the rectum.

         The arterial supply of the left colon has few profuse anastomoses and collateral circulations. The middle colic artery (MCA) and the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) provide the principle blood supply to the left colon (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756" href="/z/d/graphic/73756.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The marginal artery of Drummond and the arc of Riolan provide collateral blood vessels. Typically, the blood supply of the transverse colon is excellent provided the marginal artery is not damaged. Variability in the arterial anastomoses occurs, which is an important point when performing a segmental resection. The two most tenuous sites and the corresponding arterial supplies are the splenic flexure (Griffith's point) and distal descending colon (Sudeck's point). (See

         General issues regarding the medical preparation of patients, including antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel preparation, and other considerations, such as anticipated splenectomy, prior to colon resection are reviewed separately. Siting for possible ostomy locations should be performed prior to surgery. (See

         It is helpful to have a flexible colonoscope available in the operating room as it may be needed to identify a cancer or other mucosal lesion if it cannot be palpated.
        </p>
        <p>
         We prefer that the patient be placed in lithotomy position, though the procedure can also be performed supine. Lithotomy allows simultaneous access to the abdomen and perineum for the colorectal anastomosis when using the circular stapler, as well as for intraoperative colonoscopy or proctoscopy. It also provides additional space for the second assistant and an additional position for the operating surgeon when mobilizing the splenic flexure.

         The indications for a left hemicolectomy include benign conditions (eg, segmental Crohn's colitis, trauma, ischemia, polyps unresectable through a colonoscope) and malignant diseases (eg, distal transverse colon cancer, mid-descending colon cancers). Diverticular disease, typically treated with a sigmoid colon resection, may require a left hemicolectomy if the descending colon is unsuitable for an anastomosis due to active diverticulitis or muscular hypertrophy.

         Prior to proceeding with colon resection, the abdomen should be systematically explored. The anatomy of the colon and its blood supply should be verified, noting any anatomic variations or possibly any congenital anomalies (eg, malrotation). For patients with abdominal trauma, the abdomen is packed and systematically examined, removing the packs in turn. Bleeding is controlled first followed by control of gastrointestinal leakage. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15700.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with colon tumors, the primary tumor is palpated to confirm its location. Local and regional resectability is determined by assessing tumor invasion into the stomach, major vessels, and/or duodenum (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60998" href="/z/d/graphic/60998.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The entire colon should also be palpated to identify synchronous colonic lesions. Abdominal exploration also includes an assessment for distant disease, including peritoneal implants, hepatic metastases, or distant nodal metastases.

         Benign lesions may be resected with a hemicolectomy or a segmental resection. As an example, extensive benign lesions of the left colon (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticular disease) can be removed with a less extensive colon resection than is required for a cancer operation, providing the anastomosis is performed in well-vascularized bowel (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65664" href="/z/d/graphic/65664.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). For well-defined benign conditions of the left colon (eg, trauma, diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease), a segmental resection with a primary anastomosis in well-vascularized colon and a limited mesenteric resection can be performed (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54427" href="/z/d/graphic/54427.html" rel="external">
          figure 6
         </a>
         ). Resection margins must be chosen to ensure adequate blood supply in the remaining colon. For large polyps that require a surgical resection because of a possible malignancy, the authors perform a formal cancer operation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Malignant lesions of the left colon are typically resected with a left hemicolectomy, extending from the distal transverse colon to the upper rectum, 2 to 3 cm above the sacral promontory (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53859" href="/z/d/graphic/53859.html" rel="external">
          figure 7
         </a>
         ). For malignant lesions of the splenic flexure, a limited resection extending from the transverse to the sigmoid colon can be performed, but the pedicle of the left colic artery and the first sigmoid branch must be included (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75381" href="/z/d/graphic/75381.html" rel="external">
          figure 8
         </a>
         ). The proximal and distal colon segments are divided with a minimum of a 5 cm margin of normal colon. The anastomosis is intraperitoneal between well-vascularized colon segments; the presacral plane posterior to the rectum is not entered.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the uncommon setting of the detection of an unsuspected synchronous colonic cancer, we perform a subtotal colectomy to remove both lesions, including adequate resection margins with high ligation of mesenteric vessels and complete nodal harvest. Surgical management of synchronous metastatic disease (stage IV) is reviewed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">

         </span>
         The extent of the mesenteric resection also varies according to the indication for surgery. As an example, when performing the resection for malignant lesions, the inferior mesenteric artery is ligated at its origin from the aorta, the inferior mesenteric vein is ligated at the level of the pancreas, and the mesentery and draining lymphatics are removed with the vascular pedicle. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15261.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A less extensive resection of the mesentery is performed for benign conditions, with the mesenteric vessels ligated closer to the colon (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98812" href="/z/d/graphic/98812.html" rel="external">
          figure 9
         </a>
         ). However, for settings of severe mesenteric inflammation (eg, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease) and thickening of the mesentery near the bowel wall, mesenteric dissection may be warranted.

         There are two approaches to resecting the left colon; one begins laterally by mobilizing the colon and progresses medially, while the other begins medially by identifying the lymphovascular bundle and progresses laterally. The approach is at the discretion of the surgeon, although in most settings the lateral-to-medial approach is performed.

         The lateral-to-medial approach begins by mobilizing the left colon by dividing the lateral peritoneal attachment of the colon and developing the retromesenteric plane. This approach provides early identification and exposure of the ureter and gonadal vessels (

         The general principles for performing a left hemicolectomy, beginning with mobilizing the left colon, include:

         Retract the left colon medially and incise the peritoneal attachments in the left paracolic gutter just medial to the line of Toldt (

         </span>
         Identify and avoid injury to the left ureter and gonadal vessels in the retroperitoneum. If the ureter cannot be seen, the dissection plane may be too deep. Check medially under the reflected peritoneum as the ureter may have been lifted anteriorly with the investing retroperitoneal fascia.

         Incise the peritoneum to the level of the splenic flexure. The peritoneal incision now follows the curve of the colon, remains inferomedial to the spleen, and continues around the corner of the flexure. Divide splenocolic ligaments with scissors or electrocautery to prevent tearing the splenic capsule. An alternative approach for patients with a thick mesentery or in settings where it is technically difficult to mobilize the splenic flexure is to approach the splenic flexure medially from the midtransverse colon and the dissection continued laterally (

         The medial-to-lateral approach is ideal when a tumor is large and/or adherent to the lateral side wall. The advantage of the medial approach includes early ligation of the lymphovascular pedicle, which lessens the risk of injury as a result of torsion during colon mobilization. Early vascular ligation also allows demarcation between ischemic and well-perfused bowel prior to transecting the bowel and more efficient identification of the resection plane in the setting of severe mesenteric inflammation (eg, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease).

         Options for restoring bowel continuity include an end-to-end or side-to-end colorectal or colocolic anastomosis, which can be either performed with a stapling device or hand-sewn. An alternative anastomosis that can be used between the proximal and distal colon (not rectum) is the functional end-to-end anastomosis, which is technically a side-to-side approach. There is insufficient evidence that any one configuration is better functionally or less likely to leak or that a stapled colorectal anastomosis is superior to a hand-sewn one [

         A single-layer hand-sewn closure with absorbable (eg, polyglycolic acid) suture or nonabsorbable (eg, silk, polypropylene) suture is used to create a hand-sewn anastomosis. There is no evidence that a two-layer closure is preferable to a single-layer closure [

          2,3
         </a>
         ]. While two-layer closures were routinely performed in the past, a randomized trial of 132 patients undergoing an intestinal anastomosis found that the single-layer closure was associated with similar complication rates for anastomotic leaks (two [3.0 percent] versus one patient [1.5 percent]) and intra-abdominal abscesses (two patients each) compared with a two-layer closure [
         <a href="#rid4">

          Colonic anastomosis
         </strong>
         – The continuity of bowel is restored with a colocolic or colorectal anastomosis, depending on the length of the distal bowel available for an anastomosis. At the surgeon's discretion, the anastomosis can be performed hand-sewn or stapled, using an end-to-end or end-to-side approach. A functional side-to-side anastomosis is an alternative approach for a colocolic anastomosis with mobile distal bowel. (See

          'Colocolonic anastomosis'
