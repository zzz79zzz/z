         The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) condition is a valvulo-aortopathy (affecting both the aortic valve and the thoracic aorta); therefore, its management in adults includes surveillance of aortic valve function and the thoracic aorta (the aortic root and ascending aorta), timely intervention, treatment of hypertension, measures to address the risk of infective endocarditis, counseling patients on physical activity, and management prior to and during pregnancy [

         Indications for intervention for valvulopathy and for aortopathy in adults with BAV have been developed to provide timely treatment to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes from uncorrected progressive disease while managing the risk associated with intervention. In patients with BAV, decisions regarding the timing of BAV intervention and aortic root or ascending aorta surgery are complex, requiring consideration of the aortic valve function, aortic size, and other patient characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
         The indications for intervention are based upon natural history and intervention outcomes data for aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation, and aortic disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129727" href="/z/d/graphic/129727.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         ), as discussed below. (See

          'Procedures for aortic stenosis'
         </a>
         below and

        </p>
        <p>
         Recommendations for intervention presented here are similar to recommendations in the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline for valvular heart disease, the 2021 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines for valvular heart disease, and the 2022 ACC/AHA guideline for aortic disease [

         Options for intervention depend upon whether the patient with BAV requires aortic valve intervention, repair of the aorta, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surgical repair of the aorta (most commonly involving replacement of a dilated aortic segment with a synthetic polyethylene terephthalate [eg, Dacron] graft) may involve one or more of four anatomic areas: the aortic valve, the aortic root (from the valve annulus to the sinotubular junction), the tubular ascending aorta (from the sinotubular junction to the innominate artery), and, occasionally, the aortic arch [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. BAV patients with aortopathy exhibit predominant ascending aorta dilation (70 percent), and some exhibit predominant root dilation (20 percent). However, it is common for root-predominant patients to also exhibit dilation of the ascending aorta.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some patients, dilation of the ascending aorta extends to the aortic arch [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In such cases, concomitant aortic arch repair (hemiarch or total arch) may be required, depending upon the extent of arch dilation, surgical expertise, and technique.

          Isolated aortic valve intervention
         </strong>
         – A patient with an indication for intervention for AS or aortic regurgitation (AR) without an indication for repair of the aorta is a candidate for aortic valve intervention without surgery on the aorta. This scenario is more frequent than an isolated indication for intervention for the aorta without valve intervention [
         <a href="#rid6">

          Valve-sparing aortic surgery
         </strong>
         – A patient with an indication for surgery on the aortic root and/or ascending aorta without an indication for aortic valve replacement is a candidate for "valve-sparing aortic repair" (the patient retains their native BAV)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107677" href="/z/d/graphic/107677.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The majority of patients with BAV have predominant ascending aortic dilation and do not require root replacement for aneurysm disease; in these patients, a valve-sparing ascending aorta repair (from the sinotubular junction to the innominate artery) is performed and may include BAV repair for AR. Valve-sparing aortic root surgery involves surgical repair of the aortic root and ascending aorta while retaining the native valve and includes the David (reimplantation technique), Yacoub (remodeling technique), and partial Yacoub procedures [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. These procedures may include concomitant repair of BAV AR; there is growing experience with surgical aortic valve repair, rather than replacement, for selected cases of AR complicating BAV [

         </strong>
         – For a patient who requires aortic valve replacement and has a dilated aortic root and ascending aorta, a composite prosthetic aortic valve and aortic root and ascending aorta graft replacement (modified Bentall procedure) may be performed. Alternatively, a homograft that includes valve, root, and ascending aorta is infrequently used in selected cases (eg, in the setting of infective endocarditis). The Bentall procedure or homograft procedure includes reimplantation of the coronary arteries into the ascending aortic graft  (

         For patients with severe AS requiring valve intervention, the main options are surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR; mechanical or bioprosthetic) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Compared with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients, patients with BAV attain severe AS at 60s and 70s years of age, versus 70s and 80s years of age for patients with TAV. [
         <a href="#rid11">

         Although BAV was previously considered a contraindication for TAVI due to technical concerns about elliptical deployment or underdeployment, TAVI has been successfully performed in many patients with calcific bicuspid stenosis [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-26
         </a>
         ]. While patients with BAV were excluded from the early landmark randomized trials for TAVI using balloon-expandable or self-expanding prostheses, observational data are available on TAVI in patients with BAV [

          20-26
         </a>
         ]. In addition, it is frequently difficult to ascertain the number of valve leaflets in the presence of severe calcific stenosis, so a significant number of patients with an indeterminate leaflet number may have congenital BAV.
        </p>
        <p>
         Anatomical variability of the valve, annulus, and left ventricular outflow tract, distribution and deposition of valvular and annular calcification, and the presence of aortic disease present complexities for TAVI in BAV disease [

         The Ross procedure is a surgical option at centers of excellence for selected young and middle-aged patients (generally &lt;50 years old) with nonrepairable bicuspid valves who prefer to avoid the long-term anticoagulation required with a mechanical aortic valve prosthesis and favor a procedure that may have more durability than surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement.

         The decision to proceed with aortic surgery (to repair the root [aortic sinuses] or repair the tubular ascending aorta) in a patient with a BAV involves weighing the estimated risk of surgery and the risk of aortic complications without surgery (such as aortic dissection and rupture) based upon root or ascending aorta size and the presence of high-risk features. A shared decision-making approach is required incorporating many relevant clinical features such as the patient's age, BAV dysfunction (AS and/or aortic regurgitation [AR]), aortic size in relation to body size, associated comorbidities, operative risk, overall prognosis, and patient preferences [

         Thresholds for prophylactic surgery in patients with nonsyndromic BAV (eg, ≥5.5 cm for patients without high-risk features) are based upon natural history data on the risk of aortic complications (aortic dissection or rupture) in patients with ascending aortic aneurysms regardless of aortic valve morphology, the relatively low risk of aortic surgery in observational studies, and generally good postoperative outcomes [

        <p>
         Data on the risk of aortic complications in patients with BAV represent the clinical history of the disease (as opposed to the natural history) since most published studies of aortic complications in patients with BAV have included patients treated with elective aortic surgery for aortic dilation (if indicated) [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57,58,61-67
         </a>
         ]. Collectively, these data have demonstrated that the BAV aortopathy has a more benign course than syndromic aortopathy (eg, Marfan, Turner, Loeys Dietz syndromes). Although the incidence of aortic dissection with BAV is higher than in the general population, it remains low in absolute terms when studying the clinical history. This notion has been corroborated by two natural history studies assessing aortic dissection risk before aortic surgery:

         Expected mortality rates and the potential for continued aortic dilation over time are important considerations in management of the ascending aorta. Late complications depend upon the surgical procedure performed: aortic valve intervention without surgery on the aorta, valve-sparing aortic operations, or combined aortic valve replacement and ascending aorta surgery.

         A systematic review of 32 observational studies reported outcomes for 9441 adults with BAV (median age 50 years) and 1605 control subjects [

There were slightly higher rates of bleeding and reexploration in patients undergoing both aortic valve replacement and proximal aortic surgery compared with isolated aortic surgery. Reported long-term outcomes included all-cause mortality and acute aortic event rate (need for subsequent proximal aortic surgery, aortic dissection/rupture, or sudden death not attributable to any other cause) for each of three groups of patients:

         Among patients with BAV undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement, the risk of late aortic complications is greater in patients with larger baseline aortic size, with the aortic root phenotype, or undergoing aortic valve replacement for predominant AR [

         A series of 201 patients (mean age 56 years) with BAV (63 percent had AS, 22 percent had AR, and 15 percent had mixed disease) underwent isolated aortic valve replacement between 1979 and 1993 at Toronto General Hospital [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81

         ]. Late aortic aneurysm formation depended upon the aortic size at the time of valve replacement. During mean 10.3-year follow-up, 18 patients (9 percent) required late aortic replacement for aneurysm at mean diameter of 5.8 cm, one had aortic dissection, and three experienced sudden cardiac death. Survival was 67 percent at 15 years, and patients with ascending aorta diameters of 4.5 to 4.9 cm had worse survival. Freedom from ascending aortic complications at 15 years (aneurysm repair, dissection, or sudden death) was 78 percent for initial aortic size &lt;4 cm, 81 percent for aortic size 4 to 4.4 cm, and 43 percent for aortic size 4.5 to 4.9 cm.

This study also included outcomes for a separate group of 21 BAV patients (mean age 41 years) with aortic valve regurgitation and predominant dilation of the aortic root (root phenotype) who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement. In this group, the freedom from adverse aortic events at 10 and 15 years was 88 and 70 percent, respectively. Thus, patients with the root phenotype were at increased risk for adverse aortic events, as has also been suggested by other observations.

         Surgical repairs of the ascending aorta are generally durable, with most anastomotic problems occurring early in the postoperative period. Thus, postoperative imaging is generally required only if a problem is suspected. If there is residual aortic dilation or other pathology, imaging of the thoracic aorta every three to five years after aortic surgery by CMR or CT is suggested [

          53

          Rationale for intervention
         </strong>
         – Indications for intervention for valvulopathy and aortopathy in adults with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) have been developed to provide timely treatment to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes from uncorrected progressive disease while managing the risk associated with intervention. (See

         <strong>
          Types of intervention
         </strong>
         – The choice of intervention is based on whether the patient with BAV requires aortic valve intervention, repair of the aorta, or both. (See

          Aortic valve interventions
         </strong>
         - Standard recommendations for aortic valve intervention for severe aortic stenosis (AS) and for severe aortic regurgitation (AR) apply to patients with BAV. (See

         <strong>
          Procedures for AS
         </strong>
         – For patients with severe AS requiring valve intervention, the main options are surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR; mechanical or bioprosthetic) and transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI). At experienced centers, the Ross procedure is an option for selected young and middle-aged patients with BAV. For selected patients (generally &lt;25 years of age) with noncalcified valves and no more than mild AR, balloon aortic valvotomy is an alternative option. (See

          Aortic interventions
         </strong>
         – The decision on whether to proceed with prophylactic ascending aortic surgery in a patient with BAV is based upon weighing the estimated risk of surgery and the risk of progressive aortic disease. The threshold ascending aortic (root or tubular ascending aorta) diameter for prophylactic surgery depends on whether the patient has high-risk features, the patient's operative risk, and whether the patient has a concurrent indication for aortic valve surgery, as shown in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115163" href="/z/d/graphic/115163.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Aortic surgery should be performed by an experienced multidisciplinary aortic team with established expertise in these procedures. (See
