         Surgical resection is the cornerstone of curative treatment for rectal adenocarcinomas. Invasive small rectal adenocarcinomas may be effectively managed with limited surgical procedures, such as local excision. However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require more extensive transabdominal surgery, such as low anterior resection (LAR) or abdominoperineal resection (APR). Others present with locally advanced tumors that are adherent or fixed to adjoining structures, such as the sacrum, pelvic sidewalls, prostate, or bladder. The surgical and oncologic management of these patients varies greatly depending on the stage and location within the rectum. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2522.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Tumors in the upper and middle rectum can usually be managed with LAR, coloanal anastomosis, and preservation of the anal sphincter. Although the resulting anorectal function may be imperfect, the risk of postoperative sexual and urinary dysfunction is lessened by preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves, which is possible in most cases, particularly with total mesorectal excision (TME)  (

         Management of adenocarcinomas within 5 cm of the anal verge  (

          figure 2

         )) poses major challenges. APR has long been considered the standard operation, but it entails a permanent colostomy and a high incidence of sexual and urinary dysfunction. (See

         Sphincter-sparing approaches for lower rectal adenocarcinomas have evolved along two pathways:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For small superficial tumors that are confined to the rectal wall, local excision may offer local control and survival rates that are comparable with APR, while preserving sphincter function. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15311.html" rel="external">

          ●
         </span>
         For larger or more invasive tumors, neoadjuvant therapies have been utilized to promote tumor regression; one potential benefit is increased likelihood of sphincter-sparing surgery, if cancer control is not compromised.

          INDICATIONS FOR NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT

         </span>
         The only definitive indication for neoadjuvant therapy, supported by the results of randomized trials, is the presence of a clinical (c) T3 or cT4 tumor, as defined by the pretreatment staging evaluation. For these patients, we recommend preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemoradiation (CRT) or short-course radiotherapy (RT) rather than initial resection followed by adjuvant therapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'T3/4 tumors'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2522.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         High-quality evidence to support a clear benefit from neoadjuvant CRT, as compared with initial surgery, for other subgroups of patients with rectal cancer is lacking. However, we also suggest neoadjuvant therapy for other "relative" indications, including:

         <a class="local">
          'T1/2 and clinically node positive'

         Tumor that appears to invade or "threaten" the mesorectal fascia on preoperative imaging, given the decreased likelihood of achieving a tumor-free circumferential resection margin (CRM) with upfront surgery (see
         <a class="local">

         On the other hand, the use of preoperative therapy for a distal clinical T1N0 or T2N0 rectal cancer in an attempt to convert the operation from a needed abdominoperineal resection (APR) into a low anterior resection (LAR) or proctectomy with coloanal anastomosis is controversial and not yet an accepted standard of care. However, if the patient is a poor surgical candidate or declines APR, initial RT or CRT may be chosen, followed by a restaging evaluation with MRI or EUS. (See
         <a class="local">
          'T1-2N0 tumors'

         The only definitive indication for neoadjuvant therapy, supported by the results of randomized trials, is the presence of cT3 or cT4 rectal adenocarcinoma  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ). These are patients who, if resected initially, would likely require postoperative RT. Data from randomized trials and a meta-analysis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ] suggest that preoperative therapy is associated with a more favorable long-term toxicity profile and fewer local recurrences than postoperative (adjuvant) therapy; overall survival appears similar. (See
         <a class="local">
          'German Rectal Cancer Study Group trial'

         Given the limitations of current imaging, we consider all patients with cT3N0 rectal adenocarcinoma by EUS or MRI to be appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy, even proximal tumors. However, there is disagreement on this point, and guidelines from both NCCN and ESMO both support upfront surgery for selected patients, such as those with proximal tumors [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal management of cT3N0 rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3N0 based on preoperative EUS and/or MRI) is debated. Some of these patients have a sufficiently favorable prognosis that questions have been raised as to the necessity of postoperative adjuvant therapy after upfront total mesorectal excision (TME). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2529.html" rel="external">
          "Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy", section on 'Can adjuvant therapy be omitted in any patient?'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Others have questioned the utility of upfront therapy for patients with cT3N0 tumors that do not threaten the mesorectal fascia, particularly those involving the upper rectum, given the favorable low rates of local recurrence after TME alone in the Dutch TME trial, retrospective analyses, and one prospective observational study (OCUM) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, as many as one-fifth of these patients may be understaged by preoperative imaging. In a review of 188 patients with EUS/MRI-staged cT3N0 tumors who received preoperative CRT, 41 (22 percent) were found to have pathologically positive mesorectal lymph nodes at the time of surgery [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Given the downstaging effect of CRT, it is likely that an even larger number of these patients would have been found to have node-positive disease (and would have been recommended for postoperative adjuvant therapy) had surgery been undertaken initially.

         Issues related to the accuracy of locoregional staging in patients with newly diagnosed rectal cancer are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

          —
         </span>
         The approach of selecting patients with cT3N0 rectal tumors for preoperative therapy based on depth of extramural tumor invasion is not yet standard, at least in the United States, although this approach is supported in guidelines from ESMO [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of studies have shown that T3 tumors with &gt;5 mm of extramural invasion have a higher rate of nodal involvement [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ] and distant metastases as well as a lower cancer-specific survival compared with tumors that have a depth of penetration of 5 mm or less [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-16
         </a>
         ]. These findings have led some to suggest that it is not necessarily the distinction between T2 and T3 tumors that may potentially govern treatment decisions, but the identification of high-risk T3 tumors with a &gt;5 mm depth of extramural tumor invasion [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. In fact, updated guidelines for treatment of rectal cancer from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) suggest that patients with a depth of invasion beyond the muscularis propria that is 5 mm or less are appropriate candidates for upfront surgery rather than neoadjuvant therapy, even if they are node positive, as long as the levators are not threatened, the mesorectal fascia is clear, and there is no extranodal extension [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While preoperative high-resolution MRI can identify those patients with cT3 tumors and &lt;5 mm of extramural tumor invasion, who may have a good outcome with surgery alone [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

         ], T3 stage subclassification using depth of extramural penetration is not incorporated into tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging  (

          table 1

         For patients who have T1 or T2 tumors  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ) and a suspicion of node-positive disease by MRI or EUS, the determination of "node positivity" can be particularly difficult. Most lymph nodes involved by rectal adenocarcinoma are less than 1 cm, but not all lymph nodes seen with MRI or EUS represent metastatic disease. MRI can assist in the determination of whether small, visualized nodes are likely to be malignant by detecting mixed intranodal signal and/or irregularity of the border. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2522.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Neoadjuvant therapy might be considered an appropriate option for these patients if they had involved lymph nodes. Thus, careful consideration for ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of the lymph nodes should be given to any patient who has a cT1 or cT2 tumor and questionable perirectal lymph nodes.

         Neoadjuvant therapy may also be considered if the preoperative staging evaluation suggests that the tumor invades or "threatens" (ie, is within 1 to 2 mm of) the mesorectal fascia, which is the CRM when TME is performed. Data from several trials indicate that this finding is highly predictive of residual tumor at the CRM, which places the patient at high risk of local recurrence and inferior survival. For anterior tumors, the status of the CRM can be predicted with either EUS or MRI, while for posterior or posterolateral tumors, MRI is the preferred strategy. (See

         Although there are fewer data to validate this approach, these patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative therapy in an attempt to downstage the tumor and permit a CRM-negative resection. One of the main benefits for preoperative, as compared with postoperative, CRT in the German Rectal Cancer Study Group trial discussed below (which did not focus on patients with evidence of mesorectal fascia involvement) was a reduction in the rate of local recurrence.

         For patients with distal T3 or node-positive rectal adenocarcinomas, a major goal of preoperative therapy is to convert the surgical procedure from an APR to a sphincter-preserving operation, such as an LAR with coloanal anastomosis [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-23
         </a>
         ]. Whether or not an APR is required is somewhat subjective, and this makes determining this particular benefit of neoadjuvant therapy difficult to quantify, at least in terms of sphincter preservation. Sphincter preservation rates are highly dependent on the skill and experience of the surgeon, factors that are difficult to document.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common method to determine if preoperative therapy has increased the rate of sphincter preservation is through clinical assessment, in which the operating surgeon examines the patient prior to the start of therapy and declares the type of operation required [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. In the population under study, this rate is then compared with the actual operation that was carried out.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, few reported series provide results from patients who underwent such a prospective assessment by their surgeon and were declared to need an APR before the start of preoperative therapy. The incidence of sphincter preservation in such reports ranges from 39 to 94 percent, averaging 67 percent  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63971" href="/z/d/graphic/63971.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         High-quality definitive evidence is lacking that preoperative therapy can consistently convert patients who need an APR to where a LAR is feasible. The German trial of preoperative versus postoperative CRT demonstrated that patients undergoing preoperative CRT were twice as likely to undergo a sphincter-sparing operation (39 versus 19 percent) [

         Local excision for high-risk T1-3 rectal cancer remains an area of intense controversy where opinions are based on small experiences in patient cohorts with variable risks of nodal and thus local and systemic recurrence. We continue to advise caution in adopting these approaches as well as the need to have lengthy and complex discussion with patients regarding the potential risks of local recurrence and death. We believe that these risks are often poorly understood by patients and their caregivers. This approach is consistent with guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and ESMO, which both consider that transabdominal surgery is the preferred approach in this setting unless the patient is at high surgical risk because of age, frailty, extensive comorbidity, or refuses transabdominal surgery [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The use of preoperative therapy for a distal clinical T1N0 or T2N0 rectal cancer in an attempt to convert the operation from a needed APR into a LAR or proctectomy with coloanal anastomosis is also controversial and not yet an accepted standard of care. The major difficulty in this situation is that many of these patients, if operated on initially, would be found to have node-negative pathologic T1 to T2 tumors for which neither RT nor chemotherapy would be recommended. At many institutions, the decision to use neoadjuvant therapy commits the treating team to both the RT and a four-month course of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. This is because of the significant downstaging that often occurs with neoadjuvant therapy. Patients who are found to have negative nodes following neoadjuvant therapy may have been positive at presentation, and the presence of positive nodes is a marker for an increased risk of systemic recurrence. (See

        <p>
         However, if the patient is a poor surgical candidate or declines APR, initial RT or CRT may be chosen, followed by a restaging evaluation with MRI or EUS. A sphincter-sparing resection should only be undertaken at that time if a negative distal margin can be achieved and if presurgical anorectal sphincter function is adequate. (See

         It is vitally important that patients with newly diagnosed rectal cancer are accurately staged prior to treatment. Staging of distant disease extent as well as locoregional staging modalities are discussed in detail elsewhere; the most important issues are summarized below. (See

        <p>
         A computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate the liver, retroperitoneal nodes, and chest is indicated in all patients. Serum levels of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) should be assayed prior to treatment. Elevated pretreatment CEA levels that do not normalize post-treatment imply the presence of persistent disease and the need for further evaluation. (See

          Locoregional staging
         </strong>
         – The selection of appropriate patients with rectal adenocarcinoma for initial radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT), rather than surgery, is heavily dependent on accurate preoperative locoregional staging, which is mainly accomplished through physical examination, endoscopy, and imaging evaluation with MRI and/or transrectal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).

         Either EUS or high-resolution MRI is an acceptable radiographic method to determine preoperative local tumor stage. Both are more accurate than axial CT scans for assessing the depth of tumor invasion, nodal involvement, and the status of the circumferential resection margin (CRM). However, if available, optimal thin-section (high-resolution) MRI using a surface pelvic phased-array coil MRI is generally preferred when patients are being evaluated for neoadjuvant therapy approaches because of its greater utility in assessing the CRM. EUS is only able to assess the status of the CRM for anteriorly located tumors. (See

          Long-course chemoradiation (CRT) versus short-course radiotherapy (RT)
         </strong>
         – For patients with nonmetastatic rectal cancer who are appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy, the best regimen has not been established. For most patients, we suggest conventional fractionation RT with concurrent fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (ie, long-course CRT) rather than the short-course Swedish approach of RT alone, especially for bulky or T4 tumors. Updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines consider that neoadjuvant short-course RT (or short-course RT followed by chemotherapy) represents an option (although not preferred over long-course CRT with or without chemotherapy) for T3 any N disease with a clear circumferential resection margin, or T1-2, N1-2 disease [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, outside of the United States, short-course RT has been adopted in many institutions as the standard preoperative approach for operable rectal cancer, and this is an acceptable alternative for many patients. We would not pursue this for a bulky or T4 tumor. Many institutions in the United States are using short-course RT in selected patients, such as those with a borderline performance status or substantial comorbidity who may not to tolerate full-course CRT, as well as prior to surgery in the setting of synchronous metastatic disease to minimize delays in initiating chemotherapy.

          Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and selective use of CRT

         – For most patients with clinical T2N1M0, T3N0M0, or T3N1M0 rectal adenocarcinoma who are eligible for sphincter-sparing surgery, we suggest neoadjuvant chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX-6 followed by selective, response-guided use of CRT rather than neoadjuvant CRT alone prior to surgery. In a randomized trial, this approach demonstrated similar disease-free and overall survival. Most patients (approximately 90 percent) also avoided CRT and were presumably spared from any late radiation-associated toxicities. (See

          Nonoperative management for complete clinical responders

         – Nonoperative management for clinical complete responders to conventional neoadjuvant therapy is a controversial issue. Despite the lack of randomized trials, nonoperative management is becoming an acceptable alternative for those patients who experience a clinical complete response (cCR) to neoadjuvant therapy, especially TNT. It should be emphasized that mature data are not yet available to ensure that survival outcomes are equivalent, and this is particularly important given the natural history of rectal cancer and the rate of late recurrences between 5 and 10 years after resection.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Year 2020 consensus-based guidelines from the NCCN state that for patients who achieve a cCR with no evidence of residual tumor on digital rectal examination (DRE), rectal MRI, and direct endoscopic evaluation, an initial nonoperative approach may be considered with an experienced multidisciplinary team. However, there is not uniform agreement on whether nonoperative approaches should be considered standard at this time, even among the authors and editors associated with this topic review. Given the degree to which the risk of local and distant relapse has not been adequately characterized, any decision for nonoperative management should involve a careful discussion with the patient as to their risk tolerance.

         At a median follow-up of 46 months, preoperative CRT was associated with a significantly lower pelvic relapse rate (6 versus 13 percent with postoperative therapy); the difference persisted with longer follow-up, although it was of a lower magnitude at 10 years (7 versus 10 percent) [

The five-year disease-free survival (DFS; 68 versus 65 percent) and overall survival rates (76 versus 74 percent) were similar for preoperative and postoperative therapy, respectively; 10-year rates were also comparable (DFS approximately 68 percent in both groups, overall survival approximately 60 percent in both groups).

         Stage distribution at surgery was suggestive of significant downstaging effects. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage distribution (I to IV) was 25, 29, 25, and 6 percent for the preoperative group, compared with 18, 29, 40, and 7 percent in the postoperative group. Among the 194 patients with low-lying tumors who were thought preoperatively to require an abdominoperineal resection (APR), those undergoing preoperative CRT were twice as likely to undergo a sphincter-sparing operation (39 versus 19 percent).

         – The optimal interval between completion of neoadjuvant long-course conventional fractionation CRT and surgery in rectal adenocarcinoma is not established. However, for most patients who have a radiographic response to CRT as determined by repeat post-treatment imaging, we suggest surgical resection within 7 to 10 weeks following the completion of CRT. Waiting a longer period of time may not improve the pCR rate, and the delay may increase the difficulty of surgical resection and the postoperative morbidity.

         Traditionally, the interval between completion of neoadjuvant conventional fractionation CRT and surgery in rectal adenocarcinoma has been six weeks (approximately 11 to 12 weeks after the start of RT) as this was the duration used in the seminal German Rectal Cancer Study Group trial [

In the German study described above (a six-week waiting time between the end of CRT and surgery), the incidence of grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicity was similar in both the preoperative and postoperative CRT groups (28.8 versus 31.7 percent, respectively), and postoperative morbidity rates were not higher with neoadjuvant therapy [

         Patients undergoing treatment for rectal cancer are also at risk for sexual dysfunction. The risk is higher in those undergoing APR compared with low anterior resection (LAR), in those undergoing non-TME versus TME surgery, and in patients who undergo combined modality treatment that includes RT. The independent contribution of surgical technique (and of nerve preservation in particular) versus that of RT and whether preoperative as compared with postoperative CRT alters rates of sexual dysfunction after treatment for rectal cancer are unknown.

         In the treatment of abdominopelvic tumors, careful attention must be paid to RT technique. It is generally
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         appropriate to treat rectal tumors with anteroposterior-posteroanterior (AP-PA) fields alone. With this field arrangement, the anterior structures receive a high dose; since these structures are not substantially at risk for local failure, the two-field technique results in increased treatment-related toxicity without a significant improvement in local control. At our institutions, we generally treat patients with a four-field box technique using three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT), although a three-field technique with right and left lateral fields and a posterior field is also reasonable. The use of lateral fields permits sparing of a portion of the bladder and some anteriorly placed small bowel.

          Dose and schedule
         </strong>
         – Patients are treated in the prone position. For those with disease limited to the submucosa and muscularis propria, pelvic irradiation to 45 Gy in 25 fractions is given using a four-field technique, followed by the first field reduction, with lateral fields to 50.4 Gy, and a second field reduction (if appropriate), with lateral fields to 54 Gy. Patients are treated at 1.8 Gy per day in five fractions per week. For the initial fields (45 Gy), the superior border should be 1.5 cm above the level of the sacral promontory, and the lower border of the field should be 4 to 5 cm below the defined tumor bed. Laterally, the AP-PA fields extend 1 to 1.5 cm beyond the true bony pelvis. To treat the entire presacral space with adequate margins and the full dose, the lateral fields are designed so that the posterior border encompasses the entire sacrum with a 1 cm margin posterior to the sacrum. Anteriorly, the fields are designed to encompass the previous tumor bed, including the posterior wall of the vagina for females and a large portion of the prostate for males.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         After 45 Gy, lateral fields with an approximately 3 cm margin around the marked tumor bed are typically used for three fractions to bring the dose to 50.4 Gy. This is followed by a further field reduction to a 2 cm margin around the marked tumor bed to bring the dose to 54 Gy. A small bowel series must be performed to ensure that no small bowel is within these lateral boost fields.

          Role of intensity-modulated RT
         </strong>
         – Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is an advanced form of 3D-CRT that changes the intensity of radiation in different parts of a single radiation beam while the treatment is delivered. IMRT relies on computer control capabilities to maximize the delivery of radiation to the planned treatment volume while minimizing radiation to normal tissue outside the target. Early data from retrospective series and phase II trials suggest good compliance, low rates of acute bowel toxicity, and high pCR rates after preoperative IMRT with concurrent fluoropyrimidine therapy [
         <a href="#rid119">
          119-126

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, there are no randomized trials comparing IMRT with conventional 3D-CRT, and its routine use cannot yet be recommended. Where available, we would consider use of IMRT in unique clinical situations that require extreme conformality of radiation to the target (rectal cancer, the mesorectum, and nodes) with avoidance of surrounding normal tissues (small bowel, bladder, pelvic bone) because of prior pelvic RT or underlying comorbidities (eg, inflammatory bowel disease).

         In many countries, short-course RT has been adopted as the standard preoperative approach for operable rectal adenocarcinomas based on two randomized trials demonstrating that this approach is associated with long-term outcomes comparable to those with long-course CRT. However, in many institutions, particularly in the United States, long-course CRT is still the preferred approach for most patients, particularly those with T4 and/or bulky tumors or if the circumferential resection margin (CRM) or complete resection status are predicted to be at risk. Updated NCCN guidelines consider that neoadjuvant short-course RT (or short-course RT followed by chemotherapy) represents an option (although not preferred over long-course CRT with or without chemotherapy) for T3 any N disease with a clear CRM, or T1-2, N1-2 disease [

         Many institutions in the United States are using short-course RT prior to rectal surgery in selected patients, such as those thought not to be able to tolerate long-course CRT, and in the setting of metastatic disease to minimize delays in initiation of systemic therapy. (See

At a median follow-up of nearly six years, patients receiving long-course CRT had a small but statistically insignificant lower cumulative local recurrence rate at both three years (4.4 versus 7.5 percent) and five years (5.7 versus 7.5 percent). There were also no significant differences in the rates of distant recurrence, relapse-free survival, overall survival, or late grade 3 or 4 toxicity.

         There is no widely accepted "standard" approach to timing of surgery after short-course RT and clinical practice is variable. In our view, if neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not used, either immediate surgery (&lt;10 days after the first RT fraction) or delayed surgery (four to eight weeks after the end of RT) is acceptable. Specific recommendations for patients undergoing short-course RT as a component of total neoadjuvant therapy are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Sequencing of RT and chemotherapy'

        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal timing of surgery after short-course RT is debated, and there is no consensus as to the best approach. Most of the major trials described above, which compared short-course RT followed by surgery versus surgery alone, or short-course RT versus long-course CRT prior to surgery, used an interval to surgery of seven days after completion of short-course RT [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,132,133,138
         </a>
         ]. However, in the Dutch TME trial, the median interval between the end of short-course RT and surgery was 21 days [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. An alternative approach is to delay surgery for four to eight weeks, with the possibility of enhanced tumor downstaging and at least some pCRs [
         <a href="#rid139">
          139-142
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, other studies have suggested that an even shorter interval between the end of short-course RT and surgery (ie, zero to three days) might be beneficial, hypothesizing that a poor leukocyte response or treatment-related leukopenia might be contributory to worse outcomes when surgery is delayed, even by one week [
         <a href="#rid143">
          143-145

         The Stockholm III trial, a noninferiority trial that directly compared short-course RT with immediate surgery, short-course RT with delayed (four to eight weeks) surgery, and long-course RT with delayed (four to eight weeks) surgery in 843 patients with resectable primary rectal cancer [
         <a href="#rid146">
          146
         </a>
         ]. It appeared to be oncologically safe to delay surgery for four to eight weeks after the end of short-course RT, with fewer postoperative complications than with short-course RT with surgery within a week. However, the trial took 15 years to accrue and was amended after one year to allow participating hospitals to accrue only to the two short-course RT arms, resulting in imbalances among the groups. Furthermore, there was no concurrent chemotherapy in the long-course RT arm, and very few patients in any of the arms received adjuvant chemotherapy (15, 13, and 19 percent of those in the short-course RT with immediate surgery, short-course RT with delayed surgery, and long-course RT arms, respectively). The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not reported. These deficiencies render the results from the intention-to-treat analysis uninterpretable.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal interval between the end of short-course RT and surgery was later addressed in a secondary analysis of 810 patients who were randomized in the Stockholm III trial and analyzed as treated (not intended); patients were stratified according to the overall treatment time (OTT; defined as the number of days between the start of RT and surgery) [
         <a href="#rid147">
          147
         </a>
         ]. Among the patients receiving short-course RT, there were significantly more complications in those with an OTT of 8 to 13 days than in those with an OTT of 7 days, 5 to 7 weeks, or 8 to 13 weeks. When compared with patients with an OTT of 8 to 13 days, the risks of overall and any infectious complications were significantly lower in those with an OTT of 5 to 7 or 8 to 13 weeks. The risk of any surgical complications was reduced in those with an OTT of 8 to 12 weeks compared with those with an OTT of 8 to 13 days. There were no differences in 30- or 90-day mortality rates among the groups. Oncologic outcomes were not reported. Based on this analysis, the authors concluded that surgery should optimally be delayed for 4 to 12 weeks after the end of short-course RT.

         For most patients with clinical T2N1M0, T3N0M0, or T3N1M0 rectal adenocarcinoma who are eligible for sphincter-sparing surgery, we suggest neoadjuvant chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX-6 followed by the selective, response-guided use of chemoradiation (CRT) rather than neoadjuvant CRT alone prior to surgery. In a randomized phase III trial (PROSPECT), this approach demonstrated similar disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) relative to neoadjuvant CRT alone. Most patients (approximately 90 percent) also avoided CRT and were presumably spared from any late radiation-associated toxicities [
         <a href="#rid148">
          148

         Patients with T2N1, T3N0, and T3N1 rectal adenocarcinoma can be effectively treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by a selective, response-guided use of CRT prior to surgery, based on data from randomized trials [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99,148
         </a>
         ]. Rectal cancer is responsive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and high-quality surgical resection is associated with low rates of local recurrence (12 percent or less) in patients with T2N1, T3N0, and T3N1 tumors [
         <a href="#rid150">
          150
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up of this approach is needed since rectal cancer can have late recurrences (between 5 to 10 years or longer).
        </p>
        <p>
         Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus selective use of CRT also allows most patients (90 percent) to omit RT and avoid its late toxicities. Such late RT toxicities include infertility; premature menopause; bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction; pelvic fractures; subsequent malignancies; and impaired bone marrow reserve. Such deintensified therapy is preferred by most patients, including younger patients with early-onset rectal cancer; those of childbearing age who wish to avoid infertility; those who received prior pelvic RT for a different malignancy; and those who prioritize preserving long-term sexual function, which is an important concern among cancer survivors.

Clinical staging was confirmed using MRI of the pelvis, although contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis plus endorectal ultrasound was an acceptable alternative. Patients could not have the following high-risk features: T4 primary tumor, N2 disease (ie, four or more pelvic lymph nodes with a short-axis diameter &gt;10 mm), a low-lying tumor, or tumor visible within 3 mm of the radial margin (potential compromise of the mesorectal fascia).

         Among those treated with neoadjuvant FOLFOX, approximately 10 percent also received CRT (9 percent preoperatively and 1 percent postoperatively). Most patients treated with neoadjuvant FOLFOX (approximately 80 percent) also received adjuvant FOLFOX for a median of six cycles, which was suggested but not mandated.
        </p>
        <p>
         At median follow-up of 58 months, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with selective use of CRT was similar to neoadjuvant CRT alone for DFS (five-year DFS 81 versus 79 percent, HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74-1.14), OS (five-year OS 89.5 versus 90.2 percent, HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.74-1.44) and local recurrence rates (five-year incidence 1.8 versus 1.6 percent; HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.44-3.46). Both treatment arms also demonstrated similar rates of surgical resection (99 versus 97 percent), pathologically complete (R0) resection (90.4 versus 91.2 percent), and complete response (22 versus 24 percent).

         As expected, toxicity profiles differed based on the timing and treatment. During neoadjuvant therapy, grade ≥3 toxicity rates were higher for FOLFOX than CRT (41 versus 23 percent) [

          148

         ]. Patients treated with neoadjuvant FOLFOX also reported less diarrhea and better overall bowel function, whereas those treated with neoadjuvant CRT reported less anxiety, appetite loss, constipation, depression, dysphagia, dyspnea, edema, fatigue, mucositis, nausea, neuropathy, and vomiting [

         <a href="#rid148">
          148

          153

         Other studies have also suggested that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may permit more selective use of CRT without compromising long-term outcomes in non-bulky, resectable rectal tumors. In a separate phase III trial (FOWARC) conducted in China, 495 patients with clinical stage II or III resectable rectal cancer within 12 cm of the anal verge were randomly assigned to neoadjuvant therapy with either modified FOLFOX6 alone, CRT with concurrent modified FOLFOX-6, or neoadjuvant RT with concurrent FU [

        <p>
         At median follow-up of 45 months, three-year DFS was similar between all treatment arms (77 versus 74 versus 73 percent with FOLFOX, FOLFOX plus RT, and FU plus RT, respectively), as were overall survival (91 versus 89 versus 91 percent) and local recurrence rates (8 versus 7 versus 8 percent) [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99

In preliminary results from extended follow-up of this study, 10-year DFS (61 versus 63 versus 53 percent), OS (73 versus 72 versus 67 percent), and local recurrence rates (9.6 versus 8 versus 10.8 percent) remained similar between the three treatment arms [

         Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) consists of a course of neoadjuvant (ie, preoperative) oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and a course of neoadjuvant RT (either long-course CRT or short-course RT), both of which are administered prior to planned surgical resection of the primary rectal tumor.

         For most patients with locally advanced rectal cancer without distant metastases and any of the following clinical features, we suggest TNT rather than neoadjuvant CRT alone. Such clinical features include:

         In a randomized trial, TNT with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and CRT improved pathologic complete response rates as well as disease-free survival (DFS) and was better tolerated than neoadjuvant CRT alone. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Rationale and benefits'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with a complete clinical response after completion of TNT also have the option of omitting surgery (with close surveillance for disease recurrence), which offers a chance at rectal preservation. (See

          'Avoidance of radical surgery'

        <p>
         For cT3N0 disease that is low lying and would require either an APR or a very low coloanal anastomosis, the decision to pursue TNT for the primary goal of organ preservation is a complex decision that requires careful explanations of the pros and cons with the patient.

         For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, the rationale for TNT is to intensify neoadjuvant therapy by adding neoadjuvant chemotherapy and CRT prior to planned surgery to improve resectability, pathologic complete response (pCR) rates, enhance organ preservation, and improve survival. In a randomized trial (PRODIGE 23), TNT using neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX and conventionally fractionated (ie, long-course) CRT (followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy) improved pCR rates and DFS relative to neoadjuvant CRT (followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy) [
         <a href="#rid155">
          155
         </a>
         ]. However, most data suggest similar overall survival (OS) between these management strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
         TNT increases chemotherapy compliance since systemic therapy is administered in the preoperative rather than postoperative setting. Other benefits include the treatment of potential systemic disease early and more effectively compared with adjuvant administration of chemotherapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Sequencing of RT and chemotherapy'

         <a href="#rid155">

DFS benefit was also seen across clinically relevant subgroups, including patients with clinical T4 disease, node positive disease, low-lying rectal tumors, extramural tumor invasion, and an involved or threatened mesorectal fascia (predicted lateral surgical margin ≤1 cm). For the entire study population, OS was similar between the two treatment arms (three-year OS 91 versus 88 percent, stratified HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40-1.05). Long-term follow-up of OS and DFS in this trial are needed.

         Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX was well tolerated, with most patients (92 percent) completing all courses of chemotherapy. By contrast, among the patients assigned to preoperative CRT, only 79 percent received any adjuvant chemotherapy, and only 81 percent of these completed all six months of therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy also did not increase surgical morbidity or reduce compliance with CRT or adjuvant chemotherapy.

         preoperatively also had less neurotoxicity.

         Similar outcomes for pCR rates, DFS, and OS have also been confirmed in meta-analyses of randomized trials (with or without observational studies) comparing TNT with neoadjuvant CRT alone [

         For most patients selecting between neoadjuvant RT schedules for TNT, we suggest the use of conventionally fractionated (ie, long-course) CRT (50.4 to 54 Gy total administered over 28 to 31 daily fractions) rather than short-course RT (25 Gy total administered over 5 daily fractions). Short course RT is an alternative for those who are anticipated to not tolerate the potential toxicities of long-course CRT.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is extrapolated from a randomized phase III trial (RAPIDO) that demonstrated lower locoregional recurrence rates with neoadjuvant long-course CRT relative to TNT with short-course RT and neoadjuvant chemotherapy [

         In patients with locoregionally advanced rectal cancer, randomized trials have compared TNT using short-course RT and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (followed by surgery) versus neoadjuvant long-course CRT (followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy).

         CAPOX or FOLFOX are appropriate alternatives for less medically fit patients at higher risk of treatment-related toxicity.

         For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who will receive TNT, the optimal order of neoadjuvant RT and neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not established. Our approach is as follows:

         For patients without clinical suspicion for distant metastatic disease on initial staging studies, either sequencing approach (either chemotherapy followed by RT; or RT followed by chemotherapy) is reasonable. FOLFIRINOX is typically administered prior to neoadjuvant RT, per the clinical protocol used in PRODIGE 23; further studies are needed to establish the tolerability of FOLFIRINOX after neoadjuvant RT. CAPOX or FOLFOX may be administered either before or after RT as DFS and OS outcomes are similar regardless of how the treatments are sequenced during TNT.

         For patients in whom metastatic disease is highly suspected, but cannot be clinically confirmed on initial staging studies, we start with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by neoadjuvant RT. By administering chemotherapy first, the clinician can assess if the tumor biology is responsive to initial systemic chemotherapy and whether other treatment approaches are necessary.

         For all patients who start TNT with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, close monitoring for locoregional and metastatic disease progression is warranted. During neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we reevaluate with a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every two months to assess for metastatic disease. We also monitor the primary tumor for locoregional disease progression after two months of chemotherapy with either an endoscopy or a contrast-enhanced rectal MRI.

         Patients whose primary tumor demonstrates an objective response after two months of chemotherapy and who have no distant metastases after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy may proceed to neoadjuvant RT followed by evaluation for surgical resection. (See

         For patients with stable or progressive locoregional disease in the primary tumor and no distant metastases after two months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we discontinue chemotherapy and move directly to neoadjuvant RT for locoregional disease control. This approach is particularly important in the setting of a tumor with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)/high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), a substantial proportion of which may be resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid176">

         <a href="#rid175">
          175
         </a>
         ]. Patients were restaged 8 to 12 weeks after TNT, and those with a complete or near-complete response were offered watchful waiting; those with an incomplete response had TME. At a median follow-up of three years, chemotherapy followed by CRT had inferior rates of organ preservation versus CRT followed by chemotherapy (TME-free survival, 41 versus 53 percent). However, three-year DFS (76 versus 75 percent) and OS (15 versus 12 deaths) were similar between the treatment arms.

         Despite the lack of randomized trials, nonoperative management is becoming an acceptable alternative for those patients who experience a clinical complete response (cCR) to neoadjuvant therapy, especially to TNT. It should be emphasized that mature data are not yet available to ensure that survival outcomes are equivalent to conventional operative management, and this is particularly important given the natural history of rectal cancer and the rate of late recurrences between 5 and 10 years after resection. There is not uniform agreement on whether nonoperative approaches should be considered standard at this time, even among the authors and editors associated with this topic review [

          194

Following local regrowth, the pooled proportion of patients who had salvage therapy was 95.4 percent; sphincter preservation was achieved in 49.8 percent of patients undergoing salvage surgery. Longer intervals between neoadjuvant CRT and assessment of clinical response were associated with lower rates of local regrowth.

         In the eight studies comparing patients managed with a watch and wait strategy with patients who underwent radical surgery with a cCR or pCR, there were no significant differences in distant recurrences, cancer-specific mortality, or overall survival. However, the patients managed with a watch and wait approach did have poorer DFS than those who underwent radical surgery, driven by the intraluminal local regrowth. In the five studies comparing patients with a cCR managed with a watch and wait approach with those who had radical surgery and were found to have a pCR, the two-year local regrowth rates ranged from 4.8 to 21 percent with watch and wait (versus a 0 to 7.7 percent two-year rate of local recurrence after radical surgery). In the three studies comparing patients with a cCR managed with a watch and wait approach versus radical surgery, the two-year local regrowth rate ranged from 3.3 to 30.4 percent with watch and wait (versus a 0 to 2.2 percent local recurrence rate in patients with a cCR who had radical surgery).

         Data on nonoperative management in patients with a cCR following neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer are also available from the International Watch and Wait Database (IWWD), an international multicenter registry [
         <a href="#rid195">
          195
         </a>
         ]. Of the 1009 patients submitted to the registry between 2015 and 2017 who received neoadjuvant treatment and were managed with a watch and wait approach rather than radical resection (which included 192 patients treated in Brazil and 149 who were enrolled in the OnCoRe database, described above), there were 880 with a cCR. CRT was the most commonly used neoadjuvant strategy. At a median follow-up of 3.3 years, the two-year cumulative incidence of local regrowth was 25.2 percent, 88 percent of all local regrowth was diagnosed in the first two years, and 97 percent was located in the bowel wall (3 percent in regional nodes only). Details of surgical treatment were only available for 148 of the 213 patients with local regrowth. In total, 115 (78 percent) of the 148 patients with a local recurrence needed a TME resection for local regrowth; the remainder had local excision. Distant metastases developed in 71 patients (8 percent) during follow-up. Among the patients with local regrowth, the proportion of distant metastases was higher (38 of 213, 18 percent). Five-year DFS for the whole group was 94 percent, and five-year overall survival was 85 percent.

         ]. All 22 regrowths in the watch and wait group were detected on routine surveillance and treated with salvage surgery, and rectal preservation was achieved in 93 of the 113 patients. However, patients in the watch and wait group who had a local recurrence had a higher rate of distant metastases than those whose tumors did not recur (36 versus 1 percent), and survival was inferior in the watch and wait group compared with the surgically treated patients (DFS 90 versus 98 percent).

         Taken together, most of the data suggest that a careful endoscopic, clinical, and radiographic evaluation might be able to identify patients who have a complete clinical response to upfront therapy and who have a good likelihood of local tumor control and may not need surgery. However, none of these data are from trials that randomly assigned patients with a cCR to surgery or no surgery, and they all suffer from significant limitations.

         Local excision is an accepted surgical option for cT1 rectal adenocarcinomas. However, local excision as the sole surgical treatment for ≥cT2N0 rectal cancer after CRT is still considered investigational because of concerns for micrometastases in the mesorectum and residual disease in the excision bed, both of which could contribute to higher rates of recurrence and a poorer outcome compared with definitive surgery. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15311.html" rel="external">
          "Surgical treatment of rectal cancer", section on 'Local excision'

        </p>
        <p>
         There has been increasing interest in the use of transanal endoscopic surgery (TES) as a mechanism for evaluating pathologic response to neoadjuvant CRT in patients with cT1-3N0 rectal cancer, with further surgical treatment dictated by the pathologic findings on the local excision specimen [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. There are conflicting data from systematic reviews as to whether or not outcomes (local recurrence, survival) are inferior in patients who undergo a subsequent TME after a local excision has been performed; the available data are probably insufficient to answer this question [
         <a href="#rid199">
          199,200
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, others have shown that as many as one-fifth of patients with ypT1 to ypT2 tumors after CRT are ypN+, and that local excision would result in untreated metastatic disease in these patients [
         <a href="#rid201">
          201
         </a>
         ]. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For all of these reasons, we do not support TES as the sole surgical treatment in patients with ≥cT2N0 disease who undergo local excision and have any residual tumor after CRT. Furthermore, in patients with ≥cT2N0 tumors who achieved a pCR with preoperative CRT, further prospective studies are needed to demonstrate that long-term outcomes with local excision are comparable with those attained with conventional surgery [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. In our view, local excision should only be used after CRT in patients who are frail or otherwise unfit for abdominal surgery or in the setting of a clinical trial. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ], patients who achieve a cCR after neoadjuvant therapy with no evidence of residual tumor on DRE, rectal MRI, and direct endoscopic evaluation may be considered for an initial nonoperative approach with an experienced multidisciplinary team. There is no standard classification of response based upon DRE, endoscopy, and MRI; one approach, which is based on the schema used at MSKCC, is outlined in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129003" href="/z/d/graphic/129003.html" rel="external">
          table 11

         <a href="#rid202">
          202

         ]. We would consider that only patients who are classified as a cCR are eligible for nonoperative management. For most patients, we would repeat these studies every three months for two years, and then every six months to complete five years of surveillance.
        </p>
        <p>
         A major obstacle to selecting patients who may avoid radical surgery is that pCR can most accurately be determined after a full pathologic examination of the resected specimen. There is no single test that is capable of identifying patients with complete tumor regression following neoadjuvant therapy. A combination of clinical and endoscopic findings does not provide sufficient information to allow identification of patients with a sustained cCR who are likely to have a pCR. The limitations of this approach can be illustrated by a study from the MSKCC in which all patients undergoing preoperative CRT were subjected to resection; 75 percent of the complete clinical responders had persistent foci of tumor that were not detectable on preoperative DRE or proctoscopy [
         <a href="#rid203">
          203
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In our view, the decision to pursue or not to pursue surgery should not be based solely on the absence of clinically palpable or visible tumor after neoadjuvant treatment. A major problem is the risk of lymph node metastases despite complete primary tumor regression. Even in ypT0 rectal cancers treated with TME, the risk of lymph node metastases or mesorectal deposits is as high as 12 percent [
         <a href="#rid204">
          204-206
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prognosis and extent of tumor regression'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The role of imaging for restaging for assessment of the primary tumor and regional nodes after neoadjuvant therapy has been the subject of several studies, and all suggest that neither MRI, computed tomography (CT), transrectal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), or integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/CT alone is sufficiently accurate to identify the true complete responders [
         <a href="#rid207">
          207-219
         </a>
         ]. A major problem with MRI is that it is difficult to differentiate small areas of residual tumor from fibrosis, and readers tend to overestimate the presence of tumor [
         <a href="#rid214">
          214,220-222
         </a>
         ]. PET/CT findings that suggest a cCR are also associated with a low positive predictive value for a pCR (39 percent in one systematic review [
         <a href="#rid223">
          223
         </a>
         ]).
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, MRI has been increasingly used in addition to DRE and endoscopy for this assessment. When MRI is used, as part of the evaluation, the TRG is a critical aspect of the evaluation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129002" href="/z/d/graphic/129002.html" rel="external">

         Upfront immunotherapy followed by nonoperative management for clinical complete responders cannot yet be considered a standard approach for rectal cancers with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR). However, individuals with dMMR tumors who place a high value on avoiding the long-term morbidity associated with surgery and pelvic RT might choose this non-standard approach if they are willing to accept the uncertainty of long-term outcomes, the small risk of fatal side effects from checkpoint inhibitors, and the need for very close follow-up (every four month pelvic MRI, digital rectal examination, sigmoidoscopy with biopsy).

         There are no established guidelines for pelvic irradiation in patients with synchronous, potentially resectable metastases (predominantly in liver), most of whom will begin treatment with systemic chemotherapy. A few studies have sought to elucidate the role of local treatments, such as radiotherapy (RT), in this setting; however, given the small patient cohorts and variable use of chemotherapy, results are not conclusive and treatment must be individualized. For potentially operable patients who still have operable disease after initial systemic chemotherapy, timing of resection of the primary and liver metastases (simultaneous versus staged) is discussed in detail elsewhere.

         The contribution of pelvic RT to outcomes (especially survival) in patients with synchronous, potentially resectable liver metastases is unclear. Consensus-based guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ] suggest that one of the following strategies is acceptable: initial chemotherapy followed by short-course RT or long-course chemoradiation (CRT) and then followed by resection (synchronous or staged), or initial CRT or short-course RT followed by chemotherapy and then resection. In this setting, we prefer short-course RT rather than long-course CRT; this approach is also supported by European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There have been multiple approaches to patients with synchronous, potentially resectable metastases, some of which include RT and some of which do not [
         <a href="#rid238">
          238-242
         </a>
         ]. Information regarding the natural history and patterns of recurrence in patients who undergo complete resection of both synchronous rectal cancer and liver metastases has not been well documented. The following data are available:

         In a retrospective evaluation of 89 patients presenting with synchronous liver metastases and rectal cancer, 30 percent of whom received perioperative RT, 25 patients (28 percent) developed a pelvic recurrence; the difference between those who did and those who did not receive pelvic RT was potentially clinically meaningful, although it was not statistically significant (15 versus 34 percent, p = 0.066) [
         <a href="#rid239">
          239
         </a>
         ]. However, there was little influence of pelvic RT on overall survival. In the subgroup of 56 patients who underwent local treatment for the liver metastases, the two-year overall survival rates were 80 and 74 percent in patients who did and who did not receive pelvic RT (p = 0.616).

         A second retrospective analysis included 185 patients who underwent complete resection of a rectal primary and synchronous liver metastases at a single institution over an 18-year period [
         <a href="#rid240">
          240
         </a>
         ]. Chemotherapy was administered to 180 patients (97 percent), while pelvic RT was given to 91 patients (49 percent) either before (n = 65) or after (n = 26) rectal resection. At a median follow-up of 44 months, 130 patients (70 percent) had a disease recurrence, and these recurrences usually involved distant sites (liver, lung), rather than locoregional recurrences at the primary tumor site, even in patients treated without pelvic RT. Overall, pelvic recurrence was an uncommon event and was observed as an isolated episode in &lt;5 percent of patients. Patients who did or did not receive RT had similar rates of recurrence (63 versus 67 percent), pelvic recurrence (11 versus 16 percent), and isolated pelvic recurrence (9 versus 8 percent). In addition, use of RT did not improve disease-specific survival.

        </p>
        <p>
         In this setting, the influence of chemotherapy and RT on overall survival is likely small relative to the survival benefit of surgically resecting all gross disease, and in our view, efforts should focus on achieving margin-negative resections of both the primary site and metastases above all else. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and RT may enhance the possibility of a complete resection. Even when a complete resection is clearly possible, prevention of recurrence through the addition of chemotherapy and/or RT, delivered either preoperatively or postoperatively, remains a worthy goal, as locoregional recurrence can be extremely morbid. Future studies are needed to sort out the relative benefits of both RT and chemotherapy in resectable stage IV disease.

         For patients who present with synchronous, unresectable stage IV disease and a symptomatic rectal primary tumor, we suggest short-course RT in conjunction with modern combination systemic chemotherapy. This approach may allow patients to avoid surgery, even those with a nearly obstructing lesion. By contrast, a benefit for short-course RT or long-course CRT for asymptomatic patients with unresectable metastatic disease is not established, and we would generally not pursue RT for most of these patients, focusing instead on palliative systemic chemotherapy. This approach is consistent with consensus-based guidelines from the NCCN [

        <p>
         For patients with a symptomatic rectal primary tumor and synchronous, unresectable metastatic disease, creation of a diverting stoma or palliative resection is often carried out before initiation of systemic chemotherapy to obtain fast relief from symptoms and to avoid complete bowel obstruction or perforation necessitating emergency surgery. Another nonsurgical option is placement of a stent (if feasible). (See

        </p>

         If placement of a stent is not feasible, RT with modern combination systemic chemotherapy may allow selected patients to avoid surgery, even those with a nearly obstructing lesion [

This issue was addressed in a phase II study in which 40 patients with symptomatic primary rectal cancer and synchronous unresectable metastases received short-course RT (5 x 5 Gy) and oxaliplatin-based systemic chemotherapy; median survival was 11.5 months, and only eight patients (20 percent) required surgery during the course of their disease [

         – The selection of appropriate candidates for initial radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT), rather than surgery, depends on accurate preoperative locoregional staging, which includes pelvic MRI and/or transrectal endoscopic ultrasound (TEUS). All patients should be tested for deficient mismatch repair (dMMR; germline and somatic tumor testing), given the potential to consider upfront immunotherapy. (See

          Selection of RT schedule
         </strong>
         – For most patients selecting between RT schedules for TNT, we suggest the use of conventionally fractionated (ie, long-course) CRT (50.4 to 54 Gy total administered over 28 to 31 daily fractions) rather than short-course RT (25 Gy total administered over five daily fractions) (

         ) due to lower locoregional recurrence rates with this approach. Short course RT is an alternative for those who are anticipated to not tolerate the potential toxicities of long-course CRT. (See

          Sequencing of RT and chemotherapy during TNT
         </strong>
         – For patients without clinical suspicion for metastatic disease on initial staging studies, either TNT sequencing approach is reasonable (chemotherapy followed by RT; or RT followed by chemotherapy), as the optimal order is not established. FOLFIRINOX is typically administered prior to neoadjuvant RT. CAPOX or FOLFOX may be administered either before or after RT, as DFS and OS outcomes are similar regardless of how these regimens are sequenced during TNT.(See

        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         For patients in whom metastatic disease is highly suspected, but cannot be clinically confirmed on initial staging studies, we start with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by neoadjuvant RT to assess if the tumor biology is responsive to systemic therapy. (See

         Patients who achieve a clinical complete response after conventional neoadjuvant therapy with no evidence of residual tumor on digital rectal examination (DRE), rectal MRI, and direct endoscopic evaluation may be considered for an initial nonoperative approach with an experienced multidisciplinary team. However, there is not uniform agreement on whether nonoperative approaches should be considered standard at this time, even among the authors and editors associated with this topic review. Any decision for nonoperative management should involve a careful discussion with the patient as to their risk tolerance. (See

          Patients with nonmetastatic disease, deficient mismatch repair

         – Upfront immunotherapy followed by nonoperative management for clinical complete responders cannot yet be considered a standard approach for rectal cancers with dMMR. However, individuals with dMMR tumors who place a high value on avoiding the long-term morbidity associated with surgery and pelvic RT might choose this non-standard approach if they are willing to accept the uncertainty of long-term outcomes, the small risk of fatal side effects from checkpoint inhibitors, and the need for very close follow-up (every four month pelvic MRI, DRE, sigmoidoscopy with biopsy).

         For patients with synchronous, potentially resectable liver metastases, any of the following strategies is acceptable: initial chemotherapy followed by short-course RT or long-course CRT and then followed by resection (synchronous or staged), or initial CRT or short-course RT followed by chemotherapy and then resection. In this setting, we suggest short-course RT rather than long-course CRT (
