Parenthood can represent normalcy, happiness, and life fulfillment. Cancer survivors are often fearful that their history of cancer or its treatment will have an adverse impact on offspring conceived after their cancer treatment, such as placing them at risk for malignancy, congenital anomalies, or impaired growth and development. They are also concerned about the risks of cancer recurrence, infertility, miscarriage, and achieving a successful pregnancy outcome.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues of infertility and pregnancy outcome in cancer patients. Related topics on fertility preservation are found separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7440.html" rel="external">"Fertility and reproductive hormone preservation: Overview of care prior to gonadotoxic therapy or surgery"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101430.html" rel="external">"Fertility preservation in patients with endometrial carcinoma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3744745918"><span class="h1">FREQUENCY AND IMPACT OF COUNSELING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ideally, patients facing cancer treatment receive fertility preservation counseling and therapy, if desired and appropriate, prior to initiating gonadotoxic treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119461" href="/d/graphic/119461.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Despite concerns about future fertility and health of offspring, surveys of female cancer survivors in California and Sweden reported that only approximately 50 percent recalled receiving reproductive health counseling [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]; the proportion is higher in male cancer survivors [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. A subsequent study reported that receiving counseling about reproductive loss and the option to try to preserve fertility before treatment was important to survivors, even if they were unable to have children after chemotherapy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Patient education regarding future reproductive function is an important component of the care of individuals with cancer [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Others have noted that the rate of elective pregnancy termination among female cancer survivors was higher compared with sibling controls because of the fear that their prior cancer therapy would affect their children [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. A qualitative study of 34 female cancer patients age 23 to 39 years reported that fertility preservation was important to all and the main patient feelings about fertility preservation were safety (44 percent) and hope (23.5 percent) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Time and/or financial issues were the main obstacles to fertility preservation (82.4 percent). Ninety-one percent (31 of 34) of patients noted that their quality of life and quality of relationships would have been negatively impacted had they not undergone fertility preservation counseling and treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2894760416"><span class="h1">FERTILITY ISSUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infertility in cancer survivors can be caused by injury to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, as well as damage to the organs of the reproductive tract.

Cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes is a proven approach, while cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is considered investigational. In some cases, ovarian function can be preserved by transposition of gonads; auto-transplantation of gonadal tissue is an investigational procedure. The safety and efficacy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists for prevention of ovarian toxicity is controversial and an active area of investigation.</p><p>The primary approach to fertility preservation in men is cryopreservation of sperm. Suppression of testicular function during chemotherapy by administration of GnRH agonists has not been successful.</p><p>These methods for preserving fertility in women and men are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7440.html" rel="external">"Fertility and reproductive hormone preservation: Overview of care prior to gonadotoxic therapy or surgery"</a>.)</p><p>Resources are available to offset the financial costs of these interventions (eg, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.livestrong.org%2Fwe-can-help%2Ffertility-services%2F&amp;token=PDFlNG2fhvHgWoCVpaEyNhmVVYxyEW%2ByPB2MUJ4fI4ZimZ0YFmqa%2FPBFiy%2F3jbAsBXqwB99VOA9XutnXktsj%2Fw%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=4801" target="_blank">LIVESTRONG Fertility</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H112689306"><span class="h2">Assessment of fertility potential after cancer therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The assessment of fertility potential after cancer therapy is challenging because fertility may be transiently impaired. Whether infertility is transient or permanent, and the duration of transient infertility, cannot be predicted reliably. Furthermore, the presence of functioning gonads does not reliably predict that pregnancy will occur.</p><p>Premenopausal women who have amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles should be evaluated for premature ovarian failure. The clinical manifestations are similar to those in women with spontaneous ovarian failure. However, in young women with amenorrhea after chemotherapy, diagnosis of premature ovarian failure can be problematic since ovarian dysfunction may not be permanent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7443.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Premenopausal women with regular menstrual cycles should undergo assessment of ovarian reserve. A low anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) level may be the best test for prediction of diminished ovarian reserve in this population [<a href="#rid14">14-17</a>]. Data from a variety of infertility patients (including breast cancer survivors) planning in vitro fertilization (IVF) suggest that a low AMH level before the procedure is a useful marker for predicting women at risk for a poor response or no response to ovarian stimulation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5445.html" rel="external">"Female infertility: Evaluation", section on 'Assessment of ovarian reserve'</a>.)</p><p>In men, fertility potential is evaluated by semen analysis. If repeated semen analyses demonstrate severe oligozoospermia (less than 5 million spermatozoa/mL) or azoospermia, basal serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone should be measured. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7453.html" rel="external">"Approach to the male with infertility"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19042801"><span class="h2">Risk of cancer recurrence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With the possible exception of gestational trophoblastic disease, pregnancy does not affect the risk of recurrence of any type of cancer. In particular, the risk of recurrent melanoma [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>] or breast cancer, including estrogen-sensitive breast cancer [<a href="#rid20">20-23</a>], does not appear to be affected by a subsequent pregnancy. A multicenter retrospective cohort study comparing breast cancer patients who did (333 women) and did not (874 women) become pregnant reported no impact of pregnancy status on disease-free survival for women with either estrogen receptor (ER) positive or negative breast cancer [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Pregnant women had somewhat better overall survival (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.97), with no impact of emergency department status. Pregnancy outcome and breast cancer-to-pregnancy interval did not appear to impact the risk of relapse. </p><p>The optimal timing of pregnancy after conclusion of cancer treatment is uncertain and depends, in part, on patient-specific factors (eg, type of treatment, tumor type, prognosis). In general, as the highest risk for cancer recurrence is in the first two years after completing treatment, most authors suggest waiting this time period before attempting conception, after a thorough evaluation confirming cancer remission or cure. However, a pregnancy that occurs spontaneously within the first two years after completing cancer treatment does not suggest that cancer is more likely to recur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/786.html" rel="external">"Gestational breast cancer: Epidemiology and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7618.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H112689416"><span class="h2">Treatment of infertility</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The treatment of infertility after cancer therapy depends on the cause(s). Several factors may be contributing to infertility and some or all of these factors may have been present prior to therapy. Treatment is generally the same as that for patients without a history of cancer. Exceptions may include estrogen receptor positive breast cancer survivors and women treated with high-dose radiation involving the uterus. Women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer may benefit from ovulation induction with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> or aromatase inhibitors. Women with a history of uterine radiation are counseled that limited evidence suggests lower fecundity and an increased incidence of pregnancy complications after uterine radiation [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5448.html" rel="external">"Female infertility: Treatments"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7452.html" rel="external">"Treatments for male infertility"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7440.html" rel="external">"Fertility and reproductive hormone preservation: Overview of care prior to gonadotoxic therapy or surgery"</a>.)</p><p>Female cancer survivors who elect in vitro fertilization (IVF) are counseled regarding the options of using autologous or donor oocytes. For female cancer survivors diagnosed within the five years prior to undergoing assisted reproductive techniques (ART), use of donor oocytes appears to result in higher live birth rates compared with autologous oocytes. In a population-based cohort study of women undergoing IVF with autologous oocytes within five years of entry into a cancer registry, women with prior cancer treatments (all types) had reductions of greater than 60 percent in pregnancy and live birth rates compared with women without cancer [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Of the cancer survivors, the live birth rate varied from 54 percent for women with melanoma to 14 percent for women with breast cancer (the average live birth rate after IVF for women without cancer was 47 percent). In contrast, when women underwent IVF with donor oocytes, there were no differences in the pregnancy rates regardless of cancer treatment or cancer type. Once women with cancer became pregnant, their likelihood of having a live birth did not differ significantly from women without cancer whether donor or autologous oocytes were used. Of note, women who were diagnosed with breast cancer more than six months prior to ART had a live birth rate similar to the overall live birth rate for women with cancer (23.3 versus 24.7 percent). While more data are needed, this study suggests a negative effect of recent malignancy itself on ART success separate from the negative impact of chemotherapy on ovarian follicles. </p><p>Men with severe oligospermia may require IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

Over 170,000 mothers and fathers were included. The incidence of cancer was similar in the parents of anomalous and nonanomalous children. In addition, there was no association between congenital anomalies in offspring and any type of cancer treatment (eg, radiation therapy or chemotherapeutic treatment with an alkylating agent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An international study of over 25,000 survivors of childhood cancer in the United States and Denmark who gave birth to or fathered over 6000 children reported no significant difference in the incidence of genetic disease in children born to survivors and those born to sibling controls (3.7 and 4.1 percent, respectively, in the United States and 6.1 and 5.0 percent, respectively in Denmark) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The offspring of 1915 female survivors of childhood or adolescent cancer had a gender ratio (male:female) of 1.09:1.00 among their 4029 pregnancies [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

This finding argues against transmission of lethal X-linked mutations as a result of cancer treatment. Similar findings have been reported by others [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p></p><p>In contrast to these generally reassuring studies, at least two studies have observed an increased risk of congenital anomalies in offspring of cancer survivors. One was a relatively small study of survivors of Wilms' tumor treated with radiation therapy that included only 20 malformed infants, suggesting chance may have accounted for the findings [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The other was a population-based study from Sweden and Denmark restricted to offspring of male cancer survivors [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. In this study, offspring of male cancer survivors had a slightly but statistically higher rate of major congenital anomalies than offspring of fathers with no history of cancer (relative risk [RR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.31; absolute rate 3.7 versus 3.2 percent). One explanation for these findings, which are discordant with almost all previous studies, is that offspring of cancer survivors were examined more closely because of their paternal history, resulting in ascertainment bias.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, growth restriction, stillbirth</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (eg, miscarriage, preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth) in female cancer survivors depends, in part, on the type of therapy they received (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery) and to non-treatment factors (eg, age at start of pregnancy, type and site of neoplasm). Chemotherapy does not appear to damage the uterus, which may account for the generally favorable pregnancy outcome in exposed patients [<a href="#rid41">41</a>], while exposing the uterus to high doses of radiation can restrict uterine growth and cause vascular changes that impair uterine blood flow, which may lead to preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth [<a href="#rid33">33,42-44</a>]. However, while early studies suggested no increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes among female childhood cancer survivors or female partners of male survivors [<a href="#rid4">4,31,39,45,46</a>], subsequent studies have reported increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and preeclampsia. </p><p>A 2017 registry study comparing pregnancy outcomes of nearly 2600 adolescent and young adult cancer survivors with nearly 13,000 control women reported an approximately 50 percent increased prevalence of preterm birth and low birth weight in the cancer survivors [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. In a 2018 prospective cohort study comparing donor-egg pregnancy outcomes in 31 women with a history of cancer with 212 women without, risk of preterm birth and preeclampsia was significantly higher in women with prior cancers [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. In an attempt to understand the factors underlying the seemingly elevated risk of preterm birth, a different study compared registry data of first deliveries from over 1700 cancer survivors with more than 5100 first deliveries of matched controls [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. When compared with control women with the same conditions, cancer survivors only had an increased risk of preterm delivery if they also experienced vaginal bleeding or preeclampsia. It is unknown if physician decision making is influenced by the patient's cancer history and results in lowering the threshold for inducing a preterm birth for perinatal complications such as bleeding or preeclampsia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1398397671"><span class="h2">Timing of conception</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a birth registry study of over 2.3 million births, women with a history of breast cancer had an increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age (SGA), especially if they received chemotherapy or gave birth within two years of their breast cancer diagnosis date [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. A different retrospective cohort study similarly reported an increased risk of preterm birth for any cancer survivor whose pregnancies were conceived &lt;1 year after <strong>starting</strong> chemotherapy. Women who conceived ≥1 year after starting chemotherapy without radiation or ≥2 years after chemotherapy with radiation did not have an increased risk of preterm birth [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p>Cervical surgery for treatment of cervical cancer can also affect future risks of miscarriage and preterm delivery [<a href="#rid51">51,52</a>]. The risk of preterm birth in cervical cancer survivors largely persisted but was somewhat lower in pregnancies conceived after the first year (for pregnancies conceived ≤1 year after diagnosis: RR 3.5, 95% CI 2.2-5.4; for pregnancies conceived &gt;1 year after diagnosis: RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.5) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> – In the CCSS, women who received chemotherapy alone or with other therapies (surgery, radiation therapy, or both) had lower rates of live birth than their female siblings (range RR 0.52 [chemotherapy alone] to 0.71 [chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy]) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This appeared to be due primarily to a higher rate of pregnancy termination, as the rates of miscarriage and stillbirth were generally statistically similar for the survivors and their siblings. In addition, the male:female sex ratio of 1.09:1.0 in offspring of female survivors was similar to that in the general population and in offspring of female siblings of the female survivors, suggesting exposure to mutagenic agents (chemotherapy, radiation therapy) did not increase transmission of lethal X-linked mutations. Lastly, the rate of live birth was not lower for patients treated with any particular drug compared with those not treated with that drug. The most frequently used chemotherapeutic drugs in this study were <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9318" href="/d/drug information/9318.html" rel="external">dactinomycin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9326" href="/d/drug information/9326.html" rel="external">daunorubicin</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The same investigators also compared pregnancy outcomes in the partners of male survivors of childhood cancer with the outcomes in the partners of their male siblings [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Although the proportion of pregnancies that resulted in a live birth was significantly lower for the partners of the male survivors than for the partners of the survivors’ siblings (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.96), this was due, in part, to a higher rate of pregnancy termination among the partners of male survivors compared with partners of their siblings. The rate of miscarriage was generally similar in both groups, with a possibly higher risk for some individual chemotherapeutic agents, which may have been due to chance. The stillbirth rate and the birth weight distribution were similar in both groups. Interestingly, this study reported a male:female sex ratio of 1.00:1.03, which is lower than that in female cancer survivors and the general population. Possible explanations for this finding are chance and lower testosterone levels from exposure to chemotherapeutic agents [<a href="#rid53">53,54</a>]. It is hypothesized that sex proportions of mammalian offspring are partially controlled by hormone levels of both parents at the time of conception and low levels of testosterone are associated with a high proportion of daughters [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> – The partners of men who receive testicular radiation do not appear to be at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome [<a href="#rid33">33,56</a>]. In contrast, girls and young women who undergo pelvic radiation are at risk of developing abnormalities of the pelvic vasculature, which may decrease uteroplacental perfusion; radiation-induced myometrial changes, such as fibrosis, which may decrease uterine elasticity, distensibility, and volume; and injury to the endometrium, which may prevent normal decidualization [<a href="#rid57">57-63</a>]. These changes may account for some adverse pregnancy outcomes (fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, placenta accreta, stillbirth) that have been reported in pregnancies occurring after pelvic radiation [<a href="#rid4">4,31,33,39,42,43,47,57-59,64-69</a>]. The risk of these outcomes depends on the total radiation dose, site irradiated, and the woman's age at the time of irradiation (the prepubertal uterus is particularly vulnerable) [<a href="#rid33">33,63,70,71</a>]. Sex steroid replacement significantly increases uterine volume, endometrial thickness, and uterine blood flow [<a href="#rid72">72,73</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the CCSS, compared with female survivors who did not receive any radiotherapy, female survivors who received high-dose radiotherapy to the flank/uterus (&gt;500 cGy) were at significantly increased risk of preterm birth (50.0 versus 19.6 percent), low birth weight (36.2 versus 7.6 percent), and having an SGA infant (18.2 versus 7.8 percent) [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. These risks were also noted at lower uterine radiotherapy doses (starting at 50 cGy for preterm birth and at 250 cGy for low birth weight). In addition, uterine and ovarian irradiation significantly increased the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death at doses greater than 10 Gy (RR 9.1, 95% CI 3.4-24.6; 5/18 [18 percent]) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. For girls treated before menarche, irradiation of the uterus and ovaries at doses as low as 1.00 to 2.49 Gy significantly increased the risk of stillbirth or neonatal death (RR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2-19.0; 3/69 [4 percent]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Large studies of survivors of Wilms' tumor have compared the pregnancy outcome of those who did or did not receive abdominal radiotherapy [<a href="#rid39">39,44,64</a>].

Patients who received flank radiation may benefit from cervical length screening at their 18-week ultrasound, but patients exposed to radiation in other locations or to chemotherapy do not have an increased risk for spontaneous preterm labor.
