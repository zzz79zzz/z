Many aspects of the treatment of stage III disease are controversial. Unfortunately, the data supporting treatment approaches in specific patient subsets are often subject to a number of limitations; for example, that the trials involved heterogeneous patient populations; the definition of stage III disease has changed over time; and early studies were frequently inadequately powered to detect small differences in therapeutic outcome, were not randomized, or had limited duration of follow-up. Major improvements in therapy, including the use of more active chemotherapy agents and refinements in radiation and surgical techniques, also limit the interpretation of earlier clinical trials. Finally, improvements in pretreatment staging have led to reclassification of patients with relatively minimal metastatic disease as stage IV rather than stage III, leading to a prolonging in the apparent overall survival of both stage III and IV patients [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Taking these study limitations into consideration, the treatment approach for stage III disease presented here is consistent with guidelines from the American Society for Radiation Oncology [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>], which have been endorsed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>The initial approach to staging of NSCLC and its implications for prognosis are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4632.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4602.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p>The management of malignant effusions (classified as stage IV disease in the seventh and eighth editions of the tumor, node, metastasis [TNM] staging system) and the systemic treatment of advanced disease are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6700.html" rel="external">"Management of malignant pleural effusions"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4954.html" rel="external">"Pericardial disease associated with cancer: Clinical presentation and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4607.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">STAGING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H109591591"><span class="h2">TNM staging system</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is used to stage NSCLC  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805" href="/d/graphic/109805.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806" href="/d/graphic/109806.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. For the purposes of this topic, stage III disease refers to the eighth edition TNM staging system, which went into effect January 1, 2018. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4602.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer", section on 'Eighth edition of the TNM system'</a>.)</p><p>Historically, stage III lung cancer was defined as locoregionally advanced disease due to primary tumor extension into extrapulmonary structures (T3 or T4) or mediastinal lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) without evidence of distant metastases (M0). In the eighth edition of the TNM staging system, stage III lung cancers also include tumors greater than 5 cm in size with hilar, intrapulmonary, or peribronchial lymph node involvement (T3N1) or tumors greater than 7 cm (T4), regardless of lymph node involvement. In the previous (seventh) edition, T3N1 tumors were also considered stage III, but the lower size cutoff was 7 cm, not 5 cm, and tumors greater than 7 cm without lymph node involvement were considered stage IIB disease. While there were no differences in the N descriptors between the seventh and eighth editions of the TNM staging system, a new category, stage IIIC, was developed for those with T3/T4, N3 disease, while those with such tumors that have ipsilateral N2 mediastinal involvement are now staged as IIIB rather than IIIA. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4602.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer", section on 'Eighth edition of the TNM system'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H109591606"><span class="h2">Mediastinal evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An important component of the staging evaluation is an assessment of the mediastinal lymph nodes. Absence of tumor involvement of the mediastinal lymph nodes remains one of the most important factors in selecting patients for surgical intervention. Options for evaluation include mediastinoscopy and endoscopic bronchial ultrasound. Choice of procedure to obtain biopsy is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15135.html" rel="external">"Surgical evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy", section on 'Selection of biopsy procedure'</a>.)</p><p>Pathologic confirmation of tumor involvement of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (based upon computed tomography [CT] criteria) or metabolically active nodes (by positron emission tomography [PET] criteria) is recommended in patients who are otherwise potentially resectable.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If mediastinal lymph nodes are negative by pathologic evaluation, then resection of the primary tumor along with further mediastinal lymph node assessment at surgery is in order, similar to stage I and stage II disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4642.html" rel="external">"Management of stage I and stage II non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Surgical candidates'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If mediastinal lymph nodes are pathologically involved by tumor, patients are often treated with definitive chemoradiation, although a select few may be offered bi- or trimodality therapy. (See <a class="local">'N2 disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>For patients without suggestion of N2-3 lymph node involvement by both CT and PET criteria, the role of cytologic or pathologic evaluation of the mediastinal lymph nodes is more involved:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Invasive mediastinal staging is indicated for all patients with central tumors; those with potentially resectable T2, T3, and T4 tumors; and those with tumors with enlarged hilar lymph nodes by CT and/or clinical N1 involvement by PET, even if the mediastinum appears clean by both CT and PET criteria [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The role of preoperative pathologic evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes for patients with a peripheral T1a primary lesion and no suggestion of N1 or N2-3 lymph node involvement by both CT and PET criteria is controversial:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Some centers proceed directly to primary resection without preoperative pathologic evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes in view of the relatively low incidence of involved mediastinal nodes identified at mediastinoscopy in this selected population [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>By contrast, other centers advocate offering preoperative pathologic evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes because of the impact on management strategy when occult lymph node metastases are detected. As an example, in one study 6.5 percent of patients with T1 primary lesions had occult N2 disease despite a negative CT and PET of the mediastinum [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">NO CLINICAL MEDIASTINAL INVOLVEMENT PRIOR TO SURGERY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H295653125"><span class="h2">Approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical resection is a key component of the treatment of patients with stage III N0 or N1 NSCLC if a complete resection is technically feasible and the patient’s overall condition is satisfactory  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805" href="/d/graphic/109805.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806" href="/d/graphic/109806.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>Surgery is also used in patients with clinical stage I/II disease who ultimately are found to have pathologic stage III disease at resection (particularly if a thorough pre-resection mediastinal nodal evaluation had been negative).</p><p>Definitive radiation therapy (RT) may be an alternative for patients who technically are resectable but are not surgical candidates for other reasons. (See <a class="local">'Poor performance status'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H104013884"><span class="h2">Clinical settings</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">T3N1 disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tumors greater than 5 cm in size are now classified as T3 as in the eighth edition of the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806" href="/d/graphic/109806.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). When tumors of this size are associated with N1 involvement, they are considered stage IIIA. The appropriate initial management of these patients involves surgical resection if technically feasible after negative invasive mediastinal staging, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for those with completely resected disease. If a complete resection is not technically feasible, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is indicated. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant systemic therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Choice of chemotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Administration of radiation'</a> below.)</p><p>An exception to this approach is made for patients with a superior sulcus (Pancoast) tumor with hilar lymph node involvement or no lymph node involvement, which is generally treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. The management of Pancoast tumors is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4605.html" rel="external">"Superior pulmonary sulcus (Pancoast) tumors"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Multiple tumor nodules</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the eighth edition TNM staging system (as well as in the preceding staging system), discrete tumors in the same lobe as the primary are classified as T3, while nodules in another ipsilateral lobe are considered T4. Nodules in the contralateral lung are classified as M1a.</p><p>Patients with satellite nodules within the same lobe as the primary tumor are candidates for surgery as their initial treatment [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. Patients with ipsilateral nodules in another lobe and negative mediastinal nodes may also be candidates for surgical resection, depending on the location and extent of disease [<a href="#rid11">11,13,14</a>]. Adjuvant chemotherapy is often recommended in this setting, but data are limited for this patient subset. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Although patients with solitary tumor nodules in each lung are considered stage IV, many of these patients actually have synchronous primaries and may have a favorable outcome if treated aggressively. A reasonable approach is full radiographic staging, combined with mediastinoscopy. If that evaluation is negative, a presumption of synchronous unrelated cancers and treatment as such is reasonable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4637.html" rel="external">"Multiple primary lung cancers"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H522757065"><span class="h3">T4N0-1 disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historically, T4 lesions were considered unresectable by definition and were classified as stage IIIB. Even with improvement in surgical techniques, resectable T4N0-1 lesions are uncommon and most T4 lesions are best treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy, as for patients with mediastinal involvement. (See <a class="local">'Choice of chemotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Administration of radiation'</a> below.)</p><p>A small subset of patients may be surgical candidates, but appropriate patient selection is of critical importance. Surgery for T4 disease is contraindicated in the presence of N2 involvement (stage IIIB) or if an incomplete resection is inevitable. The role for surgery in this patient group is not supported by firm evidence, but given the rarity of these tumors, it is unlikely that randomized data will ever be available. Considerations should include the operative morbidity and the experience at the given center. Preoperative induction chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy may be of value [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Choice of chemotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Administration of radiation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H929251362"><span class="h3">Clinical stage I/II, pathologic stage III</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients who appear to have clinical stage I or II disease when pathologic involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes is not detected preoperatively. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4642.html" rel="external">"Management of stage I and stage II non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Surgical candidates'</a>.)</p><p>Despite careful preoperative evaluation, including endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and/or mediastinoscopy staging, mediastinal nodal involvement is identified in the final pathologic specimen in up to 20 percent of patients with larger central lesions. For patients with mediastinal lymph node involvement in a resection specimen, adjuvant chemotherapy can result in a significant survival benefit. Postoperative RT (PORT) may also have a role for these patients and for those with positive surgical margins. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1387149942"><span class="h2">Adjuvant therapy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H745843947"><span class="h3">Adjuvant systemic therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence from clinical trials indicates that adjuvant chemotherapy using contemporary platinum-based doublet regimens prolongs overall survival (OS) in patients with completely resected stage III disease. Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is now considered the standard of care for patients with completely resected stage II and III NSCLC. Data regarding the efficacy of adjuvant systemic therapy in stage III NSCLC are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4636.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy in resectable non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Stage II and III disease'</a>.)</p><p>Data regarding targeted therapy, for certain molecularly defined subsets, and immunotherapy are also found elsewhere.

We suggest adjuvant radiation for patients with positive surgical margins. Additionally, some UpToDate contributors offer PORT to a subset of patients who are found at surgery to have involved N2 lymph nodes. (See <a class="local">'Those with N2 involvement diagnosed at surgery'</a> below and <a class="local">'Timing with chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2478947525"><span class="h4">Positive surgical margins</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The strongest data supporting adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) for positive surgical margins come from a National Cancer Database study of 3395 patients who underwent a resection with positive surgical margins for stage II or III NSCLC between 2005 and 2011 [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Of these, 1207 received PORT to a total dose from 50 to 74 Gy using contemporary RT techniques. OS was longer for those given PORT (median, 33.5 versus 23.7 months without RT; five-year survival rates, 32.4 versus 23.7 percent). On multivariable analysis, this difference was statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92). On subset analysis, a similar improvement in OS was seen with PORT regardless of whether patients had N0, N1, or N2 disease.</p><p>The role of radiation in treating patients with carcinoma in situ only at the surgical margin is uncertain. It is often recommended, given the improved prognosis than those with more extensive disease at the resection margins [<a href="#rid18">18-21</a>]. However, there is no evidence that RT improves the prognosis in these cases [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. There are potential risks and benefits, and ultimately, the decision needs to be individualized, although in practice the presence of carcinoma in situ at the margins is rarely the sole decision-making factor regarding whether or not to use adjuvant RT.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H845209815"><span class="h4">Those with N2 involvement diagnosed at surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although a majority of patients with known N2 disease receive chemoradiation as primary treatment, some patients who have no clinical mediastinal involvement proceed with surgery as initial treatment and are found to have N2 disease at the time of resection.

Approximately 40 percent of these patients had unforeseen N2 disease, which was diagnosed at the time of surgery.
