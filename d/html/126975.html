A health technology assessment from Ontario Health concluded PlGF-based biomarker testing as an adjunct to standard clinical assessment likely improves prediction of preeclampsia [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A PlGF-based test was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2023 for use in pregnant patients hospitalized with hypertension to predict progression to preeclampsia with severe features within two weeks.

Of the 176,925 deliveries with preeclampsia/eclampsia, approximately 47 percent were mild or unspecified preeclampsia, 37 percent were preeclampsia with severe features or HELLP, 1.4 percent were eclampsia, and 15 percent were preeclampsia superimposed upon chronic hypertension. </p><p>Diagnostic criteria, clinical findings, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are reviewed in detail separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6814.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6825.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Antepartum management and timing of delivery"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139247.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Intrapartum and postpartum management and long-term prognosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1662.html" rel="external">"Eclampsia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6778.html" rel="external">"HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6805.html" rel="external">"Gestational hypertension"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116432.html" rel="external">"Chronic hypertension in pregnancy: Prenatal and postpartum care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3067977941"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AMONG PATIENTS WHOSE PRIMARY FINDING IS HYPERTENSION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3217065404"><span class="h2">Chronic hypertension versus preeclampsia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a prospective study that measured blood pressure in 1000 pregnant individuals across gestation, blood pressure gradually fell after 6 weeks of gestation, reached a nadir between weeks 16 and 20, and then gradually increased to prepregnancy levels by term [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Because of the reduction in blood pressure that typically occurs early in pregnancy, an individual with preexistent hypertension may be normotensive when first seen by the obstetric provider. Later in pregnancy, when their blood pressure returns to its prepregnancy baseline, they may appear to be developing preeclampsia if no prepregnancy blood pressure measurements have been documented and are available for comparison.</p><p>In this setting, the factors described below can be helpful in establishing the likely diagnosis. However, when evaluating pregnant patients with hypertension, it is generally safer to assume that new-onset hypertension in pregnancy is due to preeclampsia, even if all of the diagnostic criteria are not fulfilled and the blood pressure is only mildly elevated since preeclampsia may progress to eclampsia or other severe forms of the disease in a short period of time. Clinicians should be mindful that:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypertension occurring before the 20<sup>th</sup> week is usually due to chronic hypertension rather than preeclampsia; however, in rare cases it could be the first manifestation of preeclampsia. This is more likely to occur in patients who become pregnant at &gt;40 years of age in association with in vitro fertilization and multifetal gestation. It also could be the first manifestation of pheochromocytoma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Proteinuria is usually present and increases over time in preeclampsia, occasionally reaching the nephrotic range (greater than 3 g per day); by comparison, protein excretion is usually normal or less than 1 g/day in women with chronic hypertension. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis, a complication of poorly treated chronic hypertension, is associated with very modest proteinuria (1 to 2 g/day) but rarely occurs in young people [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3824.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertensive nephrosclerosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preeclampsia is more common in nulliparas than multiparas, and it is uncommon in multiparas with previously normotensive pregnancies in the absence of change in paternity.

A serum urate (uric acid) level may also help to distinguish chronic hypertension (urate generally not elevated) from superimposed preeclampsia (urate often elevated) [<a href="#rid3">3,7,8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1131208377"><span class="h2">Exacerbation of chronic kidney disease versus preeclampsia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Reproductive-age individuals with chronic hypertension and mild proteinuria (up to 1 to 2 g/day) prior to or in early pregnancy likely have chronic kidney disease (CKD). During pregnancy, worsening hypertension and/or proteinuria may represent an exacerbation of the underlying disease; this is commonly seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Increased proteinuria in the absence of hypertension commonly occurs in pregnant individuals with baseline proteinuria and is usually due to the physiologic hyperfiltration associated with pregnancy.</p><p>However, patients with CKD are also at increased risk for superimposed preeclampsia [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. The ability to accurately distinguish among these possibilities is important as management and complications are different. Quantification of proteinuria and measurement of serum chemistries early in pregnancy are helpful in order to interpret changes that may occur as pregnancy progresses. Factors that can be helpful in establishing the likely diagnosis include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laboratory evidence suggestive of exacerbation of CKD includes the presence of findings specific for disease activity (eg, low complement levels in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus, urinalysis consistent with a proliferative glomerular disorder [red and white cells and/or cellular casts]). An active urine sediment is not a feature of preeclampsia. An elevated creatinine (&gt;1.2 mg/dL [106 micromol/L]) without significant hypertension or proteinuria is suggestive of CKD and would be very atypical for preeclampsia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7205.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy and contraception in patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the first half of pregnancy, worsening hypertension and/or proteinuria is likely due to CKD rather than preeclampsia, which typically develops after 20 weeks and usually in the third trimester. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the last half of pregnancy, superimposed preeclampsia should be suspected when hypertension significantly worsens (especially acutely) or signs/symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975" href="/z/d/graphic/76975.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) associated with the severe end of the preeclampsia spectrum develop.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H41332242"><span class="h2">Gestational hypertension versus preeclampsia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gestational hypertension is diagnosed in a pregnant patient with all of the following: new onset of hypertension at ≥20 weeks of gestation, normal urine protein excretion for pregnancy, and absence of the signs and symptoms of end-organ dysfunction associated with preeclampsia with severe features  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975" href="/z/d/graphic/76975.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). The absence of both proteinuria and signs and symptoms of end-organ dysfunction distinguish gestational hypertension from preeclampsia. Some patients (10 to 25 percent) with gestational hypertension ultimately develop signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. Patients who develop severe gestational hypertension have rates of pregnancy complications comparable to those of patients with preeclampsia with severe features, thus the two groups are managed similarly. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6805.html" rel="external">"Gestational hypertension"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6825.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Antepartum management and timing of delivery"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4161635355"><span class="h2">Autonomic overactivity</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3871164446"><span class="h3">Pheochromocytoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pheochromocytoma is a rare cause of hypertension during pregnancy and may be difficult to distinguish from preeclampsia because hypertension and headache occur with both disorders. Symptoms of pheochromocytoma that help to make this distinction include generalized sweating, palpitations, tremor, pallor, dyspnea, generalized weakness, and panic attack-type symptoms. Some patients with pheochromocytoma have an elevated blood glucose level (impaired fasting glucose, apparent type 2 diabetes mellitus). Antepartum diagnosis is important because intrapartum maternal and fetal mortality are high without appropriate treatment.
