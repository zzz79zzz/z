(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/397.html" rel="external">"Overview of peripheral nerve blocks"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1413150719"><span class="h1">INNERVATION: LOWER EXTREMITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The lumbar plexus is formed by the ventral rami of the first three lumbar nerves (L1, L2, L3) and part of the fourth lumbar nerve (L4). A branch from the 12<sup>th</sup> thoracic spinal nerve (T12) often joins the L1 nerve root  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76701" href="/z/d/graphic/76701.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The lumbar plexus is located in the posterior third of the psoas muscle, anterior to the lumbar transverse processes. It gives rise to nerves that supply the muscular and cutaneous innervation to the lower extremity, including the iliohypogastric nerve, ilioinguinal nerve, genitofemoral nerve, femoral nerve, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, and obturator nerve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72523" href="/z/d/graphic/72523.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The femoral nerve (L2 to L4) runs through the psoas muscle and emerges at the lower border between the psoas and iliacus muscles, beneath the inguinal ligament lateral to the common femoral artery. The femoral nerve innervates muscles involved with hip flexion and knee extension, and provides sensation to the anterior thigh, femur, knee joint, and medial leg  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60926" href="/z/d/graphic/60926.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66562" href="/z/d/graphic/66562.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The saphenous nerve is the terminal sensory branch of the femoral nerve.</p><p>The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (also called the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh; L2 and L3) emerges from the lateral border of the psoas major muscle, crosses the iliacus, and ultimately runs behind or through the inguinal ligament and in front of or through the sartorius muscle into the thigh. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve provides sensory innervation of the lateral thigh  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72523" href="/z/d/graphic/72523.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76701" href="/z/d/graphic/76701.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60926" href="/z/d/graphic/60926.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p>The obturator nerve originates from the anterior divisions of the L2 to L4 nerves. It runs along the medial border of the psoas major muscle, passes through the obturator foramen, enters the medial thigh, and divides into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branch is located between the adductor longus and brevis muscles, and the posterior branch is located between the adductor brevis and magnus muscles. The articular branch, which innervates a small area of the medial aspect of the knee, is derived from the posterior branch of the obturator nerve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72523" href="/z/d/graphic/72523.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76701" href="/z/d/graphic/76701.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60926" href="/z/d/graphic/60926.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p>The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body; it is derived from the L4 through S3 spinal nerves and runs posteriorly down the thigh, continuing below the knee after dividing into the tibial and peroneal (common fibular) nerves. It supplies hip extensor muscles, knee flexor muscles, the motor function of the lower leg, and most of the sensory function of the lower extremity below the knee  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72523" href="/z/d/graphic/72523.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60926" href="/z/d/graphic/60926.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Sensory innervation of the posterior thigh is provided by the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve (also called the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh), which is a branch of the sacral plexus (S1 to S3). It arises from the sacral nerve roots and runs through the greater sciatic foramen beneath the pyriformis muscle along with the sciatic nerve.</p><p>Sensory innervation of the foot includes one branch of the femoral nerve (ie, the saphenous nerve) and four branches of the sciatic nerve (ie, the superficial and deep peroneal, tibial, and sural nerves). The superficial and deep peroneal (fibular) nerves are branches of the peroneal (common fibular) nerve. The sural nerve is a branch of the tibial nerve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72523" href="/z/d/graphic/72523.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105190" href="/z/d/graphic/105190.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1413150725"><span class="h1">LUMBAR PLEXUS (PSOAS COMPARTMENT) BLOCK</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A lumbar plexus block, also known as the psoas compartment block, is an advanced-level block and should only be performed by an experienced clinician. The psoas compartment block is usually used as a supplement to general anesthesia for lower extremity surgery and for management of postoperative pain. It may also be used as a primary regional anesthetic to avoid the sympathectomy and bilateral lower extremity block that would result from neuraxial anesthesia [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. If anesthesia of the lower leg or posterior thigh is required for the procedure, the sacral nerve roots must be blocked separately, typically with a sciatic nerve block [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Sciatic nerve block'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H256425490"><span class="h2">Positioning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position, operative side up, with the operative leg flexed at the hip and knee. The iliac crests and the spinous processes of the lumbar spine are palpated and identified  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66934" href="/z/d/graphic/66934.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H493965953"><span class="h2">Ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This technique uses ultrasound to identify the transverse process and psoas muscle and to determine the depth of needle insertion [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The curved, low-frequency ultrasound transducer is placed longitudinally adjacent to the spine at the second to third lumbar (L2 to L3) level  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107934" href="/z/d/graphic/107934.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) to image the vertebral transverse processes  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109512" href="/z/d/graphic/109512.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Injection can be performed in this orientation. Alternatively, the transducer may be turned 90 degrees  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107936" href="/z/d/graphic/107936.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) to obtain a transverse view of the psoas major muscle, which should appear lateral to the vertebral body and deep to the quadratus lumborum and erector spinae muscles. </p><p>The lumbar plexus lies deep within the posterior one-third of the psoas major muscle, though it is not usually visualized directly with ultrasound. The peritoneum can also be visualized and used as a landmark to avoid bowel puncture.</p><p class="bulletIndent1">The needle is inserted at the cephalad edge (medial edge in transverse orientation) of the ultrasound transducer using an in-plane technique  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97801" href="/z/d/graphic/97801.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). The full length of the needle should be seen as it approaches the target structure, which is the posterior third of the psoas major muscle. After negative aspiration, local anesthetic (LA) is injected in 5 mL increments, with gentle aspiration between injections. Because the psoas compartment is a large, loosely compacted space, a large volume of LA (eg, up to 0.5 mL/kg) is required. Spread of LA within the muscle should be observed.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H982977046"><span class="h2">Nerve stimulator-guided lumbar plexus block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are two methods for psoas compartment block using a nerve stimulator  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66934" href="/z/d/graphic/66934.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A line is drawn from the iliac crest to the spinous process of the fourth lumbar vertebra  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66934" href="/z/d/graphic/66934.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). An insulated needle is inserted on that line, 4 cm lateral to the midline.</p><p class="bulletIndent1">Or</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A line (line 1 in the figure) is drawn between the two iliac crests  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66934" href="/z/d/graphic/66934.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). A second line (line 3 in the figure) is drawn, connecting the lumbar spinous processes. A third line (line 2 in the figure) is drawn through the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) parallel to the second line. A final line (line 4) is drawn perpendicular to lines 2 and 3 at the level of L4 and divided into thirds. The needle is inserted 1 cm cephalad to line 4, at the junction of the lateral and middle thirds of line 4.</p><p></p><p>When using either method, the insulated needle is inserted perpendicular to the skin and advanced until quadriceps muscle stimulation is elicited or bony contact occurs. If bone (presumably the L4 transverse process) is encountered, the needle is withdrawn and directed caudad. The needle is then "walked off" the bone until quadriceps stimulation is obtained with current between 0.5 and 1 mA, although higher current levels can be used. Intraneural injection in this region can result in intrathecal injection (ie, spinal anesthesia). After negative aspiration for blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 20 to 30 mL of LA is injected in 5 mL increments, with gentle aspiration between injections.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H187058611"><span class="h2">Perineural catheter lumbar plexus block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Indwelling perineural catheters may be placed for continuous psoas compartment block for prolonged postoperative analgesia after hip, femur, or knee surgery. The technique for placing catheters is the same as for single-shot injections, using ultrasound guidance or nerve stimulation. An 18 or 19 gauge Tuohy needle is used rather than a block needle, with the bevel oriented laterally to direct the catheter toward the plexus. A 20 or 19 gauge single- or multi-orifice epidural catheter is threaded just far enough to allow the orifice (or orifices) to emerge beyond the needle tip. If resistance is encountered or pain occurs, the needle position should be reassessed.</p><p>Some anesthesiologists prefer to perform the nerve block via the catheter instead of via the needle, in order to confirm proper placement of the catheter tip. This is particularly important when a nerve stimulator technique is used. When ultrasound guidance is used, after removal of the needle, the location of the catheter can be confirmed by visualization of the catheter and spread of LA. We inject several mL of LA through the needle under ultrasound guidance to confirm placement and inject the rest of the bolus through the catheter while visualizing spread of LA.</p><p>The catheter is secured to the skin with a sterile dressing after applying a sterile surgical glue.</p><p>Lumbar plexus catheters are used only for inpatients, because of the risk for fall due to lower extremity motor block and the potential risk of neuraxial spread of LA. We administer an infusion of 0.1% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/z/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a> at 5 to 12 mL per hour.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H187058628"><span class="h2">Side effects and complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because of the deep nature of this block, this is an advanced-level block that should only be performed by experienced clinicians. The incidence of complications of psoas compartment block is low overall, but is higher than with other peripheral nerve blocks [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The most common complication is epidural spread of LA, leading to bilateral block. Other complications include falls due to motor block [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], total spinal anesthesia, renal injury, and retroperitoneal hematoma; extensive retroperitoneal hematoma has been reported after lumbar plexus block [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p>In contrast with many other peripheral nerve blocks, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) recommends that anticoagulation guidelines for neuraxial blocks be followed when performing lumbar plexus block [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

It blocks the sensory innervation of the lateral thigh. This block does not depend on deposition of local anesthetic (LA) near an individual nerve; instead, it works by spread of the LA in a fascial plane. Therefore, this block is not performed with nerve stimulation. It can be done using ultrasound guidance or with an anatomic approach.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H982977555"><span class="h2">Positioning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient is placed in the supine position.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H982977562"><span class="h2">Ultrasound-guided fascial iliaca block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A line is drawn between the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and pubic tubercle and divided into thirds  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64602" href="/z/d/graphic/64602.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). An ultrasound probe is placed transversely to the leg at the junction between the middle and lateral thirds  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109508" href="/z/d/graphic/109508.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) to identify the fascia lata, iliacus muscle, and fascia iliaca  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109510" href="/z/d/graphic/109510.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). The needle is introduced in-plane  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97801" href="/z/d/graphic/97801.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>) inferior to the inguinal ligament and guided beneath the fascia iliaca, and after negative aspiration, 30 mL of LA is injected in 5 mL increments, with gentle aspiration between injections. Spread of LA in medial and lateral directions under the fascia iliaca is evidence of correct needle placement.</p><p>A suprainguinal approach has also been described [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The technique is the same as above but is performed cephalad to the inguinal ligament instead.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H982977616"><span class="h2">Landmark-based fascia iliaca block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An alternative approach to this block relies upon superficial anatomy and loss of resistance with the block needle. The line between the ASIS and pubic tubercle is drawn and trisected. At the border between the lateral and middle thirds, a perpendicular line 2 cm in length is drawn caudally. A blunt needle is inserted and directed cephalad at a 45 degree angle. Two distinct "pops" should be felt as the needle passes through the fascia lata, and then the fascia iliaca. After negative aspiration, 30 mL of LA is injected in 5 mL increments, with gentle aspiration between injections.</p><p>Ultrasound guidance has been shown to more successfully achieve femoral and obturator motor block and sensory block of the medial thigh than an anatomic, loss-of-resistance technique [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. There may be more than two fascial planes in the inguinal area [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Therefore, the two "pops" felt using the loss-of-resistance technique do not reliably correlate with the fascia lata and fascia iliaca; LA may thus be placed incorrectly using this technique.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14673422"><span class="h2">Perineural catheter fascia iliaca block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Continuous infusion fascia iliaca block can be used as part of a multimodal pain control protocol after hip fracture.

It may also be used as a primary regional anesthetic to avoid the sympathectomy and bilateral lower extremity block that would result from neuraxial anesthesia. If anesthesia of the lower leg or posterior thigh is required, the sacral nerve roots must be blocked separately, typically with a sciatic nerve block.
