         Management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is informed by the individual's medical fitness for intensive antileukemic therapy. Importantly, medical fitness is based on performance status and physiologic function, but not on age per se; we do not apply age limits when judging medical fitness.

         – The clinical evaluation assesses comorbid conditions and effects of cytopenias associated with AML. The history should evaluate symptoms associated with anemia (eg, dyspnea, weakness, palpitations) that may impair the quality of life; transfusion history should be documented. The patient should be examined for evidence of infections or excessive bleeding/bruising. Clinical manifestations of comorbid illnesses, including heart disease, pulmonary processes, nutritional deficits, and renal impairment should be documented.

          Fitness categories

          Assigning a fitness category
         </strong>
         – In selecting a fitness category, we seek to protect frail individuals from treatment that they are unlikely to tolerate, while not depriving patients of the opportunity to achieve remission and prolonged survival.

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Age, per se, does not determine medical fitness. However, because of age-related comorbidities, caution should be used when considering intensive therapy for patients ≥75 years old, as most outcomes data with intensive antileukemic therapy came from studies in younger, fit adults.

         Chronic comorbid conditions should be weighted more heavily than transient medical complications of the leukemia itself (eg, infection, heart failure exacerbated by anemia). The burden of AML can contribute to a lack of fitness, and in some cases, treatment may alleviate consequences/complications of AML and enhance the patient's ability to tolerate and benefit from subsequent treatment.

          Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)
         </strong>
         – APL with t(15;17) is a unique category of AML that constitutes a medical emergency and requires urgent and specific treatment because of its distinctive clinical manifestations and complications.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         APL is more likely in patients who present with bleeding or bruising, when leukemic blasts have coarse or dense cytoplasmic granules, and when there are few circulating leukemic cells or a low white blood cell count, particularly if coagulopathy is present. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of the
         <em>
          PML-RARA

         fusion gene and/or an associated chromosomal translocation, as described separately. (See

          Medically unfit, but not frail

         – For most medically unfit patients who are not frail, the goal is to achieve a remission as the most effective way to alleviate symptoms, improve the quality of life, and/or extend survival. It should be recognized that current therapies for this population have not been proven to achieve long-term survival or the possibility of cure. (See

          Frail
         </strong>
         – For frail patients, the primary goals are relief of symptoms and improved quality of life through supportive care. The potential for harm resulting from more intensive therapy is likely to outweigh the benefits. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Goals of care should be established in discussions between the patient and clinicians at the time of diagnosis and periodically through the course of the disease. Discussions should acknowledge that for most patients, AML will be a life-ending disease. Many patients overestimate their long-term prognosis and chance for cure, and they don't recall being offered more than one treatment [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. Mutual understanding between the patient, family members, and practitioners facilitates conversations regarding goals of care, selection of therapy, health care proxies, do-not-resuscitate directives, and end-of-life decisions.

          Benefits of treatment
         </strong>
         – Patients of any age who are medically unfit but not frail can benefit from treatment of AML. Compared with supportive care alone, treatment of AML can relieve symptoms, improve the quality of life, and potentially extend survival.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Some clinicians and patients fear that treatment will cause more harm than good. However, the major causes of death from AML are infection and hemorrhage related to disease-associated cytopenias; treatment of the underlying AML is the most effective and efficient way to control those complications [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. While some population-based studies have suggested that treatment only benefits patients ≤80 years, other studies have documented that treatment of selected patients in their 80s and 90s can achieve high rates of response and improved survival [
         <a href="#rid7">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Compared with supportive care alone, treatment of AML is associated with improved quality of life (note that improved QOL is stated to be associated with supportive care of frail patients, above), including fewer hospitalizations and less need for transfusions and antibiotics [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,11
         </a>
         ]. Improved outcomes are reported in prospective, retrospective, and population-based studies, even while recognizing that retrospective analyses may exhibit a bias that favors treatment for more medically fit and/or younger patients [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9,11,12
         </a>
         ]. United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data of 5480 patients ≥65 years (median age 78 years) reported improved survival in treated patients, compared with untreated patients (median six versus two months, respectively) [

          Timing of therapy

         An important exception is patients who are suspected of having acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), for whom treatment should begin immediately, even before cytogenetic and/or molecular confirmation is available. Features that suggest the presence of APL are described above. (See

         Aside from APL, or in the setting of disease-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation, it is generally not harmful to delay treatment of AML by 96 hours or longer to stabilize the patient's condition and/or characterize the cytogenetic and molecular features of the AML cells. Infections, bleeding, hyperuricemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, and thrombocytopenia should be managed, and comorbid conditions optimized to improve baseline physical function prior to initiating antileukemic therapy.

Each enrolled patient was preselected for a conventional care regimen (CCR; either LoDAC, intensive induction chemotherapy, or BSC); within each CCR subgroup, patients were randomly assigned to azacitidine versus the preselected CCR. Compared with the overall CCR cohort, azacitidine achieved marginally superior median overall survival (OS; 10 versus 7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.85; 95% CI 0.69-1.03) and one-year OS (47 versus 34 percent). Among those preselected for BSC, patients randomized to azacitidine achieved superior OS (6 versus 4 months; HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.38-0.95); OS did not differ between patients who were randomly assigned to azacitidine versus either LoDAC or intensive induction therapy. For patients treated with azacitidine, the rate of complete remission (CR) plus CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) was 28 percent and grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) included febrile neutropenia (28 percent), thrombocytopenia (24 percent), pneumonia (19 percent), and anemia (16 percent).

         – We assess response after three cycles of therapy. However, we generally do not predefine a schedule of routine bone marrow examinations because if blood counts return to near normal, we consider that there is little to learn from repeating a bone marrow biopsy. However, for patients with prolonged pancytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy may be helpful to distinguish residual or recurrent AML from treatment-related hypoplasia.

          Consolidation therapy

         – For patients who are medically fit after achieving complete remission (CR; ie, ≤5 marrow and blood blasts), intensive consolidation therapy is an acceptable option. Consolidation therapy and its benefits and risks are discussed separately. (See

         – For medically unfit, but not frail patients who are responding and tolerating treatment, we generally continue treatment indefinitely as maintenance therapy, to prolong the response and/or extend survival. While some studies have arbitrarily stopped maintenance therapy after one or two years, the optimal duration of maintenance therapy is undefined and should be individualized. Some patients may favor observation rather than maintenance therapy, because they place greater emphasis on reducing the burdens or toxicity of continued treatment.

Compared with placebo, CC-486 achieved superior median OS (25 versus 15 months; HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55-0.86) and RFS (10 versus 5 months). Maintenance therapy with CC-486 appears to delay relapse rather than prevent it, as the survival curves for CC-486 and placebo treatment in this study ultimately converged. Neutropenia was the most frequent grade ≥3 adverse event (41 versus 24 percent for CC-486 versus placebo, respectively); most other adverse effects were mild gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting). Overall health-related quality of life was preserved during CC-486 treatment.
