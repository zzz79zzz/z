         Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness, which is most commonly caused by one of three pathogenic species of the spirochete,
         <em>
          Borrelia burgdorferi
         </em>
         sensu lato. Based on recent phylogenetic analysis, some authors have proposed reclassifying
         <em>
          Borrelia burgdorferi
         </em>
         as a genus,
         <em>
          Borreliella burgdorferi
         </em>
         , but there remains debate.
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         is the primary cause of the disease in the United States. All three pathogenic species,
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         ,
         <em>
          B. afzelii
         </em>
         , and
         <em>
          B. garinii
         </em>
         , occur in Europe and in Asia. Other species of
         <em>
          Borreliella
         </em>
         that have been recovered from humans include
         <em>
          B. mayonii, B. spielmanii, B. bavariensis, B. valaisiana, B. lusitaniae
         </em>
         , and
         <em>
          B. bissettii
         </em>
         . Lyme disease has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, and it also varies in severity due, in part, to differences in the infecting species.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lyme disease was first described in 1977 as "Lyme arthritis" in studies of a cluster in Connecticut of children who were thought to have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The multisystem nature of the infection became clear as involvement of other systems was subsequently identified [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of the clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults will be reviewed here. Issues related to bacteriology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease, as well as more detailed discussions of the clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, are reviewed separately.

         The clinical manifestations of Lyme disease can generally be divided into three phases: early localized, early disseminated, and late disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72018" data-inline-graphics="72018" href="/z/d/graphic/72018.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). However, the clinical features of each stage can overlap and some patients present in a later stage of Lyme disease without a history of prior signs or symptoms suggestive of earlier Lyme disease [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Early localized disease is characterized by the appearance of the characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans (EM), with or without constitutional symptoms  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81270" data-inline-graphics="81270" href="/z/d/graphic/81270.html" rel="external">

          picture 2

         ). EM usually occurs within one month following the tick bite.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Early disseminated disease is characterized by multiple EM lesions (that typically occur days to weeks after infection) and/or neurologic and/or cardiac findings (that typically occur weeks to several months after the onset of infection). Some of these patients have no history of antecedent early localized Lyme disease.

         In the United States, late Lyme disease is typically associated with intermittent or persistent arthritis involving one or a few large joints, especially the knee (sometimes preceded by migratory arthralgias), and/or certain rare neurologic problems, primarily a subtle encephalopathy or polyneuropathy. Late Lyme disease may develop months to a few years after the initial infection. Arthritis may be the presenting manifestation of the disease.

         The basic features of Lyme disease are similar worldwide, but there are regional variations, primarily between the illness found in the United States and that found in Europe and Asia [

         A prospective cohort study evaluated 204 patients with erythema migrans (EM), 119 due to
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         sensu stricto in the United States and 85 due to

         <a href="#rid6">

         </a>
         ]. American patients had higher rates of systemic symptoms (69 versus 51 percent), multiple EM lesions (13 versus 7 percent), and seropositivity (89 versus 31 percent), and a briefer duration of EM prior to presentation (4 versus 14 days).

         Some of the skin manifestations of Lyme disease such as borrelial lymphocytoma, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, and morphea-like lesions, seem to occur exclusively in Europe. In addition,
         <em>
          B. garinii
         </em>
         infection in Europe rarely causes the following late neurologic features: chronic encephalomyelitis (characterized by spastic paraparesis), cranial neuropathy, or cognitive impairment with marked intrathecal antibody production to the spirochete. (See

         EM is a rash that appears at the site of the tick bite, usually within 7 to 14 days after the bite (range 3 to 30 days) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,8,9
         </a>
         ]. While early erythema at the tick bite site is common due to a reaction to antigens in the tick saliva, this early allergic reaction must be differentiated from EM, which requires at least several days before slow expansion of the lesion begins. (See

         They typically expand slowly over the course of days or weeks, often with central clearing, and may reach a diameter of more than 20 cm [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,13

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although central clearing is considered classic for EM, it often requires considerable expansion of the lesion and is usually not yet present in the first days of illness. In an observational cohort study of 118 cases of EM in which

         It is important to note that a skin lesion indistinguishable from EM occurs in Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), an illness principally found in the southeast and south-central regions of the United States, although it has also been seen in more northern states (eg, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maine) as well  (

         A study of patients enrolled in a Lyme vaccine trial addressed the question of the prevalence of early Lyme disease in patients lacking an EM lesion. Forty-two of 269 (16 percent) patients with definite or possible Lyme disease had systemic symptoms without EM; 18 of these had laboratory evidence of accompanying anaplasmosis, or babesiosis and possible Lyme disease, leaving 24 patients (9 percent) with laboratory-defined Lyme disease alone [

          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms in these 24 patients included arthralgias in 17, headache in 13, and neck stiffness in 10. While fever and chills were present in two-thirds of these patients, these symptoms were neither sustained nor prominent [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Lyme disease was confirmed in all 24 patients either by
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         serologies (IgG variable major protein-like sequence-expressed sixth invariant region peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [VlsE C6 ELISA] and/or sonicate Western blot) or a positive polymerase chain reaction for
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         DNA in the blood. Although standard serologic tests for Lyme disease may be negative during the first several weeks of infection, one would expect to see seroconversion after that time if the patient has persistent infection. Moreover, a clinical picture of persistent or recurrent flu-like symptoms after antibiotic treatment in a seronegative patient is unlikely to be due to

Pathology reveals a dense lymphocytic infiltration of the cutis and subcutis.

         Late Lyme disease occurs months to a few years after the onset of infection and may not be preceded by a history of early localized or disseminated Lyme disease. In the United States, arthritis in one or a few joints is the most common feature of patients with late Lyme disease, but neurologic manifestations, such as a subtle encephalopathy or polyneuropathy can also occur. In Europe, patients may develop a chronic skin condition called acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, but this manifestation has not been identified conclusively in the United States.

In the late 1970s, before the cause of Lyme disease and the role of antibiotics in its treatment were known, the natural history of articular manifestations of Lyme disease was described in a cohort of 55 patients followed prospectively from the onset of disease with erythema migrans (EM) through later manifestations of the illness [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Months after the onset of infection, about 60 percent of patients developed joint swelling and pain. A few small joints or periarticular sites (tendons or bursae) were also affected, primarily in early attacks. The number of patients who continued to have recurrent attacks decreased each year. However, in a small percentage of cases, involvement in large joints (usually one or both knees) became chronic and sometimes led to erosion of cartilage and bone. (See

        <p>
         In patients with late-stage disease who develop arthritis, a small percentage have persistent symptoms after appropriate treatment. The basic pathogenetic feature of post-infectious Lyme arthritis is the development of an excessive, dysregulated proinflammatory immune response during the infection, which persists in the post-infectious period. This is described in detail elsewhere. (See

         In Europe, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is the cutaneous manifestation of late Lyme disease that may appear years following primary infection (range 0.5 to 8 years) [
         <a href="#rid24">

         and has not been described convincingly in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is most common in women &gt;40 years of age, but it may occur in younger people. It is typically located on the extensor surfaces of the hands and feet.
        </p>
        <p>
         In its early stages, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans has a slight bluish-red discoloration with associated swelling [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans usually begins as a unilateral lesion, but lesions may become bilateral over time.

        <p>
         In Europe, fibrous induration or nodules (over bony prominences such as elbow or patella) may also develop in patients with late Lyme disease [

          Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome

          38-40

         ]. Criteria for this syndrome include a prior history of Lyme disease treated with an accepted regimen and resolution or stabilization of the objective manifestations of Lyme disease. In addition, the onset of subjective symptoms (eg, fatigue, widespread musculoskeletal pain, complaints of cognitive difficulties) must have occurred within six months of the diagnosis of Lyme disease and persist (continuously or relapsing) for at least six months after completion of antimicrobial therapy. There are also several exclusion criteria  (

         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         , a completed course of appropriate antibiotic therapy, symptoms including fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, cognitive dysfunction or radicular pain persisting for &gt;6 months, a plausible timely association between documented
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         infection and onset of symptoms (ie, persistent or recurrent symptoms that began within six months of completion of a recommended antibiotic therapy for early or late Lyme borreliosis), and exclusion of other somatic or psychiatric causes of symptoms.

          Chronic Lyme disease
         </strong>
         – Chronic Lyme disease is a term that is used by some practitioners and patient advocacy groups. This term has not been clearly defined and can include post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, as well as illnesses and symptom complexes for which there is no convincing scientific evidence of any relationship to
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi

         <a href="#rid15">
          15,41
         </a>
         ]. These patients may have other recognizable syndromes or diagnoses. In one case series, for example, three patients who were diagnosed as having chronic Lyme disease had an underlying malignancy [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47

         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>

          B. burgdorferi

         In a study of 17 patients who received a diagnosis of erythema migrans between 1991 and 2011 and who had 22 paired episodes of erythema migrans, molecular typing of the
         <em>

         gene encoding outer surface protein C (ospC) was performed using
         <em>

         strains that were detected in cultures of skin or blood specimens [

          52
         </a>
         ]. The ospC genotype was found to be different at each initial and second episode of erythema migrans, demonstrating that repeat episodes of erythema migrans in appropriately treated patients were due to reinfection rather than relapse.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reinfected patients may have a marked anamnestic immune response with rapid IgG isotype switching [

          50
         </a>
         ]. However, in patients who are treated during the early stages of disease, the initial immune response is directed against a smaller number of antigens which do not protect against reinfection, or variations in proteins expressed by different strains of
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         may thwart protection from these previously developed immune responses. In contrast, patients who have had late-stage manifestations of Lyme disease often have expanded antibody responses to many additional antigens that protect against reinfection, and such responses typically persist for years, albeit at a low level after successful treatment of the infection. Reinfection has not been reported in patients who previously had Lyme arthritis, a late disease manifestation [

Available evidence suggests that there is no definable congenital Lyme disease syndrome. If adequately treated, Lyme disease occurring during pregnancy does not predispose to congenital anomalies or fetal demise. In addition, a woman who has a history of Lyme disease diagnosed and treated before the pregnancy has no reason for concern. The treatment of Lyme disease, including during pregnancy, is presented elsewhere. (See

         Among 192 residents of areas with high rates of tick-borne infections (Block Island, RI; Nantucket, MA; southeastern Connecticut) who were diagnosed with a tick-borne disease, 75 (39 percent) were coinfected with more than one organism [

         ]. Lyme disease with babesiosis was responsible for 81 percent of coinfections, whereas 9 percent had Lyme disease with HGA, 5 percent had all three infections, and 4 percent had babesiosis with HGA.

         Coinfected patients tend to have more prolonged and more severe symptoms (particularly higher fever, sweats, and rigors) than are usually seen with Lyme disease alone [

          64,67,69

        <p>
         Although no clinical symptoms clearly identify patients with coinfection, standard blood counts may suggest the presence of another pathogen. Lyme disease, by itself, rarely causes abnormalities; in contrast, anemia and thrombocytopenia often occur in babesiosis, whereas leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia may occur in anaplasmosis. Although anaplasmosis and babesiosis are usually asymptomatic infections, they are more of a problem in the very young or very old, or, in the case of babesiosis, in those without a spleen. (See

         <strong>
          Microbiology
         </strong>
         – Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused predominantly by three pathogenic species of the spirochete
         <em>
          Borreliella
         </em>
         (previously referred to as
         <em>
          Borrelia burgdorferi
         </em>
         sensu lato). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         <strong>
          Clinical phases of illness
         </strong>
         – The clinical manifestations of Lyme disease can generally be divided into three phases: early localized, early disseminated, and late disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72018" href="/z/d/graphic/72018.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical stages'

         <strong>
          Early localized Lyme disease
         </strong>
         – Patients in the early localized phase have erythema migrans (EM) and nonspecific findings that resemble a viral syndrome. EM occurs in approximately 80 percent of patients, usually within one month following the tick bite. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Early localized disease'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Early disseminated Lyme disease
         </strong>
         – Early disseminated disease manifests as acute cutaneous, neurologic, or cardiac involvement that usually occurs weeks to several months after the tick bite and may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Early disseminated disease'

         <strong>
          Late Lyme disease
         </strong>
         – Late disease occurs months to a few years after the onset of infection and may not be preceded by a history of early localized or disseminated Lyme disease. In the United States, arthritis in one or a few joints is the most common feature of patients with late Lyme disease. Neurologic manifestations (eg, a subtle polyneuropathy, encephalomyelitis) may also occur, but these are rare. In Europe, patients may develop a chronic skin condition called acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, but this manifestation has not been conclusively identified in the United States. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Late disease'

         <strong>
          Persistent symptoms
         </strong>
         – Nonspecific symptoms (such as headache, fatigue, and arthralgias) may persist for months after treatment of Lyme disease. There is no evidence that these persistent subjective complaints represent ongoing active infection or that repeated or prolonged courses of antibiotics provide any benefit. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome and chronic Lyme disease'

         <strong>
          Pregnancy and breastfeeding
         </strong>
         – Current evidence suggests that there is no definable congenital Lyme disease syndrome. In addition, for women who develop Lyme disease after delivery, there is no evidence that
         <em>
          Borrelia
         </em>
         species can be transmitted during breastfeeding. (See

         with
