Patients are often concerned and disconcerted about the potential for scarring from facial lacerations [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. </p><p>In multiply injured patients, disfiguring or disconcerting facial lacerations should not distract from the initial primary survey and the focus on addressing immediately life-threatening injuries. Bleeding from facial lacerations should be controlled with direct pressure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child", section on 'Primary survey'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">"Initial management of trauma in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22537533"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician should identify the following aspects of the injury:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Traumatic force (eg, high-speed motor vehicle collision with significant likelihood of associated injuries versus fall from standing height with no other symptoms)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Associated symptoms of head injury (eg, altered mental status, vomiting, headache) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6559.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in infants and young children (&lt;2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'History'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127071.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in children (≥2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'History'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age of wound</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Likelihood of wound contamination (eg, clean laceration from table edge with low risk of contamination versus bite wound with high risk of bacterial contamination and need for special prophylaxis) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Potential presence of foreign body (eg, fall onto glass or gravel)</p><p></p><p>The history should also include a comprehensive review of underlying medical history (eg, diabetes mellitus, cancer, prior keloid formation), medication use (eg, immunosuppressive agents), and social habits (eg, tobacco use) that may negatively affect healing and increase the risk for a poor outcome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">"Minor wound evaluation and preparation for closure", section on 'Risks for poor outcome'</a>.)</p><p>The clinician should also inquire about allergies to any medications, especially local anesthetics, and the patient's tetanus immunization status. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2084.html" rel="external">"Allergic reactions to local anesthetics", section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a class="local">'Tetanus prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8807554"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The face should be examined carefully to evaluate for signs of injury to adjacent and/or underlying structures such as the orbits, eyes, nose, midface, teeth, maxilla, and mandible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/343.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of facial trauma in adults", section on 'General examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/343.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of facial trauma in adults", section on 'Examination of specific body parts'</a>.)</p><p>Removal of all foreign debris and blood will permit proper assessment of facial lacerations. Local anesthesia using topical or infiltrated local anesthetic agents facilitates a comprehensive evaluation of the wound with minimal discomfort to the patient. In young children and other uncooperative patients, sedation may be necessary to perform optimal wound assessment and repair. (See <a class="local">'Anesthesia and analgesia'</a> below.)</p><p>Bleeding is a common problem with facial lacerations. Hemostasis permits an appropriate examination. Direct pressure for approximately 15 minutes with or without local injection of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> can provide sufficient hemostasis. Clamping should be avoided to prevent tissue necrosis. Electrocautery should also be avoided in facial lacerations as this will likely delay healing or cause significant scarring.</p><p>The following attributes of the wound should be noted [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Location including the involved facial zone (eg, maxilla, chin, forehead, orbit, nose, temple, zygoma [cheek], lip) and side of the face  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76233" href="/z/d/graphic/76233.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Length of laceration in centimeters</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Depth of laceration (epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous fat, muscle, or bone)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Shape of laceration (eg, linear, curvilinear, stellate, or corner)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of gross contamination or visible foreign bodies</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The presence of skin loss</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whether the laceration is horizontal, vertical, or tangential to the lines of tension (Langer's lines)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50913" href="/z/d/graphic/50913.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Skin tension lines and facial appearance during expression and emotion are important individual characteristics that contribute to overall cosmesis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Relaxed skin tension lines run perpendicular to underlying facial muscle. The best outcomes and cosmesis with repairs involve wounds that parallel Langer's lines and are under minimal tension. Asking the patient to contract and exhibit facial emotions (ie, frowning, smiling, and puffing of cheeks) will allow for an appreciation of facial wrinkling and demonstrate the lines of least tension. However, children and adolescents will have less distinguishable features, whereas Langer's lines are more apparent in the older adult patient. Retraction of the wound edges with evaluation can help identify wounds under higher tension.</p><p></p><p>The clinician should also evaluate for the following associated injuries by facial region:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Forehead</strong> – Deep lacerations may involve injury or complete laceration of the frontalis muscle of the forehead and possible bone exposure. Visible fractures or bony depressions warrant imaging with facial and head computed tomography (CT). Further, extensive bony injuries or facial trauma should prompt evaluation of the sinuses with CT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Eyelid</strong> – The lacrimal system, which begins at the upper and lower puncta and the nasolacrimal duct, should be inspected for injury. Injuries near the medial canthus can be associated with nasolacrimal duct injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53429" href="/z/d/graphic/53429.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). Further, any injury to the eyelids or surrounding structures warrant a full ophthalmic evaluation, including an assessment of visual acuity, of the presence of ocular foreign bodies and the integrity of the globe. Injuries that involve the lacrimal system, full thickness eyelid injuries, eyelid margin lacerations, or wounds through the tarsal plate warrant ophthalmic consultation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13905.html" rel="external">"Eyelid lacerations", section on 'Indications for surgical subspecialty consultation or referral'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nose</strong> – Blunt trauma to the nasal bones should be suspected in patients with nasal lacerations, particularly those caused by marked blunt force trauma. The clinician should assess for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid secondary to a fracture through the cribriform plate (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/343.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of facial trauma in adults", section on 'Midface'</a>) and for injury to the nasal mucosa, septum and cartilage. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Septal abscesses can lead to necrosis and erosion of the septum from prolonged pressure. Therefore, it has traditionally been recommended that septal hematomas be drained, and this seems reasonable in many cases. Drainage of a septal hematoma involves aspiration through a large bore needle or an incision in the septal mucoperichondrium. Anterior nasal packing is placed for compression, along with a course of antibiotics to prevent sinus infection. Extensive or bilateral septal hematomas  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51798" href="/z/d/graphic/51798.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) may warrant consultation with an otolaryngologist. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6558.html" rel="external">"Nasal trauma and fractures in children and adolescents", section on 'Septal hematoma or abscess'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/343.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of facial trauma in adults", section on 'Nose'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Markedly displaced fractures in adolescents and adults may be reduced within six hours of injury. Otherwise, nasal septum deviation or fracture noted during initial evaluation can be referred for reduction by a surgical specialist within seven days. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/343.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of facial trauma in adults", section on 'Nose'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because the endpoint of reduction is difficult to appreciate in children, most pediatric nasal fractures are not immediately reduced in the emergency department. These injuries require evaluation and care by a pediatric otolaryngologist or other physician with similar expertise. Follow-up should occur within five to seven days because rapid healing makes the fractured elements difficult to mobilize after that time. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6558.html" rel="external">"Nasal trauma and fractures in children and adolescents", section on 'Isolated nasal fracture'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cheek</strong> – Deep lacerations to the cheek and to areas anterior to the ear warrant careful evaluation for injury to the parotid gland, parotid duct and/or the facial nerve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77364" href="/z/d/graphic/77364.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55677" href="/z/d/graphic/55677.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The opening of the parotid duct is located on the intra-oral mucosa adjacent to the second molar  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303" href="/z/d/graphic/115303.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). Injury to the duct can be difficult to diagnose; suspicion based upon the location of injury is critical. Facial nerve injury is suggestive. Occasionally, a sialocele may be evident in patients who present long enough after injury for salivary accumulation to occur. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Confirmation of a parotid duct injury, as performed by a surgical specialist, can often be performed at the bedside or in the operating room by cannulation of the parotid papilla using one of several potential probes (eg, epidural catheter, double-j catheter, lacrimal probes, silicone cuff cannula of an endotracheal tube), coupled with careful exploration of the wound bed to visualize the threaded material. The cannulation of the parotid duct serves as a stent to facilitate anastomoses of both ends of the duct [<a href="#rid8">8-11</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The surgical specialist can also identify parotid duct injury by injecting fluorescein-stained normal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> through an intravenous catheter placed in the parotid papilla; extravasation is visualized using a Wood lamp [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The facial nerve traverses the parotid gland. The function of the facial nerve and its branches (temporal, zygomatic, buccal, mandibular, and cervical) should be assessed  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59570" href="/z/d/graphic/59570.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). The facial nerve function should be tested in all five branches as follows [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]: (1) temporal – contract the forehead and elevate the eyebrow; (2) zygomatic – open and shut eyes; (3) buccal – smile; (4) mandibular – frown; (5) cervical – contract the platysma muscle.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mouth</strong> – Lacerations of the intra-oral mucosa involve the buccal mucosa and mucosal reflections which connect the cheek to the mandibular and maxillary surfaces. These lacerations may be associated with injuries to the salivary glands  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303" href="/z/d/graphic/115303.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>), parotid duct, submandibular duct, teeth, lips, and jaw. The lips, teeth, and mucosal anatomy must be thoroughly inspected with adequate lighting. Dental fractures, avulsions, gingival bleeding, lacerations or displacement of the alveolar margin may be associated with mandibular or maxillary fractures, particularly if there is discomfort at the temporomandibular joint or trismus. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6556.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of dental injuries in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6565.html" rel="external">"Mandibular (jaw) fractures in children", section on 'Clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/343.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of facial trauma in adults", section on 'Temporomandibular joint'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8983170"><span class="h2">Diagnostic imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with clinical findings that suggest the presence of a foreign body not visible at the surface or bony injury warrant appropriate imaging, depending upon the type of facial trauma (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/343.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of facial trauma in adults", section on 'Diagnostic imaging'</a>): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Plain radiographs can identify most radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, metal, rocks) while ultrasound can often locate many nonradiopaque foreign bodies.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6319.html" rel="external">"Skin laceration repair with sutures", section on 'Suture selection'</a>.)</p><p>Chromic gut absorbable suture (4-0 or 5-0) is commonly used for closure of intra-oral mucosal lacerations because it is more rapidly absorbed in the oral environment than most synthetic sutures. It is less commonly used for dermal (subcutaneous) or muscle closure because it has increased tissue reactivity when compared to synthetic absorbable suture material. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6319.html" rel="external">"Skin laceration repair with sutures", section on 'Suture selection'</a>.)</p><p>Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) and Poliglecaprone 25 (Monocryl) are often chosen for closure of muscle and subcutaneous layers in deep facial wounds because they provide good tensile strength with less tissue reactivity than chromic gut  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51741" href="/z/d/graphic/51741.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). Some surgical subspecialists prefer poliglecaprone 25 because it is easier to use and may theoretically have a lower chance for infection in contaminated wounds due to its monofilament structure.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6319.html" rel="external">"Skin laceration repair with sutures", section on 'Dermal closure'</a>.)</p><p>Evidence for simple interrupted sutures as the preferred method for closing superficial facial lacerations is primarily anecdotal. Placement of interrupted sutures allows for greater appreciation of the wound repair and can allow for correction as the procedure is underway. Sutures should be approximately 3 mm apart and 1 to 2 mm from the edges to allow for optimal approximation and cosmetic healing on the face. Low-tension areas of the face, areas where skin tension has been reduced by underlying muscular or dermal closure or wounds with irregular edges are appropriate for repair with interrupted sutures. For optimal healing and to minimize scarring, the edges of the wound should be everted  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60681" href="/z/d/graphic/60681.html" rel="external">figure 13</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74454" href="/z/d/graphic/74454.html" rel="external">figure 14</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6319.html" rel="external">"Skin laceration repair with sutures", section on 'Percutaneous closure'</a>.)</p><p>Disadvantages of interrupted sutures include excessive time spent with placement of each individualized suture and the risk for crosshatched marks if sutures are not removed in a timely manner. However, techniques that require less time such as continuous suture placement or stapling are not appropriate for most facial laceration repairs. Running percutaneous sutures do not maintain wound integrity if the suture breaks and do not always result in optimal wound eversion. Staples may increase scarring and do not permit meticulous cosmetic repair. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6320.html" rel="external">"Closure of minor skin wounds with staples", section on 'Contraindications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6319.html" rel="external">"Skin laceration repair with sutures", section on 'Long, straight wounds'</a>.)</p><p>Subcuticular running sutures are an option for straight lacerations of the face if the clinician is experienced in their placement; they may be reinforced with adhesive tape.

Advantages of wound closure with tissue adhesives includes less pain, less time spent on wound repair, and no need for suture removal [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

Furthermore, no significant differences between the results of adhesive tapes and tissue adhesives, as judged by both physicians and parents [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>In general, the upper one-third to half of the face can be well managed with adhesive tapes when wounds are small (eg, &lt;2.5 cm), uncomplicated, and, well approximated with low tension. However, lacerations on the lower third of the face will generally require suturing (ie, perioral region, mandibular and submental regions) due to higher tension and more movement [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. The same considerations as for the use of tissue adhesives generally apply to the use of adhesives tape (ie, minimal tension, hairless surface, superficial epidermal closure without exposure of mucosa, absence of human or animal bite, and absence of moisture)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90472" href="/z/d/graphic/90472.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). To augment the relative low-tensile strength of adhesive tapes, topical tincture of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8809" href="/z/d/drug information/8809.html" rel="external">benzoin</a> can be applied to aid adhesion, but one should be careful not to get it in the wound as it stings and may cause a local inflammatory reaction.</p><p>Adhesive tapes should be applied perpendicular to the length of the laceration with sufficient spacing between strips to allow drainage from the wound. Railroad tracking or placing additional adhesive tapes parallel to the wound to secure the distal edges of the perpendicular adhesive tapes improves adhesion  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef131698" href="/z/d/graphic/131698.html" rel="external">figure 15</a>).

However, careful closure usually results in good cosmetic results.</p><p>In adults, the skin should be approximated with 5.0 or 6.0 nonabsorbable interrupted sutures [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In children, 6.0 absorbable fast-absorbing gut or nonabsorbable interrupted sutures should be used. With the exception of small children, close attention to wrinkles and facial lines are warranted. If needed, the subcuticular tissues and the muscle layer should be closed with as few 4.0 or 5.0 absorbable sutures as possible to prevent accumulation of material that can contribute to palpable nodules and scarring  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52335" href="/z/d/graphic/52335.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p>Trapdoor lacerations are round or elliptical partial avulsion injuries that are held in place by a small pedicle. During healing, these wounds commonly develop bulging within the flap, known as the "trapdoor effect"  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76938" href="/z/d/graphic/76938.html" rel="external">figure 16</a>) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. This effect can be minimized by approximation of the subcutaneous tissue layer to the base of the flap and careful apposition of the skin layers using simple interrupted sutures. Alternatively, small lacerations may be revised by removal of the flap and pedicle. Large lacerations typically warrant primary closure and referral to a plastic surgeon for elective Z-plasty after wound healing.

Thus, eyebrow hair should be left in place and debridement of hair or tissue should be minimal, conserving as much viable tissue as possible [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. For lacerations partially within the eyebrow, the first suture should be placed at the edge of the eyebrow. Minimal malalignment is cosmetically obvious, similar to lip lacerations through the vermillion border [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p>Closure with 5.0 or 6.0 sutures in adults and 6-0 sutures in children should be performed while leaving long tails to allow for easier identification and removal  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52335" href="/z/d/graphic/52335.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

(See <a class="local">'Other considerations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aftercare</strong> – Facial wounds closed with sutures should be covered with a topical antibiotic ointment (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9052" href="/z/d/drug information/9052.html" rel="external">bacitracin</a> zinc). They may also be dressed with a nonadhesive dressing for 24 to 48 hours. After 24 to 48 hours, all wounds closed with nonabsorbable sutures can be left open to the air and cleansed gently with soap and water. The timing for nonabsorbable suture removal depends upon the location of the laceration  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52335" href="/z/d/graphic/52335.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).
