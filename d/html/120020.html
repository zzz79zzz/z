         Regular exercise has been shown to have wide-ranging health benefits. There is evidence to suggest a sedentary lifestyle may be an even stronger predictor of mortality than such established risk factors as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Numerous epidemiologic studies show that unfit individuals are two to three times more likely to die during follow-up compared with their more fit counterparts, regardless of their risk profile, body habitus, or the presence of cardiovascular disease. Because physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor, clinicians should routinely assess and prescribe structured exercise and increased lifestyle activity to all patients [
         <a href="#rid2">

         In this topic, we discuss how to prescribe a beginning exercise program, ensure that exercise is safe and effective, and provide guidance about increasing exercise intensity and volume. Additional discussions of the fundamental concepts of exercise and exercise in the setting of particular conditions and disease states are found in a number of UpToDate topics, including the following:

         When prescribing an exercise program, it is helpful for the clinician to understand the different types and basic concepts of exercise. These are reviewed separately. (See

          Aerobic exercise
         </strong>
         is a general term, often referred to as endurance training, and includes any activity that develops cardiovascular and pulmonary fitness. It is an important component of an exercise prescription with an abundance of evidence supporting its benefits for health [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. (See

         <strong>
          Strength exercises
         </strong>
         provide important health benefits beyond aerobic activity. Also referred to as resistance training, strength training can be performed using bodyweight resistance (eg, push-ups  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104016" href="/z/d/graphic/104016.html" rel="external">
          picture 1

         )), free weights (eg, barbell squats  (

          picture 2

         )), or other tools (eg, machines  (

          picture 3

          picture 4
         </a>
         )) that place loads on muscles, forcing them to work harder. The best programs emphasize multijoint exercises such as the squat, deadlift, and press, which involve all the major muscle groups, working them through a full, functional range of motion. Strength training is typically done two or three days per week. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115880.html" rel="external">
          "Strength training for health in adults: Terminology, principles, benefits, and risks"

         <strong>
          Mobility exercises
         </strong>
         are important for maintaining functional capacity. Particularly among older adults, mobility is important for performing activities of daily living and avoiding falls. The goal of mobility work is to maintain a healthy range of motion, particularly at the shoulders, hips, and thoracic spine. However, separate mobility exercises are not needed for all individuals, particularly those who regularly engage in activities that involve full motion at the major joints. Time spent performing isolated flexibility exercises is not counted towards the weekly goal of 150 minutes or more of moderate-intensity exercise. While flexibility exercise is recommended by such groups as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), systematic reviews have found no evidence to support this form of training for reducing injury [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If stretching exercises are performed to increase muscle flexibility, it is usually best to do so after aerobic or strength workouts when muscles are warm. Studies of stretching have failed to demonstrate benefits in the form of reduced injury rates or improved functional status, but many people feel their movement is enhanced by following a stretching regimen. Stretching is best done using slow and steady movements, rather than bouncing (so-called ballistic stretching). Functional movement activities such as yoga  (

          Warm-up/cool-down
         </strong>
         – In addition to the components described above, moderate and vigorous exercise is best preceded by a warm-up and followed by a cool-down period. A warm-up usually involves doing the planned exercise at a lower intensity and speed and allows the body to prepare for more vigorous activity. A cool-down is done to aid recovery and, following vigorous exercise, can prevent exercise-associated postural hypotension and its manifestations (eg, lightheadedness, syncope). (See

          Frequency

         – Abundant evidence suggests that spreading the total weekly time for aerobic exercise across three or more days produces consistent health benefits and decreases the risk of injury [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Whenever possible, we recommend exercising three or more days per week. If this is not feasible, exercising for the same total period over two days (75 minutes each day), or possibly even one day (150 minutes), may provide equivalent health benefits [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Epidemiologic, observational, and randomized controlled trials have examined the impact of exercise frequency, either per day or per week, as a function of health-fitness outcomes. As an example, in one trial, subjects who were randomly assigned to one of three groups that ran the same total distance, but in one, two, or three sessions daily, demonstrated comparable improvements in cardiovascular endurance [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Each group exercised five days per week. Although both groups made comparable improvements in functional capacity, the repeated short-bout exercise group demonstrated better adherence and a greater average weight loss, 8.9±5.3 kg versus 6.4±4.5 kg.

          Intensity
         </strong>
         – Increasing the intensity of aerobic exercise can produce similar benefits in a shorter period. As an example, 15 minutes of jogging appears to confer the same health benefit as 30 minutes of moderate-intensity walking.

          Time

         – The time required for aerobic exercise each week depends on both frequency and intensity. Benefit can be accrued in many ways, and a flexible approach is encouraged. Bouts of exercise can be performed in 30- to 60-minute blocks or accumulated throughout the day in 5- to 10-minute periods. (See

         The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines recommend the equivalent of 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity each week, with muscle-strengthening activities on two days during the week [

         A systematic review of 19 studies involving 1080 adults participating in moderate-intensity exercise (walking in most studies) concluded that continuous and accumulated exercise (ie, several bouts of approximately 10 minutes each) produced comparable effects on fitness, blood pressure, and blood biomarkers of health [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>

         <a href="#rid3">
          3,17,18
         </a>
         ], and subsequent studies suggest that even shorter periods of light to moderate physical activity, accrued over time, can produce cardiovascular, metabolic health, and even survival benefits [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ]. Evidence accumulated over a decade from reliable, wearable fitness trackers confirms the importance of accumulated bouts of very short-duration physical activity (ie, one- to two-minute bouts) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. In a prospective observational study involving over 400,000 subjects, researchers found that even 10-minute bouts of daily moderate activity were associated with nearly a 10 percent reduction in all-cause mortality [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         While more than 150 minutes per week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise may provide some additional health benefit, returns on the investment diminish as the time spent increases. As an example, in the large observational study described above, the maximum mortality reduction associated with regular, vigorous physical activity approached 45 percent and appeared to plateau between 40 and 50 minutes of daily exercise [

         – A wide range of activities can be used to achieve exercise goals. Walking is often considered the default activity for a beginning aerobic exercise prescription because it is simple, requires no equipment, and is easily measured by time, distance, or step count. Fast walking for 30 minutes generally correlates with ambulating approximately 4000 steps or 2 miles (3.2 km). Guidelines suggest a reasonable total daily step count goal for adults is 7000 to 10,000 [

          25
         </a>
         ]. In a large prospective observational study, subjects who walked just 15 minutes per day or 90 minutes per week had a 14 percent reduction in mortality over an average follow-up of 8.1 years compared with their inactive counterparts [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In a similar study of 2110 middle-aged male and female participants, those taking 7000 steps or more per day had a 50 to 70 percent lower mortality over the 10.8-year follow-up period than those taking fewer than 7000 steps per day [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although walking may be easiest for beginning exercisers, any comparable activity performed at a moderate pace and for the same total duration provides similar health benefits to brisk walking. Activities such as bicycling, water aerobics, doubles tennis, ballroom dancing, or gardening can be done to satisfy weekly exercise goals.

A well-designed resistance training program can help retard such losses and improve strength, function, and quality of life while reducing the risk for many chronic diseases and premature death. The benefits of strength training are reviewed separately. (See

         As with taking prescription medications, getting patients to comply with an aerobic exercise prescription can be challenging. Often, the major barrier is the perceived lack of time due to competing work and family responsibilities. When patients say they cannot find time to exercise, the authors often advise the following:

         – To start the day, park your car further away from your place of work and walk 10 minutes to your worksite. At lunchtime, walk five minutes away from work and five minutes back before eating your lunch. At the end of the day, take that same 10-minute route to walk back to your car. You will now have completed your minimum recommended daily exercise.

Several professional associations, including the ACSM, offer instruction and proficiency standards and competency certification. A knowledgeable coach can help you create an exercise regimen that best fits your functional status and goals while providing guidance on proper technique to help you avoid injury. A gym or health club can not only provide a safe and inviting place to exercise, it can also provide opportunities for socializing that make exercise more enjoyable, leading to enhanced adherence. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease may find the reassurance of a medically supervised exercise program particularly valuable.

         Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, which corresponds to any activity ≥3 metabolic equivalents (METs), has been consistently shown to reduce the health risks associated with chronic diseases and the risk of developing them [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>

          21
         </a>

         Progressive overload is the fundamental principle for advancing exercise. This strategy involves systematically increasing the stress (eg, exercise intensity) placed on the body once it adapts, thereby allowing for continual improvement. Once a regular exercise habit has been established, the patient can advance their aerobic exercise by applying this principle through three basic stages [
         <a href="#rid38">

          Initial conditioning stage and using heart rate to determine exercise intensity
         </strong>
         – This stage should begin at an intensity of about 60 percent of the patient’s maximal heart rate, gradually progressing to around 70 percent of the maximal heart rate. For individuals who have not undergone recent exercise testing to determine their "true" maximal heart rate, we recommend using the standing, resting heart rate plus 10 to 25 beats per minute (bpm) to determine
         <strong>

         intensity.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         As a general guideline, each 10 bpm increase in heart rate from rest to exercise increases energy expenditure by approximately 1 metabolic equivalent (MET). Thus, if a patient increases their heart rate from 70 bpm at rest to 90 bpm during exercise, they are likely exercising at approximately 3 METs, assuming that the baseline energy expenditure at rest is 1 MET.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         This measurement should be supplemented by perceived exertion, which should fall between "fairly light" and "somewhat hard," and symptom assessment (the patient should not experience any adverse symptoms). Exercise is done three days per week, with sessions lasting 12 to 20 minutes. This stage usually extends over a four- to five-week period.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the formula "220-age" has been widely used to estimate maximal heart rate, this approach produces considerable variability in healthy people and even greater inaccuracy among individuals with heart disease. The effects of exercise on heart rate may be blunted in patients taking cardiac medications (eg, beta blockers) and in patients with diabetes whose autonomic nervous systems may not function normally. Consequently, this formula may markedly overestimate the maximal heart rate in many middle-aged and older adults. For these reasons, if a maximal heart rate has not been determined through exercise testing, we counsel patients to rely more on exertional symptoms and perceived exertion to regulate their exercise intensity, and we strongly discourage using the 220-age formula.

          Improvement stage

         – This follows the initial conditioning stage and typically lasts four to five months. This stage involves gradual increases in intensity (up to 70 to 85 percent of the maximal heart rate) and in duration (up to three to five sessions per week). Duration should be increased gradually, until the goal of 30 to 45 minutes per session is achieved, before intensity is raised.

          Maintenance stage
         </strong>
         – This begins after about six months of training and involves exercising three to five times per week at a target heart rate of 60 to 85 percent of maximum, with a duration of 30 to 45 minutes per session. The goal here is to maintain one's fitness level and functional capacity at the desired level.

        <p>
         A person's risk of injury while exercising is directly related to the gap between their usual level of activity and a new, higher level of activity. The size of this gap refers to one's relative overload, and this should be advanced gradually and in small increments to reduce the likelihood of acute cardiac events and musculoskeletal injury. Older and less fit adults are more prone to exercise-related complications; therefore, increases in their exercise activity should be made even more gradually.

         METs are a common measure of exercise intensity based on comparisons of oxygen consumption at rest and during activity (1 MET = 3.5 mL oxygen/kg body weight per minute). Most middle-aged and older individuals initiate exercise programs at approximately 1 to 3 METs, corresponding to walking at about 2 to 3 miles per hour (3 to 5 km per hour) but fail to increase the intensity of their exercise as their fitness gradually improves. This failure prevents them from achieving the maximal reduction in their risk for cardiovascular disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         An appropriate initial training goal for sedentary individuals is to achieve an exercise training intensity that elevates them from the most unfit population cohort (bottom 20 percent), which has the poorest health prognosis. Although the threshold for low cardiorespiratory fitness varies by age, this bottom cohort typically has an exercise capacity of ≤5 METs. Our experience suggests that an exercise capacity above 5 METs can be achieved by exercising with an intensity above 3 METs. This corresponds to moderate to vigorous physical activity. Moreover, progressing from an exercise capacity ≤5 METs to &gt;5 METs appears to provide the greatest relative reduction in mortality [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. With further improvements in exercise capacity, there are continued reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease but at a less dramatic rate.
        </p>
        <p>
         To achieve a training intensity ≥3 METs, individuals can walk on a treadmill at 2 miles per hour (3 km per hour) with a 3.5 percent grade or at 3 miles per hour (5 km per hour) on a level (0 percent) grade. The workloads in each case are approximately 3.3 METs.
        </p>
        <p>
         When exercising on a stationary cycle ergometer, the minimum work rates to achieve an energy expenditure of approximately 3.4 METs are as follows:

         Cardiorespiratory fitness levels are influenced by age and sex, and little additional survival benefit occurs when levels increase from "good" to "excellent," suggesting there is a plateau in the reduced relative risk for cardiovascular disease that can be achieved through exercise. However, a "good" level of fitness must be achieved to reach this plateau. The following tables provide "good" fitness levels and the aerobic training requirements necessary to achieve them  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129005" href="/z/d/graphic/129005.html" rel="external">
          table 7

         ), and the METs expended during a range of recreational activities  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66344" href="/z/d/graphic/66344.html" rel="external">
          table 8
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,41
         </a>
         ]. In creating the reference standards for cardiorespiratory fitness found in the table (expressed as METs), we employed the Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: A National Database (FRIEND) [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Age- and sex-adjusted "good" fitness levels were calculated at the 60
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our experience, if patients can progress to training intensities that are 60 to 80 percent of their oxygen uptake reserve without adverse signs or symptoms, and without excessive ratings of perceived exertion (ie, ≥15 [hard work] on a scale of 6 to 20), it is likely that they can attain the corresponding age- and sex-adjusted cardioprotective fitness levels that are compatible with increased survival [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. As an example, "good" fitness for a 65-year-old man is ≥8.7 METs; accordingly, a training level of 5.6 to 7.2 METs, achieved after 3 to 12 months of gradual, progressive increases in exercise intensity, would be a worthwhile goal (again, assuming the patient remains asymptomatic) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. This training intensity approximates singles tennis or brisk walking (pace of 4.5 to 5 miles per hour [7 to 8 km per hour])  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66344" href="/z/d/graphic/66344.html" rel="external">

         ) or graded treadmill walking (3 miles per hour [5 km per hour] on a 7.5 percent grade).
        </p>
        <p>
         Walking at 2 and 3 miles per hour (3 and 5 km per hour) approximates 2 and 3 METs, respectively. At a speed of 2 miles per hour (3 km per hour), each 3.5 percent grade increment adds an additional MET to the energy expenditure. For individuals who can walk at 3 miles per hour (5 km per hour), each 2.5 percent increase in treadmill grade adds an additional MET. Thus, walking at 3 miles per hour on a 7.5 percent grade would approximate 6 METs.

         Strength exercises provide important health benefits beyond aerobic activity. Once novice trainees develop basic exercise tolerance and strength, programs using barbells provide the most effective means for making further strength gains. The best programs emphasize multijoint exercises (such as the squat, deadlift, and press) that involve all the major muscle groups, working them through a full, functional range of motion. The benefits and implementation of such strength training programs are discussed separately. (See

         High-intensity interval training (HIIT) involves intermittent, usually regularly timed, bouts of higher-intensity activity alternating with brief, often timed, periods of low-intensity activity or rest. While numerous studies have compared the effectiveness of HIIT with moderate-intensity, continuous exercise training (MICT) for improving aerobic capacity and other measures of cardiovascular function in healthy adults and in patients with coronary artery disease, many are limited by inconsistent terminology, small numbers, and significant risk of bias [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43,44
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies of HIIT regimens performed in healthy adults report greater increases in cardiorespiratory fitness (approximately 0.5 METs) and cardiometabolic health compared with MICT regimens, especially when the total work performed during training is comparable [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45-48
         </a>
         ]. Thus, for young, healthy, asymptomatic individuals (including military personnel) seeking to improve cardiorespiratory fitness rapidly, HIIT may be a more effective approach. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1510.html" rel="external">
          "Exercise and fitness in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease", section on 'Type, intensity, and duration of exercise'

        <p>
         Among individuals with known coronary artery disease or at high risk for ischemic heart disease, the safety of HIIT remains unclear and should be undertaken, if at all, with great caution, especially in unsupervised, non-medical settings.

         Water is an essential nutrient for all who exercise. Endurance exercise on average causes one to sweat about 1 L of water per hour while losing 1 g of sodium per hour and burning 80 g of carbohydrate per hour. However, there is wide variation among individuals depending on age, body type, exercise intensity, and environmental conditions (eg, humidity) [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Guidance from the National Athletic Trainers Association of the United States about hydration in physically active adults can be found in the following reference [

        </p>
        <p>
         In general, water needs are best gauged by thirst, especially for light sweaters doing light to moderate exercise. Those performing strenuous exercise or exercising for
         <strong>
          long durations
         </strong>
         (&gt;60 minutes) should determine their rehydration needs based on their sweat rate. The sweat rate can be estimated by weighing oneself nude before and after a 60-minute bout of exercise done at a typical intensity and under typical environmental conditions of heat and humidity. The sweat rate is the difference between the pre- and postexercise weight.
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on the sweat rate estimation, an exerciser should try to replace each 0.5 kg (1.1 lb) of weight lost with 500 mL (17 ounces) of fluid each hour during and after exercise. Of note, this approach underestimates fluid needs for exercise performed at higher intensity or during hotter or more humid conditions than those of the test. Knowing one's sweat rate can help prevent both under- and over-drinking during exercise and help to optimize performance. If a sweat rate cannot be determined, a reasonable strategy is to let thirst guide hydration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Endurance athletes involved in prolonged bouts of exercise (&gt;60 minutes) who ingest excessive volumes of free water relative to their sweat losses are at risk of developing acute hyponatremia. Strategies for preventing and managing exercise-associated hyponatremia are discussed separately. (See

         Training goals are realized more efficiently when appropriate nutritional strategies are implemented before, during, and after training. "Nutrient timing" is the term coined by Drs. John Ivy and Robert Portman to suggest that "when food is consumed" is as important as "what food is consumed" [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. The three phases of nutrient timing include: during exercise, the period immediately after exercise (ie, recovery), and the interval between exercise sessions (ie, maintenance and growth).
        </p>
        <p>
         According to the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) guidelines, the timing of energy intake and the ratio of certain ingested macronutrients (eg, carbohydrate and protein) may enhance recovery and tissue repair, augment muscle protein synthesis, and improve mood following high-volume or intense exercise [
         <a href="#rid54">

         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. For beginning exercisers and many recreational exercisers who are not participating in high-volume or intense exercise, simply adhering to a sound diet rich in vegetables and fruits, lean forms of protein, and healthy fats is generally sufficient, and concern about the details of nutrient timing is unnecessary.

         Endogenous glycogen stores are depleted most by high-volume exercise. These stores are maximized by consuming a diet rich in carbohydrates (8 to 12 g of carbohydrate/kg of body weight per day). For overweight patients, the lean body weight or target body weight can be used to calculate carbohydrate needs. Carbohydrates should take the form of fruits and whole grains; refined grain products (eg, white bread, white rice, pasta, refined and sweetened cereals) should be avoided.

The exerciser should consume approximately 30 to 60 g of carbohydrate each hour during intense aerobic exercise that extends beyond 70 minutes. Ideally, this takes the form of a 6 to 8 percent carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (175 to 350 mL, or 6 to 12 fluid ounces) every 10 to 15 minutes.

         During a standard strength training workout (eg, three to six sets of 8 to 12 repetitions performing exercises targeting all major muscle groups), consuming adequate carbohydrate has been shown to promote euglycemia and higher glycogen stores. In addition, consuming carbohydrate in combination with protein during and after resistance exercise increases muscle glycogen stores, ameliorates muscle damage, and improves training adaptations. Nutrition for adults participating in resistance training programs is reviewed separately. (See

         Meeting the total daily intake of protein is important for exercising individuals. Consuming high-quality protein within two hours of exercising stimulates muscle protein synthesis and aids recovery. Adults who exercise regularly should try to consume approximately 1.5 g of lean protein/kg of body weight daily. For overweight patients, the lean body weight or target body weight can be used to calculate protein needs.

         Common reasons not to exercise include acute illness or injury. In such circumstances, it is often best to rest and recover before engaging in vigorous exercise, although in many circumstances, patients can perform light activity to maintain some level of fitness. Following significant musculoskeletal injury, a complete functional recovery is important before returning to full sport in order to avoid reinjury. (See

         Exacerbations or acute flares of chronic illnesses can restrict exercise. In some cases, alternative forms of exercise that do not exacerbate the acute condition may be used. As an example, a patient experiencing an acute flare of osteoarthritis may be able to swim or perform water aerobics. Societies for several chronic illnesses have established criteria to guide safe participation. Links to topics addressing exercise in patients with specific diseases are provided below.

        <p>
         Many exercise-associated risks can be mitigated by following common sense practices. It is important to encourage patients to "listen" to their body and how it is responding to exercise. The intensity and duration of exercise should be decreased when a person is not feeling well. In general, exercise should be avoided when a patient is severely ill, especially in the presence of fever, productive cough, significant vomiting or diarrhea, or severe pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other important safeguards include exercising with a partner when possible and wearing a medic alert bracelet if a person has a significant medical issue (eg, diabetes, epilepsy, significant allergic reactions) that could affect treatment should something untoward occur.

         </span>
         There is a sound physiologic basis for recommending calisthenics and a gradual cardiorespiratory warm-up prior to the endurance or stimulus phase of an exercise session. A proper warm-up stretches postural muscles and helps to increase blood flow and the metabolic rate. In addition, it may reduce the potential for ischemic ST-segment depression and ventricular arrhythmias that can be triggered by sudden strenuous exertion [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. A warm-up may reduce the susceptibility to musculoskeletal injury by increasing connective tissue extensibility and joint mobility.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our empiric experience suggests that the preferred warm-up for any aerobic activity is that activity performed at a lower intensity (eg, brisk walking before slow jogging over a 5- to 10-minute period). At the conclusion of the warm-up, the heart rate should fall within 10 beats per minute of the lower limit for the endurance or stimulus phase.
        </p>
        <p>
         For strength training, an appropriate warm-up involves performing the same exercise starting with lower resistance (eg, less weight) and gradually increasing it. For activities that involve complex movements, particularly explosive and unpredictable ones (as with many sports), a warm-up should incorporate the full range of movements to be used, with a gradual increase in intensity.

         A 5- to 10-minute postexercise cool-down period involving slow jogging, walking, or cycling permits appropriate circulatory adjustments and a more gradual return of the heart rate and blood pressure to near resting values. A proper cool-down enhances venous return, thereby reducing the potential for postexercise hypotension and possible syncope, and combats the potential deleterious effects of the postexercise rise in plasma catecholamines [

         It is always best to begin a new exercise routine at a low intensity, performing fewer repetitions or for a shorter duration. Gradually, exercise volume and intensity may be increased as tolerated. A knowledgeable fitness professional or coach can provide instruction about proper programming and progression of an exercise routine.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with little or no experience exercising in particular should be instructed to begin with small amounts of low-intensity exercise and to build gradually. As an example, a sedentary 55-year-old woman might begin by walking on a level surface at a pace of 1 to 3 miles per hour (ie, 1.5 to 5 km per hour, or approximately 1.7 to 3 metabolic equivalents [METs]). Gradually, over a few weeks, the intensity can be raised, such as by increasing the pace to 3 to 4 miles per hour (ie, 5 to 6.5 km per hour, or approximately 3 to 5 METs). Such gradual increases in intensity may continue for as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Such an approach helps to minimize the risk of cardiovascular complications and orthopedic injury while enabling individuals to improve their cardiorespiratory fitness.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is particularly important for the least active adults, who represent a "high-risk" cohort (bottom 20 percent in physical activity). If such patients engage in unaccustomed, vigorous-to-near-maximal physical activity, there is a large associated relative risk of an acute cardiovascular event [

         As a general guideline, exercise can be monitored by using the rate of perceived exertion (6 to 20 category scale  (

          59

         ], which, like heart rate, can be used to prescribe and modulate exercise intensity. Exercise rated as 11 ("fairly light") to 13 ("somewhat hard") generally corresponds to the upper limit of recommended exercise intensities during the first six to eight weeks of training. As a patient’s fitness gradually increases, ratings of 13 to 15 ("hard") may be appropriate, provided the exerciser remains asymptomatic. The anaerobic or ventilatory threshold generally occurs within this range. Thus, most physically active persons who remain asymptomatic can rely on perceived exertion, rather than heart rate, to regulate their exercise intensity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Exercisers who experience exertion-related symptoms (eg, chest pain or pressure, unusual shortness of breath, palpitations) should immediately cease training and seek medical clearance before resuming exercise.

         Overtraining syndrome (OTS), most commonly the result of excessive exercise, is an incompletely understood syndrome manifested by systemic symptoms and declining performance. OTS is best avoided by ensuring that the exerciser recovers properly from intense training. Recovery requires adequate hydration and nutrition, sleep and rest, relaxation and emotional support, and active somatic/physical rest. (See

         A number of observational studies report that competitive and recreational athletes who experience nonfatal or fatal cardiovascular complications during or soon after exercise often had prodromal symptoms (eg, chest pain or pressure, unusual shortness of breath, lightheadedness, palpitations, or a drop in exercise capacity) in the days or weeks before their cardiac event [

          60-63

Consequently, it is important for clinicians to review with exercising patients, particularly those who are new to exercise or have risk factors for coronary heart disease, symptoms that suggest such disease and the importance of seeking prompt medical evaluation should such symptoms develop.

          Fitness level to reduce cardiovascular risk

         – Cardiorespiratory fitness levels are influenced by age, sex, and other factors. Little additional survival benefit occurs when levels increase from "good" to "excellent," suggesting there is a plateau in the reduced relative risk for cardiovascular disease once "good" fitness levels are reached. An initial training intensity goal of ≥3 metabolic equivalents (METs) enables individuals to achieve important fitness goals. The following tables provide "good" fitness levels and the aerobic training requirements necessary to achieve them  (

          Nutrition
         </strong>
         – The patient embarking on an exercise program should consume a diet rich in vegetables, some fruits, lean forms of protein, and healthy fats while avoiding refined grains (eg, white bread, white rice, pasta, refined and sweetened cereals). Nutrition for health and for weight loss is reviewed separately. Some guidance about hydration and nutrition for exercise is provided in the text. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5364.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Reducing risk and avoiding injury
         </strong>
         – The risks associated with following a well-designed exercise program that accounts for patient age, baseline fitness level, and any comorbidities are low and far exceeded by the wide-ranging health benefits. Following an acute illness or injury, it is often best to rest and recover before resuming exercise. In some cases, alternative forms of exercise that do not exacerbate the acute condition may be used (eg, swimming or water aerobics during osteoarthritis flare). Links to topics addressing exercise in patients with specific diseases are provided in the text, as are strategies for reducing risk during exercise. (See
         <a class="local">
