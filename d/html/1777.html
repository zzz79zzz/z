         A single session of exercise increases non-insulin-mediated and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Insulin sensitivity can be enhanced for up to 48 hours after exercise. While the acute effects of exercise on insulin sensitivity are temporary, regular sessions of aerobic and resistance exercise promote adaptations in the vasculature, skeletal muscle mass and oxidative capacity, adipose tissue, and the liver that further enhance insulin sensitivity [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         These same adaptations likely occur with exercise training in type 2 diabetes [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], which tend to improve overall glycemic management and also result in other favorable outcomes, including reductions in body weight and improvements in cardiovascular risk profile [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The general benefits of regular exercise with regards to weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal apply predominantly to adults with type 2 diabetes and to those with type 1 diabetes who have obesity or overweight. In healthy weight individuals with type 1 diabetes, exercise training may have more modest effects on insulin sensitivity, glycemia, and body weight, but can still improve cardiorespiratory fitness and the cardiovascular risk profile [
         <a href="#rid4">

        <p>
         This topic will review when exercise has differential salutary effects and side effects depending on diabetes type and also provide exercise guidance specifically for people with diabetes. The glycemic benefits of intensive lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes, exercise for the prevention of type 2 diabetes, and sample cases illustrating problems that can occur when exercise is performed in patients treated with insulin are discussed separately. The effects of exercise in people without diabetes is also reviewed elsewhere.

         Exercise has both short- and long-term effects on energy metabolism. Skeletal muscle is the largest organ for glucose uptake, storage, and oxidation. Several types of exercise (including traditional aerobic, resistance, and high-intensity interval, low-volume training) have been shown to improve skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and glucose uptake in people without diabetes [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For most individuals living with diabetes, exercise training also improves muscle mechanics, muscle insulin sensitivity, and increases glucose disposal (mitochondrial oxidation and storage as muscle glycogen) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. However, the physiologic response to exercise (both short- and long-term) may be different in people with diabetes.

         During the first few seconds of muscle contractions, striated muscles use free adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is immediately resynthesized from phosphocreatine, and then over the next few minutes, anaerobic glycolysis to sustain muscle contractions. After approximately five minutes of exercise, ATP resynthesis occurs primarily by catabolizing other fuel sources (eg, carbohydrates and lipids), both from within and outside of the muscle. The longer the exercise duration, the greater the body's reliance on blood glucose and blood lipids as fuel  (

          Skeletal muscle glucose uptake
         </strong>
         – A single session of exercise increases glucose uptake into skeletal muscle severalfold, largely via mechanisms that are independent of insulin signaling [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Exercise-mediated glucose uptake occurs largely via muscle contraction-mediated increases in glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane, complemented by increased rates of glucose delivery to muscle via increased blood flow and increased rates of muscle glucose metabolism (ie, glycolysis and glucose oxidation)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77664" href="/z/d/graphic/77664.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-14
         </a>
         ]. The activation of the contraction-sensitive GLUT4 proteins likely occurs via activation of several kinases that "sense" and transduce signals related to changes in the intracellular environment during muscular contractions, including calcium ion levels and adenosine monophosphate levels [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,15,16
         </a>
         ]. The non-insulin-mediated uptake and oxidation of glucose is largely responsible for the acute blood glucose-lowering effect of exercise. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Exercise benefit in diabetes'
         </a>
         below.)

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         During exercise recovery, lasting one to four hours depending on the nature of the activity, there is a gradual decay of muscle contraction-mediated glucose uptake. At the same time, however, insulin sensitivity in the previously active muscle increases and remains elevated for up to 48 hours after exercise, depending on the intensity and duration of the activity [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. The increase in insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake after exercise are thought to be important for muscle glycogen replenishment; however, the window of time of enhanced insulin sensitivity is unrelated to muscle glycogen synthase activity, muscle glycogen content, or degree of glycogen utilization during the preceding session of exercise [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. This enhancement of peripheral glucose uptake and increased insulin sensitivity is particularly beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes, but can increase hypoglycemia risk for individuals with type 1 diabetes or insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

          Type 2 diabetes

         – In the resting state, there is a reduction in insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle in people with type 2 diabetes (see

          22

          17,18

          Type 1 diabetes
         </strong>
         – In the resting state, muscle glucose kinetics are largely intact in people with type 1 diabetes. During exercise, the glucose response is variable depending on time of day, type of exercise, timing and amount of insulin administered, and food intake [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In the fasting state and when insulin levels are at a basal concentration, glucose uptake into exercising muscle is relatively predictable [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,25,26
         </a>
         ]. When the circulating insulin levels are higher (eg, two- to threefold above basal as can occur after meals), there is an increase in insulin-mediated glucose uptake during exercise [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ], which likely contributes to elevated risk for hypoglycemia. (See

          Insulin-to-glucagon ratio
         </strong>
         – Based on an exercise-mediated increase in sympathetic drive and as the blood glucose concentration begins to fall, the secretion of insulin decreases, while that of glucagon rises directly in the portal vein. The net effect of the decrease in the insulin-to-glucagon ratio in the portal circulation is increased hepatic glucose production due both to glycogenolysis and to gluconeogenesis (in which glucose is formed from lactate, pyruvate, alanine and other amino acids, and glycerol)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82039" href="/z/d/graphic/82039.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Skeletal muscle differs from liver in that it lacks the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate (derived from glycogen) to glucose; as a result, muscle glycogen can only be used as an energy source for muscle via the metabolism of glucose-6-phosphate to pyruvate  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82039" href="/z/d/graphic/82039.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). In other words, glucose cannot be transferred out of muscle to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, insulin levels do not fall physiologically and may even increase owing to increased absorption of exogenous insulin from exercising muscle [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,28
         </a>
         ]. The physiologic response to exercise, therefore, depends on the serum insulin concentration at the time of exercise which, in turn, is influenced by the site and timing of recent basal and or bolus insulin administrations (multiple daily injections [MDI] or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]).

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Even people with well-controlled type 1 diabetes and adequate serum insulin concentrations at the time of exercise are vulnerable to falling blood glucose concentration that is much larger than that in individuals without diabetes [

          29

         Exogenous insulin concentrations may even rise with exercise, due to increased temperature and blood flow associated with exercise, which may speed insulin absorption from subcutaneous depots. This effect is most prominent if the injection was recent, was given into an arm or leg that is being exercised [

          Other counterregulatory hormones
         </strong>
         – As the duration of moderate-intensity exercise increases beyond an hour or more, other counterregulatory hormones (ie, epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone, and cortisol) rise and help sustain hepatic glucose production, blood glucose levels, and shift substrate utilization more towards lipid oxidation. Epinephrine and norepinephrine stimulate hepatic glucose production to some extent, but their major effect is to stimulate lipolysis and to limit skeletal muscle glucose uptake and utilization. These processes help to protect against exercise-associated hypoglycemia.

         Triglycerides are broken down into both free fatty acids (which are utilized as fuel by exercising muscles) and glycerol (which can be converted to glucose in the liver). These changes in hormone release and muscle metabolism become more pronounced with prolonged exercise; insulin secretion continues to fall, while there is a further increase in the release of the counterregulatory hormones. The net effect is a gradual reduction in whole-body carbohydrate utilization (muscle and blood glucose) and a greater reliance on lipid mobilization (ie, lipolysis) and oxidation  (

         Mild- to moderate-intensity exercise can cause a paradoxical elevation in blood glucose concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes, but typically only if insulin is withheld for a prolonged period of time and severe hypoinsulinemia occurs [

          29

         Moderate aerobic exercise on a regular, long-term basis (ie, endurance training) has several beneficial effects on skeletal muscle mass and function that lead to more efficient use of energy (glucose and lipid), a greater fuel oxidative capacity, and a reduction in whole-body insulin needs. Regular exercise also promotes adaptations in adipose tissue and the liver that further enhance insulin sensitivity [

        <p>
         GLUT4 appears to be a rate-limiting step in muscle glucose uptake, which probably explains much of the overall increase in insulin sensitivity. Improvements in blood flow, increases in muscle mass, enhanced skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, and increased intracellular glucose flux (including glucose oxidation and glycogen replenishment rate) also contribute to the beneficial effect [

         With repeated exercise sessions over the longer term (ie, weeks to months) there are also favorable changes in body composition (eg, muscle and adipose tissue mass changes), intramyocellular lipid deposition, hepatic and blood lipid levels, and whole-body basal (resting) and meal-associated insulin signaling [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         Emerging evidence in type 2 diabetes also demonstrates that exercising muscle releases health-promoting factors (myokines) that can improve insulin sensitivity in other tissues including adipose tissue, liver, pancreas, and even regions of the central nervous system [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37

          42,43

          17

         We typically perform a history (with assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and for conditions that may preclude some types of exercise) and physical examination in sedentary adults (age &gt;50 years) with diabetes prior to beginning an exercise program. All cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking) should be evaluated and treated (whether patients are exercising or not). (See

         For most individuals planning to participate in a low- to moderate-intensity physical activity (eg, brisk walking), no additional pre-exercise medical evaluation is needed unless symptoms of CVD or microvascular complications are present [

          Asymptomatic, low risk

         – We do not typically perform exercise stress testing in asymptomatic individuals at low risk of coronary artery disease [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,75
         </a>
         ]. We counsel initiation of a gentle exercise program with gradual progression to a more vigorous program as tolerated and evaluate if typical or atypical signs or symptoms of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) develop with exercise or are evident on examination. Routine exercise stress testing does not improve outcomes beyond medical management of cardiac risk factors [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,76-79
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a cohort study evaluating 1705 asymptomatic adults with type 2 diabetes who attended an exercise intake program, sedentary individuals with one or more cardiac risk factors (40 percent of the cohort) were referred for pre-exercise stress testing [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76

There was no difference in the composite cardiovascular outcome (revascularization, cardiovascular-related hospital admission, or cardiovascular-related death) within one year (2.8 versus 1.9 percent) or after one year (3.1 versus 4.6 percent) in those who did or did not undergo stress testing.

         – We individualize the decision to perform stress testing prior to beginning an exercise program in patients at higher cardiovascular risk (eg, evidence of peripheral or carotid atherosclerotic vascular disease, renal disease, abnormal resting electrocardiogram [ECG], multiple diabetes complications), or with concerning symptoms (eg, a recent decrease in exercise tolerance, unexplained dyspnea), or who plan to initiate a more rigorous exercise program.

         Regular physical activity is recommended throughout life.

         A reasonable initial regimen is 10 minutes of stretching and warm-up, followed by 20 minutes of gentle aerobic exercise such as walking, cycling, or rowing. The exercise should be performed regularly (at least three to five times per week) and preferably at the same time in relation to meals and insulin injections in patients treated with insulin. The duration and intensity of exercise should be increased gradually, as tolerated by the patient, to achieve a moderate intensity (eg, brisk walking).

         A shorter duration of more vigorous aerobic exercise (75 minutes per week of jogging 9.6 km/hour) is an alternative for physically fit individuals. This type of exercise regimen should only be used in adults who have been regularly exercising. Patients who are initiating an exercise program should begin with a gentle exercise program as described above with gradual progression as tolerated.

         Another example of a low-volume, high-intensity training (HIT) program is cycling at 90 percent of individual maximal heart rate for 60 seconds, followed by 60 seconds of rest, repeated 10 times (total training session 20 minutes with 10 minutes of cycling and 10 minutes resting) [

         In the absence of contraindications (ie, moderate to severe proliferative retinopathy), we also encourage adults to participate in resistance training exercises (free weights or weight machines) two to three times per week.

          89,90

When that is done, the change in blood glucose concentrations is usually somewhat predictable and reproducible, particularly if the exercise is done with no prandial insulin "onboard" [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91
         </a>

         <a href="#rid92">
          92

         ], but exercise should not be discouraged as long as the individual is motivated and educated on glucose management during exercise.

         Traditional insulin pumps allow one to reduce the basal rate prior to the activity, typically best done 90 minutes before the onset of aerobic exercise [

          93,94
         </a>
         ]; newer insulin delivery devices often have an exercise mode that increase the glucose target and reduce basal rates shortly before or during exercise, but these systems still have some challenges with exercise control [

         In people without diabetes, it has generally been shown that many of the health-related outcomes associated with regular exercise (blood pressure, weight control, lipid profiles, etc) are similar when comparing strategies of frequent, short-duration exercise sessions versus fewer, longer-duration exercise sessions [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96,97
         </a>
         ]. In type 1 diabetes specifically, one study found that individuals achieve similar continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-based outcomes (eg, percent time in range, time below range) whether they choose to perform the recommended 150 minutes of weekly physical activity during five short sessions (lasting approximately 30 minutes each) or two long sessions (lasting approximately 85 minutes each) [
         <a href="#rid98">
          98
         </a>
         ]. Since the glycemic benefits of a 30-minute exercise session tend to last up to approximately 24 hours in type 1 diabetes [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70,72
         </a>
         ], spacing out exercise training days with shorter exercise sessions (30 to 45 minutes) might be slightly better for overall glucose control, as compared with training less frequently for longer durations. In people with type 2 diabetes or obesity, small bursts of activity throughout the day to help break up periods of prolonged sitting are associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity and better glycemia [

         In the setting of adequate or high serum insulin concentrations, late (or nocturnal) hypoglycemia may occur four to eight hours after the termination of exercise due to replenishment of depleted glycogen stores.

As an example, if an individual is exercising within three hours after a meal, the prandial insulin for that meal can be reduced by 25 to 50 percent to avoid hypoglycemia during subsequent exercise. Some individuals may prefer to exercise before eating, with or without a basal insulin reduction, and then perform the usual or a slightly reduced (approximately 25 percent) premeal bolus insulin, based on the prevailing post-exercise glucose level and their residual increase in insulin sensitivity.

         Several perceived barriers may contribute to the inability to sustain an exercise regimen in patients with diabetes. As expected, patients with low perceived barrier to exercise do more physical activity and have better overall glycemic control [
         <a href="#rid114">
          114
         </a>
         ]. Unfortunately, perceptions of barriers held by physicians increase the perception of barriers in their patients and can reduce activity habits [
         <a href="#rid114">
          114
         </a>
         ]. In general, most patients with type 2 diabetes are trying to change a lifetime of sedentary behavior, and continued compliance is a major problem [
         <a href="#rid115">
          115
         </a>
         ]. In addition to decreased exercise capacity, potential movement discomforts (eg, joint pain, foot pain), occult coronary or peripheral vascular disease, and/or diabetic neuropathy can limit exercise tolerance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite these difficulties, maintenance of an exercise program in patients with type 2 diabetes remains a worthwhile goal because compliance is associated with long-term improvement in cardiovascular risk factors. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Type 2 diabetes'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         To increase compliance, the clinician should attempt to help break down perceived barriers to exercise and help patients choose a type of exercise they will enjoy and maintain. In some studies, simple behavioral counseling by clinicians during routine clinic visits to promote sustained commitment to an exercise program has shown encouraging results [

         – A single session of exercise increases non-insulin-mediated and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Insulin sensitivity can be enhanced for up to 48 hours after exercise. For most individuals living with diabetes, regular exercise training increases glucose disposal (mitochondrial oxidation and storage as muscle glycogen) and improves muscle mass and morphology, whole-body insulin sensitivity, and cardiovascular health.

         – In the resting state, individuals with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance have several defects in glucose metabolism (eg, decreased number and function of skeletal muscle insulin receptors and glucose transporters), reducing the ability of muscle cells to take up glucose. Exercise overcomes the defects in glucose transport caused by insulin resistance by increasing both non-insulin-mediated and insulin-mediated glucose transport during and after the exercise session. In the long-term, additional training-induced adaptations in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver further enhance insulin sensitivity.

          Type 1 diabetes
         </strong>
         – Patients with type 1 diabetes typically have normal muscle glucose kinetics; however, the inability to shut off previously administered exogenous insulin may result in inhibition of hepatic glucose output (with continued muscle glucose uptake) and a subsequent fall in blood glucose concentration during exercise that is much larger than that in individuals without diabetes.

          Exercise benefit in diabetes

          Pre-exercise evaluation
         </strong>
         – We typically perform a history (with assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and for conditions that may preclude some types of exercise) and physical examination in sedentary adults (age &gt;50 years) with diabetes prior to beginning an exercise program. All cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking) should be evaluated and treated (whether patients are exercising or not). (See

         We do not typically perform exercise stress testing in asymptomatic patients as long as they are beginning a gentle exercise program with gradual progression as tolerated. We evaluate if typical or atypical signs or symptoms of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) develop with exercise or are evident on examination. However, the increased risk for asymptomatic coronary artery disease in those with diabetes and other risk factors suggests that an exercise tolerance test should be individualized. We perform stress testing prior to beginning a new exercise program in patients at higher cardiovascular risk (eg, evidence of peripheral or carotid atherosclerotic vascular disease, renal disease, abnormal resting electrocardiogram [ECG], multiple diabetes complications), or with concerning symptoms (eg, a recent decrease in exercise tolerance, unexplained dyspnea), or who plan to initiate a more rigorous exercise program.

          Type and frequency of exercise
         </strong>
         – Regular physical activity is recommended throughout life. For adults with diabetes, we encourage at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity (eg, brisk walking) aerobic exercise per week. In the absence of contraindications (eg, moderate to severe proliferative retinopathy), we also encourage resistance training (exercise with free weights or weight machines) at least twice per week. For adults with diabetes who are generally fit and have higher aerobic capacity, a shorter duration of more vigorous aerobic exercise (eg, 75 minutes per week of jogging 9.6 km/hour), or brief periods of high-intensity interval training, may be preferable.

          Patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues
         </strong>
         – For patients who take insulin (particularly those with type 1 diabetes), adjustments of their insulin regimen before, during, and after exercise are often empiric and aided by the results of glucose monitoring (with fingersticks every 30 to 45 minutes, or using a continuous glucose monitor [CGM]). For patients who take insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas, glinides), blood glucose should be measured before, during, and after exercise so that the changes in blood glucose can be documented and then predicted for subsequent exercise sessions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Glycemic management during exercise'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         If the pre-exercise blood glucose is &lt;100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), insulin- or insulin secretagogue-treated patients should ingest extra food, in the form of 15 to 30 grams of quickly absorbed carbohydrate (such as glucose tablets, hard candies, or juice), which should be taken 15 to 30 minutes before exercise and approximately every 30 minutes during exercise, based on repeat blood glucose testing during the exercise. Such patients are also at risk of late hypoglycemia (ie, four to eight hours after the termination of exercise) due to replenishment of depleted glycogen stores. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Glycemic management during exercise'

         – Hypoglycemia is uncommon in patients with type 2 diabetes not treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas, glinides), and therefore, monitoring of glucose during exercise, ingestion of extra carbohydrates, and medication adjustments are not typically necessary. (See
