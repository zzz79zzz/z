         Some mutations of globin genes decrease the stability and solubility of the hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell (RBC). Substitutions in the primary sequence of globin in these unstable hemoglobins can alter the tertiary or quaternary structure of the molecule and result in a globin polypeptide/hemoglobin tetramer that is unstable and precipitates intracellularly. These intra-erythrocytic precipitates are detectable by supravital staining as dark globular aggregates called Heinz bodies. The affected RBCs have a reduced life span, producing a hemolytic disorder of varied severity called the congenital Heinz body hemolytic anemia syndrome. (See
         <a class="local">

         Unstable hemoglobin variants are rare, inherited mutations affecting globin genes. Thus, with a few exceptions, each variant is generally limited to a single pedigree [

         Specific variants discussed herein are referred to using the classical amino acid numbering system related to the mature globin peptide, not the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) numbering system. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2900.html" rel="external">
          "Basic genetics concepts: DNA regulation and gene expression", section on 'Sequence variants'

        </p>
        <p>
         Of the over 1200 hemoglobin variants (mutations) that have been described, there are approximately 150 that are classified as unstable alpha globin or beta globin variants on the online Globin Gene Server (
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fglobin.cse.psu.edu%2F&amp;token=W%2FMNZorEFI2EtNnE4Oqza%2BLSzyNbNNPsEL85T2QwNbbfeKuzf3vos5FVncGUXy64&amp;TOPIC_ID=7086" target="_blank">
          http://globin.cse.psu.edu/
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mutations conferring instability can also affect the gamma globin and delta globin chains. Delta globin chain instability does not have a clinical phenotype because the delta globin-containing hemoglobin (Hb A2) is present at very low concentration. Unstable gamma globin variants can cause neonatal hemolytic anemia that resolves as fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) is replaced by adult hemoglobin in the first months of life. In addition to instability, many of these variants also have increased or decreased oxygen affinity as the mutations may interfere with the transitions of the hemoglobin tetramer between oxygenated (R) to deoxygenated (T) states, in addition to causing instability. Auto-oxidation and methemoglobinemia are also common features. In the discussion below, the affected globin chain is designated by the gene name followed by the amino acid substitution. As an example,
         <em>
          HBB
         </em>
         ala138pro refers to an alanine to proline substitution at position 138 in the mature beta globin chain.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanisms that contribute to hemoglobin instability vary, and these are outlined below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Altered globin folding/assembly'
         </a>
         below and

        </p>
        <p>
         The inheritance of the majority of unstable hemoglobins is autosomal dominant  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63306" href="/z/d/graphic/63306.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ), and affected individuals are heterozygous for the mutation; however, homozygosity may rarely also occur, especially for the more common variants or in populations with a high degree of consanguinity [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>

         Some mutations causing unstable hemoglobins affect globin folding or assembly. This may be at the level of the secondary structure (initial folding of the protein into an alpha helix), tertiary structure (overall three-dimensional shape of the globin chain), or quaternary structure (interaction between globin subunits) of the hemoglobin molecule. As examples:

         </span>
         Approximately 75 percent of the hemoglobin protein is in the form of an alpha helix, and disruption of this secondary structure can reduce the solubility of the globin subunit. Unstable hemoglobin variants can result from the introduction of proline in the helical structure, the substitution of glycine by a mutation in invariant positions in the interhelical bends, and/or by amino acid insertions and deletions.
        </p>
        <p>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         At least 33 unstable hemoglobin variants involve the introduction of a proline residue. Proline residues disrupt the alpha helix of the globin chain, except when present at the ends of the helical section. Alpha helical regions of the globin subunits must be folded so that the hemoglobin tetramer can assume its tight globular configuration. An example of a variant that disrupts this folding is hemoglobin Brockton (
         <em>
          HBB
         </em>
         ala138pro), an abnormality that is associated with mild anemia. Crystallographic examination showed that the tertiary structure was disrupted in the vicinity of the mutated residue [

         Substitutions in the amino acid residues that point inward can occur with no change in stability/solubility as long as the incoming residue is not charged, is not bulky, or there is no loss of critical nonpolar residues that prevent water from entering the interior of the molecule.

         Introduction of charged residues in the interior of the hemoglobin molecule or loss of inter-subunit contact hydrogen bonds or salt bridges in the alpha1beta1 contact area makes the protein unstable. This area of contact is normally very strong and difficult to dissociate. When a substitution weakens the contact area, it promotes dissociation of the alpha1beta1 dimers into monomers, loosening their heme-globin interaction and favoring methemoglobin formation. (See

         Heme binding to globin is important for the oxygen binding properties and the stability and solubility of the molecule. Several of the mutations involving residues with defined interactions with the heme groups that result in protein instability are depicted in the figure  (

          figure 2

         ). These include substitutions that introduce a charged side chain into the heme pocket where a nonpolar side chain existed previously, deletions involving residues that directly interact with heme, and non-tyrosine substitutions of the proximal histidine [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Observations in individuals with hemoglobin Köln and hemoglobin Zürich illustrate these mechanisms.

         Hemoglobin Köln is the most frequently diagnosed unstable hemoglobin in the Western world. It is characterized by mild anemia, reticulocytosis, splenomegaly, and pigmenturia; it comprises 10 to 25 percent of the total hemoglobin in heterozygotes [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The presence of the hemoglobin Köln mutation at a CpG dinucleotide leads to deamidation of cytosine to thymine, perhaps accounting for its high incidence compared with other unstable variants. This mutation involves a residue in the heme pocket (FG5) that is very close to the proximal histidine (F8His) that is involved in a valency bond with heme iron.
        </p>
        <p>
         The functional properties of hemoglobin Köln include a high oxygen affinity in the absence of compensatory erythrocytosis and easy heme dissociation. Of special interest are the abnormalities in the membrane of erythrocytes containing hemoglobin Köln. When the affected individual's red blood cells (RBCs) are exposed to hydrogen peroxide stress, they produce twice the malonylaldehyde (a lipid peroxidation product) than normal RBCs. Two sorts of abnormal membrane aggregates have been found in individuals with hemoglobin Köln who have undergone splenectomy:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         A disulfide bond between membrane band 3 (also known as anion exchanger [AE]-1) and globin.

         </span>
         Aggregates of spectrin and other membrane components, which have an amino acid composition similar to normal membranes exposed to malonylaldehyde.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Membrane-associated aggregates are thought to reduce the deformability of hemoglobin Köln erythrocytes, thereby contributing to the hemolysis. In addition, the denatured hemoglobin protein co-clusters with the RBC membrane band 3, resulting in increased binding of autoantibodies against band 3 [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. This process may be important physiologically in aged RBCs when hemoglobin begins to denature; it promotes recognition by macrophages and contributes to the removal of senescent cells.
        </p>
        <p>
         Red cells containing hemoglobin Köln have a green fluorescent pigment due to dipyrroles, the same pigment found in the pigmented urine of these individuals [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The partial lack of heme molecules in some of the tetramers of hemoglobin Köln makes the use of pulse oximetry unreliable in these and some other individuals with unstable hemoglobin variants [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         In hemoglobin Zürich (

         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. This steric change has little effect on the binding of oxygen to iron, but it increases the affinity for carbon monoxide (CO). Carboxyhemoglobin levels are very high in smokers with hemoglobin Zürich due to the CO content of tobacco smoke, but they are also elevated in nonsmokers who carry the mutation due to endogenous CO production from heme catabolism. CO stabilizes the hemoglobin tetramer, and this partially protective effect of carboxyhemoglobin Zürich reduces the rate of hemolysis and the frequency of Heinz body formation, especially among smokers with the hemoglobin Zürich mutation [
         <a href="#rid12">

        <p>
         Individuals heterozygous for hemoglobin Zürich usually have normal hemoglobin levels with little hemolysis, but they have a special susceptibility to hemolytic crisis induced by oxidant agents like

          sulfanilamide
         </a>
         . This is because the increased size of the heme pocket in the hemoglobin of these individuals allows oxidant agents to enter the heme pockets and directly oxidize heme, producing methemoglobin at levels reported to be as high as 40 percent. As noted above, smoking is protective due to stabilization of the tetramer by CO.

         Some hemoglobins are so unstable that they are either barely detectable or undetectable in the hemolysate. These rare hemoglobins are called hyperunstable hemoglobin variants; they have also been called thalassemic hemoglobinopathies, as the rapid destruction of the variant globin chain causes unbalanced globin synthesis, the hallmark of thalassemia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7090.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Hyperunstable variants presumably are synthesized normally but are destroyed rapidly after synthesis because of extreme instability, creating the phenotype of a dominantly inherited thalassemia. Individuals with these variants are heterozygous for the mutated globin but have a phenotype of severe thalassemia.

         Denaturation of hemoglobin leads to its precipitation in the RBC. As a general rule, weakening of the heme-globin bond will accelerate hemoglobin denaturation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Heinz bodies are intraerythrocytic hemoglobin precipitates that form when hemoglobin denatures and produces hemichromes. Hemichromes are molecules generated when the heme dissociates from the heme pocket and rebinds elsewhere in the globin molecule after the alpha or beta chains have undergone some degree of uncoiling or denaturation. Formation of irreversible hemichromes appears to be an indispensable stage in the formation of Heinz bodies [

         Heinz bodies adhere at least partially to the cytosolic (internal) surface of the RBC membrane by hydrophobic interactions [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Band 3, one of the most abundant erythrocyte transmembrane proteins, has a highly glycosylated portion on the external surface of the RBC, a hydrophobic portion spanning the lipid bilayer, and an N-terminal cytosolic domain that has two conformational independent portions separated by a protease sensitive hinge region. The N-terminal domain is highly negatively charged and has a high content of proline and other amino acid residues that do not accommodate well in an alpha helix. Hemoglobin and hemichromes bind the most N-terminal portion of the band 3 cytosolic domain [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. The band 3 cytosolic domain can thread into the positively charged central cavity of hemoglobin, which is why this domain preferentially and reversibly binds deoxyhemoglobin [

         Heinz bodies generally are cleared by splenic macrophages as part of their normal reticuloendothelial function. This provides a possible explanation for the absence of Heinz bodies in some individuals with unstable hemoglobin variants. (See

         Not all of the unstable hemoglobin variants are sufficiently abnormal to result in hemolytic anemia. As a result, not all affected individuals will have hemolysis; in those who do have hemolysis, it may range from mild to severe. Hemolysis is typically both intravascular and extravascular.

         Free heme that becomes liberated from an unstable hemoglobin may cause heme iron to become decompartmentalized, in turn damaging the RBC membrane and RBC proteins, including hemoglobin.

         Heme is ferrous protoporphyrin IX, which consists of four pyrrole rings linked by methenyl bridges. Heme oxygenase cleaves heme at the alpha-methene (methenyl) bridges to form biliverdin.

         Pigmenturia is a color change in the urine due to the accumulation of fluorescent compounds in the plasma. These are thought to be dipyrrole methenes of the mesobilifuscin group.

Their structure, two pyrrole rings still bound to each other by a methenyl bridge, suggests the malfunctioning of the methenyl oxygenase enzyme.

          Other modifiers
         </strong>
         – The presence of other modifiers is inferred from the dramatic variations in clinical severity within the same pedigree or among different pedigrees. As an example, the disease manifestations vary widely in adults with hemoglobin Hasharon and hemoglobin Zürich, from mild hemolytic anemia to no hemolysis at all. The presence of an unstable beta globin variant as a compound heterozygote with a beta thalassemia mutation will increase the concentration of the unstable variant, making hemolysis more readily detectable. Similarly, levels of unstable alpha globin variants will be higher in the presence of alpha thalassemia. Some variants interact abnormally with alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP), which causes their instability [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Epistatic effects of other non-linked modifier genes might also be responsible for these differences in carriers of the same globin-gene mutation.

         Hemolytic anemia is the chief clinical feature of unstable hemoglobins. The intensity of hemolysis may vary considerably depending on the specific mutation [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Some individuals may have chronic hemolysis, while others may have an abrupt increase in hemolysis over steady state levels following an acute infection or exposure to oxidant medications. (See

        <p>
         As with other forms of hemolytic anemia, the reticulocyte count is elevated unless there is a concomitant vitamin or mineral deficiency that impairs hematopoiesis  (

         ). The haptoglobin is often low, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be increased, and the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT) is negative because there is no immune component. The white blood cell (WBC) count and platelet count are usually normal but may be increased. (See

         Review of the peripheral blood smear is an important component of any hemolytic anemia evaluation. This is important both to determine if findings are consistent with an unstable hemoglobin as well as to eliminate other potential causes of hemolytic anemia, some of which may be life threatening and/or require more urgent interventions.

         Typical findings on the blood smear in individuals with an unstable hemoglobin may include anisocytosis, prominent basophilic stippling, and/or microspherocytes. The RBCs may be hypochromic leading to a thalassemia-like picture, especially with the hyperunstable variants (see
         <a class="local">
          'Hyperunstable variants'
         </a>
         above). Howell-Jolly bodies may be seen, especially in individuals who have had a splenectomy, and nucleated RBCs may be present, especially if hemolysis is severe. Importantly, these abnormalities on the peripheral blood smear are not specific for unstable hemoglobins and may be seen with various other conditions associated with hemolysis. (See

        <p>
         A Heinz body stain, if available, may be helpful for cases of suspected unstable hemoglobin variants, provided that the laboratory has the expertise to interpret the results correctly. Heinz bodies are RBC inclusions caused by denatured hemoglobin proteins (see
         <a class="local">
          'Hemoglobin precipitation and Heinz body formation'
         </a>
         above). Their presence is consistent with a diagnosis of an unstable hemoglobin but not required [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Detection of Heinz bodies requires incubation of RBCs with a supravital stain such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9636" href="/z/d/drug information/9636.html" rel="external">
          methylene blue
         </a>
         , crystal violet, or brilliant cresyl blue. Heinz bodies appear as single or multiple pale purple inclusions that are 2 microns in diameter or less; they frequently appear to be attached to the cell membrane. The test is inexpensive and can be performed rapidly, but many laboratories do not have experience with evaluation and interpretation. Heinz bodies may be found in freshly drawn samples of peripheral blood but, in most cases, incubation for 24 hours in the absence of glucose is required for them to form. Due to the extreme variability inherent in this test, a normal blood sample as a control should always be run simultaneously. Heinz bodies become easier to detect after splenectomy.

         The diagnosis of an unstable hemoglobin variant is established in an individual with chronic hemolytic anemia by documentation of a causative globin gene defect by genetic testing or, less reliably, by identification of a hemoglobin variant by HPLC or CZE in the appropriate clinical setting (findings on CBC and peripheral blood smear, known affected family member).
        </p>
        <p>
         We favor genetic testing because it is widely available and provides definitive genetic evidence of the variant. Many laboratories do not perform hemoglobin HPLC or CZE routinely. For settings in which HPLC or CZE is available, genetic testing will often be required regardless of the result (ie, to make the diagnosis if HPLC fails to find a variant; to confirm the diagnosis if HPLC identifies a variant phenotypically) [

         For family members of an individual with a variant that has been confirmed by genetic testing, diagnosis may be made by the clinical picture along with HPLC or CZE.

         The question of splenectomy arises in individuals with more severe hemolysis. Although the spleen plays an important pathophysiologic role in the destruction of Heinz body-containing RBCs, the potential benefit of splenectomy must be weighed against the increased susceptibility to pneumococcal infections, risks of thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension, and the need for pneumococcal vaccines as well as prophylactic penicillin when splenectomy is performed during childhood.

          Definition and prevalence

         – Unstable hemoglobin variants are inherited mutations affecting globin genes; most are autosomal dominant and private (they affect only a single family/pedigree). Hemoglobin Köln and hemoglobin Zürich have been reported in several kindreds, and hemoglobin Hasharon is seen in individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. (See

          Genetics and pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Unstable hemoglobin variants can affect alpha, beta, gamma, or delta globin chains. They can disrupt folding, assembly, or subunit interactions in the globin molecules or interactions between heme and globin. Denatured hemoglobin precipitates in red blood cells (RBCs), which in turn may cause Heinz body formation and extravascular hemolysis as the spleen clears abnormal RBCs. (See

          Presentation
         </strong>
         – Typical clinical manifestations include varying degrees of hemolysis, anemia, and manifestations of hemolysis (gallstones, splenomegaly, pigmenturia). Clinical variability depends on which globin chain is affected, whether the variant alters oxygen affinity, environmental factors (smoking, oxidant medications), and unidentified modifiers. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – An unstable hemoglobin is suspected in a child or adult with unexplained hemolytic anemia. Presentations are usually in childhood or adolescence. However, many adults with chronic mild hemolytic anemia remain undiagnosed. Initial testing includes laboratory studies for hemolysis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126234" href="/z/d/graphic/126234.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), review of the peripheral blood smear, and Heinz body preparation (if the laboratory has appropriate expertise). Specialized testing is pursued if the initial evaluation does not reveal another cause. Genetic testing is the most definitive means of establishing the diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic evaluation'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Several other causes of inherited and acquired hemolytic anemia, especially those associated with Heinz bodies, are described above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Management is largely supportive and includes avoidance of oxidant drugs when possible, prevention and prompt treatment of infections, and possibly

          folic acid

         supplementation. Less commonly, transfusions and/or splenectomy may be needed. Testing of first-degree relatives is also appropriate. (See
