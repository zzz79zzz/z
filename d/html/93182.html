         ]. Venomous snakes are widely distributed around the world and clinical effects from envenomation can overlap to a great degree even among different families of snakes. This topic will discuss the management of snakebites that occur worldwide, other than those by snakes found in the United States.

         ). Limited evidence exists regarding the recommended height of the bite wound relative to the level of the heart. Expert recommendations vary according to the expected degree of local injury compared with systemic toxicity. In regions where venomous snakebites result in significant local tissue damage with important but less common systemic effects (eg, North America), the bite wound may be placed at the level of the heart to manage local swelling but not encourage systemic absorption. However, in settings where neurotoxicity is likely and local tissue effects are of secondary concern (eg, Australia), the bite wound should be kept below the level of the heart to slow lymphatic venom absorption.

         We suggest that patients with snakebites from species with venoms that cause paralysis with little to no local tissue damage (eg, Australian elapids, kraits  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93580" href="/z/d/graphic/93580.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>

         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68766" href="/z/d/graphic/68766.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ) rather than immobilization alone. Pressure bandage immobilization (PBI) is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         suggested following bites by snake species whose venom is associated with significant local tissue necrosis (eg, many cobras, adders, pit vipers, and rattle snakes). In these patients, localization of toxin may worsen tissue damage and could possibly raise compartment pressures. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121865.html" rel="external">

         Do not remove the pressure bandage and immobilization until the patient has reached the hospital and a clinical assessment regarding the need for antivenom has occurred [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         One exception to this rule occurs if it is evident that the bandage is so tight that it is hampering circulation (ie, distal pulses are markedly decreased or not palpable). This situation may occur if pressure immobilization is improperly applied or local swelling has increased the tightness of the bandage. If time to definitive care will exceed the likely ability of the distal limb to survive prolonged anoxia, the bandage should be carefully loosened to permit distal circulation but to avoid systemic venom absorption.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The pressure bandage and immobilization technique has wide support in Australia, where elapid snake toxins primarily cause neurotoxicity and/or coagulopathy without tissue necrosis and where there may be significant delays in transfer to medical facilities [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Its potential efficacy was first demonstrated in studies on monkeys using tiger snake venom (
         <em>
          Notechis scutatus
         </em>
         ) with high systemic toxicity [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Immobilization of the envenomed limb and application of pressure of approximately 55 mmHg resulted in a significant delay in systemic absorption of venom. Dramatic benefits have also been described with delays of up to six hours for systemic absorption of venom in human case reports [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. However, definitive evidence that pressure immobilization improves the outcomes of snakebites in humans is lacking [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>

         Overall use and proper technique are both major considerations when assessing the potential benefit of pressure bandage and immobilization. Case series indicate that only 30 to 70 percent of patients treated for snakebite in Australia have pressure bandage and immobilization applied, despite heavy emphasis on its use in this region [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. In addition, studies that evaluated intensive training of lay volunteers and healthcare providers indicate that proper bandage pressures are only achieved about 25 to 50 percent of the time [

          14,15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, when used correctly for bites by snake species that do not cause local tissue damage, pressure immobilization is unlikely to be harmful and may be helpful.

          Airway

         – Airway obstruction or respiratory failure caused by neurotoxic envenomation requires immediate airway support with oxygen and bag-mask ventilation followed by prompt rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Because of the potential for coagulopathy, intubation should be performed carefully to avoid traumatic bleeding. (See

         administration should be assessed on a case by case basis in older patients in whom atropine for RSI is not typically given.

         – When available, concomitant end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement and frequent assessment of maximal inspiratory and expiratory forces should be performed to detect evidence of impending respiratory failure. Decrease in oxygenation, as detected by pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas measurement, is a late finding.

         Oxygen should be used with caution in patients with suspected neurotoxic envenomation who do not warrant immediate airway management. Detection of respiratory failure may be impaired by oxygen therapy. Although the other clinical features of neurotoxicity usually manifest earlier (particularly bulbar palsy, usually first manifesting as bilateral ptosis). Hypoxia due to hypoventilation mandates intubation.

         Hypovolemia from hemorrhage secondary to coagulopathy, fluid shift into the bitten limb, and/or direct venom effects with vasodilation or myocardial depression may cause serious shock with hypotension [

        <p>
         In our experience, particularly in children, the infirm, or older adults, fluid overload and cardiorespiratory decompensation, such as pulmonary edema, may occasionally occur several hours into treatment when fluid initially sequestered in the bitten limb reenters the circulation. Thus, whenever possible, patients with snakebite and shock warrant close monitoring of central venous pressure during fluid resuscitation.

         For patients with a delayed presentation after bites by any snake able to cause major neurotoxic paralysis, including many Australian elapids, some cobras, kraits, coral snakes, and some rattlesnakes from south and central America, an envenomed patient may present with severe neurotoxicity and be unable to give a history of snakebite. In this setting, the patient may show some features suggestive of catastrophic brain injury, such as fixed dilated pupils, absence of deep tendon reflexes, absence of withdrawal or other reaction to painful stimuli, and failing respiration  (

        <p>
         In addition to support of airway, breathing, and circulation, and measurement of a rapid blood glucose to exclude hypoglycemia, these patients often require neuroimaging, when available, to assess for trauma or stroke. Despite appearing moribund, the patient may still be conscious and require appropriate sedation and pain management. (See

         If pressure immobilization is in place and the patient shows signs of life-threatening envenomation, hospital personnel should

          not
         </strong>
         remove it until monitoring, complete assessment, and, if needed, intravenous (IV) antivenom is provided. For patients without clinical evidence of serious envenomation but with signs of ischemic limb injury from the pressure immobilization, cautious removal of the overtight bandaging should occur as part of the initial assessment. However, signs of envenomation may develop, and the clinician should be prepared to treat immediately with antivenom and other therapy [

        <p>
         If antivenom is not indicated, then the first aid should be removed. If pressure immobilization first aid has been effectively applied, removal may result in severe envenomation developing rapidly or after a brief delay. This may result in sudden, potentially catastrophic collapse, including cardiac arrest (notably following bites by Australian brown snakes, genus

         Where possible, the snake should be identified clinically, by examination, or in Australia and Papua New Guinea, by venom kit testing combined with use of a diagnostic algorithm. Local knowledge is vital in this regard; in Southeast Asia, for example, syndromic diagnosis has been used  (

          16,17
         </a>
         ]. Although high rates of adverse reactions occur for some antivenoms, patients generally benefit from antivenom and, for many, antivenom is life-saving. All patients who receive antivenom warrant appropriate measures to manage an adverse reaction. (See
         <a class="local">

         Antivenoms consist of animal immunoglobulins developed against whole venom [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. The process involves immunizing animals (commonly horse, sheep, goats, or rabbits) with the venom and extracting the antivenom from the animal serum. Alternatively, IgY (immunoglobulin present in birds, reptiles, and amphibians but
         <strong>
          not

         mammals) may be raised against snake venoms using chicken eggs [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. However, there are concerns that IgY-based antivenoms may contain antibodies against only some classes of toxins and therefore may not offer the broad spectrum neutralization offered by IgG-based antivenoms. Antivenoms may be provided as whole immunoglobulin (IgG or IgY) or as Fab fragments; either F(ab)

         When deciding whether to administer antivenom, clinicians who are unfamiliar with the management of snakebite should seek expert consultation with a clinical toxinologist, poison control center, or physician experienced in management of snakebites in the region. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Additional resources'

        </p>
        <p>
         The decision to administer antivenom is based upon clinical findings and the risk of adverse reactions specific to the particular antivenom.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision on whether to use a monovalent or a polyvalent antivenom is determined by individual clinical circumstances, the nature of the local snake fauna, and the characteristics of the antivenoms under consideration. There is no clear "rule" that monovalent is better than polyvalent, but where the snake identity is established and the monovalent is of lower volume and risk (and potentially of lower cost), then it is clearly preferable to the polyvalent antivenom [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. However, if an appropriate monovalent antivenom is either not available in a timely manner or the quantity available is suboptimal, a relevant polyvalent antivenom may be used in addition or instead. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Antivenom'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Effectiveness of antivenom may be reduced by clinical factors (eg, late presentation), a mismatch between envenoming species and the antivenom administered (eg, misdiagnosis), pharmacokinetic factors (failure to reach target sites) and irreversible venom binding. (See
         <a class="local">

          Life-threatening envenomation

         – We recommend that patients with confirmed snakebite and evidence of life-threatening systemic envenomation  (

         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. The decision to administer antivenom must balance the potential benefit with the risk of adverse reactions, but in cases of severe envenomation when the antivenom is associated with relatively low rates of anaphylaxis, then treatment is appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients receiving antivenom require frequent monitoring and should have resuscitation equipment and medications to treat anaphylaxis, most importantly,

         Although specific data vary by region, snake species, and available antivenom, the evidence to support the benefit of antivenom relies mainly on indirect epidemiological evidence of lower mortality worldwide after the introduction of antivenom against local venomous snake species, in vitro studies of venom neutralization, animal studies, and observational series in humans [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,27,30-32

          1,33
         </a>
         ]. In 1914, prior to the availability of antivenom raised against indigenous species and wider availability of acute medical care facilities, the mortality among undifferentiated snakebite victims in India was approximately 8 percent [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         <a href="#rid2">
          2

          Local effects only
         </strong>
         — Many snake species may cause medically significant or even severe local tissue damage around the bite site. The role of antivenom in reducing or preventing such tissue injury remains uncertain, but in general, antivenom is considered to have at least some beneficial effect in this setting. It is therefore necessary to weigh the benefits and risks of giving antivenom to treat purely local effects, on a case by case basis and consultation with a clinician with expertise managing snakebites in the region is advised. Potential candidates include patients with rapid development of obviously severe local effects (such as blistering, bruising, hemorrhagic blebs, necrosis), or rapid progression of effects (eg, over one to two hours) to involve a substantial part of the bitten limb. Such patients typically also have some evidence of systemic envenomation although findings may be nonspecific (eg, nausea, vomiting, or headache).

         Availability of antivenom varies significantly by region. In general, appropriate antivenoms are more easily obtained in the Americas (North, Central, and South America), Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia than in sub-Saharan Africa and Papua New Guinea. Although there are good antivenoms available for Papua New Guinea, they are typically in short supply in hospitals there [

        </p>
        <p>
         Often antivenom is available on a regional or national basis through the producer. However, clinicians in many regions with significant numbers of dangerous snake envenomations have little or no access to antivenom because of short supply, cost, or lack of antivenom available for the specific snake species [

         For patients with envenomations by non-native exotic snakes, the clinician should contact the regional poison control center to determine if antivenom is available. Frequently, major zoos in North America, Europe, and Australia stock a range of antivenoms for exotic snakes in their collections. To obtain emergency consultation with a medical toxicologist, in the United States, call 1-800-222-1222, or the nearest international regional poison center. (See

          Route of administration
         </strong>
         – The IV route of administration is preferred to intramuscular (IM) injection whenever possible to ensure the most effective and rapid neutralization of snake venom. In small children, if IV access is not possible, intraosseous infusion is appropriate if life-threatening envenomation is likely. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6321.html" rel="external">

         The clinician may administer IV antivenom in one of two ways:

         ) and infused over 30 to 60 minutes

         Reconstituted (if required; eg, lyophilized antivenoms; not required for liquid antivenoms) and given by slow IV injection over 10 to 20 minutes
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Preliminary evidence suggests that the IV injection does not increase the risk of allergic reaction over IV infusion. As an example, in a trial of 198 patients receiving antivenom in Sri Lanka, the frequency of severe hypersensitivity reactions was not different in patients receiving IV injection over 20 minutes versus IV infusion over two hours (32 versus 35 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In general, IV infusion of diluted antivenom is still preferred because it permits slower administration with an ability to hold the infusion if an adverse reaction occurs and to restart the infusion at a slower rate after the reaction is treated. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Allergic reactions'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, in some circumstances, such as under-resourced developing nation local health facilities, equipment for safe use of a diluted IV infusion may not be available, or of suspect quality and safety, and in this setting a slow IV push of antivenom by the physician may be a better option. However, in such cases, the full dose of antivenom may be administered before an adverse reaction is clinically apparent.

         The patient should be monitored carefully for signs of adverse reactions during and for at least one hour following antivenom administration, regardless of route. Resuscitation equipment and medications to treat anaphylaxis, most importantly,

         Based on case series of patients envenomed by Russell's viper, IM routes of antivenom administration can be effective for systemic envenomation if IV administration is not possible [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. However, animal models indicate that the efficacy of IM antivenom may vary by snake species [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,41
         </a>
         ]. Thus, IM administration of antivenom should only be performed when IV or intraosseous (IO) administration cannot be achieved and for snake envenomations in which human or animal experience indicates that IM administration will be effective.

         The effect of the antivenom should be monitored carefully. Lack of response is usually caused by administration of inadequate amounts of antivenom or use of the wrong antivenom but may also occur if it is too late for the antivenom to be effective, such as in patients with advanced paralysis due to presynaptic neurotoxins in the venom. (See

         The typical timing to reversal of toxic effects when adequate amounts of antivenom have been given varies by type of envenomation as follows [

          Coagulopathy

         )) the coagulopathy may take longer than six hours to show evidence of reversal after adequate antivenom treatment. If formal coagulation tests are used to assess antivenom response to toxicity from these species (recommended whenever possible), then a response is generally defined as an improvement in coagulation parameters, not a return to normal values, which may take 24 hours or more.

         Given the risk of significant acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis following the administration of snake antivenom, resuscitation equipment and medications to treat anaphylaxis should be immediately available. The most important of these is

          epinephrine
         </a>
         (drawn up in a syringe or prepared for continuous IV infusion). The tables provide treatment recommendations for anaphylaxis  (

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The rate of early and late allergic reactions varies with different antivenom preparations and depends upon the method of purification, the total foreign protein load and the composition of the antivenom (whole immunoglobulin compared with Fab fragments) [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. Rates for early major adverse reactions to antivenom (anaphylaxis) can be very high, up to 80 percent for some antivenoms raised against Indian snakes  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93454" href="/z/d/graphic/93454.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], and in this setting the risk-benefit of use must be carefully considered before recommending use. For some other antivenoms (eg, CroFab, ViperaTAb, or Australian CSL/Seqirus antivenoms) the rate of anaphylaxis can be below 5 percent. However, the risk of adverse reactions is still significant for all antivenoms. Thus, antivenom administration should be avoided for trivial levels of envenomation.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, antivenom should not be withheld when severe or life-threatening envenomation has occurred. In some situations, the balance of benefit and risk of antivenom administration is very close. In such cases, consultation with a clinical toxinologist, poison control center, or physician experienced in the local management of snakebite should be sought. (See

         The clinician should gently clean the bite area with soap and water. If a venom detection kit will be used, cleansing should occur only after the wound site is swabbed. The wound should then be bandaged and checked once to twice daily for signs of infection, but prophylactic antibiotics are usually not indicated. Snakebites are considered tetanus prone wounds. (See

        <p>
         Evidence is lacking to guide positioning of an affected extremity after snakebite and the following suggestions are based upon experience and regional considerations as follows:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If antivenom is not available or has not been given, positioning of the affected limb depends upon the degree of swelling, the type of venomous snake, and the envenomation syndrome the patient is exhibiting.

         In regions where venomous snakebites result in significant local tissue damage with important but less common systemic effects (eg, North America), the bite wound may be placed at the level of the heart to manage local swelling but not encourage systemic absorption.

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         In settings where neurotoxicity is likely and local tissue effects are of secondary concern (eg, Australia), the bite wound should be kept below the level of the heart to slow lymphatic venom absorption.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Compartment syndromes may be confused with the appearance of local necrosis following envenomation but are rare. Fasciotomies should only be performed following confirmation of raised intracompartmental pressure and the correction of coagulopathy. Fasciotomy performed in patients with uncorrected coagulopathy may result in catastrophic bleeding and poorer outcomes in the affected limb [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the setting of major swelling due to envenoming, fasciotomy can be expected to result in significant long term functional and cosmetic problems and this known risk should be carefully considered as part of the risk-benefit analysis prior to any contemplated surgery.

         All patients with confirmed bites by neurotoxic snakes warrant hospital admission and frequent assessment of respiratory function. If signs of paralysis develop, including early signs such as ptosis, then there is a substantial risk that the paralysis may progress to a life-threatening extent. Thus, it is important to commence antivenom administration early, as soon as first signs become apparent (eg, ptosis or partial or lateral gaze ophthalmoplegia). (See

         ), some coral snakes, South American rattlesnakes, some Russell's vipers, and some European adders), response depends upon timely administration of antivenom. Antivenom cannot reverse established presynaptic neurotoxic paralysis [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50,51
         </a>
         ]. Once presynaptic venom is systemically absorbed, there is a latency of about an hour for the binding of neurotoxins at the NMJ and subsequent paralysis as the toxins enter and damage the terminal axon, resulting in inability to produce neurotransmitters. While antivenom can neutralize unbound toxins, once the presynaptic neurotoxins have entered the nerve cell, they are inaccessible to antivenom, which also cannot repair intracellular damage caused by these toxins. If antivenom therapy is delayed awaiting progression of paralysis beyond early signs of ptosis or gaze paralysis, it may then be too late to prevent major paralysis.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Intubation and ventilation are required for airway protection or respiratory support if bulbar palsy, increasing dyspnea, or respiratory failure is present. Regeneration of the NMJ may take up to several weeks. Thus the need for ventilation can be prolonged in such patients. (See

         However, it should be noted that snake venoms containing presynaptic neurotoxins will also contain postsynaptic neurotoxins, and in some cases, the neurotoxic effects may be principally mediated by the latter, with implications for treatment. (See

         Antivenom is the primary treatment for snakebite-induced coagulopathy with hemorrhage. It is not possible to correct coagulation defects without sufficient antivenom. Thus, persistent bleeding despite antivenom administration should prompt treatment with additional antivenom, provided the identification of the snake or choice of antivenom is secure. Although spontaneous bleeding may resolve rapidly after antivenom administration (eg, within 20 to 30 minutes), laboratory abnormalities may resolve more slowly (approximately six hours). Thus, evidence of clinical bleeding rather than laboratory measurement should be used to determine if sufficient antivenom has been provided.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal management of asymptomatic patients with laboratory evidence of snakebite-induced coagulopathy is unclear. Extrapolation from other medical conditions (eg, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy) has led to the suggestion that a multicomponent coagulopathy with parameters exceeding critical thresholds (international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;3.0, activated thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt;50 seconds, platelets &lt;50,000/microL,
         <strong>
          and
         </strong>
         fibrinogen &lt;75 mg/dL) is associated with a major bleeding risk of 1 percent over a few days [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>
         ]. Antivenom administration may be appropriate in such patients if the expected frequency of adverse reactions is low or antivenom is given in a setting where anaphylaxis can be readily managed. Consultation with a clinical toxinologist, poison control center, or physician experienced in the management of local snakebites is advised. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Additional resources'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, isolated coagulation abnormalities (eg, prolonged aPTT or INR in the absence of thrombocytopenia and low fibrinogen) that are
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         associated with clinical bleeding do not fit the pattern for snakebite-induced coagulopathy, except for snakes known to cause isolated "anticoagulant" type coagulopathy (eg, Australian Mulga and black snakes, genus
         <em>
          Pseudechis
         </em>
         ). In such cases, a previously undetected hereditary coagulation defect should be suspected.

         Of the blood products available, whole blood or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or similar products (eg, PF24) best addresses coagulopathy caused by snakebites and, as noted above, is primarily indicated in cases of life-threatening hemorrhage in conjunction with antivenom administration or, when antivenom is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         available and the patient has major bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         As in other patients with consumptive coagulopathy, platelet transfusions are indicated in patients with thrombocytopenia and bleeding, especially those with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, with a target of maintaining the platelet count above 100,000/microL. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7918.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         For envenomation by selected snakes that typically produces marked coagulopathy, sometimes with hemorrhage (eg, Australian Tiger, brown, and Taipan snakes), FFP or similar products (eg, PF24) has been suggested as a routine adjunctive therapy in the past [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69-71
         </a>
         ]. However, preliminary evidence indicates that while such treatment may result in more rapid return towards normal for laboratory parameters, there is no concomitant improvement in patient outcomes to offset the potential risks of blood product exposure. Therefore, we do not recommend routine use of FFP in patients bitten by these snakes and exhibiting coagulopathy. As an example, in a trial of 65 patients with venom induced consumptive coagulopathy, the 41 patients who received FFP were more likely to have an INR &lt;2 than the control group (78 versus 25 percent) [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69

         ]. However, the only significant bleeding complication (intracranial hemorrhage with death) occurred in a patient who received FFP, and the time to discharge was not significantly different between the groups.

         Immobilize the injured body part. We suggest that patients with snakebites from species with venoms that cause paralysis with little to no local tissue damage (eg, Australian elapids, kraits, some purely neurotoxic cobras, coral snakes, or South American rattlesnakes) and for whom transportation to definitive medical treatment will be prolonged receive pressure bandage and immobilization  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68766" href="/z/d/graphic/68766.html" rel="external">
          figure 2

         ) rather than immobilization alone (

          Grade 2C
         </a>

         <strong>
          Approach
         </strong>
         – Emergency management of respiratory depression and shock, followed by timely antivenom administration, if available, to patients with appropriate indications comprise the key initial interventions in patients with snakebite  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959" href="/z/d/graphic/73959.html" rel="external">
          table 9
         </a>
         ). If pressure immobilization is in place, then it should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be removed until initial assessment, stabilization, and, if needed, antivenom are provided. Additional management depends upon whether the biting snake is known or unknown and whether envenomation has occurred. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Antivenom
         </strong>
         – When deciding whether to administer antivenom, clinicians who are unfamiliar with the management of snakebite should seek expert consultation with a clinical toxinologist, poison control center, or physician experienced in management of snakebites in the region.

         <strong>
          Indications
         </strong>
         – We recommend that patients with confirmed snakebite and evidence of life-threatening systemic envenomation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959" href="/z/d/graphic/73959.html" rel="external">
          table 9
         </a>
         ) (eg, collapse, convulsions, weakness, paralysis, respiratory failure, shock, coagulopathy or bleeding, or acute kidney injury [notably following bites by Russell vipers]) receive antivenom, if available, rather than supportive care alone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">
          Grade 1A
         </a>
         ). Whenever possible, the snake should be identified clinically, by examination, or in Australia and Papua New Guinea, by venom kit testing. In certain regions, diagnostic algorithms can help with choosing the proper antivenom  (

          Contraindications and precautions
         </strong>
         – There are no absolute contraindications to antivenom administration. However, antivenom should be used with greater restraint and special caution in patients with a prior allergic reaction to antivenom or one of its components, asthma, or beta-adrenergic blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor as current medications. In general, if a patient is at serious risk of dying from envenomation, then the benefit of antivenom administration outweighs the risk of these adverse effects. Withholding antivenom because of a past adverse reactions is rarely likely to be appropriate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Contraindications'

         <strong>
          Premedication and monitoring for allergic reactions
         </strong>
         – Patients receiving antivenom require frequent monitoring and should have resuscitation equipment and medications immediately available to treat anaphylaxis. We suggest that patients treated with antivenom with a high rate of acute allergic reactions or who are receiving antivenom in facilities where the acute management of allergic reactions is problematic because of limited staffing or facilities receive premedication with subcutaneous

          Wound management
         </strong>
         – The clinician should gently clean the bite area with soap and water. If a venom detection kit will be used, cleansing should occur only after the wound site is swabbed. The wound should then be bandaged and checked once to twice daily for signs of infection. Evidence does not support the use of empiric antibiotics to prevent secondary infection after snakebite, and we do not use them. (See
