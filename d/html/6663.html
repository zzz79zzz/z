         Osteolytic bone disease is a major feature of multiple myeloma (MM) that can lead to severe disability and morbidity, including pain, decreased performance status, and decreased quality of life, as well as skeletal-related events (SRE), a composite endpoint defined as the need for radiation or surgery to bone, pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and/or hypercalcemia of malignancy. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         When used in patients with MM, osteoclast inhibitors decrease the frequency of pathologic vertebral fractures and other SREs and decrease skeletal-related pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of osteoclast inhibitors in patients with MM will be presented here. The role of these agents in the management of hypercalcemia and bone metastases from other malignancies is presented separately, as are more details regarding the side effects associated with each agent. Bone imaging in MM is also presented separately.

          Bisphosphonates
         </strong>
         – Bisphosphonates are synthetic analogues to inorganic pyrophosphates found within the bone matrix that, unlike natural pyrophosphates, are resistant to hydrolysis by phosphatases found in the blood. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix and have a direct apoptotic effect on osteoclasts, affect their differentiation and maturation, and thereby, act as potent inhibitors of bone resorption. (See

         Osteoclast inhibitors are an essential part of the management of skeletal lesions in patients with MM. While they do not repair existing bone damage, they prevent the development of new lesions. Osteoclast inhibitors can be administered in conjunction with anti-MM therapy directed at the plasma cell clone and do not appear to increase the toxicity of anti-MM therapy.

         In contrast, experts differ in their use of osteoclast inhibitors in patients with MM who have no bone lesions identified on cross-sectional imaging (CT, MRI, PET/CT) and have normal bone density. We do not routinely offer osteoclast inhibitors in this setting given an uncertain benefit and potential toxicities. Other experts offer osteoclast inhibitors to all patients with MM requiring treatment regardless of identifiable bone disease. This latter approach is recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [

In patients with MM and skeletal lesions, these agents reduce the number of vertebral fractures, skeletal-related events (SRE; a composite endpoint defined as osteolytic bone lesions, pathological fractures, and/or hypercalcemia), and associated pain.

However, there was significant heterogeneity among various bisphosphonates with respect to their effect on OS. There appeared to be a dose/potency effect with a subset analysis suggesting improved OS with

Pain control appears to take effect relatively rapidly. At least one study noted an onset of analgesia within approximately one week of beginning intravenous

         There are limited data regarding the optimum duration of osteoclast inhibitor therapy, and experts differ in their approach. We offer monthly treatment for a period of at least two years. After two years, we reassess tolerability and suggest continued monthly administration in all patients, as long as it is well tolerated.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the MM progresses during therapy, the osteoclast inhibitor is continued and adjustments are made to the anti-MM therapy directed at the plasma cell clone. Similarly, if the patient has a skeletal event (eg, a compression fracture or pathologic fracture), the osteoclast inhibitor is continued since this treatment reduces the relative number but does not prevent these complications altogether [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Other experts may reasonably discontinue the osteoclast inhibitor after two years in patients with responsive or stable MM with plans to restart the osteoclast inhibitor at MM progression [

         Additional experts may decrease the frequency of treatments in patients without active MM (eg, those on maintenance therapy) [

        </p>
        <p>
         The different expert perspectives regarding duration of therapy reflect different values and preferences for the potential toxicities and benefits with continued treatment. Data on prolonged use in the setting of MM are limited as randomized trials largely stopped osteoclast inhibitor therapy at or before two years [

          6-9,11-14,19,21,35

        </p>
        <p>
         Our preference to continue therapy places greater value on avoidance of skeletal-related events (SRE) and a potential survival benefit with prolonged treatment, while recognizing an increase in toxicity.

        <p>
         In the open-label, multicenter CALGB 70604 trial, 1544 patients with MM or bone metastases from a solid malignancy were randomly assigned to the same dose of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9902" href="/z/d/drug information/9902.html" rel="external">
          zoledronic acid

         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. The two treatment arms reported a similar estimated percentage of patients who experienced at least one SRE within two years of randomization. Patients assigned to monthly administration had numerically higher rates of osteonecrosis of the jaw (2 versus 1 percent) and kidney dysfunction (1.2 versus 0.5 percent) that did not reach statistical significance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among the 278 patients with MM, reported rates of SRE were 26 versus 21 percent in those receiving monthly and every three month treatment, respectively. However, interpretation of these data is severely limited by the short follow-up (median 1.2 years), small number of patients with MM, and a high early drop-out rate (46 percent among those with MM). This limitation can be illustrated in a worst-case-scenario analysis that assumes no SREs among those who dropped out on the monthly administration arm and assumes SREs among all patients who dropped out on the every three month arm. In this hypothetical analysis, rates of SREs would be at least double in the every three month arm (55 versus 26 percent). This study also fails to take into account the potential survival benefit from monthly

          Whom to treat
         </strong>
         – For most patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), we recommend the use of an osteoclast inhibitor, to be given in addition to other therapies directed at the malignant plasma cell clone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B

         An important exception is that we do

         routinely offer an osteoclast inhibitor to the uncommon patient who has no bone lesions on cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], positron emission tomography-computed tomography [PET/CT]) and has normal bone density given an uncertain benefit in this population and potential toxicities. Other experts offer osteoclast inhibitors to all patients with MM requiring treatment regardless of identifiable bone disease.

         In patients with MM and skeletal lesions, osteoclast inhibitors reduce vertebral fractures, skeletal-related events (ie, osteolytic bone lesions, pathological fractures, and/or hypercalcemia), and associated pain. They are usually well tolerated but are associated with low rates of serious toxicities, including osteonecrosis of the jaw. (See

          Limited role in smoldering MM, MGUS, or solitary plasmacytoma
         </strong>
         – We do not routinely offer osteoclast inhibitors to patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), solitary plasmacytoma, or smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Osteoclast inhibitors are offered to these patients only if they have another indication for their use, such as osteoporosis or osteopenia on bone mineral density studies, at doses used for osteoporosis.

          Duration of therapy
         </strong>
         – There are limited data regarding the optimum duration of osteoclast inhibitor therapy, and experts differ in their approach. We offer monthly treatment for a period of at least two years. After two years, we reassess tolerability and suggest continued monthly administration in all patients, as long as it is well tolerated. The osteoclast inhibitor is continued in patients who experience a skeletal event and/or who progress on therapy. (See
