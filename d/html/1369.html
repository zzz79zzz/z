HIT results from an autoantibody directed against platelet factor 4 (PF4) in complex with heparin (referred to as a HIT antibody). HIT antibodies activate platelets and can cause catastrophic arterial and venous thrombosis, with a mortality rate as high as 20 percent, although with improved recognition and early intervention, mortality rates below 2 percent have been reported.</p><p>Here we discuss the prevention and management of HIT.

In most cases, treatment must be initiated based on a strong clinical suspicion of HIT, even before confirmatory laboratory test results are available. For individuals with a strong clinical suspicion of HIT (eg, based on an intermediate or high probability 4 Ts score) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia", section on '4 Ts score'</a>), therapy (discontinuation of all heparin, reversal of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>, initiation of a non-heparin anticoagulant) should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory testing.</p><p>There are two major goals of the initial treatment [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>To halt platelet activation as rapidly as possible</strong>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In most cases, platelet activation only occurs in the presence of both heparin and HIT antibodies, and elimination of all heparin exposure is the best way to halt platelet activation. (See <a class="local">'Stop heparin for a presumptive diagnosis of HIT'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There is increasing awareness of rare forms of HIT (eg, autoimmune HIT, which includes delayed-onset HIT, persisting or refractory HIT, and spontaneous HIT), characterized by platelet activation in the absence of heparin. Additional interventions to halt platelet activation may be needed in these cases. (See <a class="local">'Autoimmune (heparin-independent) HIT variants'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>To provide therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with a non-heparin-anticoagulant until the thrombosis risk has returned to baseline</strong>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The risk of thrombosis is high enough that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation is needed regardless of whether a thrombotic event has occurred [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. A potential exception is an individual who has clinically significant bleeding or for whom the risk of bleeding is determined to be very high. Significant thrombocytopenia alone is not a contraindication to full-dose anticoagulation. (See <a class="local">'Rationale for anticoagulation'</a> below and <a class="local">'HIT with bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There are several options among the non-heparin anticoagulants  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115506" href="/d/graphic/115506.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The choice of non-heparin anticoagulant must consider the urgency for therapeutic anticoagulation (based on severity of clinical findings), the potential need for rapid reversal (ie, half-life of the drug and whether a reversal agent is available), the patient's kidney and liver function (which affects drug metabolism), cost, and other factors. (See <a class="local">'Choice and dose of non-heparin anticoagulant'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The duration of anticoagulation is generally longer for people who have had a thrombotic event than for those who have not. (See <a class="local">'Duration of anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Warfarin</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">Warfarin</a> can be used for anticoagulation once stable anticoagulation with another non-heparin agent has been established and an adequate platelet count has been attained (eg, &gt;150,000/microL). However, warfarin should not be used until anticoagulation with a non-heparin agent has been established and the platelet count has recovered, due to the potential risk of precipitating skin necrosis and venous limb gangrene resulting from rapid depletion of protein C in the first days of warfarin administration. If the patient is receiving warfarin when HIT with thrombosis or venous limb gangrene develops, warfarin should be reversed with vitamin K. In the absence of thrombosis or limb gangrene, discontinuation is sufficient, although administration of low-dose oral vitamin K may be considered given its low cost, safety, and potential to mitigate the risk of thrombosis. (See <a class="local">'Hold or reverse warfarin'</a> below and <a class="local">'Transition to warfarin or other outpatient anticoagulant'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>DOACs</strong> – Increasingly, long-term primary or secondary prophylaxis of thrombosis in patients with HIT and a normal and stable platelet count is provided with a therapeutic dose of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). Although data are limited, preliminary evidence suggests this strategy to be both safe and effective. In patients who cannot take an oral medication, long-term subcutaneous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8691" href="/d/drug information/8691.html" rel="external">fondaparinux</a> is also used. (See <a class="local">'Direct oral anticoagulants'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessments</strong> – All individuals with suspected HIT should have ongoing evaluation including continuous assessment for other possible causes of thrombocytopenia, serial monitoring for bleeding and thrombotic complications, and serial measurement of platelet counts and other laboratory parameters as clinically indicated. The rationale and timing are summarized in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef131882" href="/d/graphic/131882.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Any change in clinical findings (eg, development of a new thrombosis, further drop in platelet count) should prompt a recalculation of the 4 Ts score. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6680.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to thrombocytopenia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5921.html" rel="external">"Causes of thrombocytopenia in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Our approach is generally similar to that of others:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2018 guideline from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2015 expert review and case discussion of HIT management [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2012 guideline from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]</p><p></p><p>The above guidelines differ somewhat on the recommended duration of anticoagulation, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Duration of anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25998083"><span class="h2">Stop heparin for a presumptive diagnosis of HIT</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinicians should closely review the patient's clinical findings and involve the consulting hematologist (if available) as early as possible. Errors in either direction (making a presumptive diagnosis of HIT when HIT is <strong>unlikely</strong> or failing to make a presumptive diagnosis of HIT when HIT is <strong>likely</strong>) can have serious consequences for the patient. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Diagnosing HIT when HIT is absent exposes the patient to unnecessary bleeding risks from anticoagulation with non-heparin agents, cancellation of needed procedures, and/or future avoidance of heparin when heparin might be clinically indicated [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. As an example, the risk of bleeding with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8765" href="/d/drug information/8765.html" rel="external">argatroban</a> may be as high as 20 percent [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The use of a parenteral anticoagulant typically necessitates a more prolonged hospital stay. The costs of anticoagulant administration, management of complications, and extended hospitalization are substantial [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Failing to diagnose HIT when HIT is likely exposes the patient to a high risk of potentially avoidable thrombosis (arterial or venous). The risk of thrombosis with HIT in the absence of anticoagulation is as high as 30 to 50 percent, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Rationale for anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals with a presumptive diagnosis of HIT should have immediate discontinuation of all heparin exposure  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116435" href="/d/graphic/116435.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The table lists sources of heparin  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116422" href="/d/graphic/116422.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The need to avoid all forms of heparin exposure should be immediately conveyed to all personnel caring for the patient, along with a notation in the patient's medical record and signs posted at the bedside or attached to all intravenous delivery devices. Electronic medical records should build in fail-safe mechanisms to prevent ordering of heparin-containing medications in patients with either active or prior HIT. Patients should also be educated about the need for heparin avoidance and encouraged to advocate for this in their care.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H501080793"><span class="h2">Incorporate clinical information</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of HIT must take into consideration both clinical <strong>and</strong> laboratory evidence, and, often, definitive laboratory data (ie, strongly positive immunoassay and/or positive functional assay for HIT antibodies) are not immediately available (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia", section on 'HIT antibody testing'</a>). Thus, a presumptive diagnosis of HIT must often be based on clinical findings and limited laboratory data that include serial platelet counts, other findings from the complete blood count (CBC), and coagulation testing.</p><p>The 4 Ts score (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/90389.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) is an extremely helpful and easy-to-use score that quantifies the clinical findings associated with HIT based on four parameters (degree of <strong>T</strong>hrombocytopenia, <strong>T</strong>iming, <strong>T</strong>hrombotic events or sequelae, al<strong>T</strong>ernative causes of thrombocytopenia)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120545" href="/d/graphic/120545.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). The 4 Ts score requires vigilance to document heparin exposure and its timing relative to a decrease in platelet count, as well as judgment related to the likelihood of alternative explanations for thrombocytopenia. It risk-stratifies patients into low, intermediate, or high probability of HIT. The score should be used as an initial guide for clinicians but should not substitute for clinical judgment [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the 4 Ts score is intermediate or high probability, we make a presumptive diagnosis of HIT because an intermediate or high probability 4 Ts score will capture &gt;95 percent of patients with a reasonable likelihood of HIT regardless of whether they have had a thrombotic event. The score is highly sensitive, but many individuals with intermediate or high probability scores will not have HIT. Thus, the urgency of obtaining supportive laboratory testing should be emphasized.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the 4 Ts score is low probability, we do <strong>not </strong>make a presumptive diagnosis of HIT because the risk of HIT is very low (0 to 3 percent). However, in rare or complex cases, a clinician may suspect HIT despite a low probability 4 Ts score, and a presumptive clinical diagnosis of HIT may be made prior to laboratory testing.</p><p></p><p>The clinical evaluation for suspected HIT is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia", section on 'Overview of our approach to evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with a presumptive diagnosis of HIT should generally receive full-dose anticoagulation until the diagnosis is confirmed (or refuted) by laboratory testing. This includes patients who, prior to concern for HIT, were only on prophylactic dose heparin or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin and have no other indication for therapeutic intensity anticoagulation. Once confirmatory laboratory testing for HIT returns, additional decisions about the duration of anticoagulation and follow-up can be made. (See <a class="local">'Incorporating results of HIT antibody testing'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H74408994"><span class="h2">Hold or reverse warfarin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">Warfarin</a> is a reasonable choice for anticoagulation in HIT, but it must <strong>not</strong> be started until after the individual is stably anticoagulated for an appropriate duration with a non-heparin anticoagulant and the platelet count has recovered [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Specific agents'</a> below.)</p><p>The rationale is that during the initial phase of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> administration (first one to two days), there is a transient hypercoagulable state caused by depletion of functional protein C, which has a short half-life compared with the half-life of coagulation factors II and X. Functional protein S is also depleted. This rapid depletion of anticoagulant proteins may increase the risk of thrombosis, including venous limb gangrene in patients with thrombosis [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. This has been observed in individuals with underlying protein C deficiency but is also possible in other individuals. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1354.html" rel="external">"Protein C deficiency", section on 'Warfarin-induced skin necrosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1334.html" rel="external">"Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects", section on 'Skin necrosis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are diagnosed with HIT while receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> should have their warfarin held and reversed with vitamin K (typically given intravenously), and an alternate, non-heparin anticoagulant started. The exact timing of vitamin K administration should attempt to minimize the chance of precipitating or exacerbating thrombosis due to HIT in the setting of the initial procoagulant effect of warfarin. Thus, for a patient starting on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8765" href="/d/drug information/8765.html" rel="external">argatroban</a> who has received one or two doses of warfarin, it may be appropriate to establish stable anticoagulation with argatroban before giving vitamin K. However, it is important not to under-dose the argatroban based on a prolonged aPTT that will occur if the patient has significant residual warfarin effect. For a patient starting <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8691" href="/d/drug information/8691.html" rel="external">fondaparinux</a> or other medications that rapidly reach a predictable peak anticoagulant effect, it may be reasonable to give vitamin K at the same time the non-heparin anticoagulant is initiated.</p><p>These patients may transition back to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> (or perhaps a DOAC) after an appropriate duration of anticoagulation with the non-heparin anticoagulant and once the platelet count has normalized; appropriate intervals are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Transition to warfarin or other outpatient anticoagulant'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3800006617"><span class="h2">Start full-dose therapeutic anticoagulation with a non-heparin anticoagulant</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of HIT (and/or a confirmed diagnosis of HIT based on HIT antibody testing), we recommend immediate full-dose anticoagulation with a non-heparin anticoagulant rather than discontinuation of heparin alone, unless there is a strong contraindication (eg, bleeding, high bleeding risk). This applies to all patients, regardless of the initial indication for, and dose of, heparin (eg, full-dose anticoagulation, heparin flushes). Some experts consider prophylactic intensity (such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8691" href="/d/drug information/8691.html" rel="external">fondaparinux</a> 2.5 mg daily) rather than therapeutic intensity anticoagulation in patients with an intermediate 4 Ts score without any other indication for therapeutic anticoagulation who have a high bleeding risk [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].

However, if bleeding occurs and the platelet count is &lt;50,000/microL (&lt;100,000/microL for central nervous system bleeding), platelet transfusion should be considered. Platelet transfusions may also be appropriate for some patients who require an invasive procedure. This decision is individualized based on the patient's clinical status, platelet count, and expected bleeding risk. Further information regarding platelet transfusions is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7918.html" rel="external">"Platelet transfusion: Indications, ordering, and associated risks", section on 'Indications for platelet transfusion'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7918.html" rel="external">"Platelet transfusion: Indications, ordering, and associated risks", section on 'TTP or HIT'</a>.)</p><p>Additional interventions for bleeding include the use of a reversal agent, if the patient is still anticoagulated, and correction of surgical/anatomic defects.
