Most cases in this age group are acquired, caused by infection or a food protein intolerance.</p><p>When diarrhea begins within days of birth and is persistent (lasting more than two weeks) or severe, several uncommon causes must be considered. These include congenital anatomic anomalies of the intestine and a group of rare genetic disorders collectively known as "congenital diarrheas and enteropathies" (CODEs) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review will outline a clinical approach to infants presenting with chronic diarrhea before six months of age and particularly during the first six weeks of life. The acquired causes will be outlined briefly, with links to more detailed discussions. The congenital causes, including CODEs, will be discussed in more detail. </p><p>Other aspects of chronic diarrhea in children are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5881.html" rel="external">"Approach to chronic diarrhea in children &gt;6 months in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5878.html" rel="external">"Persistent diarrhea in children in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H567163256"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF THE CAUSES OF DIARRHEA DURING INFANCY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In resource-abundant settings, a wide variety of disorders cause chronic diarrheas in neonates and young infants  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118302" href="/d/graphic/118302.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Most frequently, chronic diarrhea is of allergic or infectious origin and is usually not associated with any significant long-term sequelae. Less common causes of diarrhea in infants include anatomic disorders such as gastroschisis or inflammatory disorders such as necrotizing enterocolitis, which can require surgical resection that may be complicated by short bowel syndrome and chronic diarrhea. In resource-limited settings, chronic diarrhea is usually associated with serial enteric infections and environmental enteric dysfunction [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5878.html" rel="external">"Persistent diarrhea in children in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p>Congenital diarrheas and enteropathies (CODEs) are rare genetic disorders characterized by persistent and often severe diarrhea presenting in the first weeks of life, often associated with feeding intolerance, malabsorption, and growth failure [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Most CODEs are monogenic and can be categorized into genetic variants that directly affect the intestinal epithelium or those that affect the immune system, which secondarily impair epithelial function  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117908" href="/d/graphic/117908.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3372473095"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3548311378"><span class="h2">Assessment of the diarrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step is to determine the presence and severity of the diarrhea using either qualitative or quantitative measures, as appropriate to the clinical setting. Diarrhea in infancy is difficult to define based on stool frequency or consistency since the normal range for these parameters can vary greatly. In outpatient settings, the presence and severity of diarrhea can be inferred by the significant deviation from the daily stool pattern and by the level of dehydration, presence of electrolyte abnormalities, and poor weight gain. In inpatient settings, it may be possible to quantify the stool output, in which case, diarrhea can be defined as stool volume of more than 20 g/kg/day in a young infant. In children with ostomies, output of greater than 30 g/kg/day is considered excessive. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5860.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of acute diarrhea in children"</a>.)</p><p>In infants, diarrhea is typically defined as acute if it lasts less than two weeks or chronic when it persists for longer than two weeks.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H889305679"><span class="h2">Clinical features that suggest a cause</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The second step is to do a thorough history and physical examination to identify the most likely cause(s) of the diarrhea  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118302" href="/d/graphic/118302.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), focusing on the following considerations:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H46733893"><span class="h3">Acquired diarrheas</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing and severity</strong> – Acquired diarrheas can present at any time during infancy, usually after the first few weeks of life. They vary in severity but are usually mild or moderate. By contrast, diarrhea presenting immediately postnatally or requiring critical care intervention is more likely to represent a congenital diarrhea or enteropathy (CODE). (See <a class="local">'Congenital diarrheas and enteropathies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Triggers and associated features</strong> – Acquired diarrheas often have characteristic features that permit a provisional diagnosis. Important causes to consider in an infant are listed below; details of diagnosis and management are available in the linked topic reviews.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Infections</strong> – Infections are the most common cause of diarrhea in either resource-abundant or resource-limited settings. Clues to enteric infections are sudden onset of symptoms, ill contacts, and sometimes fever or vomiting. While most infectious diarrheas resolve within two weeks and are therefore considered acute diarrheas, they occasionally persist, especially in immunocompromised individuals. In some cases, persistent diarrhea after an acute infection is caused by lingering mucosal injury with malabsorption, termed "postinfectious enteropathy."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Most infectious diarrheas are caused by viruses, including rotavirus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and norovirus. Less common in resource-abundant settings, but a significant factor globally, are enteric bacterial pathogens, such as <em>Salmonella enterica</em>, <em>Shigella </em>spp, C<em>ampylobacter jejuni</em>,<em> </em>and pathogenic <em>Escherichia coli </em>[<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6456.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13956.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Food-induced</strong> – Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis is a common cause of bloody, loose stools in young infants [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The infant is otherwise healthy, and there is no associated vomiting or weight loss. In most cases, the triggering protein is cow's milk, ingested through either breast milk or cow's milk-based formula. It can be induced by soy protein as well. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5897.html" rel="external">"Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis of infancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is an uncommon gastrointestinal food hypersensitivity that manifests as profuse, repetitive vomiting, sometimes with diarrhea, leading to dehydration and lethargy in the acute setting or weight loss and failure to thrive in a chronic form [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Symptoms of classic FPIES usually begin in early infancy, within one to four weeks following introduction of cow's milk or soy protein. In extreme cases, symptoms may begin within the first days of life. FPIES may present later in infancy if the exposure is delayed, eg, when the trigger is a solid food. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16528.html" rel="external">"Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Prematurity or medical illness</strong> – Necrotizing enterocolitis usually presents in hospitalized premature infants with symptoms of watery or bloody diarrhea, abdominal distension, feeding intolerance, and temperature instability [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Abdominal radiographs show dilated bowel loops, often with intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis). Occasionally, necrotizing enterocolitis develops in full-term infants, usually in the setting of an underlying medical illness (eg, congenital heart disease or sepsis). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5019.html" rel="external">"Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal atresias, or other congenital bowel malformations require resection of substantial portions of bowel, this may lead to short bowel syndrome, with associated malabsorption and diarrhea. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5894.html" rel="external">"Management of short bowel syndrome in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Any medication or herbal supplement given to the infant should be reviewed as a possible cause of diarrhea. As examples, antibiotics or products with high concentrations of fructose commonly induce diarrhea [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H368115888"><span class="h3">Congenital diarrheas and enteropathies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CODEs are rare genetic disorders with diverse mechanisms, characterized by persistent and often severe diarrhea presenting in the first weeks of life  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117908" href="/d/graphic/117908.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing and severity</strong> – Infants with CODEs typically have severe diarrhea from birth; although, in some cases, diarrhea may start after the neonatal period, particularly when caused by immune dysregulation. By contrast, acquired diarrheas due to infectious and allergic conditions generally have a symptom-free postnatal period of at least a few weeks before the diarrhea develops. In some CODEs, the volume of diarrhea may be so high that less experienced parents, caregivers, and clinicians may confuse watery diarrhea for urine, delaying recognition and appropriate consultation. In these cases, the infant may come to medical attention because of dehydration or a persistent metabolic acidosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other features</strong> – Other clinical features that raise the possibility of CODEs include polyhydramnios, multisystemic disease (eg, dysmorphism or other congenital anomalies or immune deficiencies), and consanguinity or membership in a higher-risk population (eg, Navajo) [<a href="#rid11">11-16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2851273153"><span class="h3">Other congenital disorders that may present with diarrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Congenital abnormalities of the intestine sometimes present with diarrhea in young infants. These usually can be diagnosed by fluoroscopic imaging, guided by the characteristic clinical features of each disorder  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118302" href="/d/graphic/118302.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hirschsprung disease</strong> – Infants with Hirschsprung disease occasionally present with Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis, a potentially life-threatening illness with a sepsis-like picture including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension. It can also present with subacute diarrhea and poor weight gain. More often, Hirschsprung disease presents with symptoms of distal intestinal obstruction, including bilious emesis, abdominal distension, delayed passage of meconium or stool, and constipation. An important clue is explosive release of gas and stool during digital examination of the rectum ("squirt sign"). Infants with Down syndrome have a high risk of having Hirschsprung disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5903.html" rel="external">"Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)", section on 'Suspected enterocolitis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intestinal malrotation with intermittent volvulus</strong> – Intestinal malrotation with intermittent volvulus occasionally presents with diarrhea, which may be bloody, and intermittent abdominal pain. However, obstructive symptoms and vomiting are more common presenting features. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6477.html" rel="external">"Intestinal malrotation in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5904.html" rel="external">"Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in children: Causes and diagnostic approach", section on 'Malrotation with midgut volvulus'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pseudo-obstruction</strong> – Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is characterized by impaired intestinal motility without anatomic obstruction, leading to diffuse bowel dilation, abdominal distension, (usually) vomiting and constipation, and (sometimes) diarrhea [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Fluoroscopic imaging often reveals very dilated bowel loops and malrotation (similar to congenital short bowel syndrome). It is rare in infants and is caused by congenital defects in myopathies, neuropathies, or mitochondrial disorders. Some cases are associated with dilated but unobstructed bladder (known as megacystis, microcolon, and hypoperistalsis syndrome) [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2639.html" rel="external">"Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Genetic'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Congenital short bowel syndrome</strong> – This is a rare congenital defect that usually presents during the first few days of life with generalized malabsorptive diarrhea and dilated bowel loops despite lack of abdominal distension, often with bile-stained vomiting and failure to thrive [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Fluoroscopic imaging often reveals malrotation (similar to CIPO), as well as the abnormally shortened small bowel. Genetic and in utero developmental causes have been identified. The presentation can be very similar to many CODE disorders.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2863844494"><span class="h1">EVALUATION FOR SUSPECTED CONGENITAL DIARRHEAS AND ENTEROPATHIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the initial evaluation suggests an acquired diarrhea, further evaluation depends on the suspected type (see <a class="local">'Acquired diarrheas'</a> above). If the initial evaluation suggests the possibility of a congenital diarrhea and enteropathy (CODE), an approach to further evaluation is described below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1177997402"><span class="h2">Initial tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with a suspected CODE, the initial evaluation includes a battery of serum tests, stool tests, fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal series, and upper endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy (with colonoscopy for selected patients). A typical sequence of testing is outlined below, but the order may vary depending on the patient's presentation and clinical suspicion for a particular disorder  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117908" href="/d/graphic/117908.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1445035146"><span class="h3">Serum testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial testing for all infants with a suspected CODE should include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete blood count with differential – Low hemoglobin suggests iron deficiency anemia (eg, due to blood loss), leukocytosis suggests an infectious diarrhea, and low total lymphocyte counts suggest a possible T or B cell deficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Electrolytes and trace elements (sodium [Na<sup>+</sup>], potassium [K<sup>+</sup>], chloride [Cl<sup>-</sup>], bicarbonate [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], and glucose) – Hypokalemic metabolic acidosis (low K<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) is the most common electrolyte pattern associated with most diarrheas. However, congenital chloride diarrhea presents with a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Some of these disorders are associated with hyperglycemia or diabetes that develop during infancy (Mitchell-Riley syndrome [<em>RFX6</em> gene mutation]) or later in life (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked [IPEX] syndrome, intestinal anendocrinosis [<em>NEUROG3</em> gene mutation]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Systemic inflammatory biomarkers – Elevated levels of C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest an acute or chronic inflammatory condition, especially if the diarrhea is bloody. In a young infant with chronic diarrhea, there are several possible causes of inflammatory diarrhea, which are often categorized as very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease, a congenital immunodeficiency, or both. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5879.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children", section on 'Very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], alkaline phosphatase) – The primary purpose of measuring AST and ALT is to screen for cholestatic liver disease, which can cause chronic diarrhea due to bile acid insufficiency. In infants receiving parenteral nutrition, abnormalities in these tests are often due to intestinal failure-associated liver disease (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5948.html" rel="external">"Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants"</a>). However, some monogenic CODEs are also associated with liver disease, including microvillus inclusion disease, trichohepatoenteric syndrome, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and some autoimmune enteropathies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Albumin – Low serum albumin associated with diarrhea may suggest insufficient caloric absorption or excessive protein loss, indicative of protein-losing enteropathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4769.html" rel="external">"Protein-losing gastroenteropathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The following tests also may be included in the initial evaluation if suggestive clinical features are present  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117908" href="/d/graphic/117908.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) or may be selected later in the evaluation based on the type of diarrhea.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If fat malabsorption is suspected (due to grossly fatty diarrhea, positive fecal fat screening, abnormal serum lipids, or clinical features of cystic fibrosis):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lipid panel (triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein [LDL]) – Very low LDL suggests abetalipoproteinemia. Elevated triglycerides and cholesterol suggest cholestatic liver disease.

The first step is to evaluate for the most common infectious diarrheas, if these have not already been excluded. This testing should include standard assessment of enteric bacterial pathogens by culture and/or by polymerase chain reaction. Viral pathogens such as rotavirus, cytomegalovirus, norovirus, and adenovirus should be tested by polymerase chain reaction and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cytomegalovirus and adenovirus can also be assessed on the intestinal biopsy if performed later in the evaluation.</p><p>The following tests require special stool-collection procedures and should be performed during feeds with a full caloric challenge, as well as during fasting (unless the diarrhea abates completely during fasting). The infant's dietary intake at the time of testing should be recorded in detail to permit accurate interpretation of the stool test results.</p><p>Collection of accurate stool samples can be challenging because the diaper rapidly absorbs stool water and stool is often mixed with urine in the diaper. To avoid loss of stool water in an absorbent diaper, either reverse the diaper so that the nonabsorbent surface is on the inside or line the diaper with a nonabsorbent surface, such as an adhesive wound dressing. In addition, the stool must be separated from urine to allow for accurate stool sampling and volume measurement. For boys, this usually can be accomplished by using an adhesive bag to catch the urine. For girls (or for boys if the adhesive bag is not successful), a urine catheter may be needed but should only be used for a few days to reduce the risk a of secondary urinary tract infection. The stool samples should be packaged and sent for testing as soon as possible after excretion.</p><p>Samples of stool should be sent for the following tests:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Electrolytes</strong> – This is a key test in evaluating the nature of the diarrhea and for calculation of the stool osmotic gap.

These include congenital chloride diarrhea, congenital sodium diarrhea, hormone diarrhea (due to VIPoma or serotonin-secreting tumor), or primary bile acid diarrhea (due to a defect in ileal bile acid reuptake transporters [eg, SLC10A2]). In congenital chloride diarrhea, stool Cl<sup>-</sup> is typically &gt;120 mM [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].

This is also valuable for any infant with profuse watery diarrhea to validate the other stool tests. Proper stool collection is confirmed if the stool osmolality is isoosmolar to serum (approximately 290 mOsm). Stool osmolarity that is well above this threshold suggests contamination with urine (or delay in sample processing, with evaporation of water or fermentation). Stool osmolarity below this threshold suggests contamination with water (eg, factitious diarrhea).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reducing substances and pH</strong> – These tests serve as an initial screen for carbohydrate malabsorption. They must be interpreted in the context of the infant's diet and age. Neonates normally have some degree of carbohydrate malabsorption because of immaturity of the disaccharidase enzymes (eg, lactase) on the intestinal brush border.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reducing substances &gt;0.5 percent suggests possible malabsorption of disaccharides or monosaccharides (although up to 0.75 percent can be normal in neonates and young infants).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Glucose, lactose, and fructose are reducing sugars. Therefore, this test accurately reflects carbohydrate malabsorption if the infant is breastfed or on a formula that contains these sugars (eg, any cow's milk-based formula). By contrast, reducing substances may be negative if the infant is on a formula that contains only sucrose (a nonreducing sugar). However, malabsorbed sucrose is sometimes degraded by colonic bacteria to glucose and fructose, resulting in a positive test for reducing substances.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Low pH (&lt;5.3) also suggests carbohydrate malabsorption; this finding is caused by fermentation of malabsorbed carbohydrates by colonic bacteria, resulting in an abundance of short-chain fatty acids.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alpha-1 antitrypsin</strong> – Elevated alpha-1 antitrypsin in the stool reflects intestinal protein loss; patients with this finding may have low serum albumin and IgG as well. Causes include a protein-losing enteropathy (eg, lymphangiectasia, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 [DGAT1] deficiency, or complement decay-accelerating factor [CD55] deficiency) or an inflammatory enteropathy (eg, immune dysregulation-associated enteropathies [autoimmune or immunodeficiency] or postinfectious enteropathy). Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a protein that is largely resistant to the action of intestinal proteases, unless it is secreted in the stomach.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fat</strong> – A qualitative or spot fecal fat (neutral or split) is a helpful initial screen for fat malabsorption, although the sensitivity and specificity of this test are limited. Elevation in neutral fat reflects increased unhydrolyzed mono-, di-, or triglyceride content in the stool and is consistent with pancreatic insufficiency. Elevation in split fat reflects increased free fatty acids in stool and correlates with fat malabsorption from injury to or loss of the mucosal surface.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If fat malabsorption is suspected (eg, due to fatty-appearing stools or positive spot test), a quantitative 72-hour fecal fat collection should be performed for a more accurate assessment of fat malabsorption. The test requires a complete collection of all stools passed during the collection period, as well as a record of dietary fat intake, to permit calculation of the percentage of fat absorbed. Normal neonates and young infants absorb 75 to 80 percent of dietary fat, and this proportion increases with age; a healthy six-month-old infant absorbs 80 to 95 percent of dietary fat.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elastase</strong> – Stool elastase should be measured to screen for pancreatic insufficiency. Elastase is secreted by the pancreas, and low values (&lt;200 mcg/g) suggest pancreatic insufficiency. Abnormal results also may be seen in any type of high-volume diarrhea due to the effects of dilution.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inflammation</strong> – The following tests serve to screen for an inflammatory process:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Occult blood – A positive test for occult blood (Hemoccult) indicates or confirms the presence of blood in the stool and could indicate an inflammatory process.

This is particularly important for infants presenting with any signs or symptoms of obstruction, including vomiting and abdominal distension, or with signs of proximal bowel obstruction on conventional abdominal radiograph. The main purpose is to evaluate for malrotation, congenital short bowel syndrome, and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO). Congenital short bowel syndrome and CIPO are characterized by very dilated bowel loops and are often associated with malrotation.

In general, at least an upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) should be performed to assess small intestinal structure. Sigmoidoscopy is often performed as well to assess colonic changes, especially if there is any suspicion of colitis.

Most CODEs are monogenic and can be categorized into genetic variants that directly affect the intestinal epithelium and impair absorption of nutrients or electrolyte flux, or those that affect the immune system, which, due to inflammation, secondarily impair epithelial function  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117908" href="/d/graphic/117908.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong> – Most CODEs present with severe diarrheal symptoms that begin within the first weeks of life, although some CODEs, particularly those caused by immune dysregulation, may present after the neonatal period. Other clinical features that raise the possibility of a CODE include membership in a population with a high frequency of certain genetic variants or consanguinity, multisystemic disease (eg, dysmorphism or other congenital anomalies or immune deficiencies), and polyhydramnios. (See <a class="local">'Congenital diarrheas and enteropathies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – For most patients with a suspected CODE, the initial evaluation includes a battery of serum tests, stool tests, and upper endoscopy (with colonoscopy for selected patients). A few of these tests may be selected later in the evaluation based on the type of diarrhea.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Standard serum testing includes complete blood count, electrolytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, liver function tests, and albumin. Additional testing for selected patients includes a lipid panel, immunoglobulin G and A (IgG and IgA), and T and B cell subsets. (See <a class="local">'Serum testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Standard stool tests consist of electrolytes (to calculate an osmotic gap), reducing substance and pH, alpha-1 antitrypsin, elastase, calprotectin, and culture and/or polymerase chain reaction techniques to rule out bacterial or other infectious causes. Some of these tests require special collection procedures to ensure an accurate result. (See <a class="local">'Stool testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The results of these tests inform the diagnostic steps used to determine the most likely type of CODE. For watery diarrhea, trials of fasting or carbohydrate-free formula help to narrow the diagnostic possibilities. Once the likely category of CODE is identified, functional testing or genomic testing can be used to confirm the specific diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic algorithm'</a> above and <a class="local">'Genomic testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Thiagarajah JR, Kamin DS, Acra S, et al.
