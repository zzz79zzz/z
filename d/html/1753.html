         Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disorder, affecting approximately 10 percent of the United States population [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and neuropathy, and these, combined with the frequent microvascular complications of the disease, often translate into more surgical interventions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Careful assessment of patients with diabetes prior to surgery is required because of their complexity and high risk of coronary heart disease, which may be relatively asymptomatic compared with the nondiabetic population. Diabetes mellitus is also associated with increased risk of perioperative infection and postoperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One key aspect of the perioperative management is diabetes care. The complex interplay of being nil per os (NPO) preoperatively, the operative procedure, anesthesia, and additional postoperative factors such as sepsis, disrupted meal schedules and altered nutritional intake, hyperalimentation, and emesis can lead to labile blood glucose levels. A rational approach to diabetes mellitus care allows the clinician to anticipate alterations in glucose and improve glycemic management perioperatively [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This review will discuss the preoperative evaluation of patients with diabetes, general glycemic goals, and management of blood glucose in the perioperative period. The special circumstances of glucocorticoid therapy and hyperalimentation are also reviewed. More details regarding glucose management in hospitalized patients in general are found separately. (See

         Surgery and general anesthesia cause a neuroendocrine stress response with release of counterregulatory hormones, such as epinephrine,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8493" href="/z/d/drug information/8493.html" rel="external">
          glucagon
         </a>
         , cortisol, and growth hormone, and of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These neurohormonal changes result in metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, decreased peripheral glucose utilization, impaired insulin secretion, increased lipolysis, and protein catabolism, leading to hyperglycemia and even ketosis in some cases [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The magnitude of counterregulatory hormone release varies per individual and is influenced by the type of anesthesia (general anesthesia is associated with larger metabolic abnormalities as compared with epidural anesthesia), the extent of the surgery (cardiovascular bypass surgery resulting in significantly higher insulin resistance), and additional postoperative factors such as sepsis, hyperalimentation, and glucocorticoid use. The hyperglycemic response to these factors may be attenuated by diminished caloric intake during and immediately after surgery, making the final glycemic balance difficult to predict.

         The preoperative evaluation of any patient, including those with diabetes mellitus, focuses on cardiopulmonary risk assessment and mitigation of risk. Coronary heart disease is much more common in individuals with diabetes than in the general population, and in addition, patients with diabetes have an increased risk of silent ischemia [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, assessment of cardiac risk is essential in patients with diabetes [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Other associated conditions, such as hypertension, obesity, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, and autonomic neuropathy, need to be assessed prior to surgery as these conditions may complicate anesthesia and postoperative care. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113642.html" rel="external">
          "Anesthesia for patients with diabetes mellitus and/ or hyperglycemia", section on 'Preanesthesia evaluation'

        </p>
        <p>
         All patients require a careful history and physical examination, with further evaluation required in certain individuals. Key elements of the initial assessment include the following:

         ECG abnormalities, such as abnormal Q waves suggestive of previous myocardial infarction, and chronic kidney disease are risk factors for major postoperative cardiac events. Further investigations including noninvasive cardiac testing should be considered on an individual basis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery"

        <p>
         A1C levels will provide information on chronic glycemia, and this is an important element in determining adequacy of current glycemic management, especially insulin dosing, in insulin-requiring patients. There is some suggestion that elevated A1C levels predict a higher rate of postoperative adverse events, including infections, myocardial infarction, and mortality [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18-23
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a prospective study of 3089 patients (1240 with and 1849 without a diagnosis of diabetes) undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting who had A1C measured as part of routine preoperative laboratory testing, higher A1C, but not the diagnosis of diabetes, was associated with an increased incidence of death, myocardial infarction, and deep sternal wound infection. When analyzed across the whole study population, there were significant increases per unit rise in A1C in mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.4), myocardial infarction (OR 1.55), and deep sternal wound infection (OR 1.38) after adjustment for multiple covariates [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Further threshold analyses showed an increased risk of death (OR 4.41) and deep sternal wound infection (OR 5.29) for patients with A1C values above 8.6 and 7.8 percent (70.5 and 61.7 mmol/mol), respectively. A1C thresholds for delaying elective surgery are reviewed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113642.html" rel="external">
          "Anesthesia for patients with diabetes mellitus and/ or hyperglycemia", section on 'Level of blood glucose control'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         It is uncertain whether past chronic glycemia, reflected by A1C, is the risk factor for adverse events or whether A1C is a surrogate for poor perioperative glucose management. In a retrospective analysis of electronic medical records, elevated perioperative glucose (&gt;200 mg/dL [&gt;11 mmol/L]), but not A1C, was associated with increased 30-day mortality [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Preoperative glucose levels can additionally help to stratify risk for postoperative wound infections [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26
         </a>
         ]. Elevated preoperative glucose levels (&gt;200 mg/dL [&gt;11 mmol/L]) were associated with deep wound infections in a case control study (OR 10.2, 95% CI 2.4-43) [

         A coordinated care plan should be established among providers involved in the patient's perioperative management. Patients with diabetes are at elevated risk of adverse outcomes in the perioperative setting, and key contributors to this elevated risk include inadequate communication among providers and insufficient planning specifically for diabetes-related care [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         – Hyperglycemia can cause volume and electrolyte disturbances mediated by osmotic diuresis and may also result in caloric and protein loss in under-insulinized patients, which can, in turn, adversely affect wound healing. In addition, observational studies show an association between perioperative hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes and an increased risk of postoperative infection [

          Prevention of ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar states
         </strong>
         – Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are insulin deficient and are prone to developing ketosis and acidosis. A potential mistake is to manage these patients like type 2 diabetes patients who are not ketosis prone (eg, holding long-acting insulin if the glucose level is in the normal range), with the consequent risk of ketoacidosis. Similarly, failure to provide pre-meal, rapid-acting insulin for persons with type 1 diabetes will result in unacceptable post-meal glucose excursions. Patients with type 2 diabetes are susceptible to developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (also known as nonketotic hyperosmolar state) associated with severe volume depletion and neurologic complications, and they may develop ketoacidosis in the setting of extreme stress.

         Beyond avoidance of marked hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, optimal perioperative glucose targets have not been rigorously established. Although there are varying opinions on what the target blood glucose should be, there is little evidence to support specific targets. Given the risk of hypoglycemia (especially in unmonitored settings), in our practice, we aim to keep glucose readings between 110 and 180 mg/dL (6.1 to 10 mmol/L). However, a less stringent glucose target may be considered depending on patient comorbidities, prognosis, and risk for hypoglycemia, or when close glucose monitoring may not be available. The risk of hypoglycemia can be reduced by frequent glucose monitoring and carefully designed management protocols. (See

         The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has endorsed a target glucose range for the perioperative period of 80 to 180 mg/dL (4.4 to 10 mmol/L) [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Other diabetes guideline bodies recommend glycemic targets of between 90 and 180 mg/dL (5 to 10 mmol/L) for noncritically ill hospitalized patients [

         In a meta-analysis of 20 randomized trials (2670 patients with diabetes) comparing intensive (&lt;120 or &lt;160 mg/dL [&lt;6.7 or &lt;8.3 mmol/L] for most trials) versus conventional (variable) glycemic targets in the perioperative period, intensive glycemic management perioperatively did not lead to significant reductions in infectious complications, length of hospital stay, or all-cause mortality, but did increase risk of hypoglycemia [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Intensive glycemic management slightly reduced the rate of cardiovascular events, but the quality of evidence was low. Among the trials, intensive management achieved a mean reduction in blood glucose level of 13 to 91 mg/dL (0.72 to 5.0 mmol/L) compared with conventional management.

         Avoiding hypoglycemia during anesthesia and in the postoperative phase is important because hypoglycemic symptoms are virtually impossible for the sedated patient to sense and, similarly, its signs are difficult for health care providers to detect. The goals in the perioperative setting are to preoperatively identify patients at highest risk for hypoglycemia, appropriately adjust diabetes treatment preoperatively to prevent its occurrence, and monitor for any episodes of hypoglycemia by measuring glucose levels to ensure prompt treatment.

          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – In the perioperative setting, hypoglycemia can be detected through monitoring of blood glucose levels, which are typically checked every one to two hours during surgery (for patients treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113642.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         After recovery from anesthesia or sedation, hypoglycemia may be suspected based upon patient-reported symptoms, including tremor, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias. All of these symptoms may be reduced in patients recovering from anesthesia and surgery. The hypoglycemic thresholds at which these symptoms occur are quite variable. In patients with diabetes, these symptoms of hypoglycemia may occur at glucose levels of &lt;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Hypoglycemia can also cause cognitive dysfunction, which may occur at plasma glucose concentrations below 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) and will further impair patients' ability to recognize and report hypoglycemia to their caretakers. More severe neurologic symptoms, including obtundation, seizures, and coma, occur with progressive hypoglycemia. The glycemic thresholds for these responses may shift to higher plasma glucose concentrations in patients with chronic hyperglycemia and to lower plasma glucose concentrations in patients with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, such as may be associated with intensive therapy of diabetes.

          Management

         – In patients with diabetes, hypoglycemia is defined as all episodes of an abnormally low plasma glucose concentration (with or without symptoms) that expose the individual to potential harm. Although the cutoff value has been debated, clinicians should become concerned about the possibility of hypoglycemia in a perioperative patient at a glucose level ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). (See

Ultimately, even well-coordinated plans for diabetic management are dynamic, being influenced by predictable and sometimes unpredictable events.

         Patients with type 1 diabetes and some insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes are insulin deficient. They are at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and must have basal insulin supplied at all times. Basal insulin dosing generally accounts for approximately one-half of an individual's total daily insulin dose. It is necessary to prevent ketoacidosis and limit protein loss during reduced caloric intake and perioperative stress. Therefore, basal insulin must be given to insulin-deficient patients even in the absence of oral intake [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Some patients may require a reduction in their usual dose of basal insulin on the morning of surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         The adjustment of insulin doses and regimens in the transition from usual outpatient care to inpatient and perioperative care is highly individual. The major changes in eating, activity levels and the superimposed perioperative stress, potential use of glucocorticoids, intravenous (IV) fluids with dextrose, and numerous other factors may disrupt glucose management and affect the specific choice of insulin regimens and dosing. These factors require an individualized approach to insulin management in hospitalized patients. The approach that follows provides a guideline for adjustment but cannot substitute for careful evaluation of these factors for each patient in selecting dosing perioperatively.

         </strong>
         – Patients with type 2 diabetes who take only once-daily basal insulin (eg, NPH, glargine, detemir, degludec) may continue basal insulin without any change to their usual regimen, as long as the basal insulin dose has been adjusted appropriately as an outpatient and results in safe morning glucose levels. In patients whose basal insulin dose is calculated to keep the blood glucose in normal or low-normal ranges, or when there is history of low glucose measures as an outpatient, we often reduce the dose by 10 to 25 percent to lower the risk of perioperative hypoglycemia. (If patients need to eat to treat hypoglycemia on the morning of surgery, the surgery may need to be rescheduled for another day.) If the patient takes insulin once daily in the evening, the dose typically is reduced by 10 to 25 percent on the night prior to surgery.

         Intravenous (IV) insulin infusion is usually required for long and complex procedures (eg, coronary artery bypass graft, renal transplant, or prolonged neurosurgical operations). There are numerous IV insulin infusion algorithms published in the literature, with insulin and glucose solutions being infused separately or as a combined glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) solution [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48,52-61
         </a>

         Studies comparing subcutaneous insulin administration versus IV infusion have found a marked increase in variability of the glucose concentration when using the subcutaneous route [

          48,58

         An important note is that insulin infusions should not be stopped altogether, even if hypoglycemia is present, without some basal insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes to prevent ketosis. In cases of hypoglycemia, insulin infusions may be reduced and the glucose infusion increased to maintain glucose targets.

         We prefer separate insulin and glucose intravenous (IV) solutions. With this regimen, dextrose is administered at approximately 5 to 10 g of glucose/hour, and a separate insulin infusion is given using short-acting insulin. Many type 1 diabetes patients require an infusion at a rate of 1 to 2 units/hour, while more insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes patients can require higher insulin rates.
        </p>
        <p>
         A commonly followed algorithm calculates the initial rate by dividing the blood glucose level (in mg/dL) by 100 and then rounding the result in units/hour (eg, glucose of 210 mg/dL divided by 100 = 2.1 units/hour) [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. Based on capillary glucose levels, the insulin infusion will be adjusted as needed to achieve the individualized glucose target (eg, glucose 120 to 160 mg/dL, increase by 0.5 units/hour; 160 to 200 mg/dL, increase by 1 unit/hour; &gt;200 mg/dL, increase by 2 units/hour). In case of hypoglycemia, the insulin infusion can be decreased to 0.5 units/hour and the glucose infusion rate increased to maintain glucose targets.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rate of insulin infusion should be titrated depending on the procedure and the degree of insulin resistance. For coronary artery bypass procedures, the insulin requirements may increase up to 10-fold, especially after recovery from the hypothermic period, necessitating an increase in the initial insulin rate by three to five times [

          Contraindications
         </strong>
         – When used as sole methods of insulin delivery, sliding scales of correction insulin can be problematic since they delay administration of insulin until hyperglycemia is present and frequently cause wide fluctuations in the serum glucose as they only react to past glucose concentrations. Correction insulin alone should not be used as the sole treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes, in whom ketosis can occur before significant hyperglycemia is present, or for insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.

          Dosing
         </strong>
         – Corrective insulin typically is given when glucose levels are &gt;150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L), and the amount of insulin depends upon the degree of insulin sensitivity of the patient, caloric intake, and the glycemic target  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83834" href="/z/d/graphic/83834.html" rel="external">

         <a class="local">
          'Glycemic targets'
         </a>
         above). Older, lean, type 1 diabetes patients or individuals with kidney or liver failure are usually considered to be "insulin sensitive," while obesity or treatment with glucocorticoids are usually associated with an insulin-resistant state. Smaller doses of insulin are given at bedtime to avoid nocturnal hypoglycemia. Many different regimens have been used, with no studies demonstrating the superiority of one over the others. Since there is a large patient-to-patient variability in terms of insulin sensitivity and response to clinical changes, the absolute dose choice is empirical and, most importantly, frequent (daily) adjustments based on glucose levels need to be made.

         Glucocorticoids are used for the treatment of many disorders and are often given as an anti-emetic, or in "stress" doses perioperatively if adrenal insufficiency is suspected, in the setting of shock, and sometimes when intraoperative radiologic procedures use radio-opaque dye. Glucocorticoids can worsen preexisting diabetes mellitus and may precipitate steroid-induced hyperglycemia in patients without preexisting diabetes.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Twice-daily NPH with short-acting insulin given in a subcutaneous sliding scale every six hours may be needed to achieve glucose targets in patients using longer-acting steroids or patients on steroids dosed twice daily. For patients who receive steroids long term, the daily NPH dose can be adjusted by adding up the correction doses of short-acting insulin administered on the day prior, and then by adding approximately 50 percent of the total daily correction dose to the total NPH dose.

         While there are no guidelines for specific insulin regimens in patients on oral or intravenous (IV) steroids, considerations should be given to the specific steroids used and their doses, as the magnitude and timing of the hyperglycemic response depends on the type and dose of glucocorticoids.

         ]. Once the patient is on a stable infusion rate of TPN, add 80 to 100 percent of the total insulin requirement directly to the TPN solution bag. As an example, if the patient requires 20 units of insulin per 24 hours, add 16 to 20 units of short-acting insulin in the TPN solution that is administered continuously over 24 hours. A subcutaneous insulin sliding scale using short-acting insulin may be used initially to identify the 24-hour insulin requirement if insulin infusion is not feasible, and should be converted to a twice-daily, intermediate-acting insulin if the TPN solution and rate are stable. TPN orders should always include an order to substitute dextrose infusion and recalibrate insulin dosing if the TPN is interrupted for more than an hour.

         – For nasogastric feeds administered continuously over 24 hours, either a variable-rate IV insulin infusion or twice-daily intermediate-acting insulin plus sliding-scale short-acting insulin every four to six hours may be administered. Changes in insulin regimen must precede any changes in nasogastric feeding regimens (ie, changes from 24-hour infusion to three times a day bolus feeds). As with TPN, interruption of continuous enteral feeding for more than an hour will require

         For patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated blood glucose levels (&gt;250 mg/dL [13.9 mmol/L]) who require emergency surgery, we treat with an IV insulin infusion or subcutaneous insulin. For long procedures, an insulin infusion is preferred. If the patient had been using a long-acting basal insulin (eg, glargine, degludec) once daily or a continuous infusion of short-acting or rapid-acting insulin (insulin pump), it should be continued along with the IV insulin infusion or additional corrective subcutaneous insulin.

          Preoperative evaluation
         </strong>
         – All patients require a careful preoperative history and physical examination, with further evaluation required in certain individuals. Basic laboratory investigation should include a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), assessment of renal function (serum creatinine), glycated hemoglobin (A1C) if not measured in previous four to six weeks, and blood glucose. Associated conditions, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, obesity, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, and autonomic neuropathy, need to be assessed prior to surgery as these conditions may complicate anesthesia and postoperative care.

          Goals of glycemic management

          Glycemic targets
         </strong>
         – There are few studies evaluating the optimal intraoperative blood glucose level for patients with diabetes. During surgical procedures and in the postoperative phase, we aim to keep the glucose readings between 110 and 180 mg/dL (6.1 to 10 mmol/L). Glycemic targets must take into account the individual patient's situation and whether these goals can be safely achieved within each individual hospital system. (See

          Timing of surgery

          Insulin injection
         </strong>
         – Patients with type 1 diabetes and some insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes are insulin deficient. They are at much higher risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and must have some basal insulin supplied at all times, even when not eating. Prandial insulin (regular, lispro, aspart, glulisine) should be stopped when caloric intake is discontinued in preparation for surgery. (See

For long surgeries (more than two hours) or surgeries associated with expected high glucose levels (eg, coronary artery bypass grafting, organ transplants with steroid use), intraoperative glucose testing every one to two hours should be performed either by laboratory or point-of-care testing (capillary "fingerstick" using a blood glucose meter). Supplemental short-acting (eg, regular) or rapid-acting (eg, lispro, aspart, or glulisine) insulin  (

         – Generally, patients who use insulin can continue with subcutaneous insulin perioperatively at a reduced dose (rather than an insulin infusion) for procedures that are not long and complex (eg, no more than one or two missed meals). However, IV insulin infusion is usually required for long and complex procedures (eg, coronary artery bypass graft, renal transplant, or prolonged neurosurgical operations). (See

         <strong>
          Postoperative glucose management
         </strong>
         – If an insulin infusion has been used, it should be continued postoperatively in patients who do not resume eating. Continue to monitor glucoses every one to two hours. Once it seems likely that solid food will be tolerated, the patient can be switched to subcutaneous insulin, and then the insulin infusion can be discontinued. For most patients with type 2 diabetes, the preoperative diabetes treatment regimen (oral agents, noninsulin injectables, oral agents plus insulin, or basal-bolus insulin) may be reinstated once the patient is eating well. However, there are a few caveats for certain oral hypoglycemic agents. (See
