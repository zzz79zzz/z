         A number of inherited syndromes involve defects that produce systemic and cardiac manifestations, most of which affect skeletal muscle. These disorders will be briefly reviewed here and are discussed in detail on the appropriate topic reviews.

         Mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome produce both Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. In addition, deletions in the 5' muscle promoter of the dystrophin gene can cause a predominant cardiac phenotype that presents as a dilated cardiomyopathy. Skeletal muscle biopsies of individuals with X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy due to dystrophin deletions demonstrate the classic pathologic changes of Duchenne or Becker dystrophies, but the muscle manifestations may be subclinical.

         Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by a defective gene located on the X chromosome that is responsible for the production of dystrophin, a high molecular weight protein that is localized to the sarcolemmal membrane of normal skeletal muscle. Patients with DMD have complete or almost complete absence of dystrophin in skeletal muscle. The clinical onset of weakness usually occurs between two and three years of age. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6149.html" rel="external">
          "Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         DMD causes a primary cardiomyopathy with extensive fibrosis of the posterobasal left ventricular wall, resulting in the characteristic electrocardiographic changes of tall right precordial R waves with an increased R/S ratio and deep Q waves in leads I, aVL, and V5-6  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53681" href="/z/d/graphic/53681.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. As the cardiac disease progresses, fibrosis can spread to the lateral free wall of the left ventricle. The extent and severity of fibrosis can be assessed by examining the distribution of late gadolinium enhancement with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Significant mitral regurgitation is often present due to involvement of the posteromedial papillary muscle [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Cardiac involvement is also associated with conduction abnormalities, especially intraatrial and interatrial but also involving the AV node, and a variety of arrhythmias, primarily supraventricular [

          3

         Like DMD, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an X-linked disorder involving the dystrophin gene [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. However, in contrast to the absence of dystrophin in skeletal muscle in DMD, most patients with BMD have an abnormal dystrophin protein. BMD is later in onset and slower in progression than DMD. The clinical manifestations are also less severe as affected patients typically remain ambulatory until at least age 15 and often into adult life. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6149.html" rel="external">
          "Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although muscle involvement is less severe than in DMD, cardiac involvement in BMD can be more severe [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. It has been suggested that, because patients with mild BMD are still able to perform strenuous exercise, the associated mechanical stress on the heart may be harmful for myocardial cells with abnormal dystrophin.
        </p>
        <p>
         Echocardiography and/or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) reveals early right ventricular involvement with the later development of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure that can be rapidly progressive and is usually the ultimate cause of death [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In addition, abnormalities of the AV node and infranodal conduction system can result in fascicular and bundle branch block and can progress to complete heart block. (See

         Myotonic dystrophy (also called dystrophia myotonica [DM]) is a multisystem disease with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable penetrance and clinical anticipation, eg, increasingly severe disease with each successive generation. Two main forms have been identified: DM1, in which the genetic defect is a trinucleotide repeat in a gene encoding a protein kinase called myotonin; and, less commonly, DM2 (also known as proximal myotonic myopathy or PROMM), in which the disease locus is on chromosome 3q21. Clinical features include myotonia (delayed muscle relaxation after contraction), weakness and wasting affecting facial muscles and distal limb muscles, frontal balding in males, cataracts, multiple endocrinopathies, and low intelligence or dementia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the classic form, DM has its onset in adolescence or adulthood and disease severity may be mild (eg, isolated cataracts) to severe with marked skeletal muscle and cardiac and/or endocrine dysfunction. The congenital form occurs in children born to affected mothers with myotonic dystrophy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cardiac manifestations include atrioventricular block and intraventricular conduction delay, with occasional progression to complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and a cardiomyopathy characterized by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, and in less than 10 percent of patients, heart failure. Sudden death can result from conduction system disease or ventricular tachycardia, and cardiovascular causes are responsible for about 30 percent of deaths. (See

         </span>
         Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), also known as humeroperoneal muscular dystrophy, can be inherited as an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive disorder involving the emerin or lamin A/C genes. The different forms of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy have identical symptoms, which usually begin in the first or second decade of life. Muscle weakness and wasting has a humeroperoneal distribution and tend to be slowly progressive. Contractures are often the first manifestations of the disease. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A cardiomyopathy may be seen in EDMD. It is typically associated with AV conduction abnormalities; other common findings include atrial paralysis, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and infranodal or AV conduction block with the development of slow junctional rhythms that often require pacemaker insertion. Sudden death can occur.

         Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is the third most common hereditary muscle disorder after Duchenne muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy. The classic form is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and the affected DUX4 gene has been mapped to chromosome 4q35.
        </p>
        <p>
         FSHD is usually slowly progressive but there is variability in both age of onset and severity. The onset in the classic form is usually between the ages of 10 and 30 and progression is slow with an almost normal life span; however, the infantile form is rapidly progressive. The disease initially involves the face and the scapulae followed by the foot dorsiflexors and the hip girdles. Asymmetry of muscle involvement and sparing of bulbar, extraocular, and respiratory muscles are other typical features.

         Cardiac involvement can occur. The manifestations include P wave abnormalities, intraventricular conduction delay, and supraventricular arrhythmias. (See

         Friedreich ataxia is the most common hereditary ataxia in White populations. It is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait and is caused by loss of function mutations in the frataxin gene. The major clinical manifestations are neurologic dysfunction (eg, progressive ataxia of all four limbs may be seen by age five or earlier), diabetes mellitus, and cardiac disease. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities are those of morphologically mild asymmetric septal hypertrophy with progressive impairment of systolic function. The main clinical manifestations are arrhythmic complications related to the cardiomyopathy, particularly atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias, as well as ventricular arrhythmias, which are a frequent cause of death.

         Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common disorder with recessive inheritance that affects 1 in 400 individuals of northern European ancestry. It is characterized by increased iron absorption and deposition in parenchymal tissues, including the heart. This disorder is due to mutations in the HFE gene that lead to increased intestinal iron absorption. (See

         Diabetes mellitus, bronze skin changes, and/or evidence of hepatitis or cirrhosis should alert the clinician to the possible presence of hereditary hemochromatosis. However, the absence of these disorders does not exclude the diagnosis since, prior to the use of screening studies, heart disease was the presenting manifestation in up to 15 percent of patients. Iron deposition can lead to a dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by the development of heart failure and conduction disturbances such as sinus node dysfunction. (See

         Sideroblastic anemias and thalassemias are hereditary disorders that cause anemia of varying severity depending upon the specific genetic defect. Ineffective erythropoiesis leads to increased iron absorption; in addition, regular red blood cell transfusions are necessary in the management of most of these disorders. These processes ultimately lead to iron overload and deposition in various tissues, including the heart  (

         ). Iron deposition in the myocardium can result in arrhythmias and HF, which usually occur late in the course of the disease. (See

        <p>
         Phlebotomy, which is effective in treating iron overload due to hereditary hemochromatosis, is not feasible in the sideroblastic anemias and thalassemias because of the underlying anemia. Iron chelation therapy, if initiated early, may prevent or reverse the cardiac abnormalities. Assessment of myocardial iron overload with cardiac magnetic resonance T2* imaging to guide chelation therapy has dramatically improved prognosis in thalassemia [

         Desmin is a polypeptide that normally aggregates to form filaments of a diameter intermediate between myosin and actin in both skeletal and cardiac muscle [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12

          12

         ]. Desminopathy is a skeletal and cardiac myopathy caused by mutations in desmin or alpha B crystallin, a chaperone for desmin.
        </p>
        <p>
         Desminopathy is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern although some kindred demonstrate autosomal recessive transmission. In contrast to other forms of cardiomyopathy, it requires ultrastructural study for diagnosis. The failure of desmin to aggregate into intermediate filaments and the presence of granulofilamentous material leads to impairment in relaxation and contraction and clinical presentation resembling restrictive cardiomyopathy [

          13
