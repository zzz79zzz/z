         Approximately 70 percent of individuals who have a vaginal birth will experience injury to the vagina or perineum that may require surgical repair [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. After vaginal delivery, the vagina, perineum, and anorectum are examined to identify and repair significant injuries. In particular, occult injury to the anal sphincter complex may occur at the time of an otherwise uncomplicated delivery and, if neglected, can result in anal and fecal incontinence [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Even when recognized and repaired, persistent sphincter dysfunction is considered to be the most common cause of postpartum anal incontinence [

         External anal sphincter (EAS) – The EAS is a thick, circular, predominantly striated muscle that surrounds the anal orifice, and is responsible for continence of solid and liquid stool, as well as flatus, both at rest and at times of rectal distension. The EAS is innervated by the inferior branch of the pudendal nerve, which may be susceptible to injury during delivery.

         Internal anal sphincter (IAS) – The internal anal sphincter (IAS) lies between the external sphincter and the anal canal and represents a thickened condensation of the longitudinal smooth muscle fibers of the rectum (

         <a href="#rid8">

         The key initial task is to assess both the extent of bleeding and injury to the perineum, vagina, and anorectum, prior to the suturing of any injuries [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. This assessment should include both visual inspection and digital palpation, including routine rectal examination, . Adequate exposure, lighting, and analgesia are essential for a thorough examination. Some studies have suggested that a significant number of sphincter injuries go undetected at the time of delivery [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A thorough visual inspection of the distal vagina, perineum, and anorectum should be performed following a vaginal delivery to identify and evaluate the extent of a vaginal tear. Good lighting is essential. Examination may be performed with the patient in the "frog leg" position or in lithotomy, if preferred. The apex of the vaginal laceration should always be identified. The clinician can place four fingers into the perineal laceration and then spread the fingers to increase visualization of the laceration apex. After inspecting the vagina, a rectal examination should be performed routinely to exclude injury to the anorectal mucosa and anal sphincter. Digital rectal examination is important to determine whether the rectal mucosa and anal sphincter are intact. The rectovaginal examination is accomplished by placing an index finger in the rectum and the thumb over the anal sphincter and using a pill-rolling motion to assess the sphincter. Of note, the anal sphincter may be disrupted by shearing forces produced by descent of the fetal head, and this can occur in women with an otherwise intact perineum [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Lacerations can usually be repaired in the delivery room with the patient in the lithotomy position; however, third- and fourth-degree lacerations may require an operating room for ready access to appropriate equipment and lighting, anesthesia support, and maintenance of aseptic conditions. Delivering the placenta prior to suturing is preferred, if possible given the volume of bleeding from the laceration, to avoid disrupting the sutures with placental delivery.

         If feces are obviously present, it should be removed and the tissues irrigated thoroughly. We perform a gentle scrub with

         Antibiotics are unnecessary for repair of first- and second-degree lacerations. While a trial in the United Kingdom reported a reduction in episiotomy infections following a single dose of intravenous antibiotics in the setting of operative vaginal delivery, major study limitations prevent universal adoption of this approach [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. This trial is reviewed in detail in a related topic. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         For repair of a third- or fourth-degree obstetric laceration, we suggest a single dose of a broad spectrum antibiotic (second generation cephalosporin [eg,

         )), given prior to the repair, based upon results of a single trial demonstrating that antibiotic administration resulted in a marked reduction in wound complications (eg, dehiscence) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-17
         </a>
         ]. Although this trial had a high rate of loss to follow-up, it is the best available data on which to base a recommendation, and antibiotic prophylaxis is a low-cost/low-risk intervention that could prevent complications with significant morbidity. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support the use of a single dose of antibiotic to reduce the incidence of postoperative infection for third- and fourth-degree lacerations [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Independent from antibiotic use, if the wound is contaminated by gross fecal spillage, then local cleansing and irrigation should also be performed.

         The level of anesthesia should be adequate for the surgical repair. If the patient had an epidural catheter placed for labor and delivery analgesia/anesthesia, it can be used to provide anesthesia for the repair.
        </p>
        <p>
         For repair of third- or fourth-degree lacerations, redosing of the epidural may be needed prior to beginning the surgical repair as additional muscle relaxation is often necessary to relax the contracted anal sphincter, retrieve the retracted ends, and bring them back together without tension. A bilateral pudendal block with or without a local field block, a saddle block, or general anesthesia are alternatives if there is no preexisting analgesia.

         The choice of sutures for repair of perineal lacerations has traditionally been one of personal preference, although recent data have suggested that synthetic absorbable suture material is associated with less short-term perineal pain and less wound dehiscence compared with catgut suture. In most institutions, chromic catgut has been largely replaced by synthetic, delayed-absorbable materials, such as polyglactin 910 and polyglycolic acid, as use of chromic catgut appears to be associated with more postpartum discomfort [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ]. A 2010 systematic review of randomized trials concluded that, compared with catgut (plain, chromic, glycerol impregnated), standard absorbable synthetic suture for perineal repair following childbirth was associated with less pain in the first three days postpartum (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.90), less need for analgesia in the first 10 days postpartum (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.87), and less resuturing for dehiscence (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.74), but no difference in long-term pain or dyspareunia [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. However, the need for removal of unabsorbed synthetic suture material was almost twice as common; this problem is significantly diminished by using rapidly-absorbable synthetic sutures [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. When catgut and glycerol-impregnated catgut were compared, results were similar for most outcomes, although the latter was associated with more short-term pain.

         Rapidly absorbed polyglactin 910 suture (commercial name Vicryl Rapide, average 42 days) or standard absorption (average 63 days) braided polyglactin 910 sutures and monofilament sutures (eg, poliglecaprone 25, glycomer 631) in a variety of sizes are usually readily available on most Labor and Delivery Units. In general, one should use the smallest diameter suture that has adequate tensile and knot strength for the task; 2/0 and 3/0 sutures are suitable for soft tissue repair. Monofilament sutures may cause less tissue reaction than braided sutures, and thus may minimize discomfort and infection risk. However, this must be balanced against the significantly longer absorption time, and quicker loss of tensile strength that is characteristic of monofilament sutures. In general, the use of polyglactin 910 suture sizes 2/0 and 3/0 is a reasonable choice for most routine repair of perineal and vaginal lacerations. Rapidly absorbed polyglactin 910 appears to be associated with reduced perineal pain, including a reduction in superficial dyspareunia, at three months postpartum, as well as a significant reduction in the need for suture removal up to three months postpartum [

         Third- or fourth-degree tears, if present, should be repaired first. To help with exposure, a vaginal pack can be used to prevent uterine bleeding from obscuring the surgical field and a self-retaining retractor, such as a Gelpie or Weitlander, is helpful if an assistant is not readily available.

         The aim of reconstructive surgery is to restore the continuity of both the external and internal anal sphincters [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In addition, a thick perineal body and rectovaginal septum should be created to provide muscular and structural support in the thin area between the anterior anorectum and vagina. Proper reconstruction will also result in lengthening of the anal canal and restoration of a functional high pressure zone within it.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal of sphincter repair (either primary or secondary) is reconstruction of a muscular cylinder that is at least 2 cm thick and 3 cm long [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,23
         </a>
         ]. This results in an anatomically and functionally correct anal canal. Simple plication of the severed ends of the external anal sphincter (EAS) with two or three interrupted, absorbable sutures is commonly performed, but may be inadequate since this approach is frequently associated with persistent sphincter defects and symptomatology [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

         If a fourth-degree laceration is present, we repair the torn anal mucosa using a continuous (nonlocking) 3/0 or 4/0 braided polyglactin on a tapered needle; a monofilament suture such as poliglecaprone 25 is also acceptable. Interrupted sutures can be used, but result in a larger quantity of foreign body because of multiple knots.

         The internal anal sphincter should be properly identified and repaired as a separate layer [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,26
         </a>
         ]. It often retracts laterally and superiorly and appears as thickened, pale pink, shiny tissue just above the anal mucosa that some clinicians refer to as perirectal fascia. Reapproximation of this layer is important for the strength and integrity of the repair and for achieving anal continence [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         The external sphincter is then identified and repaired. The repair begins by identifying and grasping the two severed ends of the dark red EAS muscle with Allis clamps. It may be necessary to push the Allis clamp deep into the surrounding connective tissue to locate the sphincter since one or both ends typically retract when it ruptures.

         We typically place at least four or five interrupted sutures, but we are not opposed to placing more if it is possible. It may be necessary to sharply mobilize either sphincter end to achieve a better anastomosis and minimize tension.

         In a 2013 meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing the overlap and end-to-end techniques, the overlap technique was associated with a nonstatistical lower risk of one or more anal incontinence symptoms (risk ratio [RR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.68-1.17; five trials, n = 2221), but this was primarily in the first 12 months after delivery and disappeared at 24 and 36 months [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. There were no significant differences between procedures in perineal pain, dyspareunia, or quality of life at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after repair. Limitations of these trials were the inclusion of multiparous women and women with partial tears, and differences in measurement of outcomes and surgical experience.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Subsequent to this meta-analysis, a randomized trial of the overlap and end-to-end techniques limited to primiparous women with complete tears reported that at 6 and 12 months postpartum the overlap technique was associated with a higher rate of flatal incontinence (6 months: 61 versus 39 percent, p = 0.005; 12 months: 56 versus 31 percent, p = 0.12) and a trend toward a higher rate of fecal incontinence (6 months: 15 versus 8 percent, p&gt;.2; 12 months 16 versus 6 percent, p = 0.17) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Another randomized trial of the two techniques in primiparous and multiparous women with either partial or complete tears found the overlap repair was not superior to the end-to-end technique with respect to fecal incontinence at 12 months [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Others have observed that the incidence of residual anal sphincter damage on endoanal ultrasonography is similar for the two techniques [

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In the absence of clear evidence favoring one technique over the other, the choice of overlap or end-to-end repair should be based upon the surgeon's preference and experience. In the United States, end-to-end repair is more commonly practiced than the overlapping technique with full thickness external anal sphincter tears. End-to-end repair is almost universally practiced in a partial thickness EAS tear.

        <p>
         After the sphincter repair is completed, the next task is to rebuild the distal rectovaginal septum and perineal body. This layer helps to maintain the proper spatial distance between the anus and vagina, and may prevent suture erosion from the deeper layers. Another goal of this layer is to help take the tension off of the underlying sphincter repair. We typically use an interrupted 2/0 polyglactin suture on a cutting needle.
        </p>
        <p>
         The end result of the surgical repair should be reconstruction of an adequate perineal body, a thickened rectovaginal septum, and an intact cylindrical sphincter complex that is approximately 2 cm wide and 3 cm long. The anus should easily admit one finger following the procedure, although skeletal muscle paralysis induced by anesthesia may temporarily weaken the tone of the anal canal.

         If there is no third- or fourth-degree extension, vaginal lacerations with extensions into the perineal body have traditionally been repaired in layers using a series of continuous suture techniques. The repair begins at the apex of the vaginal laceration and ends with a subcuticular closure that terminates just above the level of the posterior fourchette.

        <p>
         There is robust evidence that continuous nonlocking suture techniques for repair of the vagina, perineal muscles, and skin are superior to traditional interrupted methods with regards to reducing postpartum perineal pain. The continuous technique is faster and uses the smallest amount of suture material; the only advantage of an intermittent technique is that if one suture breaks, there are others to hold the repair in place; however, this is probably not critical in the perineum. A continuous subcuticular closure of the perineal skin is preferred to interrupted transcutaneous stitches, as a meta-analysis of randomized trials of continuous versus interrupted suture techniques for perineal closure found that the continuous suturing technique was associated with [

         The differences in pain between the two techniques may be due to increased suture tension with interrupted stitches, which may lead to edema and pain. With continuous sutures, the tension is transferred along the length of a single suture and the subcuticular layer is placed well below the skin surface, thus avoiding the nerve endings.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vaginal epithelium is reapproximated first, and should include any underlying divided tissue in order to build up the rectovaginal septum. Care should be taken to identify and incorporate the apex of the episiotomy in the repair. If the apex of the episiotomy extends out of the field of vision, a suture can be placed below the apex and the suture tail used as a purchase to pull the apex into view. An absorbable suture (typically a 2/0 polyglactin 910) is usually used for the repair. The anatomical landmarks, such as the vermilion border and hymenal ring, should be identified and reapproximated. Theoretically, use of a locking stitch will prevent pulling the suture too tight and shortening the vagina; we do not use a locking stitch, as there is no evidence to support this theory. We prefer to close with a loose, continuous nonlocking technique to reduce the risk of narrowing the vagina, and make sure that the sutures are not placed too wide of the edge.
        </p>
        <p>
         Following closure of the vaginal portion of the laceration down to the level of the hymenal ring, the perineal body and bulbocavernosus muscle are then reapproximated. The same suture is usually passed through the vaginal layer above through to the deep perineal layer, in what is commonly referred to as the "transition stitch." The suture is then placed through the superficial bulbocavernosus muscle on each side in a "V" configuration, commonly referred to as the "crown" stitch. Some surgeons prefer to close this layer with three to four interrupted sutures to approximate the deep and superficial perineal muscles. The critical point is to realign the muscles so that the skin edges can be reapproximated with minimal tension.
        </p>
        <p>
         The suture is next passed through the deep perineal tissue from side to side in a vertical direction until the edge of the perineal tear is reached. At this point, the suture is brought back up in the reverse direction along the perineal body in a subcuticular manner and tied at, or just inside, the introitus with a loop knot.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some authors have proposed leaving the perineal skin open, to heal by secondary intention, because avoiding suture material has been associated with better skin sensation when assessed one year postpartum [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32

         Episiotomy infection and dehiscence are uncommon, but important postpartum complications. Signs of episiotomy infection include fever, wound tenderness, and purulent discharge, typically occurring six to eight days following delivery.

         Traditionally, secondary repair of episiotomy breakdown was deferred for a minimum of two to three months [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. The purpose for delay was to allow sufficient time for revascularization of the wound edges and formation of scar tissue, which was thought to be of value during reanastomosis of the torn sphincter. However, few data support this approach and it commits the patient to an extended period of physical, social, and sexual disability because of continuous incontinence. Available evidence, although extremely limited and inconclusive, supports re-repair of both superficial and deep episiotomy dehiscence within the first two weeks following childbirth, which may result in a reduction in perineal pain during the healing process up to six months postdelivery and a reduction in dyspareunia [
         <a href="#rid41">

        <p>
         Early repair of episiotomy breakdown has replaced the traditional approach and has overall success rates of 87 to 100 percent [

         Early secondary repair is performed when the wound surface is free from exudate and covered by pink granulation tissue. If cellulitis was present, it should be resolved. On average, it will take six to eight days of aggressive wound care before the repair can be attempted.

         In patients with superficial disruption of a first- or second-degree laceration, some surgeons give a single preoperative dose of a broad spectrum antibiotic, such as a cephalosporin. The value of antibiotics in this setting has not been studied in randomized trials.

In secondary closures that involve re-repair of the anal sphincter and/or rectal mucosa, we feel the use of an enema the night before surgery to remove the potential for perioperative fecal contamination is sufficient preparation of the lower colon and anorectum. The use of a mechanical bowel prep is unnecessary. (See

         ). Perineal lacerations are described based on the depth and anatomy of injury, including the anal sphincter, down to the anal mucosa. The anal sphincter can be disrupted even though the perineum is intact. (See

          Examination
         </strong>
         – Initially, the key task is to examine the perineum and vagina thoroughly to determine the extent of injury (ie, classification) and severity of bleeding. After vaginal delivery, it is important to perform a thorough rectovaginal examination of the anal sphincter complex and rectal mucosa. Unrecognized injury to the anal sphincter complex occurs commonly after vaginal delivery. (See

          Anal sphincter repair

         Reapproximation of the internal sphincter is important for the strength and integrity of the repair and for achieving anal continence. Proper reconstruction will lengthen the anal canal and restore the functional high pressure zone. (See
