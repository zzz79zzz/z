         Cancer is recognized as a disease of older adults, with over 50 percent of new cases being diagnosed after age 65, and over 70 percent of deaths from cancer occurring in this same age group [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide and accounts for nearly 4 percent of all new cases of cancer in women [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. It is also the eighth most common cause of cancer death in the world. The risk of ovarian cancer increased with age with only 10 to 15 percent of cases diagnosed before menopause [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. With increasing age, there is an increased prevalence of comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, functional dependence, cognitive impairment, depression, frailty, poor nutrition, and limited social support [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Given these many potential limitations, it is not surprising that many older adult patients who present with advanced ovarian cancer receive less aggressive therapies than their younger counterparts and have poorer disease-specific outcomes. Because there are limited data on the approach to older women with gynecologic cancer in general, this topic will specifically discuss the care of the older woman with ovarian cancer.

         Older patients should undergo a geriatric assessment (GA) at their initial presentation to determine whether or not they are appropriate candidates for cytoreductive surgery (CRS). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Geriatric assessment'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The results of the assessment can be used to determine the most appropriate treatment strategy:

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Patients who are candidates for CRS should proceed with primary surgical therapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to surgery'
         </a>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Patients who are not candidates for CRS should be offered chemotherapy, provided they are also candidates for medical treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to first-line medical therapy'

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Patients who are neither candidates for CRS nor for medical treatment should be referred for palliative care and hospice services. Treatment for these patients should be focused on symptom management. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Palliative care'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment for ovarian cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes consideration of both surgery and medical therapy. Therefore, all patients should be evaluated by a specialized team that includes a gynecologic oncologist whenever possible.

         Geriatric assessment (GA) provides clinicians with a formal way to evaluate a patient's functional status (ie, ability to live independently at home and in the community), comorbid medical conditions, cognition, psychological status, social functioning/support, and nutritional status. Several studies have demonstrated the predictive value of GA for estimating the risk of severe toxicity from chemotherapy and survival outcomes [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6

        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, a validated instrument for assessment specifically for the older patient with ovarian cancer is not yet available. For patients with ovarian cancer, separate GAs are conducted for evaluation preoperatively and then prior to the initiation of chemotherapy. These are discussed below.

         A validated instrument for assessment of the older adult patient with cancer does not yet exist. Despite this, there are several assessments under study for breast and other solid tumors, which may be applicable to this population. Ongoing research is aimed at prospective evaluation of these and other tools to remove the guesswork from assessing a patient’s fitness for surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the importance of the issue of preoperative assessment, the American College of Surgeons released a position paper in 2012 outlining best practices for the optimal preoperative assessment of the geriatric patient [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, the NRG-Oncology Cooperative Group completed a GA study in older adults (ELD1301, NRG-CC002), which used a modified Preoperative Assessment of Cancer in the Elderly (PACE) tool, to determine the benefit of a modified GA in predicting postsurgical complications in women undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery. Unfortunately, the preoperative score was not predictive of major postoperative complications in older patients undergoing primary open cytoreductive surgery. However, there was an association between score and postoperative complications in a subgroup of patients with advanced-staged malignant disease [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>

         The PACE and other tools that can be used as part of a preoperative GA are discussed below.

         The Preoperative Assessment of Cancer in the Elderly (PACE) tool was developed to combine elements of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) with surgical risk assessment tools. However, while promising, it has not yet been evaluated in patients who are being considered for higher-risk surgeries, such as cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer. Therefore, it is not yet being commonly used in this population. Instruments included in the PACE are:

         Multiple national and international guidelines recommend the routine use of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessments (CGAs) in older adult patients. However, although a CGA may assist in the coordination of cancer treatment and in guiding appropriate interventions for specific problems, it can be time-consuming and not practical in a clinical setting. Despite these limitations, studies suggest they do provide important prognostic information. (See

         Patients who are initially diagnosed with ovarian cancer should be evaluated for cytoreductive surgery (CRS), regardless of age. However, there will be a proportion of patients who present with advanced ovarian cancer in whom primary CRS is not indicated (eg, those with a poor performance status and/or those with radiologically or clinically unresectable disease). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3193.html" rel="external">
          "Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Surgical staging"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         CRS is often a very complicated surgery that qualifies as a high-risk procedure. In general, it requires a large abdominal laparotomy, and cytoreduction may require bowel resection, splenectomy, and other procedures. In addition, patients may present with evidence of poor nutrition and poor performance status due to disease-related complications, such as the rapid accumulation of ascites.

         Unfortunately, generalized preoperative assessment tools such as the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Physical Status Classification System  (

         Despite the goals of CRS, postoperative complications, including death, increase with age, which may reduce any survival advantage achieved with surgery [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

         ]. Many single-institution studies have been published exploring this issue in the "older adult patient," with a variety of definitions of older adult and a variety of outcomes  (

          table 7
         </a>
         ). In order to make more informed decisions on how to care for older adult patients with ovarian cancer and provide them with the most accurate preoperative counseling, we need better estimates of what have been termed the "hazards of hospitalization," which include death, morbidity, discharge to locations other than home (or nontraditional discharge), and delay of systemic treatment. These are discussed below.

         A risk score has been proposed to identify patients who are being evaluated for primary CRS and may be at risk for death within 30 days, which uses age, stage, and comorbidity score. The highest-risk group is comprised of women 75 years of age or older with stage IV disease (or stage III disease plus a comorbidity score of 1 or more). In this SEER-Medicare study, this group had a 30-day postoperative mortality of 12.7 percent, which accounted for 50 percent of the deaths in the entire cohort [

         Postoperative complications are important to avoid, not only for the obvious reason of eliminating patient discomfort and risk, but also because certain complications are associated with a reduction in overall survival (OS). This is not to say that patients die of their complications (ie, postoperative death), but the complication compromises the ability of the patient to survive their cancer. The importance of this was shown in a National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) study where the most important determinant of decreased survival following surgery for patients with solid tumors was the occurrence of a major complication [

         In ovarian cancer surgery, two or more complications increased the risk of death from cancer by almost 30 percent (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.15-1.49) [

         In the randomized clinical trial of primary CRS versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by an interval CRS conducted by the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC 55971), almost 7 percent of those women who underwent primary CRS did not receive chemotherapy, and in most of these cases, it was due to excessive post-surgery complications or the diagnosis of another primary tumor. The results of this trial are discussed separately. (See

         A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) review, including almost 8000 women older than 65 years with stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer, suggested that while patients who underwent surgery only had similar survival compared with patients who received no treatment (2.2 versus 1.7 months), patients receiving chemotherapy as the sole treatment for their disease had a better overall survival (OS; 14.4 months) [

         The poor prognosis of many older women with ovarian cancer is partly due to dose reductions.

         Regardless of age, a platinum-taxane doublet is the most appropriate first-line treatment for ovarian cancer. For older adult patients, chemotherapy dosing, scheduling, and timing (neoadjuvant or postoperative) should be carefully considered when developing a treatment plan.

         Several strategies have been described to improve the tolerability of the first-line treatment, including single-agent

         or every-three-week treatment. Although single-agent carboplatin has been advocated by some as a less toxic option, particularly in frail or oldest patients (greater than 80 years), a randomized trial of older women with ovarian cancer has shown a survival disadvantage to single-agent carboplatin compared with doublet therapy. However, single-agent carboplatin may be an appropriate alternative for select patients (eg, those with pre-existing neuropathy).

         The largest studies that investigated the treatment of older women with ovarian cancer come from the French Groupe d’Investigateurs Nationaux pour l’Etude des Cancers Ovariens (GINECO) group in France, and their dedicated Elderly Women Ovarian Cancer (EWOC) program. Between 1998 and 2003, two prospective studies were conducted to assess the tolerability of standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. In both studies, the selected population comprised older adult patients aged ≥70 years with liberal inclusion criteria. Importantly, all patients completed a baseline geriatric assessment (GA). These studies were pooled in a retrospective, multivariate analysis to assess predictive factors of survival [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Predictive factors of poor prognosis were advanced age, depression symptoms at baseline, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IV. Of note, in this analysis, the use of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">
          paclitaxel
         </a>
         was found to be an independent factor for poor survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.42). However, whether this association is valid is questionable given that these were small, nonrandomized studies.

         Results from the International Collaboration on Ovarian Neoplasms (ICON) 3 study are often also cited as supporting data because single-agent

         in addition to carboplatin, there was no survival advantage among those who were over 65 years at enrollment (30 percent of patients on study) [

Fewer patients completed treatment with single-agent carboplatin than with the doublet regimens, due largely to progression. Treatment cessation due to toxicity occurred in 20 and 23 percent of patients in the every-three-weeks and weekly doublet groups, respectively, and in 15 percent receiving carboplatin only [

         Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the delivery of chemotherapy prior to planned cytoreductive surgery (CRS). Its use is gaining popularity in both the United States (US) and Europe, particularly for older and frail patients, given NACT is associated with less surgical toxicity. In an observational study of over 1500 women with stages IIIC to IV ovarian cancer, NACT use increased from 16 percent during 2003 to 2010 to 34 percent during 2011 to 2012 among those with stage IIIC disease, and from 41 to 62 percent among those with stage IV disease [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40

         ]. By shrinking cancer prior to surgery, several reports suggest that NACT increases the chance of an optimal CRS (defined as &lt;1 cm disease post-surgery) with less surgical morbidity and no significant effect on survival. (See

          Introduction
         </strong>
         – Cancer is recognized as a disease of older adults, with over 50 percent of new cases being diagnosed after age 65, and over 70 percent of deaths from cancer occurring in this same age group. Ovarian cancer, predominantly a disease of postmenopausal women, should also increase in prevalence with an increasingly aged population. (See
         <a class="local">

         Older patients should undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) at their initial presentation to determine whether or not they are appropriate candidates for cytoreductive surgery (CRS). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview of the approach'

         <strong>
          Preoperative assessment
         </strong>
         – Geriatric assessment (GA) provides clinicians with a formal way to evaluate a patient's functional status (ie, ability to live independently at home and in the community), comorbid medical conditions, cognition, psychological status, social functioning-support, and nutritional status. Several studies have demonstrated the predictive value of GA for estimating the risk of severe toxicity from chemotherapy and survival outcomes. Unfortunately, a validated instrument for assessment specifically for the older patient with ovarian cancer is not yet available. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Preoperative assessment'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The Preoperative Assessment of Cancer in the Elderly (PACE) tool was developed to combine elements of the CGA with surgical risk assessment tools. However, while promising, it has not yet been evaluated in patients who are being considered for higher-risk surgeries. (See
         <a class="local">
          'PACE'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         As with the preoperative assessment, there is a clear need for a simple and short screening test for older vulnerable women with ovarian cancer undergoing chemotherapy. While validated tools are available, none are routinely used in clinical gynecologic oncological practice at this time. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Primary cytoreductive surgery
         </strong>
         – Patients initially diagnosed with ovarian cancer should be evaluated for CRS, regardless of age. However, there will be a proportion of patients who present with advanced ovarian cancer in whom primary CRS is not indicated (eg, those with a poor performance status and/or those with radiologically or clinically unresectable disease). (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients deemed to be poor candidates for primary CRS, interval CRS can be offered after initial treatment using neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Multiple randomized trials show that survival outcomes appear to be similar among women who undergo a primary versus an interval CRS. However, perioperative complications were lower in those patients receiving NACT. (See
