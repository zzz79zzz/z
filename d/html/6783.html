The four types of PGT are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A)</strong> (formerly called preimplantation genetic screening) – The goal of PGT-A is to identify embryos with de novo aneuploidy and subchromosomal deletions and duplications in the embryo(s) of parents presumed to be chromosomally normal. Theoretically, avoiding transfer of these embryos will reduce the risk of miscarriage and complications related to pregnancy failure and improve the probability of conceiving a pregnancy that results in a live birth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">PGT-A can be used to select the sex of the transferred embryo, which is controversial when performed for nonmedical reasons and prohibited in some countries. (See <a class="local">'Patients who wish to avoid a sex-linked disorder in offspring'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7419.html" rel="external">"Sex selection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic (single-gene) disorders (PGT-M)</strong> – The goal of PGT-M is to establish a pregnancy that is unaffected by specific genetic characteristics, such as a known heritable pathogenic variant carried by one or both parents. It is also used to select embryos for transfer that have specific characteristics, such as a particular sex or compatible human leukocyte antigen complex type.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">PGT-A is also commonly performed since leftover DNA is available for analysis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disorders (PGT-P) </strong>– The goal of PGT-P is to establish a pregnancy that is at low risk of being affected by polygenic disorders that occur later in life, such as hypertension and diabetes. A polygenic risk score is calculated for each embryo using deep whole genome sequencing and haplotyping. Those with the lowest risk scores are prioritized for embryo transfer. Polygenic disorders are more common than monogenic disorders and their inheritance is more complicated. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preimplantation genetic testing for structural rearrangements (PGT-SR)</strong> – The goal of PGT-SR is to establish a pregnancy that is unaffected by a structural chromosomal abnormality (translocation) in a couple with a balanced translocation or deletion/duplication. Contemporary technology may distinguish noncarrier embryos from balanced carriers [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p>IVF is required as part of this process even though many of these couples have no known difficulties conceiving a pregnancy. IVF is expensive, intrusive, and associated with risks, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and a higher frequency of some adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with natural conceptions. The inconvenience, risks, and expense of PGT limit the utilization of this technology to couples at risk of transmitting a genetic disease or those attempting to select for specific characteristics in their offspring.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related to PGT (PGT-M, PGT-SR, and PGT-A). IVF is reviewed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7404.html" rel="external">"In vitro fertilization: Overview of clinical issues and questions"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6788.html" rel="external">"Assisted reproductive technology: Pregnancy and maternal outcomes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2848434965"><span class="h1">PROCEDURE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">Obtaining DNA for analysis</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2567834656"><span class="h3">Blastocyst or cleavage stage biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The blastocyst, which is the developmental stage achieved by five to six days following fertilization, usually contains more than 100 cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55217" href="/d/graphic/55217.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). To obtain genetic material for analysis, a laser, acid Tyrode solution, or a sharpened glass needle is used to create an opening in the zona pellucida when the embryo reaches the blastocyst stage [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>]. Trophectoderm cells (ie, cells from the outer layer of the blastocyst destined to form the placenta) are extracted using a small pipette plus gentle suction or by gently compressing the blastocyst to extrude the cells through the opening. Usually, five to eight cells are removed to limit disruption to the developing fetoplacental unit, but two to three dozen cells can be removed for genetic analysis without compromising blastocyst viability. Compared with other techniques for obtaining preimplantation DNA, blastocyst biopsy is the least disruptive to subsequent development while providing the most DNA for testing, which reduces the possibility of diagnostic errors [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p>Biopsy can be performed on day 3 of development (cleavage stage). Embryo transfer of day 3 embryos used to be the preferred practice in in vitro fertilization (IVF). Approximately 50 percent of embryos survive in culture to day 3 of development (cleavage stage: four to eight cells [blastomeres]). If in vitro culture time is extended to day 5 or 6, only approximately 25 percent of embryos survive to form good-quality blastocysts in vitro. Therefore, extended culture to the blastocyst stage for PGT may increase the number of patients who have no embryos suitable for biopsy or transfer and may result in fewer embryos available for testing, transfer, or cryopreservation. Additional issues of extended culture include a small increase in the risk of monozygotic twinning, an increased probability of having a male child, and the potential for a small increase in the risk of epigenetic modifications leading to increased risk for adverse neonatal outcomes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, the use of day 5 embryos is increasing in IVF programs, even when PGT is not performed. The rationale for this change is that per cycle live birth rates as high or higher than with cleavage stage transfer can be achieved with transfer of fewer (one or two) blastocysts. Additionally, many programs are now cryopreserving all embryos created from each cycle of stimulation with the goal of transferring embryos to the uterus in a cycle without the high estrogen levels created during ovarian stimulation.</p><p>Issues related to IVF are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7404.html" rel="external">"In vitro fertilization: Overview of clinical issues and questions"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134342.html" rel="external">"In vitro fertilization: Procedure"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6788.html" rel="external">"Assisted reproductive technology: Pregnancy and maternal outcomes"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h3">Polar body biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In countries where biopsy of an embryo is not permitted, genetic analysis of polar bodies  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53222" href="/d/graphic/53222.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) is an option since their genetic composition is predictive of the genetic composition of the oocyte [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. As long as it is performed by an experienced individual, removal of polar bodies is not harmful to the oocyte since they are a byproduct of cell division.</p><p>Polar body biopsy (PBB) is only useful for evaluation of maternally inherited pathogenic variants or meiotic errors during oocyte development. The genetic composition of the oocyte can be inferred from analysis of the first and the second polar body [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. If the mother is heterozygous for a known variant allele, division of the diploid primary oocyte at meiosis I may result in a normal ("wild-type") secondary oocyte and a first polar body with the same variant allele as the mother  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53222" href="/d/graphic/53222.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). PBBs that demonstrate normal alleles are presumed to be associated with oocytes that have the variant alleles: These oocytes would not be used to achieve pregnancy. Conversely, PBBs demonstrating the variant alleles are presumed to be associated with oocytes with normal alleles, so these oocytes would then be used for IVF.</p><p>PBB has several limitations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PBB is not useful if the mother is affected (homozygous) by an autosomal recessive disorder and the father is a carrier since all of the mother's oocytes and polar bodies will carry the pathogenic variant. Blastocyst biopsy to assess both maternal and paternal genes in the developing embryos is necessary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The genetic phenomenon of recombination ("crossing over") occurs during meiosis between homologous chromosomes. If a single crossing-over event involves the region containing the candidate gene, the two chromatids of the chromosome would become heterozygous, and thus, biopsy of only polar body I would not permit an accurate prediction of the genetic composition of the oocyte. This problem can be addressed by removal and analysis of both polar body I and II  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53222" href="/d/graphic/53222.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The likelihood of recombination and diagnostic error is increased for genes close to the telomeric (distal) region of the chromosome since genes closer to the centromeric (central) region are far less likely to cross over. Improved PGT for monogenic (single-gene) disorders<strong> </strong>(PGT-M) protocols that include closely linked markers, short tandem repeats, or simple sequence repeats may alleviate those problems.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The oocyte must either be fertilized or cryopreserved before the results of PBB are available, which leads to unnecessary and costly testing of the 30 percent of oocytes that will either not fertilize successfully (ie, develop two pronuclei) or will not undergo postfertilization development.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PBB has limited ability to predict the genetic status of the embryo since analysis of polar bodies does not detect abnormalities that develop after syngamy (ie, fusion of the oocyte and sperm pronuclei), such as mitotic abnormalities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PBB may diagnose a meiotic aneuploidy after meiosis I that goes on to self-correct after meiosis II  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53222" href="/d/graphic/53222.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2346738199"><span class="h3">Noninvasive and/or minimally invasive PGT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Noninvasive and/or minimally invasive PGT is an emerging technique that has the potential to reduce embryo damage caused by biopsy and lower the cost of PGT since less labor is required [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. This approach involves collecting cell-free DNA released from preimplantation embryos, including fluids in the blastocysts, spent culture medium [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], or both [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Challenges that are being addressed include lower detection rates and DNA contamination from maternal cells [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. However, it may become an alternative for helping to select the single best embryo for transfer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1224489275"><span class="h2">Cryopreservation of the embryo or oocyte</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After biopsy, the embryo or oocyte usually must be vitrified (frozen) until results of the genetic analysis are available since the comprehensive genetic techniques used for genomic analysis often cannot be completed in time to allow fresh transfer. Pregnancy outcomes with vitrified and warmed embryos are as good as or better than with fresh embryos, and maternal morbidity, such as ovarian hyperstimulation, may be less since the transfer will not occur during a stimulated cycle. Additionally, the patient may be able to undergo multiple transfers of single embryos from all the embryos obtained during a single ovarian stimulation cycle. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134342.html" rel="external">"In vitro fertilization: Procedure", section on 'Cryopreservation'</a>.)</p><p>It is also possible to thaw frozen unbiopsied embryos, perform PGT, and then repeat cryopreservation [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. If results obtained from the initial biopsy are not conclusive, previously biopsied embryos can be thawed, rebiopsied, and refrozen until the results of repeat testing are available. Viability of embryos after the second vitrification and warming cycle appears to be slightly lower than that of embryos biopsied and frozen only once.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Genetic analysis</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2807951012"><span class="h3">Techniques</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PGT is based on analysis of either a single cell (polar body or day 3 blastomeres) or a few cells (day 5 or 6 biopsy). Contemporary genetic analysis involves DNA amplification using a variety of strategies (eg, whole-genome amplification, polymerase chain reaction [PCR] amplification), followed by use of one of several available platforms for analysis of the amplified DNA [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was a widely used platform for a comprehensive chromosome screening because of its commercial availability but is being replaced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for whole chromosome aneuploidy, segmental alterations, and mosaicism evaluation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117681" href="/d/graphic/117681.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). Efforts have been focused on increasing NGS coverages and on modifying bioinformatic algorithms to improve sensitivity and specificity.</p><p>Other less frequently used platforms include single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and quantitative real-time PCR. Karyomapping, an application of SNP array technology, is now commonly used for detection of single-gene defects. It is technically feasible to perform exome sequencing or even whole genome sequencing on biopsied embryos; however, these techniques are still considered experimental, are labor intensive, and are relatively more costly. These platforms have not been directly compared in randomized trials. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2893.html" rel="external">"Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16683.html" rel="external">"Prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal imbalance: Chromosomal microarray"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2601823434"><span class="h3">False negatives and positives</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>False-negative errors for many diseases have occurred following PGT. Inadvertent amplification of contaminating extraneous DNA can lead to false-negative results and the transfer of abnormal embryos thought to be normal. Errors can also result when one allele for the gene of interest fails to amplify ("allele drop-out") or amplifies poorly ("partial amplification"). Both types of technical failure have been described and have resulted in misdiagnoses leading to the transfer of an affected embryo believed to be normal or the discarding of a normal embryo thought to be affected. For autosomal dominant diseases, testing the family members of the patient carrying the pathogenic variant and using linked markers will reduce the false-negative rate.</p><p>The true risk for obtaining a clinically relevant false-negative result can be determined by prospective auditing and reporting of outcomes of all conceptions after PGT, but no large prospective studies have been conducted yet [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2253931050"><span class="h3">Transfer of embryos with mosaicism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mosaicism arises from postfertilization mitotic errors and leads to distinct cell populations with both euploid and aneuploid chromosomal constitutions. Embryo mosaicism is potentially the largest source of false-positive or false-negative errors and may reduce the overall probability of pregnancy from a single-assisted reproductive technology cycle. Random biopsies of a small sample of cells may not represent the actual chromosomal constitution of the remainder of the dynamic embryo. </p><p>The stage of development of the embryo where the mitotic error occurred will determine the proportion of abnormal cells in the embryo. Earlier errors will lead to higher percentages of abnormal cells. Since aneuploid cell lines divide more slowly than euploid cells, "self-correction" may occur so that the percentage of abnormal cells in an embryo may decrease over time [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. At the blastocyst stage, approximately 17 percent of biopsied embryos were mosaic to some degree in one study [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. At 10 and 13 weeks of gestation, 1 to 2 percent of chorionic villus sampling samples show persistence of mosaic cell lines. Mosaicism has been identified throughout pregnancy. </p><p>Current NGS-based testing methodologies are able to detect low percentages of these abnormal cell populations (as low as 20 percent of the total biopsied specimen). In contrast to older, less sensitive techniques, the percentage of mosaicism likely accurately reflects the mosaic status of the embryo. With previous, less sensitive technologies, such as quantitative PCR, array CGH, and SNP array, mosaic embryos were previously either diagnosed as "normal" and transferred or as "abnormal" and either discarded or not used for transfer. When these abnormal embryos were transferred due to the absence of any normal embryos, the implantation and birth rates of the mosaic embryos were affected by the extent of mosaicism, and healthy children were born without evidence of the persistent abnormal cell line [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. It appears that the implantation rate of these embryos is decreased compared with normal embryos only when the abnormal cell line comprises &gt;50 percent of the cell population sampled but those that implant still result in the birth of healthy children [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Thus, placing arbitrary thresholds on the percent of abnormal cells that can result in a healthy child is without scientific merit and will reduce the pool of available embryos for transfer, as well as the overall probability of pregnancy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H870804138"><span class="h3">Criteria for aneuploidy in embryos for transfer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No universal criteria exist for selecting identified mosaic or abnormal embryos for transfer. We consider a combination of factors: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whether the patient has any remaining euploid embryos</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whether the patient cannot or will not make more embryos</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The percent of abnormal cells in the biopsy </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The potential effect of the abnormality if it persists</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The quality of the embryo</p><p></p><p>Many clinics have developed their own criteria for selecting embryos for transfer. In a survey of assisted reproductive technology clinics in the United States, the most common threshold for considering an embryo euploid was &gt;80 percent normal cells, and the most common threshold for considering an embryo aneuploid was &gt;80 percent abnormal cells; however, substantial variation existed among clinics [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Over 60 percent of respondents had or would transfer a mosaic embryo if only mosaic embryos were identified, one-fourth reported they had no mosaicism threshold for transfer, and nearly 40 percent were unsure of their threshold. One group used outcome data from 1000 mosaic embryo transfers to develop a prioritization scheme for mosaic embryo selection [<a href="#rid25">25</a>] and found that embryos classified as mosaic experienced higher miscarriage rates than euploid embryos, with a particularly high frequency shortly after implantation [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. However, infants born of mosaic embryo transfers had similar birth weight, length of gestation, and frequency of congenital anomalies as infants of euploid embryo transfers.</p><p>The Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis International Society updated their position statement on the transfer of mosaic embryos in 2021 based on recent scientific evidence [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. As published earlier [<a href="#rid29">29</a>], this recent evidence also revealed that mosaic embryos (whole or segmental) could develop into healthy pregnancies [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The Society advised prioritizing transfer of embryos with a normal euploid result over those with mosaic results, but stated that transfer of mosaic embryos appeared to have low or minimal risk of negative outcomes beyond the background risk for any pregnancy.</p><p>The practice committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine has developed guidelines regarding counseling patients who are considering transfer of a mosaic embryo based on trophectoderm biopsy [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. They concluded that, "there is no evidence-based method available to determine which embryos with mosaic results have the best chance of successful pregnancy, or which may have the lowest risk of an undesired outcome," however, it seems reasonable to counsel patients that transfer should be prioritized to those embryos that would have the best outcome if the abnormal cell line identified persisted in the fetus. While genetic testing of a pregnancy conceived after the transfer of an embryo identified as mosaic is strongly encouraged, there is no evidence to date that the abnormal cell line has persisted in these children.</p><p>The ASRM also recommends genetic counseling before testing of embryos for aneuploidy so patients can be informed of the incidence of mosaic results as well as the reporting criteria used by the testing laboratory.

Misdiagnosis can be a falsely normal or falsely abnormal result.

Best estimates of true error rates are difficult to elucidate and will only be identified through transfer of an embryo thought to be free of disease that implants and is tested during pregnancy or on products of conception from miscarriage.

This is important for patients who would, for a variety of reasons, be unable or unwilling to terminate an affected pregnancy diagnosed by prenatal diagnostic techniques (eg, diagnostic amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling) but could discard affected preimplantation embryos or oocytes.

One such example is children affected with Fanconi anemia. Identification of a disease-free embryo that is also HLA compatible with the affected child and can provide cord blood stem cells for transplantation will significantly improve the probability of survival of the affected sibling.

Many patients do not want to know if they are carriers of the pathogenic variant for personal and insurance reasons; however, if they inherited it from their parent, they want to make sure that they do not pass it on to their offspring.</p><p>In these situations, PGT-M with "nondisclosure" can be performed. The patient undergoes an egg retrieval, the eggs are fertilized, but the results (number of eggs, embryos, the number of embryos transferred, the results of the genetic testing) are not divulged to the patient or their partner because disclosing this information could reveal their genetic status for the disorder.

If there are no normal embryos available, sometimes a "mock" embryo transfer with no actual embryos transferred is performed.</p><p>A challenging ethical situation occurs when the patient is found not to be a carrier of the pathogenic variant, based on the results of the initial cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and PGT.

It is desirable because it dramatically reduces the frequency of multiple gestation compared with double embryo transfer. However, some patients, especially older patients, may choose to transfer more than a single embryo to increase their chances of pregnancy with a single in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle.

Since more embryos are available for transfer, the live birth rate per IVF cycle is similar to that with PGT-A [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. Patients who do not undergo PGT-A generally have more surplus embryos for freezing and later use than patients who had their embryos tested. Furthermore, once all embryos (fresh and frozen) from a single oocyte retrieval procedure have been transferred over two or more cycles, patients who do not undergo PGT-A/eSET have similar cumulative live birth rates as patients who undergo PGT-A/eSET, but they also have higher rates of multiple gestation.

Additionally, PGT-A appeared to lower the number of infants born per IVF retrieval procedure and may have increased the number of cycles needed to achieve a live birth.

Although PGT-A selected euploid embryos, potentially resulting in higher implantation rates and pregnancy rates per transfer, pregnancy rates per patient or per started cycle were lower since fewer embryos were available for transfer and fewer transfers were performed.</p><p>In a 2017 trial of patients aged 38 to 41 years with at least five metaphase II oocytes randomly assigned to PGT-A using comparative genomic hybridization or transfer of untested blastocysts, both groups had similar cumulative delivery rates per patient by six months after trial closure [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. PGT-A resulted in a higher rate of live birth from the first embryo transfer (53 versus 24 percent) and overall fewer embryo transfers per live birth (mean 1.8 versus 3.7) because of lower miscarriage rates (3 versus 39 percent). However, fewer cycles in the PGT-A group resulted in embryo transfer (68 versus 91 percent). The authors concluded that PGT-A was advantageous in patients of advanced age because it reduced the emotional burden of miscarriage and the time from initiation of IVF to pregnancy resulting in a live birth (7.7 versus 14.9 weeks).</p><p>In contrast to this trial, which was restricted to patients with multiple metaphase II oocytes, PGT-A may prolong the time to conceive a pregnancy in patients who are undergoing multiple IVF cycles to have adequate numbers of embryos to perform PGT-A (ie, embryo banking). Although patients in whom all embryos were chromosomally abnormal in this trial avoided the psychological, physical, and economic burden of unsuccessful embryo transfers (miscarriage, implantation failure), there is a real possibility that some embryos considered abnormal by PGT-A testing, particularly mosaics, could have resulted in a healthy euploid child (false abnormal PGT-A) had they been transferred [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. Patients with limited numbers of embryos must be made aware of this prior to testing. In addition, since most abnormal embryos will not continue to develop or implant if transferred into the uterus or would result in an early miscarriage without need for medical intervention, PGT-A to avoid transfer of abnormal embryos is not likely to reduce maternal medical or surgical morbidity associated with pregnancy loss. This was seen in the older population in the STAR trial; older patients did not have a different miscarriage rate or live birth rate with PGT-A compared with those in the control group per randomized patient [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H778456382"><span class="h2">Recurrent early pregnancy loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of conceptions that end in miscarriage and successfully karyotyped demonstrate a chromosomal abnormality, typically aneuploidy (loss or gain of an entire chromosome), but some are related to duplication or deletion of a portion of the chromosome (segmental aneuploidy) or to mosaicism [<a href="#rid77">77,78</a>].

Based on the score, some patients may destroy potentially viable blastocysts or undergo extra cycles of ovarian stimulation to produce more blastocysts. Additionally, selecting a specific embryo based on this score may inadvertently select an embryo with a higher risk for another disorder that was not tested for.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Types</strong> – There are multiple types of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT): </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic (single-gene) disorders (PGT-M)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Preimplantation genetic testing for structural rearrangements (PGT-SR)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic diseases (PGT-P, a relatively new concept that is rarely performed)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">All require in vitro fertilization (IVF), biopsy of the embryo, or less commonly, the polar body for genetic testing, and then uterine transfer of selected embryos based on the results of genetic testing. (See <a class="local">'Introduction/terminology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Candidates </strong>– The main reasons that patients choose PGT-M are to avoid having a pregnancy with a fetus affected by, or at risk for, a severe debilitating disease; to increase the parents' chances of having a human leukocyte antigen complex-compatible offspring; and for medically-indicated sex selection. (See <a class="local">'Potential candidates for PGT-M'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Couples with balanced translocations choose PGT-SR to reduce the risk of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) from unbalanced translocations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Counseling</strong> – Counseling should be provided to ensure that patients fully understand the benefits and limitations of PGT and other available options for prenatal diagnosis or other ways to avoid having a child with a genetic disorder. They should understand the limitations of the technique, the small but nonzero rate of false-positive and false-negative results, and the need for amniocentesis (preferred) or chorionic villus biopsy to confirm PGT findings. (See <a class="local">'Counseling'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Biopsy does not appear to decrease implantation and live birth rates or have any long-term harm on offspring. (See <a class="local">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Biopsy and vitrification</strong> – DNA for genetic analysis is usually obtained from biopsy of trophectoderm cells from a blastocyst on day 5 or day 6 after fertilization (see <a class="local">'Blastocyst or cleavage stage biopsy'</a> above). Biopsy of a polar body is also possible, but results are much more limited. (See <a class="local">'Polar body biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After biopsy, the embryo or oocyte usually must be vitrified (frozen) until results of the genetic analysis are available. It is possible to thaw frozen unbiopsied embryos, perform PGT, and then repeat cryopreservation, although this may compromise embryo viability. Rebiopsy of a previously frozen embryo to clarify ambiguous results from an initial biopsy is also possible. (See <a class="local">'Cryopreservation of the embryo or oocyte'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genetic analysis</strong> – Genetic analysis involves DNA amplification using a variety of strategies (eg, whole-genome amplification, polymerase chain reaction [PCR] amplification), followed by use of one of several available platforms for analysis of the amplified DNA. (See <a class="local">'Genetic analysis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Inadvertent amplification of contaminating extraneous DNA can lead to false-negative results and transfer of abnormal embryos thought to be normal. Errors in PGT-M can also result when one allele for the gene of interest fails to amplify ("allele drop-out") or amplifies poorly ("partial amplification"). Both types of technical failure have been described and have resulted in misdiagnoses leading to the transfer of an affected embryo believed to be normal or the discarding of a normal embryo thought to be affected. Linkage analysis can help improve the accuracy of the results. (See <a class="local">'False negatives and positives'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Utility</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>PGT-M and PGT-SR</strong> can reduce the risk of a pregnancy with a fetus affected by a severe, debilitating genetic condition or a miscarriage due to unbalanced translocation. (See <a class="local">'Potential candidates for PGT-M'</a> above and <a class="local">'Potential candidates for PGT-SR'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>PGT-A</strong> to eliminate the transfer of aneuploid embryos has not been proven to improve pregnancy rate or outcome per started IVF cycle and may lower the overall probability of pregnancy due to errors and lower numbers of available embryos. Additionally, miscarriage rates are not reduced. (See <a class="local">'PGT-A to improve pregnancy outcome for patients undergoing IVF'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The major clinical utility of PGT-A is that multiple gestation rates can be significantly reduced without reducing delivery rates if a euploid result leads to single embryo transfer (eSET) rather than double embryo transfer. However, studies evaluating the transfer of one fresh blastocyst and, if no pregnancy occurs, one frozen/thawed blastocyst, report the same cumulate live birth rates as transferring a single blastocyst after PGT-A. (See <a class="local">'Potential candidates for PGT-A'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Although commercial laboratories have begun offering <strong>PGT-P</strong> to patients, its use is controversial and should be approached cautiously as a number of potential problems exist. (See <a class="local">'Selecting for polygenic disorders (PGT-P)'</a> above.) </p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Kuliev A, Rechitsky S.
