Metastatic prostate cancer is an important clinical problem in terms of the number of men who are affected, its impact on quality of life, and as a cause of mortality.</p><p>Osteoblastic lesions in bone are the most common site of metastasis. These frequently are symptomatic and can cause pain, debility, and functional impairment. The treatment of bone metastases in men with prostate cancer is palliative. The goals of treatment are to improve survival, relieve pain, improve mobility, and prevent complications (eg, pathologic fractures, epidural spinal cord compression).</p><p>The management of men with bone metastases from advanced prostate cancer is reviewed here, including treatments to palliate pain and therapies to prevent complications of osseous metastasis. The clinical presentation and evaluation of bone metastases and the overall approach to the management of men with advanced prostate cancer are discussed separately.

Symptomatic SREs are clinically detectable events that do not depend on routine acquisition of imaging. Pain is the most common symptom in metastatic bone disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91912.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of bone metastasis in adults", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1813911624"><span class="h1">MANAGING PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC BONE METASTASES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are several approaches to managing pain and other skeletal-related events (SREs) in men with metastatic prostate cancer. In general, systemic therapy is an important component of patient management for controlling symptoms and slowing progression of bone metastases. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is the treatment of choice for men with metastatic prostate cancer and bone pain that is not responsive to systemic therapy and limited to one or a limited number of sites.</p><p>The utility of other therapies, including bone-targeted radioisotopes, bisphosphonates, focused ultrasound, and surgery, is limited to selected populations and is reviewed in the sections below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3771804741"><span class="h2">Analgesics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A range of pharmacologic agents are available to treat cancer-related bone pain that is not adequately controlled by measures specifically directed against the metastatic disease. In addition to opioids, which are a mainstay of treatment for painful bone metastases, these include adjuvants, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and osteoclast inhibitors, such as bisphosphonates. (See <a class="local">'Bisphosphonates'</a> below.)</p><p>A wide variety of issues relating to optimal pain management in cancer patients are discussed separately.

Specific examples of some of these treatments are outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127197" href="/z/d/graphic/127197.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). However, the optimal sequencing or combination of these therapies with bone-targeted agents (including Ra-223) is unclear [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>The use of androgen deprivation therapy as initial therapy for castration-sensitive metastatic disease, and various other modalities for castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer are discussed separately.

For most men, we suggest using a single fraction of 8 Gy to the involved area. The benefits of radiation therapy (RT) in this setting, a discussion of optimal treatment schedules (eg, single- versus multiple-fractionation RT), and the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy as an alternative to EBRT are discussed separately.

Beta particle-emitting radioisotopes, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9950" href="/z/d/drug information/9950.html" rel="external">strontium-89</a> and samarium-153 ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonate, may provide palliation of pain, but they do not significantly prolong overall survival. (See <a class="local">'Radium-223'</a> below and <a class="local">'Beta-emitting radioisotopes'</a> below.)</p><p>These radioisotopes, which vary in their physical properties  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53847" href="/z/d/graphic/53847.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), are mainly used in men with advanced prostate cancer who are symptomatic from multiple osteoblastic bone metastases. A prerequisite for bone-targeted radioisotope treatment is the presence of uptake on bone scan due to metastatic disease at the sites that correlate with pain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H261306118"><span class="h3">Radium-223</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For men with symptomatic metastatic CRPC and bone pain who have predominantly bony metastases and no evidence of visceral or large nodal metastases, Ra-223 is an option to reduce symptomatic SREs (including bone pain) and improve health-related quality of life. A beneficial role for combinations of Ra-223 with systemic therapy has not been established, and at least some data suggest detrimental outcomes when Ra-223 is combined with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16083" href="/z/d/drug information/16083.html" rel="external">abiraterone</a>. We suggest against initiating Ra-223 and abiraterone at the same time. Ra-223 can permanently reduce bone marrow reserves, and this may affect decision-making on the timing and use of this agent if a patient remains a candidate for palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p><p>Ra-223 is a bone-seeking alpha particle-emitting agent, and its decay allows the deposition of high-energy radiation over a much shorter distance than that with beta particle-emitting radioisotopes, thus potentially treating the tumor while minimizing toxicity to normal bone marrow.</p><p>Ra-223 has been shown to prolong overall survival and decreases symptomatic SREs due to bone disease in men with multifocal symptomatic bone metastases [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. Ra-223 is indicated for the treatment of patients with CRPC, symptomatic bone metastases, and no known visceral metastases. However, the optimal selection of candidates for Ra-223 is not established [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], especially given that new agents such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86370" href="/z/d/drug information/86370.html" rel="external">enzalutamide</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16083" href="/z/d/drug information/16083.html" rel="external">abiraterone</a> were not utilized in the pivotal phase III Ra-223 study (ALSYMPCA trial) that demonstrated a survival benefit from use of this agent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2458133117"><span class="h4">ALSYMPCA trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ra-223 increased both overall survival and time to first symptomatic SRE in the phase III ALSYMPCA trial [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Symptomatic skeletal events were defined as external beam RT to relieve skeletal symptoms, new symptomatic pathologic fracture, occurrence of spinal cord compression, or tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention.</p><p>In the ALSYMPCA trial, all patients had castration-resistant prostate cancer with multiple bone metastases and had either progressed on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> chemotherapy or were not candidates for docetaxel chemotherapy. Patients were required to have two or more bone metastases and no known visceral metastases. Overall, 921 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to best supportive care plus Ra-223 (one dose every four weeks for six cycles) or best supportive care plus placebo. Best supportive care options included a second-line variety of hormonal therapies and bisphosphonates. Approximately 80 percent had six or more lesions on bone scan, and 40 percent had 20 or more lesions. Almost 60 percent had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy.</p><p>Key results included the following [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overall survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, was significantly prolonged with Ra-223 compared with placebo (median 14.9 versus 11.3 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.58-0.83) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The survival benefit was consistent across all patient subgroups, including both those who had and had not received prior <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The time to first symptomatic skeletal event (which included first use of EBRT for symptom relief, new pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, or tumor-related orthopedic surgery intervention) was significantly increased (median 15.6 versus 9.8 months, HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.52-0.83) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. When the symptomatic skeletal events were analyzed individually, the differences were statistically significant for use of EBRT for symptom relief (HR 0.67), and for spinal cord compression (HR 0.52). Differences were not statistically significant for new pathologic fracture (0.62) or for orthopedic surgery intervention (0.72), but the number of such events was limited. Routine radiographs were not utilized during this trial, and, thus, all symptomatic skeletal events were detected clinically.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a prespecified subset analysis, Ra-223 had similar efficacy in those who had received prior <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> and in those who were docetaxel naïve [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

The updated information recommends that hematologic evaluation be performed at baseline and prior to each dose. Before the first administration, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥1.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, the platelet count should be ≥100 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, and the hemoglobin should be ≥10 g/dL. Before subsequent administrations, the ANC should be ≥1 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, and the platelet count should be ≥50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Treatment should be discontinued if there is no recovery to these values within six to eight weeks of the last dose.</p><p></p><p>The clinical trial used six doses of Ra-223 every four weeks, and this is the approved schedule for Ra-223 administration that is endorsed in expert guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].

In view of these data, for most men, we suggest against initiating Ra-223 and abiraterone at the same time. For men already receiving abiraterone, whether the addition of Ra-223 might be safe and yield clinical benefit is unknown.

The goals of palliative treatment for men with bone metastases include pain relief, improved mobility, and prevention of complications such as pathologic fracture or epidural spinal cord compression. (See <a class="local">'Complications from bone metastases'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Analgesic agents</strong> – A range of pharmacologic agents are available to treat cancer-related bone pain that is not adequately controlled by measures specifically directed against the metastatic disease. In addition to opioids, which are a mainstay of treatment for painful bone metastases, these include adjuvants, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and osteoclast inhibitors, such as bisphosphonates. (See <a class="local">'Analgesics'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Systemic anticancer therapy</strong> – Systemic anticancer therapy may control symptoms and slow progression of bone metastases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6941.html" rel="external">"Overview of systemic treatment for recurrent or metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>External beam RT</strong> – External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is the treatment of choice for men with bone pain that is not responsive to systemic therapy and limited to one or a limited number of sites. For most men, a single fraction of 8 Gy to the involved area is preferred over multifractionated regimens. Specific recommendations are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2805.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy for the management of painful bone metastases"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bone-targeting radioisotopes</strong> – For patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and multifocal symptomatic osteoblastic bone metastases that are not controllable with systemic therapy or EBRT, bone-targeting alpha particle-emitting radioisotopes (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="89425" href="/z/d/drug information/89425.html" rel="external">radium-223</a> [Ra-223]) may offer significant palliative benefit. (See <a class="local">'Bone-targeted radioisotopes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ra-223 should be restricted to men with castration-resistant symptomatic metastases, and no known visceral metastatic disease. (See <a class="local">'ALSYMPCA trial'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Ra-223 can permanently reduce bone marrow reserves, and this may affect decision-making on the timing and use of this agent if a patient remains a candidate for palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For most men with advanced CRPC, we suggest against initiating Ra-223 and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16083" href="/z/d/drug information/16083.html" rel="external">abiraterone</a> at the same time (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). A beneficial role for combining Ra-223 with systemic therapy has not been established, and some data suggest detrimental outcomes when Ra-223 and abiraterone are initiated concurrently. For men already receiving abiraterone, whether the addition of Ra-223 might be safe and yield clinical benefit is not yet established. If such an approach is chosen, patients should also be receiving a bone-modifying agent, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9902" href="/z/d/drug information/9902.html" rel="external">zoledronic acid</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a>.

For many patients, denosumab may be preferred over zoledronic acid, based on superior efficacy in a large randomized comparative trial. However, others prefer zoledronic acid because there are sufficient data in CRPC to support dosing every 12 rather than every 4 weeks. Zoledronic acid may also be a preferred alternative if cost and/or reimbursement are important considerations. Data on efficacy of bisphosphonates, denosumab, and comparative efficacy in men with CRPC are discussed in detail elsewhere.
