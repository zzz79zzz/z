Less commonly, splenectomy is used to make a diagnosis when there is unexplained splenomegaly or a splenic mass. There are several considerations to address before, during, and after the procedure to ensure the best outcomes and the least morbidity.</p><p>This topic discusses the indications for elective splenectomy, preprocedure interventions, operative technique, and postprocedure risks.</p><p>Traumatic splenectomy, the approach to evaluating splenomegaly, and the care of the asplenic (or functionally asplenic) patient are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anatomy and function of the spleen – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7134.html" rel="external">"Splenomegaly and other splenic disorders in adults", section on 'Properties of the normal spleen'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Splenic trauma, operative management – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7955.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of splenic injury in the adult trauma patient"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Splenic trauma, non-operative management – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7957.html" rel="external">"Management of splenic injury in the adult trauma patient"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Splenomegaly evaluation (child) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5928.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with an enlarged spleen"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Splenomegaly evaluation (adult) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7134.html" rel="external">"Splenomegaly and other splenic disorders in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asplenic patient, prevention of infections – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1412.html" rel="external">"Prevention of infection in patients with impaired splenic function"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asplenic patient, treatment of infections – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1404.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, evaluation, and management of fever in patients with impaired splenic function"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5937.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of fever in children and adults with sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H621651122"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4082929171"><span class="h2">Overview of indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The conditions for which splenectomy may be appropriate therapy, those for which it is rarely used, and those for which it is generally contraindicated are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121576" href="/d/graphic/121576.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Close consultation between the primary care provider, the consulting hematologist or oncologist, and the surgeon is important to determine whether splenectomy is the best treatment option for the individual patient and what preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative considerations apply.</p><p>Broadly, indications for splenectomy include conditions with significant hemolysis or thrombocytopenia that depends on splenic reticuloendothelial function and/or autoantibody production; malignant or infectious disorders predominantly localized to the spleen; removal en bloc with other organs for cancer surgery; and rare complications of other disorders in which there is massive splenomegaly and/or hypersplenism with cytopenias [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Details are presented in the following sections.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1838264910"><span class="h2">Inherited hemolytic anemias</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Splenectomy is an accepted therapy for several inherited hemolytic anemias and may be used to reduce hemolysis and improve the hemoglobin level when less invasive medical therapies have been ineffective. It may also provide symptomatic relief when there is massive splenomegaly that interferes with normal functioning.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hereditary RBC membrane disorders</strong> – Hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis, pyropoikilocytosis, and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis are hereditary hemolytic anemias caused by variants in genes that encode components of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane and cytoskeleton. Splenectomy may be used in selected individuals (often children) who remain transfusion dependent or severely symptomatic after one year of age, although it is preferable to delay the procedure until after six years of age due to the possible risk of sepsis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7079.html" rel="external">"Hereditary spherocytosis", section on 'Splenectomy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7087.html" rel="external">"Hereditary elliptocytosis and related disorders", section on 'Role of splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thalassemia</strong> – Thalassemias include inherited hemolytic anemias of varying severity that generally result from a decrease in alpha globin or beta globin production. Some individuals with severe disease (transfusion-dependent thalassemia, growth retardation, hypersplenism, splenic infarction) may be treated with splenectomy, although severe complications are becoming less common when individuals are treated with regular transfusions, chelation therapy, activin receptor ligand trap therapy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Gene therapy will also likely have an impact on the natural history of this disease and thus may decrease the need for splenectomy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7118.html" rel="external">"Management of thalassemia", section on 'Role of splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sickle cell disease</strong> – Sickle cell disease causes splenic infarction early in life and is rarely associated with splenomegaly or hypersplenism. However, some patients may have life-threatening splenic sequestration resulting from massive pooling of red blood cells in the spleen causing rapidly developing splenomegaly, anemia, and hypovolemia. This is a serious complication and mortality is high. There have been no prospective controlled studies in patients with a history of splenic sequestration crisis evaluating the benefit of splenectomy versus chronic transfusion therapy versus observation to prevent further attacks [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Some experts recommend splenectomy after one or two episodes of splenic sequestration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease", section on 'Splenic and hepatic sequestration'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pyruvate kinase deficiency</strong> – Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which causes a reduced ATP production in RBCs, is a rare congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Splenectomy is often performed in individuals with severe or transfusion-dependent anemia. If possible, surgery is delayed until after age 5 years to decrease the risk of sepsis [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. A registry study in individuals with PK deficiency demonstrated an increase in hemoglobin of 1.6 g/dL after splenectomy, which is often less than what is seen in other inherited hemolytic anemias treated with splenectomy [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease", section on 'Splenic and hepatic sequestration'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7129.html" rel="external">"Pyruvate kinase deficiency"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H113414755"><span class="h2">Autoimmune cytopenias</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In autoimmune cytopenias, the spleen may be the primary site of cell destruction due to reticuloendothelial macrophages, or it may be the source of the clone of cells producing the autoantibodies responsible for targeting the cells for destruction.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ITP</strong> – Splenectomy is sometimes used in individuals (typically adults) with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP for whom initial therapies are ineffective in raising the platelet count to a safe range (eg, &gt;30,000/microL) to reduce the risk of serious bleeding. Benefits and risks compared with other therapeutic options are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6678.html" rel="external">"Second-line and subsequent therapies for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>AIHA</strong> – Splenectomy is sometimes used in individuals with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) for whom initial therapies are ineffective in improving the hemoglobin level and reducing hemolysis. Benefits and risks compared with other therapeutic options are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7078.html" rel="external">"Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in adults", section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Felty syndrome</strong> – Splenectomy is rarely used for autoimmune neutropenia. An exception is Felty syndrome (splenomegaly and autoimmune neutropenia in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis), for whom splenectomy may be used if there are recurrent or severe infections and other interventions have been ineffective. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7485.html" rel="external">"Role of splenectomy for Felty syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H650487665"><span class="h2">SMZL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents in adulthood with splenomegaly and lymphocytosis. Splenectomy may be used for symptom control in some individuals who are symptomatic from localized splenic involvement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4731.html" rel="external">"Splenic marginal zone lymphoma", section on 'Splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2719618603"><span class="h2">Splenic abscess</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Formation of an abscess in the spleen is a rare complication of other infections, typically seeded hematogenously (eg, from bacterial endocarditis). Management typically involves antibiotics and splenectomy, although experience with image-guided percutaneous drainage has been developing.

Individuals with this condition are at risk for complications including splenic torsion and/or infarction. Splenectomy is often recommended in these individuals [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Ideally, this is done on an elective basis, although patients present with an acute complication requiring emergency surgery [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7134.html" rel="external">"Splenomegaly and other splenic disorders in adults", section on 'Abscess and infarction'</a>.)</p><p>Symptomatic or massive splenomegaly may also be treated with splenectomy. In these cases, the role of splenectomy depends on the underlying cause of splenomegaly and the risks and benefits of other available therapies.</p><p>Occasionally, individuals will have an enlarged spleen or a splenic mass without obvious cause despite extensive work-up, including bone marrow biopsy, peripheral blood flow cytometry, and imaging studies. Such patients could be considered for diagnostic splenectomy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Splenic mass</strong> – A series of 28 individuals who underwent splenectomy for a splenic mass (mostly solitary) found that approximately three-fourths had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and one-fourth had benign tumors (eg, inflammatory pseudotumor) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7134.html" rel="external">"Splenomegaly and other splenic disorders in adults", section on 'Focal splenic lesions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Splenomegaly</strong> – A series of 1280 individuals who underwent splenectomy over a 10-year period from 1986 to 1995 reported that approximately 10 percent were done for diagnostic purposes [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The most common finding was lymphoma (often a primary splenic lymphoma) or leukemia (57 percent) followed by metastatic cancer (11 percent) or cyst/pseudocyst (9 percent). Less-common findings included vascular neoplasms, granulomatous lesions, infarction, hemorrhage, and extramedullary hematopoiesis.

This procedure is generally reserved for children who require splenectomy when they are younger than six years of age. Following partial splenectomy, the spleen may regrow and a second procedure may be required. However, this may allow the patient to delay total splenectomy until they are considerably older and have a reduced risk of sepsis.

Most were done using an open laparotomy (81 percent); the remainder used a laparoscopic approach, and 27 were done robotically. Vascular dissection and parenchymal transection methods evolved over the years. Conversion to total splenectomy occurred intraoperatively in 14 individuals and postoperatively in 12; an additional 61 subsequently underwent elective conversion to total splenectomy to further treat their underlying hematologic condition. The mean length of hospital stay was six days, and overall complications were low. There were three deaths, one due to colonic perforation on postoperative day six and two from sepsis (one eight months after total splenectomy, and one 13 years after splenectomy). The long-term efficacy and safety of this procedure could not be evaluated in a systematic and thorough fashion due to the nature of the studies reviewed (retrospective and case reviews) and lack of data regarding detailed follow-up. It is noteworthy that many of the patients who required elective conversion to total splenectomy had hematologic indications for their partial splenectomy.

The majority of accessory spleens are located in the splenic hilum, gastrosplenic ligament, splenorenal ligament, and greater omentum. They have also been located in the tail of the pancreas, where they might be mistaken for an intrapancreatic neoplasm. An accessory spleen is thought to form when the splenic tissue fails to fuse properly during embryogenesis. Splenosis arises from trauma, when a piece of the spleen breaks off and becomes lodged in the peritoneal cavity.

Further, the splenic blood supply is very rich. Accordingly, removal of the spleen may place one or more of these structures and/or their vascular supplies at risk.</p><p>In a series of 604 patients from China who underwent splenectomy for trauma or portal hypertension, intraperitoneal hemorrhage occurred in 14 (2 percent); most occurred within 24 hours of the procedure, and half were preceded by sentinel bleeding (minor blood loss around the surgical drains) a few hours before major bleeding occurred [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. All but one underwent re-exploration, and the sites of hemorrhage were found to be in the splenic bed, short gastric artery, pancreatic tail, and splenic artery. Three of the patients with hemorrhage died, compared with seven patients in the non-hemorrhage group (21 versus 1 percent, respectively). Risk factors for hemorrhage included postoperative antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3417651597"><span class="h2">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The spleen is a major immune organ. It is the principal site responsible for removing opsonized bacteria from the bloodstream via the monocyte macrophage system, as well as a key secondary organ for producing mature B-cells during the antigen-dependent phase of the humoral immune response. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7134.html" rel="external">"Splenomegaly and other splenic disorders in adults", section on 'Function'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13933.html" rel="external">"Normal B and T lymphocyte development", section on 'Mature B cells'</a>.)</p><p>Infections with the parasites <em>plasmodium falciparum</em> (malaria), <em>Babesia microti</em> (babesiosis), and <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em> (human granulocytic ehrlichiosis) are also increased or of greater severity in individuals who have undergone splenectomy.</p><p>Infection, including life-threatening sepsis, is of concern in any individual who has undergone splenectomy and especially in young children or individuals with other immune deficits. As noted above, encapsulated organisms are of concern because the splenic filtering function is no longer present following splenectomy; however, infections are not limited to encapsulated organisms. (See <a class="local">'Vaccinations'</a> above.)</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">Rituximab</a> may increase this risk, as noted above. (See <a class="local">'Other medication management'</a> above.)</p><p>In a series of over 8000 veterans who were followed for over 20 years after splenectomy, infection was the most common long-term complication (adjusted relative risk [RR] for sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis, 3.4, 2.4, 1.9, respectively) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. These risks were independent of the underlying indication for splenectomy and persisted over the course of the study, suggesting that infectious risk does not wane over time. Other studies have reported similar findings and have identified sepsis as the most common cause of post-splenectomy death during extended follow-up [<a href="#rid36">36-38</a>].</p><p>Any sign of a systemic infection (eg, fever with a single oral temperature &gt;38.3°C [101°F]) in an asplenic individual should be considered a medical emergency; most individuals presenting with a suspected bacterial infection should be admitted to the hospital, have blood cultures obtained, and receive broad-spectrum antibiotics pending the results [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Outpatient management may be appropriate for an individual who does not appear clinically ill, has normal laboratory testing (eg, complete blood count [CBC]), and in whom follow-up can be obtained in a timely manner. If patients are distant from a medical facility, oral administration of an antibiotic is appropriate; plans for this approach and a prescription should be provided to the patient. Prompt antibiotic therapy of animal bites (including dog bites) is recommended by some experts. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1404.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, evaluation, and management of fever in patients with impaired splenic function", section on 'Evaluation and management'</a>.)</p><p>Recommendations for prophylactic antibiotics vary, and the approach in the post-pneumococcal era is based on expert opinion rather than randomized controlled trials. A common recommendation for children &lt;5 years of age is for antibiotic prophylaxis for at least two years following splenectomy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119183" href="/d/graphic/119183.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Patients should be advised to carry a medical alert card or bracelet stating that they are asplenic, and the medical record should be updated to include splenectomy as an active problem. Additional details as well as other preventive measures related to travel and animal exposures are presented in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1412.html" rel="external">"Prevention of infection in patients with impaired splenic function", section on 'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1412.html" rel="external">"Prevention of infection in patients with impaired splenic function", section on 'Other considerations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H48495031"><span class="h2">Venous thromboembolism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Splenectomy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including portal and splenic vein thrombosis as well as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The cause may be multifactorial and include thrombocytosis, alterations in the vascular anatomy, increased blood viscosity, and/or changes in coagulation parameters that may be related to the underlying diagnosis and/or to splenectomy procedure [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p>In retrospective studies, the absolute risk of VTE has ranged from 3 to 7 percent [<a href="#rid40">40-42</a>]. Malignancy and myeloproliferative neoplasms and increased platelet count postoperatively appeared to be associated with greater risk. </p><p>In the series of over 8000 veterans who were followed for over 20 years after splenectomy, the rates of DVT and PE were both increased (RR, 2.2 for both) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. As with infection, this increased risk was independent of the underlying indication for splenectomy and persisted over the course of the study. Other studies have corroborated this increased risk and identified possible contributing factors such as increased age [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p>The rate of VTE appears to be especially high after splenectomy in individuals with hereditary stomatocytosis. In one large series, 11 of 13 individuals who underwent splenectomy developed severe, recurrent thromboses, whereas 9 of 10 with intact spleens did not develop VTE [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. This is part of the rationale for avoiding splenectomy.

In the series of over 8000 veterans who were followed for over 20 years after splenectomy, the risk of heart disease was not increased [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. However, other studies have reported an increased risk of stroke and ischemic heart disease following splenectomy [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PH may be due to chronic hemolysis for which splenectomy was performed. PH has been described following splenectomy for thalassemia, sickle cell disease, and hereditary spherocytosis (HS), and it was suggested that the risk may be related to ongoing hemolysis after the procedure [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].

Specific indications, summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121576" href="/d/graphic/121576.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), include hereditary spherocytosis, transfusion-dependent thalassemia, immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, splenic abscess, splenic or portal vein thrombosis with bleeding varices, ovarian cancer debulking, and total pancreatectomy. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General contraindications</strong> – Splenectomy is no longer used for staging Hodgkin disease and is generally avoided in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, hereditary stomatocytosis or xerocytosis, cold agglutinin disease, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, Gaucher disease, and hypersplenism from cirrhosis. (See <a class="local">'Conditions in which splenectomy is generally contraindicated'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preoperative planning</strong> – Before splenectomy, the risks and benefits of alternative therapies must be considered. Laboratory testing includes complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, differential, and coagulation studies (prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]). Additional testing for occult lymphoma or glycogen storage disease may be indicated depending on the clinical setting. (See <a class="local">'Preoperative considerations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vaccinations</strong> – Vaccinations prior to splenectomy are crucial, because the spleen is the principal site responsible for filtering bacteria from the bloodstream and producing mature B-cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119180" href="/d/graphic/119180.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Influenza vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine, and other vaccines for which the individual is due should also be administered. The ideal timing is 10 to 12 weeks before the procedure to allow the full series, but shorter timelines are effective.

This is expected to have lower mortality, shorter hospital stay, and fewer surgical complications. However, there may be reasons to perform an open splenectomy in some cases (massive splenomegaly, need to explore for an accessory spleen, cancer surgery, insufficient surgical expertise, lack of support for laparoscopy). Other considerations include use of partial splenectomy for children &lt;6 years, simultaneous cholecystectomy for individuals with pigment gallstones from hemolysis, and identification and removal of an accessory spleen(s). (See <a class="local">'Surgical approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – Operative mortality is declining but remains a concern. Perioperative complications include bleeding, thrombosis, and infections.
