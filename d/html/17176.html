ORS was first described in 1970 in a report of a study in felines in which ovarian specimens left in the abdominal cavity were able to reimplant and become functional, even after devascularization [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>ORS is associated with pelvic pain or pelvic mass after oophorectomy. Though infrequent, this condition presents a challenge to the clinician in its diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>The epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of ORS are reviewed here. The technique for oophorectomy is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3304.html" rel="external">"Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29954828"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historically, the definition of ORS included only patients with histologically confirmed ovarian tissue after bilateral oophorectomy.</p><p>The definition has since been broadened to include patients with a history of unilateral oophorectomy with ovarian tissue remaining ipsilateral to the side of excision [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>ORS is a different entity than "residual ovary syndrome," also referred to as a retained ovary, in which an ovary is intentionally left in place during surgery and subsequently causes pelvic pain [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. It is also different from supernumerary ovary syndrome, which involves the development of extra ovaries during embryogenesis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Ovarian tissue may be present due to ectopic implantation of excised ovarian tissue. There are rare reports of patients who developed endometriosis or ovarian carcinoma at laparoscopic port sites after oophorectomy, particularly when the ovarian specimen was cut into pieces [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. During laparoscopic procedures, the implantation of a tiny piece of ovarian tissue might occur during the extraction of the specimen through the trocar site, which does not allow us to define this occurrence as remnant ovary, but rather as port site ectopic tissue or port site metastasis [<a href="#rid9">9,12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H329799018"><span class="h1">RISK OF ENDOMETRIOSIS OR OVARIAN CANCER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with ORS may be affected by endometriosis or ovarian cancer. Thus, post-oophorectomy presentation consistent with either of these conditions requires evaluation. These two issues are related, since endometriosis is a risk factor for some histologic types of ovarian carcinoma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83387.html" rel="external">"Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Incidence and risk factors", section on 'Endometriosis'</a>.)</p><p>ORS with pelvic pain is often associated with endometriosis. Remnant ovarian tissue may contain endometriotic implants, or hormonal stimulation from functional ovarian tissue may stimulate endometriotic implants at other sites [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Endometriosis in an ovarian remnant typically presents with pelvic pain, which may be cyclic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134970.html" rel="external">"Endometriosis: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis", section on 'Presenting symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of malignancy in remnant ovarian tissue has been described in patients with a history of bilateral oophorectomy [<a href="#rid14">14-19</a>]. In one series, 2 of 20 patients with ORS were reported to have ovarian adenocarcinoma [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], and a case of ovarian endometrioid carcinoma was noted in a patient 10 years after initial oophorectomy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Ovarian endometriosis was also present in the majority of the reported cases of ovarian carcinoma in ORS patients [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>There is no evidence that patients with ORS are at an increased risk of ovarian cancer compared with the general population; the risk for each patient is based upon individual risk factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59585" href="/d/graphic/59585.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Patients with a malignancy in an ovarian remnant typically present with either pelvic pain, which is often associated with endometriosis (a risk factor for some histologic types of ovarian carcinoma) and may be an early symptom of ovarian cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76135" href="/d/graphic/76135.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), or with a pelvic mass. Patients should be evaluated for ovarian cancer following oophorectomy as appropriate based upon risk factors, symptoms, and imaging findings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83387.html" rel="external">"Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Incidence and risk factors", section on 'Endometriosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83704.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass", section on 'Assessing the risk of malignancy'</a>.)</p><p>Differentiating a malignancy in an ovarian remnant from peritoneal carcinoma is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29954688"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of ORS is difficult to determine [<a href="#rid3">3,14</a>]. The available data are limited to case reports or to retrospective case series [<a href="#rid1">1,3-5,9,14-16,20-29</a>].</p><p>The best available data are from a cohort study describing the frequency and outcome of laparoscopy in patients with chronic pelvic pain and/or pelvic mass who were later found to have ovarian remnants. In 119 patients with persistent cyclic or chronic pelvic pain after total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy who then underwent operative laparoscopy, an ovarian remnant was present in 26 (22 percent); during one to eight years of follow-up, one additional patient was found to have an ovarian remnant [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, this was a small study and the cohort represents only symptomatic participants.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29954694"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical factors that contribute to incomplete removal of the ovarian tissue at the time of oophorectomy increase the risk of ORS [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. These include factors that limit surgical exposure of the ovary or compromise surgical technique:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pelvic adhesions – They limit visualization of the ovary and may also cause it to adhere to surrounding tissues</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anatomic variations</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intraoperative bleeding</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poor surgical technique – This may include failure to achieve adequate exposure or restore adequate anatomy, or imprecise choice of incision site used to remove the ovary</p><p></p><p>Ovarian remnants are commonly encased in adhesions due to the preexisting conditions and prior surgeries [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Indeed, in the majority of the cases reported since 2007, endometriosis was the most common indication for the initial oophorectomy in patients who were subsequently diagnosed with ORS [<a href="#rid4">4,9,15,16,27</a>].</p><p>Factors and conditions that predispose to pelvic adhesions include: previous pelvic or abdominal surgery, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ruptured appendix, and inflammatory bowel disease. Endometriosis increases the risk for functional ovarian tissue being embedded into adjacent structures (eg, pelvic peritoneum), making complete excision challenging [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Incomplete removal of the ovarian tissue may also occur due to anatomic variations, such as patients in whom there is a retroperitoneal location of ovarian tissue or the sigmoid colon is attached at the pelvic brim overlying the infundibulopelvic ligament [<a href="#rid5">5,34,35</a>]; the left side has been reported to be the side most affected by ORS [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. This is likely because on the left side the sigmoid colon is frequently attached at the pelvic brim overlying the infundibulopelvic ligament, which may impede visualization and excision of the ovary.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H329798795"><span class="h1">PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most important approach to prevention of ORS is meticulous surgical technique at the time of oophorectomy, with adequate exposure, visualization, and margins around ovarian tissue. Based on the possibility of microscopic ovarian tissue, in our practice we achieve a ≥2 cm margin along the infundibulopelvic ligament from the grossly visible margin of the ovary.</p><p>In terms of surgical technique, if the ovarian pedicle is clamped or stapled too close to the ovary, there may be ovarian tissue that is not excised [<a href="#rid15">15,31</a>]. In some cases, this may be because the grossly visible border of ovarian tissue is misleading.</p><p>In a novel study, ovarian specimens were examined microscopically after oophorectomy, and in 8 of 58 ovaries, ovarian stroma was noted to extend into the infundibulopelvic ligament, beyond the grossly visible margin of the ovary (most were in the range of 0.2 to 0.8 cm; 1.4 cm in one ovary) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. This finding requires further study. It is uncertain whether the ovarian tissue identified was functional or had malignant potential.</p><p>Based upon these results, a 2 cm margin would be necessary to ensure complete excision of the ovary.</p><p>In our practice, we use the following approach to different types of procedures:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laparotomy or conventional or robotic laparoscopy</strong> – We enter the retroperitoneum at the level of the pelvic brim and isolate the infundibulopelvic ligament (IP) after clearly identifying the ureter. A window is made in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament immediately inferior to the IP and superior to the ureter. The IP can then be clamped, cut, and suture ligated or sealed and divided with a vessel-sealing device at least 2 cm proximal to the grossly visible ovarian margin. When the adnexa is involved with adhesions to the pelvic sidewall or underlying ureter, we mobilize and lateralize the ureter completely in order to avoid leaving behind any ovarian tissue.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vaginal approach</strong> – When adnexectomy is intended at the time of the vaginal hysterectomy, we use the round ligament technique  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98069" href="/d/graphic/98069.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) to remove the entire adnexa. That is, after the hysterectomy is performed, the utero-ovarian ligament is grasped gently in order to identify the round ligament, which is then transected with electrosurgery. Transection of the round ligament results in skeletonization of the IP, releases the adnexa from the pelvic side wall, and allows for safe placement of the Heaney clamp at least 2 cm proximal to the grossly visible ovarian margin.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29954706"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with ORS most commonly present with pelvic pain. Less frequently, it presents as a pelvic mass or the absence of menopausal symptoms after oophorectomy [<a href="#rid20">20,37</a>]. Other possible symptoms are consistent with endometriosis, including dyspareunia, urinary symptoms, or bowel symptoms [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. It is likely that some patients are asymptomatic, but the rate of this is unknown since the incidence of ORS is uncertain. (See <a class="local">'Incidence'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134970.html" rel="external">"Endometriosis: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>In terms of timing of presentation, most cases present with symptoms within the first five years of the oophorectomy, although there are reports of ORS presenting in patients 20 years after the initial surgery [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Some examples of clinical case scenarios that warrant further evaluation for ORS include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 38-year-old patient underwent abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) for severe endometriosis and now presents with right lower quadrant pain. Pelvic examination reveals tenderness on the right aspect of the vaginal cuff. Imaging confirms the presence of a 3 cm cystic mass. A serum follicle stimulating hormone level is in the premenopausal range.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 69-year-old patient underwent hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy and presents five years later with right-sided tenderness. Imaging reveals a 6 cm complex mass in the right adnexal region.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 40-year-old premenopausal patient with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with metastasis to the liver underwent BSO and is on single therapy <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8780" href="/d/drug information/8780.html" rel="external">anastrozole</a> [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Repeat positron emission tomography scan six months later reveals progression of the liver lesion and a new right adnexal mass.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H329799363"><span class="h2">Pelvic pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pelvic pain is the most common symptom of ORS and can present in a variety of ways [<a href="#rid4">4,9,15,16,27,28</a>]. In the largest cohort of patients (n = 186) who were surgically treated for ORS, presenting symptoms included: chronic pelvic pain (84 percent), dyspareunia (26 percent), cyclic pelvic pain (9 percent), dysuria (7 percent), and tenesmus (6 percent) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>In premenopausal patients, the mechanism of pelvic pain may be hormonal stimulation of endometriotic implants by remnant ovarian tissue. Other causes of pelvic pain in patients with ORS and previous endometriosis may include infiltration of nerves, or even local inflammatory processes [<a href="#rid13">13,18,28</a>].</p><p>In patients with or without endometriosis, pain may be caused by the expansion of a cystic structure with pressure on adjacent structures or in a confined, scarred tissue that does not allow for the natural expansion of ovarian follicles as occurs in the normal ovary.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H329799369"><span class="h2">Pelvic mass</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ORS may present as a pelvic mass, which may be accompanied by pain or be asymptomatic. This may be noted on pelvic examination or imaging. In a series of 186 patients, 57 percent had a pelvic mass [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. A pelvic mass may result in low back pain, constipation, or urinary retention. The mass may represent ovarian tissue that has developed a physiologic cyst, endometrioma, or other neoplasm.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H329799377"><span class="h2">Symptoms of persistent ovarian function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In premenopausal patients, ovarian remnant tissue may continue to be functional. Thus, the absence of typical menopausal symptoms after bilateral oophorectomy should raise clinical suspicion of ORS. The series of 186 patients cited above showed that 37 percent of patients did not exhibit menopausal symptoms such as vaginal dryness, hot flushes, and vasomotor symptoms despite the absence of estrogen replacement therapy immediately after BSO [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. In addition, these patients may continue to have menstrual symptoms, including molimina, uterine cramping, or cyclic vaginal bleeding (if the uterus is in place).</p><p>However, in premenopausal patients in whom unilateral oophorectomy is performed, pain symptoms alone often trigger the suspicion for ORS [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>In patients with breast cancer, progression of cancer may raise suspicion of ORS. Two case reports described progression of metastatic breast cancer disease and persistent premenopausal serum estradiol levels due to ORS in patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer and previous prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy [<a href="#rid38">38,39</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29954712"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An evaluation is prompted by a clinical suspicion of ORS in a patient who has undergone oophorectomy. Key findings in the evaluation are suggestive symptoms, the presence of a pelvic mass, and, in those who have undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, a serum follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol level consistent with persistent ovarian function [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H329797522"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The medical history should be elicited, including symptoms associated with ORS (see <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above). The history should include questions about pelvic pain before and after oophorectomy and associated diagnoses (eg, endometriosis). Risk factors for ovarian cancer should be assessed  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59585" href="/d/graphic/59585.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5490.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in nonpregnant adult females: Causes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83387.html" rel="external">"Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Incidence and risk factors", section on 'Probable risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>A history of oophorectomy is required, by definition, to make the diagnosis. The indication for oophorectomy should be obtained and the detailed procedure and pathology notes reviewed, if possible. Salient parts of the history include risk factors for poor surgical visualization, including prior abdominal or pelvic surgery and endometriosis.</p><p>The patient’s menopausal status at time of bilateral oophorectomy should be determined. Patients who may have functional remnant ovarian tissue (based on age younger than upper range of normal for menopause) should be asked about symptoms indicating persistent ovarian function (molimina symptoms, cyclic vaginal bleeding, absence of menopausal symptoms). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7395.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H329797529"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A complete pelvic examination should be performed. Focal areas of pelvic tenderness should be noted. If a pelvic mass is present, the size, mobility, and location should be documented. The key points of the examination are the same as for the examination of patients with pelvic pain or a pelvic mass. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83704.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5467.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Evaluation", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H329797535"><span class="h2">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with a history of bilateral oophorectomy, serum follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol levels consistent with persistent ovarian function support an initial clinical diagnosis of ORS and thus provide an indication for surgical exploration.</p><p>In a patient with a history of unilateral oophorectomy, laboratory evaluation is not helpful.</p><p>The goal of laboratory testing for ORS following bilateral oophorectomy is to test for <strong>any evidence</strong> of ovarian activity, rather than to confirm postmenopausal status. Hormone levels that are consistent with persistent ovarian function include [<a href="#rid29">29</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7395.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause", section on 'Posthysterectomy or endometrial ablation'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) &lt;30 UI/dL</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><strong>and/or</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum estradiol &gt;20 pg/mL</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the finding of menopausal levels of these hormones does <strong>not</strong> exclude the diagnosis, since ovarian function may have ceased in the residual ovarian tissue [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Pathologically confirmed ovarian remnant tissue has been noted in patients with menopausal hormone levels.</p><p>In addition, test results at a single point in time may be misleading. Often, patients with ORS have fluctuating levels of estradiol and FSH.

Estrogen replacement therapy should be discontinued for at least 10 days in these patients prior to testing.</p><p>In a series of 186 patients, 63 and 69 percent of patients with ORS had premenopausal levels of estradiol and FSH, respectively.

In the imaging methods, the mass may appear on the side of the previous salpingo-oophorectomy and most commonly contains debris-filled cysts [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

Stimulation of ovarian tissue may also allow for easier identification and removal at the time of surgery. In one study, provocation with clomiphene citrate was helpful in identifying the remnant tissue in three of four patients [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. A negative provocation test, however, does not exclude the diagnosis of ORS, because some anovulatory patients may fail to respond to the medication. In our practice, we only perform the clomiphene citrate test when there is a clinical suspicion of ORS and imaging is negative for any masses.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H757365252"><span class="h2">Surgical exploration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical exploration and biopsy of possible ovarian tissue is required for the definitive diagnosis of ORS, and treatment by excision of the remnant ovarian tissue may be performed during the same procedure  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98073" href="/d/graphic/98073.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The ovarian remnant is frequently located on the pelvic sidewall peritoneum near the angle of the vaginal vault and may be encased in dense and fibrotic scar tissue [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].

ORS is a histologic diagnosis, made based upon pathologic confirmation of remnant ovarian tissue obtained at the time of surgical exploration. For patients who are not candidates for surgery, a clinical diagnosis can be made based on the symptoms and upon a finding of premenopausal follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels following bilateral oophorectomy and/or imaging findings consistent with the presence of remnant ovarian tissue.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H329797345"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of ORS includes other conditions that present with pelvic pain or a pelvic mass in patients with a history of oophorectomy.</p><p>There are many etiologies of pelvic pain, and the patient's prior history helps to guide the differential diagnosis. In patients with pelvic pain prior to oophorectomy, it is difficult to distinguish persistent or recurrent pain from ORS from other etiologies. In patients with prior endometriosis, the pain from ORS may, in fact, be due to endometriotic implants. In patients with endometriosis with pelvic pain alone after oophorectomy, standard medical treatment should be given. If a pelvic mass is present, ORS should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis, and the surgical exploration is typically performed to diagnose and treat the etiology of the pain.</p><p>For patients with a new onset of pelvic pain after oophorectomy, postoperative complications should be investigated (eg, urinary tract or bowel injury, infection, abscess, hematoma, retained surgical material or instrument, adhesions). If these are not present, the likelihood of ORS versus other etiologies will depend upon whether the symptoms and findings are suggestive of ORS (ie, pelvic mass, findings consistent with continued ovarian function). The evaluation of acute and chronic pelvic pain are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5473.html" rel="external">"Acute pelvic pain in nonpregnant adult females: Evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5467.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a pelvic mass should be evaluated for potential malignancy. An ovarian remnant malignancy is often located in close association with the pelvic peritoneum and may resemble peritoneal carcinoma. Carcinoma in an ovarian remnant and peritoneal cancer both include malignant tissues consistent with ovarian carcinoma in the absence of an obvious ovary. However, in contrast to peritoneal carcinoma, an early stage malignancy in an ovarian remnant is unifocal and metastatic disease is not present [<a href="#rid18">18,27</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27733005"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical incision is the mainstay of treatment of ORS.

Surgical excision of all residual ovarian tissue is the gold standard treatment. Based on the limited available data, it appears to be effective for treating pelvic pain associated with ORS.
