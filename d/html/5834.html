This translates to a height that is below the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile.</p><p>The most common causes of short stature beyond the first year or two of life are familial (genetic) short stature and constitutional short stature (also known as constitutional delay of growth and puberty [CDGP]), which are normal nonpathologic variants of growth. These growth patterns often can be distinguished from one another, but some children have features of both.</p><p>This topic will review the diagnostic approach to children with short stature, beginning with a brief review of normal growth and development. The causes of short stature are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5832.html" rel="external">"Causes of short stature"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">NORMAL GROWTH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serial measurements of growth are an important parameter in monitoring the health of children. A normal pattern of growth usually suggests good general health, while growth that is slower than normal raises the possibility of an underlying subacute or chronic illness, including an endocrinologic cause of growth failure.</p><p>Statural growth is a continuous but not linear process. There are three phases of postnatal growth (infantile, childhood, and pubertal), each of which has a distinctive pattern [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The phases are similar for boys and girls, but the timing and pace of growth differ, particularly during puberty.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intrauterine</strong> – Size at birth is determined more by maternal nutrition and intrauterine and placental factors than by genetic makeup. Not all the genes that affect growth may be expressed at birth. As a result, the correlation coefficient between birth length and adult height is only 0.25 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infancy</strong> – During the first two years of life (infantile phase), linear growth initially is very rapid and gradually decelerates. Overall growth during this period is approximately 30 to 35 cm. The length (and weight) of premature infants must be corrected for gestational age, at least for the first year. However, growth is often accelerated during the second one-half of the first year in otherwise healthy children born early.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An infant's height curve often crosses percentile lines during the first 24 months of life as the growth moves away from the influences of the intrauterine environment and toward the child's genetic potential. As examples, infants born small because of placental or uterine constraint may move upwards across percentile curves ("channeling up"), whereas infants born large because of maternal-fetal overnutrition may cross downward across percentile curves ("channeling down"). After this adjustment period, the correlation between length at two years and adult height is 0.80 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Childhood</strong> – The childhood phase is characterized by linear growth at a relatively constant velocity, with some slowing in later childhood. Most children grow at the following rates (representing the 10<sup>th</sup> to 90<sup>th</sup> percentiles):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age two to four years – 5.5 to 9 cm/year (2.2 to 3.5 inches/year)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age four to six years – 5 to 8.5 cm/year (2 to 3.3 inches/year)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age six years to puberty:</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>4 to 6 cm/year for boys (1.6 to 2.4 inches/year)</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>4.5 to 6.5 cm/year for girls (1.8 to 2.6 inches/year)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adolescence</strong> – The pubertal phase is characterized by a growth spurt of 8 to 14 cm per year due to the synergistic effects of increasing gonadal steroids and growth hormone [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In girls, the pubertal growth spurt typically starts around age 10 but may start as early as age 8 for early maturing girls. In boys, the pubertal growth spurt typically starts around age 12 but may start as early as age 10 in early maturing boys [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p>The "rule of fives" incorporates these typical phases of growth and provides an estimate for normal height and height velocity (HV) in a given age group, as shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70382" href="/z/d/graphic/70382.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Actual height and HV in a healthy child can vary substantially around these approximations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H523440"><span class="h1">EVALUATION OF GROWTH</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3320063194"><span class="h2">Overview</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Goals</strong> – The goal of the evaluation of a child with short stature is to identify the subset of children with pathologic causes, such as Turner syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease or other underlying systemic disease, or hormonal abnormality. The evaluation also assesses the severity of the short stature and likely growth trajectory to facilitate decisions about intervention, if appropriate. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sequence of the evaluation</strong> – Evaluation of a child suspected of having short stature is guided by answering the following questions. Although the causes and clinical presentation of short stature vary by age group, the same questions are relevant for children of any age:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>How short is the child?</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Is the child's height velocity (HV) impaired?</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>What is the child's likely (predicted) adult height?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The answers to these questions guide a focused history and physical examination and, in some cases, laboratory evaluation to determine the cause(s) and appropriate management of the child with short stature  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94743" href="/z/d/graphic/94743.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical setting</strong> – Some components of the evaluation can reasonably be performed in the primary care setting, including initial interpretation of the growth chart and growth potential (based on measured heights of the child's parents), calculation of height velocity (HV), and initial laboratory screening for an underlying systemic or endocrine disease, if suspected based on symptoms. If HV is slow, then bone age determination should be performed, if expert interpretation is available. Other components of the evaluation, including review of the bone age results and the detailed evaluation for causes of short stature, are typically performed by a pediatric endocrinologist, if available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Referral patterns reveal substantial sex differences in the evaluation and treatment of children with short stature [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>]. Boys are referred for evaluation more often, at younger ages, and for less severe height deficits compared with girls. As an example, in one retrospective review of 288 children referred to a single center for assessment of short stature, the male:female ratio was 1.9:1 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. At the time of referral, the height deficit was significantly greater for girls than boys (median height Z-score -2.4 versus -1.9) and organic disease was more common among girls (40 versus 15 percent). Similarly, studies of growth hormone registries have shown preferential treatment of boys compared with girls with an approximate ratio of 2:1 [<a href="#rid6">6,7,9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This apparent sex bias may be due to underappreciation of growth problems in girls, leading to fewer evaluations of girls for short stature. Alternatively, it may be due to increased societal pressure for tall stature in boys, leading to increased referral and growth hormone treatment of boys without organic causes of short stature. These findings emphasize the need for accurate growth monitoring during the health care maintenance of all children to ensure appropriate referral and treatment.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Is the child short?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Accurate measurement of length or height is essential; inaccurate measurements or aberrant plotting is one of the more common causes of apparent growth failure. Length is measured lying down and should be used for infants and children up to 24 months of age  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132742" href="/z/d/graphic/132742.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>); height is measured standing and should be used for children two years and older (if possible)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56127" href="/z/d/graphic/56127.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Standard approach using height-for-age growth curves</strong> – The child's length or height should be plotted on the growth chart that is appropriate for the child's age and sex (children &lt;24 months  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67950 graphicRef80511" href="/z/d/graphic/67950.html" rel="external">figure 4A-B</a>); children two years and older  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63399 graphicRef77249" href="/z/d/graphic/63399.html" rel="external">figure 5A-B</a>)). Weight should also be measured to provide additional information about the child's nutritional status. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5356.html" rel="external">"Measurement of growth in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Percentiles and Z-scores can be calculated using a calculator for recumbent length (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/15631.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) or standing height for boys (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13413.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>) or for girls (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13416.html" rel="external">calculator 3</a>). For the purposes of an endocrine evaluation, short stature is defined as a length or height more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean (ie, a Z-score &lt;-2), which corresponds to a height that is &lt;2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Height above the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile (&gt;-2 SD) – These children generally do not require further specific evaluation unless there are additional reasons for concern, such as progressively decreasing height percentiles (implying growth failure), dysmorphic features, or evidence of underlying systemic disease, or if they are growing well below their genetic potential (eg, they are children of very tall parents).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Height below the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile (≤-2 SD) – These children have short stature and should undergo a more detailed evaluation, starting with evaluation of HV, as outlined in the following sections. The first steps of this evaluation usually can be performed in the primary care setting. Early referral to a specialist is appropriate if the HV is very slow.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Height less than the 1<sup>st</sup> percentile (≤-2.25 SD) – These children have extreme short stature and usually should be referred to an appropriate subspecialist for a detailed evaluation, where available. The first steps in the evaluation will be similar, but a higher index of suspicion for pathologic causes of growth faltering is appropriate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tanner stage adjusted (TSA) growth curves</strong> (for selected patients) – For children with late puberty for their age (including those whose puberty is delayed because of medical illness or puberty-suppressing therapy), use of standard height-for-age growth references may exaggerate the child's degree of short stature. For these children, growth potential may be more accurately assessed by using special TSA growth standards, which are captured in this <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftsaheight2020.shinyapps.io%2Ftsa_height_clinical_calc_plotter_2020%2F&amp;token=BvRsvcUcobYlrMbMrM5Y5fuTPBwiuMCZgnBpgtFNCjA8%2Fkp4U49Ge9twc20cxeFGhGzSwt%2BV8oendDxTC1IWhd2pgclNl6WgvhGwSZxXDfY%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=5834" target="_blank">online calculator</a> or by plotting the child's growth on a <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fosf.io%2Fmyur7%2F&amp;token=g1M57B2GlJQWtUWPO%2FJkQa%2BXkrAifeWC4rAQav4cxM8%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=5834" target="_blank">TSA-adjusted growth curve</a>, selected for their stage of pubertal development (sexual maturity rating) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Is the child's height velocity impaired?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Determination of the child's HV is an essential component of the evaluation of a child for short stature and can be considered a "vital sign"  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94743" href="/z/d/graphic/94743.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). This requires serial measurements of height, which should be done along with weight at each well-child visit. Serial measurements help to determine whether the child's HV is within the normal range and whether the child progressively deviates from their previous growth channel (or percentile curve). The HV should be calculated (in cm/year) using accurate measurements of height and an interval between measurements of at least six months. Plotting height and HV immediately after the measurement is taken on the child's growth chart is important because this may help identify a measurement error and permit remeasurement. The data can be easily plotted using the growth charts included in an electronic health record.</p><p>For children two years and older, <strong>growth failure is likely</strong> if:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The height-for-age curve has deviated downward across two major height percentile curves (eg, from above the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile to below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Or, if the child is growing slower than the following rates:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age two to four years – HV less than 5.5 cm/year (&lt;2.2 inches/year)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age four to six years – HV less than 5 cm/year (&lt;2 inches/year)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age six years to puberty:</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>HV less than 4 cm/year for boys (&lt;1.6 inches/year)</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>HV less than 4.5 cm/year for girls (&lt;1.8 inches/year)</p><p></p><p>Short children with HV <strong>above</strong> these cut points usually have a nonpathologic cause of short stature, such as familial short stature or constitutional delay of growth. For these children, a basic evaluation for short stature usually is sufficient, consisting of a focused history, physical examination, adult height prediction, and bone age determination, as outlined in the following sections [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Prediction of adult height'</a> below and <a class="local">'Bone age determination'</a> below.)</p><p>Short children with HV <strong>below</strong> these cut points are more likely to have a pathologic cause of short stature and warrant additional attention. In addition to the basic evaluation outlined above, laboratory screening for pathologic causes of growth failure is warranted. The clinician should be particularly alert for subtle symptoms of underlying systemic disease (eg, Crohn disease) and for evidence of Turner syndrome in girls [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. The detailed evaluation may be most appropriately performed by a pediatric endocrinologist, if available. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory and imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Short children with HV <strong>substantially below</strong> these cut points are most likely to have a pathologic cause of short stature and should undergo a detailed evaluation for pathologic causes of growth failure by a pediatric subspecialist, if available.</p><p>Alternatively, for a more precise assessment, the child's HV can be plotted on an HV chart  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96367 graphicRef96366" href="/z/d/graphic/96367.html" rel="external">figure 6A-B</a>) to determine the HV percentile (or SD [Z-score]) for the child's age and sex (note that this is different from the height-for-age percentile). In general, HV between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> percentile should raise concern for possible growth failure and an HV below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile warrants a thorough evaluation for growth failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H64002967"><span class="h2">Prediction of adult height</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adult height is determined by a combination of genetic potential and many other factors that influence somatic growth and biologic maturation. No method accurately predicts adult height, and there is wide variation in predicted adult height among the different methods. However, an estimate of adult height can be developed using information about heights in the biologic family, combined with information about the child's own growth and level of skeletal maturation. The results help to guide decisions about evaluation and treatment and also provide some information about the possible causes of short stature in a particular patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H114183513"><span class="h3">Is the child's growth within the range for the family?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The next step is to determine the height range expected for the child's biologic family and compare it with the child's growth trajectory. In most populations, a predicted adult height that is &lt;63 inches (160 cm) for males and &lt;59 inches (150 cm) for females is considered short stature, corresponding to more than 2 SD below the mean (&lt;2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile) for adults of the same population and sex.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Midparental height</strong> – An estimate of a child's genetic height potential can be obtained by calculation of the midparental height, which is based upon the heights of both parents and adjusted for the sex of the child  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94743" href="/z/d/graphic/94743.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). This estimate is also known as the "target height." Whenever possible, the biologic parents' heights should be directly measured rather than self-reported.

The methods used most commonly for determining skeletal age are the Greulich and Pyle Atlas [<a href="#rid18">18</a>] and the Tanner-Whitehouse 3 (TW3) method [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In general, TW3 is considered to be more accurate, based on studies in predominantly White European populations [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. However, bone ages obtained from these methods are less generalizable to other groups of children; Black or African American children tend to have advanced bone age, and Southeast Asian children tend to have delayed bone age, compared with their White peers [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p>The bone age determination informs estimates of the child's growth potential and likely adult height, as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delayed or advanced bone age is defined as a bone age that is 2 SD or more below or above the mean, respectively. This is approximately 20 percent below or above the chronologic age. This translates to a difference between bone age and chronologic age of approximately 12 months between 2 and 4 years of chronologic age, 18 months between 4 and 12 years, and 24 months after age 12  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94179 graphicRef94180" href="/z/d/graphic/94179.html" rel="external">figure 8A-B</a>). If the bone age is delayed or advanced near or beyond these parameters, then the projected height should be recalculated based on the bone age rather than the chronologic age. This will provide a more accurate assessment of projected height. As an example, if an eight-year-old boy is 117 cm tall and has a bone age of 6.5 years, this corresponds to the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile for chronologic age but to the 35<sup>th</sup> percentile for skeletal age, suggesting that the child may have constitutional delay of growth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The bone age can be used to predict the child's adult height. The technique developed by Bayley-Pinneau (BP) is most commonly used for children approximately six years and older [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. This technique employs a table to translate the child's bone age and chronologic age to a decimal fraction of adult height (eg, 0.75). To predict adult height, the present height is divided by the fraction of adult height.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other methods use different algorithms to predict adult height from height measurements and bone age data and include the TW3, Roche-Wainer-Thissen (RWT), and Khamis-Roche (KR) methods. RWT and KR incorporate midparental height in addition to bone age, and TW3 uses a skeletal maturity score. Comparison of these methods reveals a wide range of adult height predictions. Overall, the TW3 method (or the previous version, TW2) either underpredicts or overpredicts adult height in approximately 30 percent of individuals [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>], while the BP and RWT methods tend to overpredict adult height in boys [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The BP method is most likely to identify a short child as a candidate for growth hormone therapy [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Methods that incorporate bone age are generally more accurate in predicting adult height than the simple midparental height method. However, there is a wide variation in height prediction, and the same method may yield significantly different adult height predictions at different ages [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Investigational techniques include automated interpretation of radiographs [<a href="#rid28">28</a>], or use of quantitative ultrasound to assess bone age, which would have the advantage of avoiding ionizing radiation [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p>The results of the bone age determination also provide important information about possible causes of the short stature  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94743" href="/z/d/graphic/94743.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A significantly delayed bone age is consistent with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), which is considered a variant of normal growth. However, significantly delayed bone age is also seen in many types of pathologic growth failure, including nutritional deficiency, underlying systemic disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease), and growth hormone deficiency. The HV helps to distinguish among these categories: Children with CDGP tend to have normal or low-normal HV until they reach bone age of 11 years in girls or 13 years in boys. By contrast, children with underlying systemic or endocrine disease tend to have progressive decreases in HV. Children with significantly delayed bone age should undergo a focused history and physical examination to evaluate for symptoms and signs of systemic or endocrine disease (see <a class="local">'Additional evaluation for causes of short stature'</a> below).

However, a normal bone age is also seen in younger girls with Turner syndrome.

If the evaluation excluded familial short stature and constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) and did not identify a specific cause, they are considered to have ISS (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5832.html" rel="external">"Causes of short stature", section on 'Idiopathic short stature'</a>). Although ISS is generally considered a normal variant of growth, a subset of children has mild or subtle forms of a skeletal dysplasia.

This translates to a height that is below the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile. The clinical significance of the short stature depends on many factors, including genetic potential and changes in stature over time (height velocity [HV]). (See <a class="local">'Is the child short?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial evaluation</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Height velocity</strong> – Determination of the child's growth, or HV, is an essential component of the evaluation for short stature. For children two years and older, growth failure is suggested by a growth pattern that has deviated downward across two major height percentile curves or by growth slower than the following rates:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Age two to four years – HV less than 5.5 cm/year (&lt;2.2 inches/year)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Age four to six years – HV less than 5 cm/year (&lt;2 inches/year)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Age six years to puberty:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">HV less than 4 cm/year for boys (&lt;1.6 inches/year)</p><p class="bulletIndent3">HV less than 4.5 cm/year for girls (&lt;1.8 inches/year)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">(See <a class="local">'Is the child's height velocity impaired?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Height prediction</strong> – An estimate of a child's adult height potential can be obtained by calculation of the midparental height (target height), adjusted for the sex of the child (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13422.html" rel="external">calculator 4</a>). For males and females, 8.5 cm (3.3 inches) on either side of this calculated value represents the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 97<sup>th</sup> percentiles for anticipated adult height.

The bone age result can then be used to refine the estimate for the child's adult height and also informs the evaluation for possible causes of short stature. (See <a class="local">'Bone age determination'</a> above and <a class="local">'Laboratory and imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Further evaluation</strong> – Children with severe short stature (eg, height ≤-2.5 SD [0.6<sup>th</sup> percentile]) or growth failure should be further evaluated with a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin A (IgA), creatinine, electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). A karyotype or comparative genomic hybridization should be performed in all girls with unexplained short stature (to evaluate for Turner syndrome) and in short boys with associated genital abnormalities. Abnormal results of these tests and/or symptoms are signs that a disorder causing growth failure warrants further investigation.
