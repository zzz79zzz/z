Palliative care is applicable early in the course of terminal illness in conjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life; it is not limited to end-of-life care [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Palliative services, including setting patient-centered achievable goals for medical care and aggressive symptom management, should be routinely offered alongside curative and disease-modifying treatments for patients with serious illnesses (the simultaneous care model). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care", section on 'Rationale for palliative care'</a>.)</p><p>Palliative care has been best studied and implemented among patients with malignancy, and increasingly there is growing evidence of the many benefits of integration of palliative care for a variety of advanced illnesses. End-stage liver disease (ESLD) is a commonly reported cause of death in the United States and guidelines from professional societies highlight the importance of integrating palliative care principles in the care of these patients [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) have published guidance on integrating principles of palliative care for patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and our approach is well-aligned with the guidance statements [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Palliative care issues in adult patients with ESLD will be reviewed here. An overview of the benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care is provided elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2947572165"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS, CLINICAL COURSE, AND CAUSES OF DEATH</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4106125990"><span class="h2">Cirrhosis versus end-stage liver disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cirrhosis represents the irreversible late stage of chronic progressive liver disease; it is characterized by the distortion of hepatic architecture and the formation of regenerative nodules. Patients with cirrhosis who have not developed major complications are classified as having compensated cirrhosis. Patients who have developed complications of cirrhosis, such as variceal hemorrhage, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatorenal syndrome, or hepatopulmonary syndrome, are considered to have decompensated cirrhosis. These complications are the primary causes of death in ESLD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1263.html" rel="external">"Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>The term "end-stage liver disease" is synonymous with advanced liver disease, liver failure, and decompensated cirrhosis, given the general irreversibility of these conditions [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. However, in contrast to other terminal illnesses, liver transplantation can potentially be a definitive curative treatment for irreversible liver disease. While liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for patients with decompensated cirrhosis (and for patients who develop HCC in the setting of cirrhosis as long as they meet criteria for listing), many are not candidates for transplantation because of clinical and social factors. Furthermore, the number of patients who qualify for transplantation is greater than the availability of donor organs. Because of wait times for organ transplantation, a significant minority of patients on a transplant waitlist die annually [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Among adults on the liver transplantation waiting list between 2016 and 2018, 9 percent of patients died, and 23 percent were removed from the list within three years of follow-up. Thus, even with the hope of transplant, some patients with decompensated cirrhosis will die as a result of their underlying illness [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. It may seem counterintuitive to integrate palliative care for patients considered for transplant because of the potential for cure; however, the potential for adverse outcomes and significant symptom burden is also high. Therefore, it is appropriate to initiate palliative care, even while recognizing the possibility of long-term survival [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1263.html" rel="external">"Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis", section on 'Liver transplantation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4585.html" rel="external">"Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2476.html" rel="external">"Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2490.html" rel="external">"Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3336011931"><span class="h2">Disease trajectory and estimating prognosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prognosis of cirrhosis is highly variable since it is influenced by a number of factors, including etiology, severity, type of and severity of complications, and comorbid disease. Patients with compensated cirrhosis have a median survival that may extend beyond 12 years. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis have a worse prognosis than do those with compensated cirrhosis; the average survival without transplantation is approximately two years [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. The trajectory of functional decline in patients with decompensated cirrhosis may be erratic and unpredictable, and many patients are in a constant state of poor or declining health interspersed by intermittent exacerbations and hospitalizations [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Death may be relatively sudden and unexpected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1263.html" rel="external">"Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>In general, the degree of hepatic decompensation is an important determinant of prognosis. Multiple studies have attempted to predict the prognosis based upon clinical and laboratory assessment of liver function. Two commonly used models are the Child-Pugh classification and the Model for End-Stage Liver disease (MELD) score. </p><p>An important point is that, although these predictive models are useful for predicting long-term outcomes in ESLD and guiding treatment decisions, they do not always align with the patient's reported functional status and sense of well-being.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2820597767"><span class="h3">Child-Pugh classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Child-Pugh classification  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401" href="/z/d/graphic/78401.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) was initially developed to assess the risk of non-shunt operations in patients with cirrhosis (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/15639.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a> and <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/15638.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. </p><p>The Child-Pugh classification system correlates with survival in patients with cirrhosis; one-year survival rates for patients with Child-Pugh class A, B, and C cirrhosis are approximately 100, 80, and 45 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid14">14,17,18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1263.html" rel="external">"Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis", section on 'Child-Pugh classification'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2109463884"><span class="h3">MELD score</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Another model to predict prognosis in patients with cirrhosis is the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which was originally designed to predict 90-day mortality in those undergoing placement of a portosystemic shunt. The MELD score is based upon bilirubin levels, creatinine, the international normalized ratio (INR; a measure of hepatic synthetic function), and sodium level. The MELD 3.0 score also incorporates albumin and sex [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The MELD score has been adopted for use in prioritizing patients awaiting liver transplantation and has an expanding role in predicting outcomes in patients with liver disease in the non-transplantation setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1241.html" rel="external">"Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)"</a>.)</p><p>The utility of the MELD score for predicting mortality among patients awaiting liver transplantation was demonstrated in a study that included 3437 adult liver transplantation candidates who were listed between 1999 and 2001 [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Of these, 412 died during the three-month follow-up period. Waiting list mortality was directly proportional to the MELD score at the time of listing, with mortality being 1.9 percent for patients with MELD scores less than 9, and 71 percent for patients with MELD scores ≥40  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77732" href="/z/d/graphic/77732.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). A table using MELD scores to predict 3, 6, 12, and 24-month survival is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109535" href="/z/d/graphic/109535.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p>The utility of these predictive models in estimating prognosis among patients with decompensated cirrhosis is illustrated by a systematic review that found that the median survival was ≤6 months in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and a Child-Pugh score ≥12 or a MELD score ≥21 [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In addition, patients with decompensated cirrhosis who had been hospitalized with an acute liver-related illness (eg, variceal hemorrhage or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) had a median survival of ≤6 months if the Child-Pugh score was ≥12 or the MELD score was ≥18. Patients with ESLD who have an estimated survival of six months or less may be eligible for hospice care, particularly if they are not candidates for transplantation. (See <a class="local">'Considerations for end-of-life care and hospice referral'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2078539183"><span class="h3">Other important prognostic variables</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The presence of hepatorenal syndrome or kidney failure due to acute tubular necrosis in patients with cirrhosis is a particularly poor prognostic indicator, with 90-day mortality approaching 60 percent [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1263.html" rel="external">"Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis", section on 'Major complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2308.html" rel="external">"Hepatorenal syndrome"</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with ESLD, variceal bleeding has a very high mortality rate, whether or not hemostasis is achieved [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1263.html" rel="external">"Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis", section on 'Variceal hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p>Other factors associated with poor survival in patients with decompensated cirrhosis have included hepatopulmonary syndrome, intensive care unit admission for complications of liver disease with hypotension requiring pressor support, hyponatremia [<a href="#rid26">26</a>], or jaundice. Sarcopenia and frailty have also been associated with morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1263.html" rel="external">"Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2326.html" rel="external">"Hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis"</a>.) </p><p>Additionally, data have suggested that a prognostic score that is based on performance status may be used to assess risk of hospitalization or mortality in patients with cirrhosis [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3511167974"><span class="h1">USE AND BENEFITS OF PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patents with serious illness, including ESLD, the primary goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life for the patient and their family through relief of emotional distress and physical symptoms. Ideally, palliative care should be provided throughout the trajectory of illness, beginning with the diagnosis of ESLD. Relief of emotional distress and physical symptoms can be provided by primary care physicians and gastrointestinal and hepatology specialists (termed primary palliative care, to distinguish it from secondary or subspecialty palliative care). Ideal timing of subspecialty palliative care consultation depends on local resources and patient need. (See <a class="local">'What is the difference between primary and secondary (subspecialty) palliative care?'</a> below and <a class="local">'Indications for a specialty palliative care consultation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2268346623"><span class="h2">What is the difference between palliative care and hospice?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While hospice and palliative care share the same principles of providing comfort and support for patients, palliative care differs from hospice care. In the United States, the term hospice is used to describe a model of palliative care that is offered to patients with a terminal disease who are at the end of life (generally with an estimated life expectancy of six months or less) when curative or life-prolonging therapy is no longer the focus of treatment. In contrast, palliative care should be appropriately offered to patients at any time along the trajectory of any type of serious illness, even concurrent with restorative, life-prolonging therapies. While all care that is delivered by hospice programs can be considered palliative care, not all palliative care is considered to be hospice care.</p><p>Eligibility for hospice care generally requires that a physician estimate that life expectancy is six months or less. Estimating prognosis in ESLD is discussed above, and disease-specific criteria for hospice referral for patients with ESLD, as well as non-disease specific criteria are outlined in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106152" href="/z/d/graphic/106152.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87321" href="/z/d/graphic/87321.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) and discussed in more detail below. (See <a class="local">'Disease trajectory and estimating prognosis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Considerations for end-of-life care and hospice referral'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1188404935"><span class="h2">What is the difference between primary and secondary (subspecialty) palliative care?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hospice and Palliative Medicine is now recognized as a medical subspecialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties, as well as in Canada, England, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and many other countries. In most jurisdictions, specialty palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team of specially trained physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and other specialists with advanced training in palliative care, who work with a patient's other clinicians to provide an "extra layer" of support. Clinicians who are specifically trained in palliative care can provide in-depth pain and symptom management, communication regarding goals of care, and help to integrate goals and values into care plans across settings and over time. Subspecialty palliative care services are most available in resource-abundant countries in the inpatient setting, as exemplified by the United States. The availability of subspecialty palliative care services in resource-limited countries is generally limited [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Subspecialty palliative care may be delivered in a number of settings across the continuum of health care, including in the home, nursing homes, long-term acute care facilities, acute care hospitals, and outpatient clinics [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Moreover, palliative care can also include bereavement care for family and loved ones following the death of the patient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86758.html" rel="external">"Palliative care and hospice outside of the United States"</a>.)</p><p>In order for the large number of patients with serious illness to benefit from palliative care, it is important that supportive services not only be provided by specialists but also be incorporated into the practices of all clinicians who are caring for persons with serious and complex illness, such as ESLD [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Some term this "primary" palliative care to distinguish it from "secondary" or "subspecialty" palliative care [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Primary palliative care encompasses any type of supportive care that is delivered by all health care professionals caring for patients with serious illness. Clinicians caring for these patients need to attain competence in providing comprehensive supportive care, including initiating and carrying out advance care planning (ACP), assessing and addressing symptoms, recognizing distress, and the appropriate referral for issues not adequately addressed by the primary care or subspecialist non-palliative-care clinician  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107897" href="/z/d/graphic/107897.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106790.html" rel="external">"Primary palliative care"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3299705176"><span class="h2">Palliative care in ESLD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ESLD has become a focus of palliative care research, and best practices for the role of palliative care in ESLD and for those patients who are listed for transplant are being defined. </p><p>It is well recognized that patients with ESLD have a profound level of discomfort and often have substantial suffering. Complications of chronic liver disease compromise health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which worsens as disease severity increases [<a href="#rid34">34-37</a>]. Over two decades ago, the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) study demonstrated that patients with ESLD have rates of moderate to severe pain toward the end of life that are similar to those of patients with lung or colorectal cancer [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Most patients in this study expressed a preference for dying rather than living in a coma or on prolonged life support, suggesting the importance of understanding patients' preferences for care, especially for end of life approaches. Other studies have confirmed the high rate of pain and other symptoms in cohorts of patients with ESLD [<a href="#rid39">39-41</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, even patients listed for liver transplantation experience significant functional decline while awaiting a donor organ [<a href="#rid42">42</a>], and they have high rates of both physical and psychological suffering [<a href="#rid35">35-37</a>]. Many people die while awaiting transplant. The system for organ allocation, which is based upon the severity of the underlying liver disease, has left many patients in a sort of limbo, which has been described as "too well for transplant but too sick for life" [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Judicious application of the tenets of palliative care can help to bridge this gap.

Placement of an indwelling pleural catheter may be an alternative, particularly for patients who prefer to have symptoms managed at home on hospice services [<a href="#rid88">88-90</a>]. However, use of an indwelling catheter may be limited due to infection risk.

This information is used to guide health care choices in the context of care that is medically reasonable and appropriate. In an ideal ACP discussion, the clinicians, patient, and his or her loved ones think through particular approaches to follow if (or when) the patient's health progressively declines and plan for managing a potential episode of acute decompensation. This process is iterative and typically occurs longitudinally within the context of an existing and continuing medical relationship. Studies suggest that ACP is underutilized, especially in the context of transplant [<a href="#rid61">61,92,93</a>]. General issues of ACP are discussed separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86248.html" rel="external">"Advance care planning and advance directives"</a>). For patients with ESLD, ACP can facilitate decisions around end-of-life care that reflect a patient's goals and values [<a href="#rid94">94</a>]. </p><p>However, there are several challenges to ACP in ESLD:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A common symptom of ESLD, encephalopathy, may limit a patient's decision-making capacity at times during illness, making early planning, including identification of a surrogate decision maker and conversations with this individual, important. If this does not happen, many surrogate decision makers have difficulty predicting what their loved would want in future circumstances; they may incorrectly predict a patient's treatment preferences. It is critical to establish goals of care and ACP at a time when cognitive function is intact. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86248.html" rel="external">"Advance care planning and advance directives", section on 'Surrogate decision-makers'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of social support, substance use disorder, and caregiver burden are prevalent in this population, which can lead to challenges with communication and care planning [<a href="#rid55">55,74,82,95</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consideration of transplant should be an indicator for ACP given the high risk of death, despite hope for cure, which may seem counterintuitive for some physicians.

Based upon data from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), most patients and their families find these discussions to be less stressful and prefer to have these conversations in a stable medical state when they are able to make clear decisions [<a href="#rid96">96</a>]. Having these discussions early in the disease trajectory will make it easier to return to these discussions at a later time, if needed [<a href="#rid97">97,98</a>].</p><p>Because of the possibility of transplantation, a subset of patients pursue curative efforts until the end of life; palliative and/or hospice care frequently is not provided or suggested until the hope of recovery or transplantation is extinguished, which is often in the last weeks of life. Because of this, patients with ESLD are more likely than those without chronic liver disease to receive aggressive care despite declining poor health, and lower quality end-of-life care [<a href="#rid39">39,51,99</a>]. Although it may seem counterintuitive, consideration of transplantation should be an indicator for ACP given the high risk of death, despite hope for a cure. In this setting, discussions should include preparing the patent and family for a range of potential outcomes, including a drastic decline and/or the development of complications that eliminate the patient as a transplant candidate, or the patient undergoing a transplant and then dying of complications related to the procedure.</p><p>Discussions about ACP should be patient centered and sensitive, balancing hope with reality. Eliciting information about the patient's perception of the impact of the disease in their life, disease severity, and prognosis will guide the clinician in achieving this balance. Sensitivity to the individual patient's response to a discussion of these issues is essential due to the broad variation in patient responses. Discussions about prognosis and the process of dying can be especially difficult. Issues related to communication of prognosis in patients with serious illness and practical guidance for discussing prognosis are addressed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83706.html" rel="external">"Communication of prognosis in palliative care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95284.html" rel="external">"Discussing serious news"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3674109"><span class="h2">Considerations for end-of-life care and hospice referral</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hospice care is a model and philosophy of care that focuses on palliating a terminally ill patient's pain and other symptoms and attending to their and their family's emotional and spiritual needs. At least in the United States for the Medicare hospice benefit, hospice eligibility is restricted to patients who have an estimated survival of six months or less. Medicare guidelines for hospice eligibility among patients with ESLD are outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106152" href="/z/d/graphic/106152.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). A separate table that includes non-disease-specific guidelines for determining appropriateness for hospice referral in the United States Medicare program is also provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87321" href="/z/d/graphic/87321.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p>A systematic review of non-cancer conditions suggested that a median six-month prognosis could be expected in ESLD or decompensated cirrhosis when the Child-Pugh score was at least 12 and/or the MELD score was at least 21 [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Disease trajectory and estimating prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Additionally, consensus-based quality indicators by a multidisciplinary expert panel for palliative care in ESLD due to cirrhosis suggest a referral for palliative/hospice services if a patient has advanced ESLD and hepatocellular carcinoma with either a Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage D tumor or hepatorenal syndrome and is not a candidate for transplant [<a href="#rid100">100</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2476.html" rel="external">"Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma"</a>.)</p><p>Outside of the United States, availability of hospice care is variable, and criteria for hospice eligibility have not been established. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86758.html" rel="external">"Palliative care and hospice outside of the United States"</a>.)</p><p>The available data suggest that only a minority of individuals with ESLD are enrolled in hospice and that the median length of time spent in hospice care is short (median nine days in one report of hospitalized Medicare patients with ESLD [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]).</p><p>One limitation for this population, at least in the United States, is that hospice enrollment is not widely available for patients who are pursuing potentially curative therapy, such as a liver transplant. Providing hospice care for patients awaiting transplant was the topic of a pilot study that showed that concurrent hospice care with transplant candidacy was feasible with specifically trained staff [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. Of the 157 patents with ESLD admitted to hospice, 122 died while awaiting a transplant; the average MELD score was 21 at admission, and almost all patients with a MELD score above 18 died within several months. The mean length of stay was 38 days. Only six (5 percent) of the listed patients went on to a successful liver transplant.</p><p>Despite this positive experience, the hospice philosophy (in the United States and elsewhere [<a href="#rid101">101</a>]) remains generally aligned with patients whose goals are primarily focused on comfort at the end of life. For this reason, clarification of transplant status is often an important issue to inform decision-making.

While liver transplantation is a potentially viable and curative treatment option, many are not candidates because of clinical or social factors, comorbidity, or in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma, disease extent. Even with the hope of transplant, most patients with decompensated cirrhosis will die of this condition. (See <a class="local">'Definitions, clinical course, and causes of death'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Disease trajectory</strong> – The prognosis of cirrhosis is highly variable. The trajectory of functional decline in patients with ESLD may be erratic and unpredictable, and many patients are in a constant state of poor or declining health interspersed by intermittent exacerbations and hospitalizations. Death may be sudden and unexpected. (See <a class="local">'Disease trajectory and estimating prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In general, the degree of hepatic decompensation, as reflected by the Child-Pugh classification or the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, is an important determinant of prognosis. Although predictive models such as these are useful for predicting long-term outcomes in ESLD and guiding treatment decisions, they do not always align with the patient's reported functional status and sense of well-being, and they should not be used in isolation for determining eligibility for palliative or hospice care. (See <a class="local">'Child-Pugh classification'</a> above and <a class="local">'MELD score'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Providing palliative care</strong> – In our view, palliative care should be provided throughout the trajectory of illness, beginning with the diagnosis of ESLD, but much of this supportive care can be provided by primary care clinicians and gastrointestinal and hepatology specialists. Ideal timing of specialty palliative care consultation depends on local resources and patient need. An important point is that an increasing number of studies in patients with advanced cancer have suggested that earlier involvement leads to better patient outcomes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care", section on 'Rationale for palliative care'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Important components of palliative care include exploring the patient's understanding about their illness and prognosis, assessing and managing symptoms, soliciting and discussing goals of care and advance care planning, integrating goals and values into the care plan, and helping to plan end-of-life care, including determining the need for and timing of hospice care  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109553" href="/z/d/graphic/109553.html" rel="external">table 8</a>). (See <a class="local">'What are the important components of palliative care in ESLD?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Considerations for end-of-life care and hospice referral</strong> – Hospice can provide an extra layer of support for patients with ESLD and their caregivers when prognosis is estimated to be six months or less. It is noted that some pilot work using hospice concurrently with transplant candidacy has been done, but this is not widely available, and generally, the hospice philosophy is aligned with patients whose goals are primarily focused on comfort at the end of life. For this reason, clarification of transplant status is often an important issue to inform decision-making. (See <a class="local">'Considerations for end-of-life care and hospice referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Managing symptoms</strong> – Most symptoms of ESLD are best managed by following the tenets of high-quality cirrhosis care.
