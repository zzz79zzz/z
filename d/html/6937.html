In particular the development of checkpoint inhibitors has dramatically changed how many cancers are treated, although questions still remain as to the biomarkers that best predict benefit from these agents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99637.html" rel="external">"Principles of cancer immunotherapy", section on 'Predictors of response to immune-based therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The benefits of immunotherapy have been difficult to demonstrate in conventional prostate adenocarcinoma, which is generally considered to have an immunologically "cold" microenvironment. Nevertheless, in 2010, the therapeutic vaccine <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9916" href="/d/drug information/9916.html" rel="external">sipuleucel-T</a> was approved for males with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), becoming the first (and still only) autologous cellular therapeutic vaccine to be approved for any solid tumor. However, the modest benefits and substantial cost of this treatment have hampered widespread uptake. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no other approved immunotherapies specifically for advanced CRPC. Results from immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, which has been so successful in other solid tumors, have been disappointing in prostate cancer, with limited response rates in unselected patients. The sole exception is those few patients whose tumors are characterized as having a high mutational load because of deficient deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair. (See <a class="local">'Deficient mismatch repair'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will review the rationale for immunotherapy in the context of advanced prostate cancer, discuss approved agents and indications, discuss what is known about individuals who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy, and briefly explore clinical trial data of investigational therapies that offer clinical insights for future approaches A general discussion of the principles of immunotherapy is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99637.html" rel="external">"Principles of cancer immunotherapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1957137154"><span class="h1">IMMUNOBIOLOGY OF PROSTATE CANCER AND RATIONALE FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer therapy are based on the premise that the body's own immune system plays a key role in the surveillance and eradication of malignancy, that tumors evolve ways to elude the immune system so that they can continue to grow and metastasize, and that the mechanisms that underlie this immune tolerance can be circumvented for therapeutic benefit. Cancer progression is often fueled by a preponderance of genetic aberrations, including mutations, that can lead to newly expressed peptides (sometimes called "neoantigens") that are entirely absent from normal noncancer human tissues, or to peptides that are expressed at a higher level in tumors but may be present at a lower level in normal cells (eg, tumor associated antigens such as prostatic acid phosphatase). Tumor cells that contain antigens such as these may be seen by the body's immune system as not normal or "non-self", and as such, they can be recognized by the immune system and killed.</p><p>Chen and Mellman's concept of the cancer immunity cycle is useful in understanding the immunobiology of prostate cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138503" href="/d/graphic/138503.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The generation of immunity to cancer is a cyclical process that can be self-propagating, leading to an accumulation of immune-stimulatory factors that, in principle, should amplify and broaden the in vivo immune response. There are two key cells in this immune process: the antigen-presenting cell (APC; eg, macrophage or dendritic cell) and the T cell.</p><p>Briefly, tumor cells that die get taken up by APCs. These cells fill the role of both clearing garbage and raising the alarm to other cells in the immune system if there are antigens present (eg, multiple mutations, functioning as "neoantigens") that should not be present (ie, they are "non-self"). To do this, these APCs travel to the draining lymph nodes and interact with T cells, where the tumor antigens are processed by chopping them into 7 to 15 amino acid residues that are then bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, and this complex is then transported to the cell surface where it can signal other T cells. The appropriately presented MHC-peptide complex on the APC binds to a T cell receptor, leading to activation of that T cell. Once activated, the T cell can undergo division, making additional copies of itself, all of which can bind the specific target that was presented to the T cell, and these cells can travel to any site in the body. Once they reach the area of the tumor, they can identify the tumor using the same MHC-peptide recognition method. Most cells in the body have MHC molecules, allowing T cells to interact with them. Upon recognition, and in the presence of costimulatory signals, the T cell can kill the cell by releasing granzymes or perforin that can puncture the tumor cell membrane, causing the tumor cell to die. The T cell then can move on searching for more tumor cells.</p><p>This costimulatory process is tightly regulated by both "agonist" molecules which stimulate the immune response, and inhibitory signals on both the APC and T cells, often collectively referred to as "immune checkpoint" molecules, which function as a physiologic brake on unrestrained cytotoxic T effector function. Examples of co-inhibitory or "immune checkpoint" molecules include cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). These immune checkpoints exist to dampen the immune response in order to protect against detrimental inflammation and autoimmunity, and in the setting of malignancy, such immune checkpoints can result in immune tolerance to the tumor allowing evasion of the immune response and progression of the malignancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99637.html" rel="external">"Principles of cancer immunotherapy", section on 'The "immune synapse"'</a>.)</p><p>Inhibition of these checkpoints using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs,  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130841" href="/d/graphic/130841.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)), which "releases the brake," on the immune response to the non-self antigens, restoring cytotoxic T effector function, might be expected to halt tumor progression. Although use of these agents has dramatically changed how many cancers such as melanoma, renal cell cancer, lung cancer, and advanced esophagogastric cancer are treated, not all patients benefit, and questions still remain as to the biomarkers that best predict benefit. In many tumors, benefit is independent of biomarker status, while in some (eg, esophagogastric, non-small cell lung, head and neck squamous cell cancers), benefit seems most pronounced among those with high levels of expression of the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15863.html" rel="external">"Systemic treatment of metastatic melanoma lacking a BRAF mutation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2984.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy of advanced clear cell renal carcinoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90312.html" rel="external">"Initial management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer lacking a driver mutation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4633.html" rel="external">"Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management", section on 'Rationale for addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2473.html" rel="external">"Initial systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer", section on 'Immunotherapy-based regimens'</a>.)</p><p>Immunotherapies such as ICIs have been less successful for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Although prostate cancer cells express a number of tumor-associated antigens that can serve as targets for immunotherapy, prostate cancer is generally considered as having a "cold" immune microenvironment, characterized by T cell exclusion (especially CD8+ T cells), a relatively low neoantigen load, and a relatively high immunosuppressive microenvironment, which includes a high proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells [<a href="#rid2">2-7</a>]. The limited presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes suggests a scant adaptive immune response against tumor cells. Moreover, prostate cancer tumor cells (particularly those that are castration-resistant) frequently present with phosphatase and tensin homolog (<em>PTEN</em>) loss, which may interact with the interferon-1 pathway, a pivotal step in the immune process, leading to its dysfunction, and immunosuppression [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. These many factors can thwart a tumor-directed immune response, leading to a state of immune tolerance, or anergy. The poor in vivo immune response to prostate cancer has been attributed to decreased immunogenicity of the tumor-associated antigens and/or blunted effectiveness of the immune response mounted against them. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99637.html" rel="external">"Principles of cancer immunotherapy", section on 'Tumor evasion of immune surveillance'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1088811455"><span class="h1">CURRENT STATUS OF IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the limited immune response to prostate cancer in vivo, it is not surprising that immunotherapeutic approaches that have been so successfully applied to other solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors [ICIs], chimeric antigen receptor [CAR]-T cells) have not shown comparable clinical efficacy in unselected prostate cancers, although clinical studies of many of these therapies are ongoing. (See <a class="local">'Other patients'</a> below and <a class="local">'CAR-T cells'</a> below.)</p><p>There are some notable exceptions, and at least three approved immunotherapy treatments for metastatic CRPC (ie, advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to first-line hormone therapy, typically androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Therapeutic vaccines use varying types of antigens, and accompanying immune adjuvants to influence an adaptive in vivo immune response.

This approval for males with metastatic CRPC was based upon a four-month improvement in median overall survival (OS) in randomized trials conducted in males with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic disease, albeit with little evidence of objective antitumor activity. Notably, other therapeutic vaccines have not been successful at improving outcomes in advanced metastatic CRPC. (See <a class="local">'Therapeutic vaccination with Sipuleucel-T'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other vaccines'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A subset of particularly aggressive prostate cancers, including those with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) genes, or defective homologous recombination DNA repair genes (eg, alterations in cyclin-dependent kinase [CDK]-12) have been variably associated with higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and neoantigen load, and an increase in T-cell related transcripts within the tumor, which may reflect enhanced antitumor immunity, and potential benefit from ICIs [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Two ICIs, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96957" href="/d/drug information/96957.html" rel="external">pembrolizumab</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="131441" href="/d/drug information/131441.html" rel="external">dostarlimab</a>, have received a "tissue agnostic" or "pan-cancer" approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of refractory solid tumors (including prostate cancer) with no other satisfactory treatment alternatives that have dMMR (or, in the case of pembrolizumab, a high level of TMB). Unfortunately, dMMR/high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and high TMB are relatively uncommon in prostate cancer. Furthermore, the available data supporting efficacy in metastatic CRPC are very limited. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In contrast to dMMR and high TMB, whether ICIs targeting the PD-1 pathway are clinically useful for treatment of other advanced prostate cancers (ie, unselected patients or those with high levels of PD-L1 expression) is unclear.

The treatment landscape for metastatic CRPC has expanded significantly over the past decade with multiple agents, all given in conjunction with continued ADT, demonstrating improved OS in phase III trials  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127197" href="/d/graphic/127197.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). One of these options is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9916" href="/d/drug information/9916.html" rel="external">sipuleucel-T</a>. However, there are no trials comparing sipuleucel-T with other systemic approaches which include cytotoxic chemotherapy, androgen receptor targeted therapies, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="89425" href="/d/drug information/89425.html" rel="external">radium-223</a> (which is typically reserved for those with symptomatic bone metastases without visceral metastases), radioligand therapy (which is typically reserved for those with prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive tumors), or poly ADP-ribose phosphate (PARP) inhibitors (for those with a deficiency in a gene associated with DNA homologous recombination repair). The choice is dependent on prior treatments, disease status, and anticipated treatment-related toxicity. In general, sipuleucel-T is reserved for patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic slowly progressive metastatic CRPC who do not have visceral (especially hepatic) metastasis or cancer pain requiring opioids, but even in this population, other treatments may also be appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The optimal way to integrate ICI therapy for patients with dMMR/high TMB CRPC is also not clear. The FDA "tissue agnostic" approval covered a variety of advanced solid tumors other than colorectal cancer that had MSI-H or dMMR, that had progressed following prior treatment, and for which there were no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This position is interpreted variably by clinicians caring for patients with advanced metastatic CRPC.

Although most of the mismatch repair (MMR) defects identified in metastatic CRPC are somatic mutations (tumoral) and not inherited (germline), the standard should be combined tumor (somatic) and germline genomic testing to maximize the detection of potentially actionable mutations. (See <a class="local">'Mechanism of benefit and prevalence of actionable findings'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120646.html" rel="external">"Tissue-agnostic cancer therapy: DNA mismatch repair deficiency, tumor mutational burden, and response to immune checkpoint blockade in solid tumors", section on 'Approach to testing dMMR as a predictive marker'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112282.html" rel="external">"Genetic risk factors for prostate cancer", section on 'Who needs referral for genetic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3677831228"><span class="h1">THERAPEUTIC VACCINATION WITH SIPULEUCEL-T</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4248593909"><span class="h2">Definition, mechanism of benefit</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9916" href="/d/drug information/9916.html" rel="external">Sipuleucel-T</a> is a therapeutic vaccine that is prepared from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained by leukapheresis, and pulsed ex vivo with a unique fusion protein of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), termed PA2024. Theoretically, GM-CSF fosters maturation of dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to present PAP to the patient's T cells, which then recognize the PAP, and this results in PAP-specific T-cell proliferation which then targets the PAP-expressing prostate cancer cells for killing. Both antibody (humoral) and cellular responses are reported, and the peripheral immune responses to PAP correlate with overall survival (OS), as do measures of APC activation [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. However, the mechanism of benefit is not completely understood. In the pivotal phase III study, the degree of PAP-specific T cell proliferation at week 6 did not correlate with survival, raising the possibility that additional immunologic mechanisms might explain this survival benefit. (See <a class="local">'Monotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>One possibility is a direct local immune effect of systemically administered <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9916" href="/d/drug information/9916.html" rel="external">sipuleucel-T</a> on prostatic tissue. This was suggested in a clinical trial in which 42 patients with untreated localized prostate cancer who received sipuleucel-T prior to prostatectomy, in whom there was a more than threefold increase in T cells that travelled to the tumor microenvironment (comparing pre-biopsies with prostatectomy specimens) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Interestingly, this was observed at the tumor normal interface and not within the tumor itself. Furthermore, the magnitude of the circulating immune response did not directly correlate with T cell infiltration within the prostate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2606843724"><span class="h2">Preparation, dosing, and administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The individual leukapheresis product is sent to a central manufacturing facility where the APCs are enriched and pulsed with the GM-CSF/PAP fusion protein.

One well-characterized checkpoint being targeted in several tumor types is programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). PD-1 is upregulated on activated T cells, and upon recognition of tumor via the T cell receptor, PD-1 engagement by programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed by tumor or other immune cells infiltrating the tumor tissue can lead to T cell inactivation and a "brake" on immune-mediated tumor eradication.

When a high rate of variation in microsatellite length exists across the genome a tumor is said to have MSI-H, which reflects underlying deficiency in MMR capability. As expected, an inability to repair DNA damage results in the accumulation of mutations. These mutations code for mutant proteins, and mutation-derived antigens ("neoantigens") can be recognized by CD8+ T cells, and targeted by the immune system in vivo.

Significant declines in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or radiographically detectable objective antitumor responses are unlikely to occur, and as a result, this treatment is not appropriate for those with high-burden, highly symptomatic disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For most patients, we use this agent earlier rather than later during the treatment course of CRPC as this may optimize outcomes.
