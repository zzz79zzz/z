         Cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) is a relatively common clinical entity, accounting for approximately 2 percent of all invasive cancers [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. CUP is diagnosed in patients who have metastatic cancer but who have no anatomic primary site identified by a comprehensive initial evaluation. Within this category, cancers from many primary sites with varying biology are represented. Improved diagnostic methods including molecular cancer classifier assays (MCCAs) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining allow the site of tumor origin to be predicted in most patients with CUP. However, the anatomic primary site is usually not detected during the clinical course, so patients with CUP remain a clinically distinct group. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4878.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of the classification and management of cancers of unknown primary site"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Adenocarcinomas of unknown primary site comprise approximately 70 percent of CUPs. In autopsy series, although these cancers may arise from a wide variety of primary sites, the most frequently identified sites are lung, pancreas, hepatobiliary tree, and kidney, together accounting for approximately two-thirds of cases [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Adenocarcinomas of the breast and prostate are identified infrequently at autopsy, despite being the most common cancers in females and males, respectively. In 20 to 30 percent of patients, no primary site can be identified. However, it seems likely that very small primaries that would require multiple sections for microscopic identification may be missed at autopsy. Large autopsy series include patients who were not evaluated with modern imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET), and therefore published data may not accurately reflect contemporary patient population with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with adenocarcinomas of unknown primary site, the focus is on identifying specific subsets in which disease-oriented therapy may be more effective than empiric therapy; this is based on a combination of clinical features, IHC results, and MCCA results.

          CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND COURSE

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The incidence of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site increases with age. The clinical presentation is determined by the sites of metastatic tumor involvement, which are frequently multiple and often include the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and bones. Many patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site have widespread metastases and poor performance status at diagnosis. The prognosis for most of these patients is poor, although this is influenced by the type of adenocarcinoma, sites of metastases, extent of tumor burden, performance status, and disease management.
        </p>
        <p>
         In an analysis of almost 19,000 patients with cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) from the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1987 to 2008, the median survival for those with adenocarcinoma (70 percent of the group) was three months, with a 17 percent one-year survival rate [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Another analysis from this cancer registry found an improvement over time in overall survival (OS) in patients with adenocarcinoma (median OS of approximately six months between 2001 and 2008 versus four months between 1987 and 1993) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In both registry analyses, all patients with the diagnosis of CUP were included, regardless of performance status or treatment received.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although there have been no randomized studies, substantial evidence supports a modest improvement in survival with empiric chemotherapy versus supportive care only. As opposed to the registry data, patients in empiric chemotherapy trials are restricted to those with a good performance status; in this population, empiric chemotherapy produced median survivals of 7 to 10 months in most phase II studies [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-9
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Empiric chemotherapy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, several subsets of patients have a more favorable outlook, and initial evaluation should attempt to identify these patients. Additional diagnostic tests including improved immunohistochemical (IHC) stains and molecular cancer classifier assays (MCCAs) have improved the identification of the site of tumor origin, and improved the prognosis of selected patients when treated with site-specific therapy. Empiric chemotherapy also results in modest survival improvement (median survival, 9 to 11 months) for patients with good performance status. (See

         Most of the necessary clinical studies should have already been performed in the process of making the diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary site (CUP). These studies include a thorough history and physical examination, complete blood count, urinalysis, basic serum chemistries, and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. In males, assessment should incorporate a prostate examination and measurement of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In females, the evaluation should include a pelvic examination and mammography. In addition, patients should have a focused clinical evaluation of any signs or symptoms suggestive of metastatic cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         In specific patient subgroups, several additional clinical studies are useful in identifying the anatomic primary site:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In females with a clinical presentation suggestive of metastatic breast cancer (eg, axillary adenopathy), breast MRI should be performed even if mammograms are normal. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of the biopsy specimen may detect the expression of breast cancer-specific markers, such as estrogen and progesterone receptors, mammaglobin, and gross cystic duct fluid protein. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Females with axillary lymph node metastases'

         </span>
         Colonoscopy should be performed in patients with intra-abdominal metastases who have histology typical of lower gastrointestinal cancer and either typical IHC staining (cytokeratin 20 [CK20]-positive, cytokeratin 7 [CK7]-negative, caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 [CDX-2]-positive) or a molecular cancer classifier assay (MCCA) diagnosis of a colorectal site of origin. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Colon cancer profile'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In males with clinical presentations suggestive of metastatic prostate cancer (eg, osteoblastic bone metastases), tissue staining for PSA is sometimes diagnostic even when serum PSA is not elevated.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Positron emission tomography (PET) is an additional standard diagnostic staging procedure that may be useful in certain presentations. In a number of retrospective series, PET identified a primary site in approximately 40 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. However, in a single existing prospective study, PET was not superior compared with CT [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, the use of PET should be restricted to the evaluation of patients with specific clinical presentations (eg, those with squamous carcinoma in cervical lymph nodes or with a single metastasis). Although unrelated to the diagnostic evaluation, PET scans are also useful for monitoring response to treatment in patients with bone-predominant metastases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Exhaustive imaging and endoscopic testing should not be performed, since these studies rarely detect the primary site in the asymptomatic patient, and confusion can result from false-positive results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Traditional serum tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], cancer antigen [CA] 19-9, CA 15-3, CA 125) are generally not useful as diagnostic or prognostic tests. However, they are commonly elevated and may be useful in following the response to therapy.

         Cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) is, by definition, a metastatic tumor for which pretreatment evaluation does not reveal an anatomic primary site. In cases of suspected CUP, a biopsy of the most accessible site should be performed, preferably using a core needle or excisional biopsy to obtain sufficient tissue for all necessary studies. Adenocarcinoma can usually be distinguished from other histologies by light microscopic examination. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and additional studies should be guided by the tumor histology, as described below. Treatment should then proceed based on results of these assessments  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86664" href="/z/d/graphic/86664.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         </span>
         The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma is usually based on the identification of glandular structures that are formed by the neoplastic cells. These features are shared by all adenocarcinomas, and the site of the primary tumor usually cannot be determined by light microscopy. Although certain morphologic features can be associated with a particular tumor type (eg, papillary features with ovarian cancer and signet ring cells with gastric cancer), they generally are not sufficiently specific to provide a definitive diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is usually made when only minimal glandular formation is seen on histologic examination or in tumors that lack glandular differentiation but stain positively for mucin. Adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and poorly differentiated carcinoma are histologic diagnoses that represent a spectrum of tumor differentiation rather than well-demarcated entities. Different pathologists may use somewhat different criteria for each of these diagnoses.
        </p>
        <p>
         The light microscopic diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma should be interpreted with caution, since some of these patients have a distinctive tumor biology and responsiveness to systemic chemotherapy. For this reason, evaluation and treatment of patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site should follow the guidelines outlined for poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site, including the use of IHC staining, a molecular cancer classifier assay (MCCA), and electron microscopy (if necessary) to identify potentially chemotherapy-responsive cancer and rule out other tumor types such as hematologic malignancies, sarcomas, neuroendocrine carcinomas, or germ cell tumors. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4875.html" rel="external">
          "Poorly differentiated cancer from an unknown primary site", section on 'Clinical evaluation'

          —
         </span>
         In most instances, IHC is successful in defining the tumor lineage of poorly differentiated neoplasms  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62750" href="/z/d/graphic/62750.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). However, IHC allows the determination of the tissue of origin in only a minority of adenocarcinomas of unknown primary site [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. In part, this is due to the atypical staining patterns present in many adenocarcinomas. However, selection of the appropriate IHC stains is also problematic. It is not possible to do all the IHC stains listed in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56518" href="/z/d/graphic/56518.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) due to limitations of available tissue and expense; rather, the pathologist must select stains based on suggestive histologic or clinical findings [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In evaluating a CUP, most pathologists start with a panel of four IHC stains that form the basis of several potentially diagnostic patterns (cytokeratin 7 [CK7], cytokeratin 20 [CK20], thyroid transcription factor-1 [TTF-1], caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 [CDX-2]) to narrow the diagnostic possibilities, and add stains based on histology, clinical presentation, and results of the initial IHC panel [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. With this approach, results are strongly suggestive of a single cancer type in only 33 percent of patients with CUP [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Even in these patients, clinicians have hesitated to use the IHC predictions to guide site-specific treatment, since the pathology reports are often somewhat equivocal, with phrases like "consistent with" or "favor," rather than a firm diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a few situations, IHC provides strong evidence regarding the primary site  (

         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. CK7 is expressed by cancers of the lung, ovary, endometrium, and breast, but not in cancers of the lower gastrointestinal tract. The CK20-positive/CK7-negative combination is the most specific, particularly if the CDX-2 stain is also positive, and allows a strong prediction of colorectal cancer in patients with compatible clinical and histologic features. In a study of 93 autopsy cases of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site involving the liver, a CK20-positive/CK7-negative pattern correctly predicted a colorectal primary in 17 of 21 cases (81 percent) [
         <a href="#rid17">

         None of these IHC results have been prospectively evaluated for accuracy in identifying the primary site in patients with CUP. Likewise, no studies have adequately addressed the question of whether treatment based on these IHC "diagnoses" improves the outcome for these patients. However, the good correlation between IHC and MCCA diagnoses when a single primary site is suggested by IHC supports the accuracy of these IHC diagnoses. (See

         After initial clinical and pathologic evaluation, groups of patients who fit into favorable subsets requiring specific therapy can be identified.

          Pathology and pathogenesis
         </strong>
         – In some cases, these tumors arise from the peritoneal surface or fallopian tubes, which share a common histogenesis with ovarian tissues. Many have morphologic features that are typical for epithelial ovarian carcinoma, such as papillary configuration or psammoma bodies. In such cases, this syndrome has various terms such as primary peritoneal carcinoma, serous carcinoma of the peritoneum, or multifocal extraovarian serous carcinoma. However, some patients may present with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma that does not exhibit a papillary configuration (analogous to poorly differentiated epithelial ovarian carcinomas); they should be approached similarly to those with typical serous histology. Both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular cancer classifier assays (MCCAs) often corroborate this diagnosis. (See

         Breast cancer should be suspected in females (and, rarely, in males) who have an adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site and axillary lymphadenopathy.

Even with physical examination and mammography, bilateral breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is successful in identifying a primary site in the majority of such cases. (See

Occasional patients have a significantly elevated serum PSA or tumor staining for PSA, but a clinical presentation that is atypical for prostate cancer (eg, metastases to the lung or mediastinal or upper abdominal lymph nodes, without concomitant involvement of bone or pelvic lymph nodes) [

         The recognition of patients with CUP from a lung tissue of origin is important because it influences therapy. The treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved with the addition of immunotherapy, molecular targeted therapies, and maintenance therapy, among other approaches, but none of these specific therapies are included in the empiric chemotherapy options for CUP.

         In occasional patients, only a single metastatic lesion is identified after a complete staging evaluation. Such single lesions have been described in a variety of sites including lymph nodes, brain, lung, adrenal gland, liver, and bone. The possibility of an unusual primary site (eg, apocrine, eccrine, or sebaceous carcinoma) mimicking a metastatic lesion should be considered, but can usually be excluded on the basis of clinical or pathologic features.
        </p>
        <p>
         In most of these patients, other metastatic sites become evident within a relatively short time. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan may be helpful to rule out additional unrecognized sites of metastatic disease prior to definitive local therapy [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If no evidence of additional disease is found, resection of the solitary lesion should be considered. If resection is not feasible because of the location of the metastatic lesion, definitive local radiation therapy should be administered. Local treatment sometimes results in long disease-free intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit of surgical resection of more than one metastatic lesion in patients with CUP is not well documented. Since this approach is recommended in highly selected patients with several tumor types (eg, renal carcinoma, colon cancer with liver metastases, non-small cell lung cancer), it may also be reasonable in occasional patients with CUP.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some instances (eg, after resection of a solitary brain metastasis), local radiation therapy may also be appropriate to maximize the chance of local control [

         The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting is undefined. However, a primary site can now be predicted in many of these patients using IHC and MCCA.

When a primary site cannot be predicted, empiric chemotherapy may be useful in patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma. (See

         A majority of patients (65 to 70 percent) with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site do not fit into any of the clinical subgroups outlined above. These patients have traditionally received empiric chemotherapy with regimens designed to have efficacy in a broad spectrum of cancer types. However, the role of molecular cancer classifier assays (MCCAs) and comprehensive molecular profiling in the treatment of these patients is evolving.

         MCCAs can accurately identify the tissue of origin and subsequently guide site-specific therapy in patients with CUP. The diagnostic efficacy of MCCAs is based on distinct gene expression profiles present in different normal body tissues. When cancers arise from normal tissues, the distinct gene expression profiles are usually retained, at least in part, by the neoplastic cells, allowing identification of the tumor site of origin (eg, primary site). Several MCCAs, using either reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene microarray technology, are commercially available and provide results with a clinical turnaround time of approximately one to two weeks [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32,33,41
         </a>

         <a href="#rid32">
          32,33,41

         MCCA-directed site-specific therapy has been compared with empiric chemotherapy, with mixed results [

        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, randomized studies have demonstrated similar outcomes between the two treatment approaches [
         <a href="#rid44">

          treatment-resistant

         " tumor types, where site-specific therapy is relatively ineffective. Therefore, further randomized studies are needed to evaluate the benefit of site-specific treatment versus empiric chemotherapy, specifically in those with treatment-sensitive tumor types. Defining treatment-sensitive tumor types may evolve over time with the use of easily accessible molecular testing, more precise delineation of CUP subsets, and continued improvements of treatment efficacy in many types of advanced cancer.

         In patients with potentially treatment-sensitive tumor types detected by IHC and/or MCCA (eg, kidney cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, and others), we use site-specific therapy, which includes (1) use of site-specific first-line and subsequent-line chemotherapy, (2) molecular testing for specific molecular alterations pertinent to the specific tumor type (eg, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2] testing for breast cancer), with targeted therapy for appropriate subsets, and (3) use of immunotherapy if indicated for the tumor type identified.
        </p>
        <p>
         Comprehensive molecular profiling may also be offered to select patients to identify actionable molecular alterations, a technique also used to identify active therapies in those with treatment-resistant tumors. However, the routine use of MCCA and comprehensive molecular profiling in guiding treatment for CUP is not yet considered definitive by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and these tests are not included in the NCCN treatment guidelines.

In this small cohort, the one- and two-year OS rates favored patients receiving site-specific therapies (one-year OS 39 versus 30 percent; two-year OS 24 versus 10 percent). For the entire group of 243 patients, median OS (10 versus 10.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.69-1.23) and progression-free survival (PFS; 5.3 versus 4.6 months; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72-1.25) were comparable between empiric chemotherapy and site-specific therapy.

However, the study results were potentially biased by the inclusion of patients with lymphoma (26 patients [20 percent]), which is typically detected on standard pathologic examination; inclusion of these patients in a study designed to evaluate those with CUP suggests problems either with the standard pathology or with the MCCA.

          16,29,30,37,46-49
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a prospective nonrandomized phase II trial, 194 patients with CUP received site-specific therapy based on MCCA predictions (CancerTYPE ID) [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Median OS for the entire group was 12.5 months, which is longer than the OS observed with empiric chemotherapy in separate studies (median 9 to 11 months). In addition, patients with potentially responsive tumor types did better with site-specific treatment than did those with less responsive types (median 13.4 versus 7.6 months).

         In patients predicted to have a tumor type relatively resistant to treatment as detected by IHC and/or MCCA (eg, pancreatic, biliary, gastric, liver cancer, and others) or those in whom no primary tumor site is identified, empiric chemotherapy provides treatment results equivalent to site-specific therapy, although both approaches have relatively poor efficacy.

         With the evolution of cancer therapy, empiric chemotherapy has become less attractive in the diverse CUP population. Treatment now differs markedly based on the site of tumor origin and often involves the identification of defined molecular targets, none of which are included in the empiric chemotherapy regimens for CUP. As a result, there is developing interest in using other molecular profiling techniques to identify and offer therapy directed at the tumor of origin in patients with CUP. (See

         As an example, patients with advanced NSCLC are treated using checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy (alone or in combination with chemotherapy) as well as therapies targeting molecular alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor (

         We offer comprehensive molecular profiling of CUP. Molecular alterations predictive of activity of targeted agents or immunotherapy are present in a sizable minority of these patients. Such treatment should be offered, either as first-line, when other treatment options are unlikely to be beneficial, or as subsequent treatment.
        </p>

         Comprehensive molecular profiling involves assaying a broad group of genes for the purpose of identifying potentially actionable oncogenic molecular alterations (eg,
         <em>
          HER2
         </em>
         ,
         <em>
          EGFR
         </em>
         ,
         <em>
          BRAF
         </em>
         , others), which in one study, were identified in approximately 20 percent of patients with CUP [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Comprehensive molecular profiling therefore differs from an MCCA, which measures differential expressions of normal genes to enable identification of a tissue of origin. Similar to MCCAs, data suggest comprehensive molecular profiling using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel may also be able to predict tissue of origin, but further clinical validation is necessary [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Data supporting the use of comprehensive molecular profiling are rapidly evolving. Increased use of comprehensive profiling has allowed for the evaluation of established targeted agents in a wide variety of cancer types that are rare or have a low incidence of the critical molecular alterations. As expected, active targeted agents have efficacy across a variety of tumor types, as long as the critical molecular alteration is present [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54,55
         </a>

         , high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), and high tumor mutational burden (TMB). However, activity of the same targeted agent can vary widely in different tumor types, for reasons that are incompletely understood [

          56,57

         ]. At present, the efficacy of targeted therapy in patients with CUP is documented only by a few case reports [

         Comprehensive molecular profiling may also identify patients with CUP who may benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. While the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is largely untested in patients with CUP, the efficacy of these agents seems likely. Cancer types known to be responsive to these agents (lung, urothelial, renal) are well represented in the CUP population. Molecular alterations predictive of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including MSI-H, high TMB, and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) amplification or overexpression [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68-70
         </a>
         ], have been identified in CUP [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71-73
         </a>
         ]. High TMB (≥20 mutations/mb) is relatively common in CUP, occurring in 8 percent of adenocarcinomas, 11 percent of carcinomas, and 23 percent of squamous carcinomas [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. PD-L1 is also overexpressed in patients with CUP; staining in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was seen in 63 percent, and staining of cancer cells was observed in 21 percent of patients with CUP [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]. MSI-H and PD-L1 amplification are less common (1 to 2 percent) [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>

        <p>
         Although comprehensive molecular profiling identifies an actionable molecular alteration in a sizable minority of patients with CUP, optimal use of these data in guiding therapy may also require additional information, including identification of the likely primary site. Few targeted drugs are recommended for first-line, single-agent treatment in any solid tumor type. Combination chemotherapy continues to play an integral role in the treatment of many cancers. One would not recommend the same chemotherapy for patients with breast versus colon cancer, nor would one treat patients with either of these cancer types with first-line, single-agent, targeted therapy. Likewise, initial treatment with
         <em>
          BRAF
         </em>
         -targeted therapy would be inappropriate in a patient with a
         <em>
          BRAF V600E
         </em>
         mutation if the primary site was known to be colorectal.

         In one prognostic factor analysis that included 150 patients with CUP who were seen at a single institution over a 10-year period, the performance status and serum LDH could be used to separate patients into good- and poor-risk categories. The median survival durations for good- and poor-risk patients were 11.7 and 3.9 months, and one-year survival rates were 45 and 11 percent, respectively [

         A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors based on a series of 317 consecutive patients found that a normal serum albumin and the absence of liver metastases identified a favorable subset of patients (median survival 371 days, versus 103 days in patients with a low serum albumin and/or liver metastases) [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84
         </a>
         ]. In the same report, the favorable prognosis associated with the combination of a normal serum albumin and the absence of liver metastases was validated in a second cohort of 124 patients with CUP.

         Prognostic factors have not been studied in patients receiving site-specific therapy, and they may differ from those recognized in previous studies. In addition, it is likely that molecular tumor prognostic factors of greater clinical value will be identified (eg, actionable mutations, alterations predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors).

          Definition and epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) is diagnosed in patients who have metastatic cancer but have no anatomic primary site identified by a comprehensive initial evaluation. CUPs account for approximately 2 percent of all invasive cancers. Adenocarcinomas of unknown primary site comprise approximately 70 percent of CUPs. (See
         <a class="local">

          Pathologic evaluation

         – Once the diagnosis of CUP is established, additional evaluation may be warranted based on the findings of clinical and pathologic assessment. (See

Molecular alterations predictive of activity of targeted agents or immunotherapy are present in a sizable minority of these patients. Such treatment should be offered, either as first-line, when other treatment options are unlikely to be beneficial, or as subsequent treatment. (See
