         Fever is a prominent symptom of many different disease processes. Based upon one large, population-based observational study, approximately 1.4 percent of infants younger than three months of age present for evaluation of fever [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Neonates and young infants may manifest fever as the only sign of significant underlying infection. The incidence of invasive bacterial infection (IBI; bacteremia or meningitis) is higher in infants younger than three months of age, particularly those under 28 days, than at any other time in childhood [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5
         </a>
         ]. In addition, these young patients can experience significant morbidity from some viral infections. (See

         Rectal temperatures are the standard for detecting fever in infants less than three months of age and the majority of studies establishing the risk of serious infections in febrile young infants have relied upon rectal temperatures. A rectal temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) or greater is generally regarded as fever in infants 90 days of age and younger [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. This temperature is the one used by the majority of studies that have focused on the risk of serious illness in young infants and corresponds to a value that is two standard deviations above the mean in this age group. We use electronic rectal thermometers with covers. Glass thermometers should not be used because of difficulties with reading the temperature correctly, risk of injury to the patient if they break, and potential for spreading infectious disease.

         Axillary, temporal artery, and tympanic membrane temperatures appear less reliable for detecting fever in young infants when compared with rectal thermometry as the gold standard but may be used when rectal thermometry is contraindicated, such as in patients with neutropenia, bleeding diathesis (eg, thrombocytopenia), or necrotizing enterocolitis. A temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) or greater by methods other than rectal measurement should be regarded as fever and a workup should be initiated. Temperatures measured by other, nonrectal methods that are near 38°C (100.4°F) should be interpreted on a case-by-case basis using the overall clinical assessment; when possible, a rectal temperature should be taken. Options include serial exams and observation, or a laboratory evaluation. (See

         Observational studies have established the following relationships between rectal temperature and other measurements of body temperature in infants and children as follows (see

         Axillary temperature is most commonly performed as an alternative to rectal temperature in the young infant. It is consistently lower than rectal temperature, but the absolute difference varies too widely for a standard conversion. If a rectal temperature is contraindicated, we prefer to use axillary temperature to determine if a fever is present.

         Systematic reviews have concluded that infrared tympanic membrane thermometry shows insufficient agreement with established methods of core temperature measurement to be used in situations where detection of fever has important clinical implications, such as in febrile young infants.

         Infrared contact and noncontact forehead (temporal artery) thermometers also have contradictory results when compared with rectal temperatures and should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be used to determine the presence of fever in a young infant [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-10
         </a>

         Based upon an observational study in 148 infants younger than three months of age, oral temperature measurement with a pacifier thermometer had a low sensitivity for detection of fever (48 percent) when compared with rectal temperature and a number of infants were unable or unwilling to suck on the device long enough to obtain a reading [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the variability from device to device and by site of measurement, we do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         suggest altering the reported temperature based on the device used for estimating the rectal temperature. For example, it is not advised to "add a degree" to axillary values but rather report the value with the method of measurement used. As with any measured data, the clinician must then use
         <strong>
          all
         </strong>
         clinical findings to interpret the results and to plan an appropriate evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whenever feasible, we typically measure the rectal temperature of infants initially assessed using other means of temperature measurement. When the measurements are close in time (ie, within 15 to 30 minutes), then we use the rectal temperature to determine if a fever is present. If the measurements are not close in time, then if either measurement indicates a fever, we proceed with an evaluation according to the patient age and clinical findings. (See

         Young infants who are afebrile at presentation but have a caregiver report of fever taken by a reliable means at home still have a substantial risk for a serious bacterial infection [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-13
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, the risk of an invasive bacterial illness such as bacteremia or meningitis does not appear to be significantly different in these patients when compared with febrile young infants. In addition, afebrile infants on presentation who were given antipyretics prior to arrival (thereby potentially masking fever but not changing the course of the underlying infectious process) remain at the same risk as infants who are febrile at presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to caregiver report of fever depends upon how the temperature was taken as follows:

          Rectal temperature
         </strong>
         – It is not uncommon for caregivers to report an elevated temperature in an infant who is afebrile at the time of evaluation. A history of objective fever by rectal temperature at home requires further evaluation according to age and clinical findings, even if the infant is afebrile at the time of presentation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106744.html" rel="external">

         In one small observational study of 40 such patients presenting to an emergency department and performed prior to widespread availability of
         <em>
          Haemophilus influenzae
         </em>
         type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, the risk of bacterial infection, including urinary tract infection, bacteremia, or meningitis was approximately 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. A more recent prospective cohort study performed after routine use of
         <em>
          Haemophilus influenzae
         </em>
         type b and heptavalent pneumococcal vaccines evaluated 835 infants with a documented fever by rectal temperature at home but who were afebrile when seen in a primary care office and found a risk of about 1 percent for bacteremia or meningitis [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Taken together, these studies suggest that the risk of bacterial infection is substantial in infants who are afebrile on presentation but had a fever documented by rectal temperature at home.

          Axillary temperature
         </strong>
         – Limited evidence suggests that the risk of invasive bacterial illness in infants whose caregivers report a fever based upon axillary measurements may be similar to infants who are febrile upon medical evaluation. For example, in a retrospective study of almost 2500 infants with a caregiver history of fever (most taken by axillary measurement [personal communication, Dr. Santiago Mintegi]), the rate of invasive bacterial infection (IBI) was not significantly different for afebrile infants based upon emergency department assessment when compared with febrile infants (IBI 2.4 percent for both) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Thus, we support further evaluation according to age and clinical findings in these patients. Notably, the local protocol for evaluation included lumbar puncture for all infants not well appearing as well as all infants &lt;21 days of age [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         <strong>
          Other measurements
         </strong>
         – Evidence is lacking regarding the risk of IBI in young infants with fevers reported based upon less reliable means of temperature assessment such as contact or non-contact infrared temporal artery temperature, oral pacifier thermometer, or infrared tympanic membrane temperature.

         Noncontact thermometers (infrared thermal scanners), which have become the preferred instruments from an infection control standpoint when screening patients for COVID-19, allow temperatures to be taken with minimal to no physical contact with the person being examined. There is no consensus as to the optimal cutoff temperature for determining the existence of a fever for any of these devices [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. However, thermal screening has reasonable diagnostic accuracy for the detection of fever. For example, in one systematic review of 30 studies and meta-analysis of 11 studies, many of which used noncontact infrared thermometers (NCITs), negative predictive values for excluding fever were high and remained high (97.7 to 100 percent) over a wide range of prevalence (0.0001 to 10 percent) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, the sensitivity and specificity of NCITs and thermal scanners in the detection of fever ranged widely with high heterogeneity on meta-analysis likely due to differences in type and method of noncontact device used, varying reference fever thresholds and method of measurement, patient age, and setting between the studies.

         Although we recommend rectal temperatures to identify the presence of fever, when caregivers report an elevated temperature within the past 24 hours that is based upon other methods of measurement, our approach is to proceed with an evaluation according to the patient age and clinical findings regardless of the rectal temperature at clinical presentation or the timing between measurements by the caregiver and the medical provider. This approach is in part informed by an understanding that fever is not a static process. In these situations, varying temperature readings over time may reflect natural variability rather than a lack of fever.

         For patients in whom reliable follow-up is not assured and who have not received antipyretic therapy, observation for lack of fever by rectal measurement at one or two additional time points in the department (eg, for one to two feeding cycles) remains an option. It is reassuring if the patient feeds well, remains afebrile, and continues to look well. This time can be used to continue to educate parents on supportive care and signs and symptoms to return.

The fact that these patients differ with respect to current immunization practice and the possible benefit derived from herd immunity limits interpretation of these findings in a modern-day population where the etiologies of bacterial infection and the invasiveness of the related pathogens have shifted significantly.

         When ambient temperature and humidity permit normal heat loss (ie, humidity &lt;75 percent, ambient temperature &lt;35°C [95°F]), an elevated rectal temperature &gt;38°C (100.4°F) should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be attributed to bundling in infants 7 to 90 days of age. In addition, a fever &gt;38.5°C (101°F) should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be attributed to bundling regardless of the manner taken. When evaluating an infant who is afebrile by rectal temperature at presentation but had a fever at home, bundling is an important factor to consider if the fever is based upon temperature measurements other than a rectal temperature. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Caregiver report of fever'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         When ambient temperature and humidity pose a significant threat to heat loss (eg, ambient temperature &gt;35°C [95°F] and/or relative humidity &gt;75 percent), infants who are bundled have a limited ability to acclimate and can have elevated temperatures &gt;38°C (100.4°F) that indicate heat illness. However, infection is still an important consideration. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6592.html" rel="external">
          "Heat illness (other than heat stroke) in children", section on 'Pathophysiology'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Bundling of infants in clothing or blankets generally causes an elevation in skin temperature rather than rectal temperature when ambient conditions permit normal heat loss. As an example, in a randomized trial of 64 infants 11 to 95 days of age, rectal temperature after one hour was
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         significantly different between bundled and unbundled infants but mean skin temperature was (1.2°C higher in bundled infants) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Thus, bundled young infants outside of the newborn period may feel warm, but typically their rectal temperature will reflect their true core temperature. Again, this stresses the importance of using rectal measurements in young febrile infants rather than temporal artery, axillary, or other methods of temperature assessment that may be more impacted by alterations in skin temperature.

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Fever in neonates and infants younger than three months (90 days) of age is defined as a rectal temperature ≥38ºC (100.4ºF). Rectal temperatures are the standard for detecting fever in these infants and the majority of studies establishing the risk of serious infections in febrile young infants have relied upon rectal temperatures. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definition of fever'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Elevated rectal temperature'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Axillary, temporal artery, and tympanic membrane temperatures appear less reliable for detecting fever in young infants when compared with rectal thermometry as the gold standard but may be used when rectal thermometry is contraindicated, such as in patients with neutropenia, bleeding diathesis (eg, thrombocytopenia), or necrotizing enterocolitis.

         <a class="local">

          Guidance for elevated nonrectal temperatures
         </strong>
         – A temperature of ≥38°C (100.4°F) taken by methods other than rectal measurement should be regarded as fever, and a workup should be initiated. Temperatures measured by other, nonrectal methods that are near 38°C (100.4°F) should be interpreted on a case-by-case basis using the overall clinical assessment; when possible, a rectal temperature should be taken. Options include serial exams and observation, or laboratory evaluation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other measurements'

          Guidance for a caregiver report of fever

         – A reliable caretaker report of fever should be carefully evaluated, even if the infant is afebrile at presentation as follows (see

          'Caregiver report of fever'

         A history of objective fever by rectal temperature requires further evaluation even if the infant is afebrile at the time of presentation.

         Although we recommend rectal temperatures to identify the presence of fever, when caregivers report an elevated temperature within the past 24 hours that is based upon other methods of measurement such as axillary temperature, contact or non-contact infrared temporal artery temperature, oral pacifier thermometer, or infrared tympanic membrane temperature, our approach is to proceed with an evaluation according to the patient age and clinical findings regardless of the rectal temperature at clinical presentation or the timing between measurements by the caregiver and the medical provider.
