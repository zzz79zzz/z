It is the core feature of schizophrenia and other conditions in the schizophrenia spectrum and may occur in bipolar disorder and major depression with psychotic features. Psychosis may also be a manifestation of substance use or underlying medical disease.</p><p>This topic will address initial management of psychosis. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, comorbid conditions, evaluation, and initial management of psychosis in adults are discussed elsewhere.

It is essential to consider collateral information obtained from family members, psychosocial supports, and other providers during initial management decisions. For most patients, treatment involves antipsychotic medication and psychosocial interventions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1698737288"><span class="h2">Safety risk and level of care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of psychosis should take place in the least restrictive environment where safety can be maintained. Inpatient psychiatric hospitalization is needed when the patient is at risk to harm themselves or others. This should be assessed through direct questions about homicidal and suicidal ideation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1708.html" rel="external">"Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"</a>). Other considerations include the patient’s ability to secure basic needs, such as food and shelter, to protect oneself from harm, and the presence of family members or other supports who can monitor the patient and alert emergency services if needed.</p><p>Psychiatric hospitalization can be either on a voluntary or involuntary basis, subject to legal restrictions that vary by jurisdiction. Clinicians, especially those in emergency settings, should become familiar with involuntary treatment criteria and procedures within their legal jurisdictions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1364321801"><span class="h2">Psychiatric consultation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any patient with an initial or recurrent onset of psychosis should be evaluated by a psychiatrist.

Notable exceptions include patients with psychosis due to central nervous system stimulant intoxication or patients with catatonia, both of which should be treated initially with benzodiazepines. (See <a class="local">'Psychosis due stimulant intoxication'</a> below and <a class="local">'Catatonia'</a> below.)</p><p>Antipsychotics have been extensively studied and shown to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. A network meta-analysis of 402 studies with over 50,000 participants examined the efficacy of over 30 different first- and second-generation antipsychotics in patients with acute symptoms of schizophrenia or related disorders [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. All antipsychotics were found to reduce overall symptoms more than placebo. Studies used different rating scales for determining symptom improvement; the estimated individual effect sizes for overall symptom improvement ranged from -0.89 to -0.03 standardized mean difference compared with placebo (mean -0.42). Benefits were also reported for positive symptoms (eg, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions), depressive symptoms, and social functioning.</p><p>While antipsychotics have been most extensively studied in the treatment of schizophrenia, the medications appear to effectively reduce psychotic symptoms due to many different causes. For example, meta-analyses have found antipsychotics are effective in the treatment of psychotic mania in bipolar disorder [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], major depressive disorder with psychotic features (when combined with an antidepressant) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], delirium [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], psychosis in Parkinson disease [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], and psychosis in Alzheimer disease [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14778.html" rel="external">"Brief psychotic disorder", section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3077995658"><span class="h3">Selection</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1617954273"><span class="h4">Preference for second-generation agents</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest using a second-generation antipsychotic as first-line treatment in most cases of psychosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624" href="/z/d/graphic/60624.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Selection among the second-generation antipsychotics is often based on clinician familiarity with specific agents, patient comorbidities, psychiatric symptoms such as level of agitation, and potential side effects of medications. In many cases, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8786" href="/z/d/drug information/8786.html" rel="external">aripiprazole</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9868" href="/z/d/drug information/9868.html" rel="external">risperidone</a> are appropriate choices due to their relatively favorable side effect profiles; however, specific features may prompt selection of other second-generation antipsychotics, and in some cases (eg, severe agitation), a first-generation antipsychotic such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8516" href="/z/d/drug information/8516.html" rel="external">haloperidol</a> may be appropriate. Patient-specific considerations in selecting an antipsychotic are discussed in the sections that follow. Specific side effects associated with the various antipsychotic agents are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533" href="/z/d/graphic/82533.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>Second-generation antipsychotics are preferred because they tend to cause fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS; ie, akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism) than first-generation antipsychotics [<a href="#rid1">1,2,9,10</a>]. Meta-analysis comparing overall efficacy and effects of antipsychotics showed less EPS associated with all second-generation antipsychotics studied compared with the first-generation antipsychotic, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8516" href="/z/d/drug information/8516.html" rel="external">haloperidol</a> [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Aside from this distinction, therapeutic effects and adverse effects are not significantly different between first- and second-generation antipsychotics and likelihood of specific adverse effects are heterogenous within each group. Although <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9289" href="/z/d/drug information/9289.html" rel="external">clozapine</a> is more effective than other agents, it is reserved for patients who have not responded to other antipsychotics because it has significant side effects and medical risks that require careful monitoring. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14805.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14773.html" rel="external">"First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14776.html" rel="external">"Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14772.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Guidelines for prescribing clozapine"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H498310159"><span class="h4">Additional patient-specific considerations</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2924441535"><span class="h5">Psychiatric symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Certain psychiatric features may be a reason for selection of a particular antipsychotic or a particular property of an antipsychotic:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Negative symptoms</strong> – Negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as diminished emotional expression and lack of motivation, have proven particularly difficult to treat. Most classes of medications tested have not shown clinically meaningful effects on negative symptoms [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], but <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104184" href="/z/d/drug information/104184.html" rel="external">cariprazine</a> has shown positive effects in a clinical trial [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

Small, statistically significant reductions in negative symptoms were found for second-generation antipsychotics, antidepressants, glutamatergic agents, and combinations of these medications, but not for first-generation antipsychotics or brain stimulation. None of the beneficial effects for any of the medication strategies were considered to be of a clinically significant magnitude. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6962.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Negative symptoms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a clinical trial of 461 patients with stable schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104184" href="/z/d/drug information/104184.html" rel="external">cariprazine</a> was compared with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9868" href="/z/d/drug information/9868.html" rel="external">risperidone</a> over a 26-week period [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Cariprazine-treated patients had a modestly greater reduction in negative symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (difference in mean change from baseline -1.46, 95% CI -2.4 to -0.5 on a 42 point scale) and improvement in domains of self-care, and social relationships and activities on the Personal and Social Performance Scale (difference in mean change from baseline 4.6, 95% CI 2.7-6.6 on a 100 point scale). Cariprazine did not have a differential effect on positive symptoms, depression, or EPS. (See <a class="local">'Negative symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Agitation</strong> – We consider agitation to be a psychiatric emergency. Agitation is a state of motor restlessness or excitement and is often accompanied by mental tension and irritability.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We typically treat agitated patients with an antipsychotic with prominent sedating effects. As examples, we often use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9716" href="/z/d/drug information/9716.html" rel="external">olanzapine</a> 5 to 10 orally or disintegrating tablet or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8516" href="/z/d/drug information/8516.html" rel="external">haloperidol</a> 2 to 10 mg orally  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624" href="/z/d/graphic/60624.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In individuals who refuse or are unable to take oral medication, each of these can be administered intramuscularly (IM) at the same dose as oral administration. However, when giving these medications IM, we administer them with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9106" href="/z/d/drug information/9106.html" rel="external">benztropine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9369" href="/z/d/drug information/9369.html" rel="external">diphenhydramine</a> in order to reduce the risk of severe EPS or dystonia.

In a trial, 380 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to sublingual dexmedetomidine 180 µg, 120 µg, or matching placebo [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Subjects were instructed on the appropriate method of self-administration, and the study drug was administered under the supervision of a staff member. Treatment effects, as measured by the five-item, 35-point Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component, were first observed at 20 and 30 minutes postdose with sublingual dexmedetomidine 180 µg and 120 µg, respectively. Participants in both sublingual dexmedetomidine treatment groups showed improvements as compared with participants in the placebo group at all measured timepoints for up to two hours. Drug-related adverse effects for the 180 µg group, the 120 µg sublingual group, and placebo group were 37, 40, and 15 percent, respectively.

In contrast, a 40-year-old patient with acute onset of psychosis, no premorbid history, and stable psychosocial functioning will likely be treated for several months followed by a trial of discontinuation of medications.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/291.html" rel="external">"Assessment and emergency management of the acutely agitated or violent adult"</a>.)</p><p>In cases where the acuity of the psychosis does not warrant IM or IV treatment (eg, mild paranoia), we suggest frequent education of the patient about potential benefits of medication and discussion of reasons for refusal. It is often helpful to engage family members and other supports in order to build alliance with the patient. In cases where adherence becomes problematic, long-acting injectable medications are suggested. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15250.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Pharmacotherapy with long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2556042459"><span class="h2">Monitoring and follow-up</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recommend follow-up monitoring on a weekly basis with a mental health team to provide pharmacologic and psychosocial treatment. After three months, the frequency can be monthly if the patient continues to be in remission.</p><p>Medication benefits, side effects, and adherence should be discussed at each visit. Additionally, lipid profile, metabolic profile, and, for patients on a medication associated with QT prolongation, an electrocardiogram should be monitored at regular intervals  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117454" href="/z/d/graphic/117454.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Side effect monitoring for patients taking long-term antipsychotic medication is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14805.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management", section on 'Duration of antipsychotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who have recovered from a first episode of psychosis have a high rate of recurrence following medication discontinuation [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. For those whose antipsychotic treatment is discontinued, we continue to monitor for relapse in symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Duration of pharmacologic therapy'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14805.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H221566520"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

All patients with psychosis should be evaluated for risk of harm to themselves or others and their ability to take care of themselves. Patients who are unable to care for themselves or pose a risk to themselves or others should be hospitalized. Severely agitated patients with psychosis may need sedation or physical restraint. (See <a class="local">'Safety risk and level of care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antipsychotic therapy</strong> – Antipsychotic medications are an effective symptomatic treatment of psychosis, regardless of underlying cause, and are the standard initial treatment for most cases. Important exceptions include patients with stimulant-related psychosis or catatonia, for whom antipsychotic medications are not given unless the underlying condition is treated. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Selection </strong>– Antipsychotic drugs are largely similar in efficacy and selection among them is typically made on the basis of patient presentation, the medication’s side effect profile and formulations available  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624" href="/z/d/graphic/60624.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533" href="/z/d/graphic/82533.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). For most patients, we suggest a second-generation rather than a first-generation antipsychotic (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8786" href="/z/d/drug information/8786.html" rel="external">Aripiprazole</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9868" href="/z/d/drug information/9868.html" rel="external">risperidone</a> are appropriate choices for most patients. However, specific features of the presentation may warrant a different antipsychotic choice  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533" href="/z/d/graphic/82533.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Selection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For agitation</strong> – For patients with agitation, an antipsychotic with prominent sedating effects, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9716" href="/z/d/drug information/9716.html" rel="external">olanzapine</a> 5 to 10 mg orally or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8516" href="/z/d/drug information/8516.html" rel="external">haloperidol</a> 2 to 10 mg orally may be useful. These can be given intramuscularly (IM) if refused orally. For more severe agitation, they can be combined with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9573" href="/z/d/drug information/9573.html" rel="external">lorazepam</a>. A sublingual formulation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8897" href="/z/d/drug information/8897.html" rel="external">dexmedetomidine</a> is available for individuals with agitation who can self-administer under supervision. (See <a class="local">'Psychiatric symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For insomnia </strong>– For patients with insomnia due to underlying psychosis, an antipsychotic with sedating properties such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9570" href="/z/d/drug information/9570.html" rel="external">quetiapine</a> can be a useful option. Quetiapine can be started at 25 mg twice daily and increased to an initial target dose of 300 to 400 mg nightly. (See <a class="local">'Psychiatric symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For patients with cardiovascular risk factors </strong>– For patients with diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, or other uncontrolled cardiovascular risks, we are especially cognizant of choosing an agent that has a lower risk of metabolic side effects  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533" href="/z/d/graphic/82533.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Cardiovascular risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Administration </strong>– In adults, most antipsychotic medications are titrated from the initial dose to the therapeutic range as quickly as tolerated  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624" href="/z/d/graphic/60624.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Exceptions include older patients, patients with first episode of psychosis, and patients with relevant medical comorbidities. (See <a class="local">'Administration'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients who refuse medication</strong> – In patients who refuse medications, IM or intravenous medication may be needed for those with agitation or symptoms that put them at risk for dangerous behaviors (eg, severe paranoia leading to agitation or hallucinations commanding violence). Otherwise, we continue to educate patients who refuse medications about potential benefits and discuss reasons for refusal. (See <a class="local">'Patients who refuse medications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychosocial interventions</strong> – Psychosocial interventions are an important adjunctive therapy to antipsychotic medications. These interventions include cognitive and social training, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and family-based interventions. (See <a class="local">'Psychosocial interventions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comorbidities </strong>– Psychosis can occur in the setting of other psychiatric comorbidities such as mood disorders, substance use disorders, and other medical or neurologic disorders. In these cases, antipsychotic medications are administered in combination with treatment for the underlying or comorbid medical or psychiatric disorder. (See <a class="local">'Comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring and follow-up</strong> – We recommend follow-up monitoring on a weekly basis with a mental health team to provide pharmacologic and psychosocial treatment. After three months, the frequency can be monthly if the patient continues to be in remission. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Zhang JP, Gallego JA, Robinson DG, et al.
