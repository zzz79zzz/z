         Cerebellar hemorrhage (CBH) is the major and most frequent cause of neonatal cerebellar injury in very preterm infants (gestational age &lt;32 weeks). Infants with extensive cerebellar lesions are at risk for poor outcome with decreased survival. In preterm survivors less severe bleeds are also associated with significant long-term neurodevelopmental impairment.
        </p>

         The risk factors, presentation, management, and outcome of neonatal cerebellar hemorrhage will be discussed here. An overview of cerebellar development and cerebellar disorders is presented separately. (See

         In very preterm infants (gestational age [GA] &lt;32 weeks), there is a wide range of pathology due to CBH, ranging from small punctate lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), focal unilateral bleeds, and massive bleeds involving both hemispheres and including the vermis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Traditionally, two pathologic patterns of preterm CBH were described. The first consists of extensive CBH occurring in the sickest and most immature infants (&lt;28 weeks gestation and/or &lt;750 g)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef128173" href="/z/d/graphic/128173.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. These large lesions often lead to a destruction of cerebellar parenchyma and subsequent volume reduction and are associated with long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities in surviving infants [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The second pattern includes single or multiple small, punctate (&lt;3 to 4 mm) hemorrhages detected by MRI  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef128170" href="/z/d/graphic/128170.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ). These small lesions are usually not detected by cranial ultrasound and are frequently encountered as a chance finding on MRI. They usually do not lead to cerebellar volume reduction and are associated with a more favorable prognosis [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In more recent studies, a third category of limited/focal lesions (ie, larger than punctate hemorrhages but smaller than the extensive CBH) has been described [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Outcomes tend to be more favorable with these lesions than in cases with extensive CBH, but this also depends on size/location and additional complications. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Outcome'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Neuroimaging studies show that most affected preterm survivors have unilateral lesions, whereas bilateral hemorrhage is predominately seen in autopsy cases [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In the majority of cases, hemorrhage occurs in the lateral or in the inferior part of the posterior lobe in the region supplied by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef128225" href="/z/d/graphic/128225.html" rel="external">
          image 3
         </a>
         ). Smaller "satellite" lesions are often associated with larger lesions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Microscopically, large hemorrhages involve the cortex near the junction of the white matter and the internal granular layer and/or adjacent white matter [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         In preterm infants with CBH, the location and extent of the lesion(s) are important to neurodevelopmental outcome. Classification systems have been proposed based on neuroimaging studies and extend beyond the traditional two pathologic patterns described above. The severity of CBH is based on the size of the lesion, the location including unilateral or bilateral involvement and involvement of the vermis and the degree of cerebellar volume loss at term equivalent age [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,7-10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The authors have previously developed and used the following classification to grade severity of CBH for both ultrasound and MRI for preterm infants during the preterm period and at term equivalent age, which has been correlated with neurodevelopmental outcome [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,8
         </a>
         ]. Within this classification, a distinction is made between punctate and larger hemorrhages, and the larger cerebellar lesions are further divided into limited and extensive. The latter distinction is important as infants with limited CBH have a better prognosis than infants with extensive CBH [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].

         The following grading categories are used  (

         Grade 2 – Limited CBH, larger than a punctate lesion (≥4 mm) but involving at the most one-third of a single cerebellar hemisphere. Usually, these lesions involve the lateral or inferior convexity of the cerebellar hemisphere(s). They can be detected by cranial ultrasound, especially when mastoid fontanel views are performed. On follow-up scans, focal cystic degeneration or atrophy may be seen, involving again at the most one-third of the affected cerebellar hemisphere  (

         Grade 3 – Extensive CBH, involving more than one-third of the cerebellar hemisphere. These lesions lead to obvious volume reduction of the cerebellar hemisphere on follow-up imaging  (

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Each grade of CBH can be unilateral or bilateral and either symmetric or asymmetric. Involvement of the vermis (isolated or in combination with cerebellar hemispheric lesions) is noted separately.
        </p>
        <p>
         An alternative classification system categorizes MRI signal abnormalities in the cerebellum at term equivalent age into four grades depending on size (either small (≤3 mm) or large (&gt;3 mm) and location [uni- or bilateral involvement]). It also categorizes cerebellar volume reduction at term equivalent age into three different categories according to the transcerebellar diameter (TCD), corrected for age at scanning (normal cTCD ≥50 mm)  (

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In some studies, volumetric MRI has been used to quantify the overall burden of cerebellar lesions, and both the total volume and location of the lesions was associated with outcome [

         Supratentorial germinal matrix hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) is frequently observed in neonates with CBH (in 95 percent of autopsy cases and in 65 to 80 percent of survivors based on neuroimaging studies [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,7

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,12
         </a>
         ]. In both conditions, bleeding occurs in highly fragile cellular and vascular developing regions of the brain (external and internal granular cell layer for the developing cerebellum [CBH] and the supratentorial germinal matrix layer under the ependymal lining of the ventricles [GMH-IVH]). During this period, acute fluctuations of arterial blood flow due to impaired cerebral blood flow auto-regulation in these fragile, highly vascular networks contribute to capillary damage, resulting in bleeding observed in preterm infants with CBH and GMH-IVH.

         CBH in preterm infants may disrupt the normal development of the cerebellum during a critical time of rapid and enhanced proliferation and differentiation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,12
         </a>
         ]. Large CBH are often followed by cerebellar atrophy with a loss of cerebellar volume on magnetic resonance imaging [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,13,14
         </a>
         ]. This atrophy is generally focal in unilateral lesions and extensive in bilateral lesions and may need to be distinguished from cases of primary hypoplasia  (

         In late preterm (gestational age 34 to &lt;37 weeks) and term infants, massive posterior fossa hemorrhage is mostly related to birth trauma due to direct laceration of the cerebellum or the tentorium or to rupture of cerebellar bridging veins or the occipital sinus  (

          19-22
         </a>

         The incidence of CBH in preterm infants reported in studies varies widely, mainly due to differences in GA of studied infants and imaging techniques applied. The youngest and smallest infants are at greatest risk to develop CBH [

         – The reported incidence of CBH on cranial ultrasound using mastoid fontanel (MF) views in addition to the traditional anterior fontanel ranges from 3 to 9 percent in infants born below 32 weeks gestation and/or with a birth weight &lt;1500 g [

         The incidence of cerebellar injury in term infants is difficult to estimate, as these infants do not routinely undergo neuroimaging. However, it is likely that cerebellar injury has been underdiagnosed, as these lesions are increasingly reported in full term infants due to traumatic delivery  (

         The risk of CBH and its long-term effect on neurodevelopment increases with decreasing gestational age. As discussed above, the fragility of the developing cerebellum and immaturity in auto-regulating cerebral blood flow increase the risk of CBH in preterm infants. In addition, injury disrupts the normal development of the cerebellum, which is critical and rapid throughout the last trimester of pregnancy and continues postnatally. (See

         Very preterm infants (gestational age [GA] &lt;32 weeks) and especially extremely preterm infants (GA &lt;28 weeks) are also more likely to be severely ill with concomitant conditions that result in additional hemodynamic disturbances, which contribute to CBH [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. The following have been associated with an increased risk of CBH in preterm infants presumably due to their negative effects on hemodynamic stability [

         Advances in prenatal ultrasound and the use of fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to increased recognition of CBH in high-risk fetuses (see

          "Prenatal diagnosis of CNS anomalies other than neural tube defects and ventriculomegaly", section on 'Posterior fossa abnormalities'
         </a>
         ). These lesions have been associated with congenital infection, hydrops fetalis, anemia, and intrauterine transfusion, and with maternal conditions such as sepsis, preeclampsia, trauma, and coagulation disorder [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33-36
         </a>
         ]. Still, fetal CBH is a relatively rare event, and the majority of reports were described after termination of pregnancy or fetal demise.
        </p>
        <p>
         When CBH occurs antenatally, it may lead to a disruption of further cerebellar development. After birth, fetal CBH may present as either uni- or bilateral cerebellar hypoplasia and mimic cerebellar malformation [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. In a series of 26 fetuses with unilateral cerebellar hypoplasia diagnosed at a mean GA of 26 weeks, in eight cases, the progression of imaging features on fetal ultrasound and/or MRI were highly suggestive of an ischemic or hemorrhagic insult [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Other case reports described similar findings of antenatal cerebellar injury presenting as cerebellar hypoplasia or malformation after birth [
         <a href="#rid33">

        </p>
        <p>
         On prenatal ultrasound, CBH presents as a hyperechogenic intraparenchymal lesion, often rapidly evolving to a hypoechogenic lesion in the subacute phase  (

         CBH can have different presentations in the preterm infant depending on the size and acuteness of the lesion. Like GMH-IVH (see

         ), most CBH occur during the first postnatal week. However, especially in extremely preterm (gestational age &lt;28 weeks) and preterm infants with intrauterine growth restriction, CBH may develop later during the neonatal period around episodes of respiratory and/or circulatory failure and/or sepsis.

         Ultrasound should be performed in all infants with unexplained neurologic symptoms and/or severe illness to avoid a delay in diagnosis because the findings of CBH are nonspecific. Ultrasound findings that are suggestive of posterior fossa hemorrhage are ventriculomegaly in absence of GMH-IVH, (asymmetric) elevation of the tentorium, loss of normal demarcation of the posterior fossa structures, increased echogenicity within of one or both cerebellar hemispheres, and, rarely, herniation of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum or upwards transtentorial herniation of posterior fossa structures [

         Data are limited to small case series. In one study of 20 term infants with CBH, the presenting signs included apnea in 14 patients occurring within 12 hours of birth and six presented with seizures within 36 hours of birth [

         ]. Lesions were small (&lt;1 cm) in 12 cases, and large in eight cases. Primiparity was observed in half of the mothers, and the following were noted in one-third of cases: advanced maternal age, group B streptococcus-positive mothers, abnormal fetal heart rate, and instrumented delivery. Neurosurgical intervention was required in 5 out of 20 infants (25 percent); three required hematoma evacuation, and two others ventricular peritoneal shunts. Those infants who developed apnea, seizures, or required neurosurgical intervention all had cerebellar lesions &gt;1 cm in size.

         In our neonatal intensive care units, routine screening cranial ultrasound examinations are performed in all very preterm infants (gestational age &lt;32 weeks) to detect supratentorial hemorrhage (ie, GMH/IVH), CBH, white matter injury and other brain abnormalities. During the first postnatal week at least one of the routine ultrasound scans is performed including mastoid fontanel windows, and subsequent serial ultrasound examinations using the mastoid fontanel window are performed on a regular basis in extreme preterm infants after the first postnatal week. Mastoid fontanel views provide better visualization of the posterior fossa than the traditional routine anterior fontanel window  (

The brain stem, cerebellar hemispheres, vermis, fourth ventricle, and cisterna magna can be visualized by this approach, and the transcerebellar diameter (TCD) can be measured to monitor cerebellar growth  (

In the subacute stage, sometimes already after one to two weeks, the lesion will become less echogenic, with central echolucency, while in the chronic stage, after several weeks, cerebellar atrophy is seen. Depending on the size of the hemorrhage, the lesion may be focal or diffuse. In preterm infants with CBH, cerebellar atrophy is often seen around term equivalent age. However in cases of prenatal CBH, cerebellar atrophy may already be present at birth [

         Although MRI provides images of areas that are difficult to visualize with ultrasound, MRI is not the initial preferred imaging modality in sick newborn infants, as it requires transportation to the magnetic resonance scanner. Thus, it is not a practical modality for early (shortly after birth) and serial neuroimaging for neonates at risk for cranial bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, MRI does provide additional prognostic information in complicated cases, in whom defining location and extent of abnormalities is clinically necessary. In selected patients with (suspected) grade 2 to 3 CBH, we perform MRI at term equivalent age (when the infant is typically more clinically stable) to obtain information on chronic changes and on the effect of the lesion(s) on cerebellar growth and development. MRI also enables the detection and depiction of smaller, punctate lesions in the cerebellum and can provide more information about the extent of associated supratentorial injury and global brain development and maturation. Small, punctate lesions (&lt;4 mm) are the most common type of CBH in preterm infants, and often are not detected by cranial ultrasound, despite the use of mastoid fontanel views [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8
         </a>
         ]. Although MRI is a more sensitive modality, their presence on conventional magnetic resonance images can also be underestimated and influenced by factors such as magnetic resonance field strength and slice thickness. T2*-weighted and susceptibility-weighted sequences improve the detection of these small lesions, as these sequences are more sensitive to blood products and also show small hemosiderin depositions in tissue as areas with a hypointense signal  (

         Larger CBH are easily diagnosed on conventional MRI. In the acute stage and early subacute stage, these have high signal intensity on T1-weighted and low signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. In the chronic stage, the hemorrhages often lead to destruction of cerebellar tissue and atrophy and can sometimes be mistaken for congenital cerebellar hypoplasia. The use of susceptibility-weighted or T2-weighted sequences also improves the recognition of hemosiderin in these chronic cerebellar lesions  (

         The most effective strategy to prevent CBH is the prevention of preterm birth; however, this is yet to be accomplished. In the meantime, because it is likely CBH and supratentorial germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) share similar pathogenic mechanisms, both antenatal and early postnatal preventive measures used to reduce the risk of GMH-IVH are probably also effective in preventing CBH in preterm infants.

         Infants most likely to develop extensive cerebellar lesions are the sickest and most preterm; the majority of infants with such lesions have an unfavorable outcome. Older case series and autopsy studies indicated that infants with massive hemorrhages have high mortality rates [
         <a href="#rid26">

         There is increasing recognition on the long-term negative impact of neonatal CBH on neurodevelopmental outcome. A review of studies published between 2007 and 2014 describing neurodevelopmental outcomes of direct cerebellar injury in preterm infants confirmed that with the exception of punctate cerebellar lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebellar injury is associated with long-term motor, cognitive, and language impairments, as well as socialization and behavioral difficulties [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. Impaired outcome in infants with neonatal cerebellar injury depends on the site and extension of the lesion(s), the total volume of the lesions, whether there is concomitant supra-tentorial injury, and (based on limited data), further underdevelopment of the cerebellum and other regions of the brain [
         <a href="#rid4">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For infants with large lesions detected by ultrasound, there is evidence of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment [

         The impact of isolated CBH was demonstrated by a study that compared three groups of preterm infants (35 isolated CBH, 35 age-matched controls without CBH, and 16 CBH plus supratentorial parenchymal injury) [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. Children with isolated CBH detected by ultrasound and confirmed by MRI were more likely than controls to have neurologic impairment (66 versus 5 percent) with lower scores on tests for motor, expressive and receptive language, and cognitive function. They also had more internalizing behavioral problems and more often an abnormal autism screening. These problems were most common and profound in cases with vermian involvement. The third group of preterm infants with combined CBH and supratentorial injury was not at overall greater risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities than those with isolated CBH, but their impairments were more severe.

         A second study described the effects of CBH on outcome at preschool age of 79 survivors who were extremely preterm (gestational age [GA] &lt;28 weeks) and had ultrasound detected CBH [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. In this cohort, the location of hemorrhage was a predictor of the type of impairment; infants with hemorrhages involving both the medial and lateral structures of the cerebellum were at high risk for motor and mental disabilities, whereas infants with hemorrhages confined to only the cerebellar hemispheres had high rates of mental but not motor delay.

         The outcome of punctate cerebellar lesions, frequently encountered as a chance finding on MRI, appears to be more favorable.

         In a cohort of very preterm infants (GA &lt;32 weeks) who underwent MRI at term age, small CBH were present in 15 percent of the infants. These small hemorrhages did not lead to disruption of cerebellar development or atrophy and were not associated with neuromotor outcome, or cognitive or behavioral problems at two years corrected age [

         Another study also showed that the outcome of these small hemorrhages was more favorable than in infants with large CBH, but in this study, the infants still had a five-fold increased risk of neurologic abnormalities at five years compared with infants without CBH [
         <a href="#rid6">

        </p>
        <p>
         Evaluating the relationship between preterm CBH and outcome remains challenging, as published studies include small numbers of cases, and because affected infants, especially the most immature and sickest infants, usually have concomitant supratentorial injury. This makes it difficult to determine the impact of cerebellar injury alone and distinguish it from the effect of supratentorial hemorrhage and white matter injury. In addition, although the size and location of the lesion appear to impact outcome, only a few studies discriminate between sizes of lesions, and except for the presence of vermian involvement, there is little knowledge on the relationship between the location of cerebellar injury and outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
         To address these issues, a 2017 systematic review of the literature analyzed the outcome of 128 very preterm infants with isolated CBH [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69
         </a>
         ]. In this study, the incidence of severe delay in cognition, motor, language, and behavior development was 38 percent, 39 percent, 41 percent, and 38 percent, respectively. Infants with involvement of the vermis and those with large lesions had the highest risk of impaired outcome. A relatively low incidence of severe outcome was seen in patients with bilateral lesions, but this was likely due to the small number of patients (n = 6) with bilateral CBH. Infants with punctate cerebellar lesions had a much better outcome than infants with large cerebellar lesions. However, due to small subgroups and the lack of more detailed description, it was not possible to further evaluate the effects of size, laterality, and location on outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a subsequent retrospective multicenter study, the CHOPin study, 218 very preterm infants with CBH were classified by severity based on size (grade 1 punctate ≤4 mm, grade 2 limited &gt;4 mm but &lt;1/3 of a hemisphere and grade 3 massive ≥1/3 of a hemisphere)  (

        <p>
         Subgroup outcome analyses based on location were not performed, as the number of infants based on specific locations was too small and precluded further analyses to determine a relation between locations of lesions and outcome.

        <p>
         Volumetric MRI studies in preterm infants demonstrated that isolated CBH has a remote effect on the development of cortical areas functionally connected to the affected cerebellar region. In these infants, the volumes of remote cortical regions in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere were reduced as compared with those of the ipsilateral hemisphere [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. The underdevelopment of cerebellar projection pathways and volumetric reductions of regional cerebral cortical areas of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere were predictive of domain-specific and long-term functional deficits [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. This phenomenon is called cerebello-cerebral diaschisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study in which volumetric MRI was performed during the preterm period, both total size and location of CBH were associated with neurodevelopmental outcome at age 5.5 years [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Hemorrhages in the inferior posterior area and deeper regions of the cerebellum were associated with more motor, visuomotor and behavioral dysfunction than hemorrhages in the more superficial areas of the cerebellum.
        </p>
        <p>
         Large, prospective multicenter studies may clarify possible associations between lesion size and location, and outcome. In addition, most of the above-mentioned outcome studies only included preschool outcome, and long-term follow-up is needed to determine the neurodevelopmental impact of CBH through school age, adolescence, and adulthood. These data will be imperative to identify the need for additional support for these individuals.

          Epidemiology and risk factors
         </strong>
         – Cerebellar hemorrhage (CBH) is the major and most frequent cause of neonatal cerebellar injury in very preterm infants (gestational age &lt;32 weeks). The risk of CBH increases with decreasing gestational age. In late preterm and term infants, CBH is associated with birth trauma, perinatal asphyxia, and major surgery. (See

         of CBH is similar to that of supratentorial germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) with bleeding occurring in a fragile highly vascular region of the brain during acute fluctuations of cerebral blood flow. Very preterm infants, especially extremely preterm infants (gestational age &lt;28 weeks) are also more likely to be severely ill with concomitant conditions (eg, systemic hypotension, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and perinatal asphyxia) that result in additional hemodynamic disturbances that increase the risk of CBH.

         ). At birth, infants with antenatally acquired CBH may present with either uni- or bilateral cerebellar hypoplasia which may mimic cerebellar malformation due to disruption of cerebellar development from the initial injury. (See

          Preterm infant presentation
         </strong>
         – In preterm infants, CBH lesions can range from small punctate lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to focal unilateral bleeds to massive bleeds involving both hemispheres including the vermis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128355" href="/z/d/graphic/128355.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Most CBH develop during the first postnatal week and are detected by screening cranial ultrasound examinations, including the mastoid fontanel approach. However, CBH may also develop later related to episodes of circulatory and/or respiratory failure. The smallest, punctate CBH are not well detected by screening cranial ultrasound examinations. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Postnatal presentation of preterm infants'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In preterm infants, most CBH are asymptomatic or present with nonspecific signs (eg, apnea, irritability, seizures, or ventricular dilatation unexplained by supratentorial abnormalities). Catastrophic presentation of CBH is rare and usually co-occurs with massive IVH. (See

          Term infant presentation
         </strong>
         – Term infants with CBH generally present with early postnatal irritability, apnea or seizures. As these symptoms are nonspecific, cranial ultrasound should be performed to detect CBH  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef128171" href="/z/d/graphic/128171.html" rel="external">
          image 8
         </a>
         ). Some term infants will present with acute catastrophic deterioration, mainly when CBH occurs in combination with large extra-axial posterior fossa hemorrhage. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Postnatal presentation of term infants'

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of CBH is made by neuroimaging. Cranial ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality as it is performed at the bedside and enables early diagnosis. MRI performed around term equivalent age is used to determine exact location and extent of the lesion(s). It also helps to determine cerebellar disruption or atrophy due to antenatal or neonatal CBH and to detect punctate CBH. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Neuroimaging'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In our centers, screening cranial ultrasound examinations are performed serially during the first postnatal week for very preterm infants. Mastoid fontanel windows are used to assess the posterior fossa during at least one of these routine ultrasound scans and on a regular basis for subsequent serial ultrasound examinations. (See

          Prevention
         </strong>
         – The most effective strategy to prevent CBH is to reduce the risk of preterm birth. When preterm birth cannot be avoided, appropriate prenatal and neonatal care should be provided to the mother and neonate including maternal, intrauterine transport, administration of antenatal corticosteroids and

          Management
         </strong>
         – No specific therapy exists to limit the extent of CBH after it has occurred. Treatment of CBH is supportive and directed towards minimization of any further brain injury, and early detection using follow-up cranial ultrasounds of complications including post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD).

         <strong>
          Outcome
         </strong>
         – Outcome in infants with neonatal cerebellar injury depends on the site and extension of the lesion(s) and whether there is concomitant supra-tentorial injury. Extensive lesions are associated with poor outcome with high mortality rates and neurodevelopmental impairment in the majority of survivors. For surviving infants, long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up is therefore needed. (See
