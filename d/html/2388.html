Nutrient-dense alternative food sources should be recommended when elimination diets are initiated. Follow-up is also recommended to ensure that the alternative nutrient sources have been accepted and incorporated into the diet.</p><p>This topic will focus on the prevention of nutritional problems that can arise with food elimination diets and optimizing the diet. Persons with food allergy, like those without food allergy, should aim for a diet that promotes health, meets nutrient needs, and reduces the risk of chronic disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Food allergen avoidance is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2406.html" rel="external">"Management of food allergy: Avoidance"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/z/d/html/377.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Food allergen avoidance (Beyond the Basics)"</a>.)</p><p>The indications for nutrition assessment, clinical features of nutrition disorders, measurements of growth, and laboratory evaluation of nutritional status are also discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5358.html" rel="external">"Indications for nutritional assessment in childhood"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5356.html" rel="external">"Measurement of growth in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5359.html" rel="external">"Laboratory and radiologic evaluation of nutritional status in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5366.html" rel="external">"Dietary assessment in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1565754676"><span class="h1">REFERRAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with food allergy and their parents/caregivers would benefit from referral to a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) to learn how to avoid their allergens and how to substitute the eliminated food while minimizing the social impact of the allergy. Children in particular are at increased nutritional risk, and parents/caregivers will need to plan avoidance strategies for a variety of settings, including those where the parent/caregiver may not be present (eg, school, camps). Of note, an RDN has completed a minimum of a bachelor's degree from an Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) approved program, an ACEND-approved internship, passed a written Commission on Dietetic Registration credentialing exam, and completed continuing professional education credits needed to maintain credentials. Some states certify or license "nutritionists," but qualifications vary by state, and many states have no legal definition of the term; therefore, it may be used by anyone without proof of qualification.</p><p>Major allergens that are staple foods (eg, cow's milk, wheat) typically provide a large percentage of daily dietary intakes, contributing not only energy but also macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, and fat) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Other common allergens (hen's eggs, soy, peanuts, sesame, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish) are nutritionally dense and, when eliminated, can impair intake of specific nutrients. Children with multiple food allergies or cow's milk allergy (CMA) appear to be at greatest nutritional risk, with a higher proportion exhibiting poor growth or overt malnutrition [<a href="#rid2">2-7</a>]. A registered dietitian nutritionist with food allergy expertise can provide patient-specific, practical advice on eliminating multiple and/or staple foods and address nutritional needs by recommending nutritionally appropriate replacements for eliminated foods as well as advice on skill-appropriate progression of complementary foods to avoid feeding difficulties [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GENERAL NUTRITION AND FOOD ALLERGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dietary limitations secondary to food allergy can lead to malnutrition, decreased growth velocity (height/length and weight), and/or deficiencies in specific macro and micronutrients [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Several studies have demonstrated that children with food allergies have lower intakes of total energy and macro/micronutrients than children without food allergy [<a href="#rid3">3,7,9-11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2874.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children younger than two years in resource-abundant settings: Management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2877.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children older than two years in resource-abundant settings"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2864.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children younger than two years in resource-abundant settings: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Causes'</a>.)</p><p>Pediatric clinicians should closely monitor the growth (height/length in addition to weight and, until 36 months of age, head circumference) of children with food allergy and refer such patients to a registered dietitian for evaluation [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. In particular, height/length may be impacted, with one prospective international survey of over 430 children finding stunting (height-for-age Z-score of &lt;-2) more common than poor weight gain in children with food allergy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring growth'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2845.html" rel="external">"Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children", section on 'Evaluation of growth'</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for nutritional deficiencies include dietary factors, such as multiple food allergies leading to a larger number of foods eliminated, altered weaning schedules, and elimination of foods that typically provide important nutrition for a population such as cow's milk in children; behavioral factors such as picky eating, refusal of supplemental formulas, and food refusal; and psychosocial and economic factors [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Energy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient with food allergies is at risk of insufficient energy intake due to inadequate substitution in the allergen elimination diet. Additionally, feeding problems such as food aversion and limited acceptance of a variety of foods may occur in children with food allergies and may significantly contribute to poor energy and overall nutrient intake. One cross-sectional study comparing children on a cow's milk elimination diet (n = 146) with a control group (n = 109) found that children on an elimination diet presented a higher frequency of picky eating and higher scores of feeding problems [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Picky eating in both groups was associated with lower values of weight-for-age Z-scores. Certain food allergic disorders, such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and gastroenteritis, are more commonly accompanied by poor appetite, early satiety, and feeding difficulties, potentially contributing to decreased energy intake [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. Overweight and obesity are also a risk, with an international study of pediatric patients (n = 430) with food allergy reporting that 8 percent were overweight or obese [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Thus, children with food allergies are not immune to excessive energy intakes or poor food choices. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2243.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2536.html" rel="external">"Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases"</a>.)</p><p>Estimated energy needs for those with food allergies are generally similar to energy needs of those without food allergies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2855.html" rel="external">"Introducing solid foods and vitamin and mineral supplementation during infancy", section on 'Infant nutritional requirements'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2866.html" rel="external">"Dietary recommendations for toddlers and preschool and school-age children", section on 'Energy and macronutrient balance'</a>.)</p><p>Energy is provided in the diet through three primary classes of macronutrients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Proteins</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Carbohydrates</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fats</p><p></p><p>Acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges (AMDRs) indicate the range of intake for a particular energy source, expressed as a percentage of total caloric intake that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intakes of essential nutrients  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69697" href="/z/d/graphic/69697.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Macronutrient intake should be considered in the nutritional assessment and recommendations for dietary modifications to ensure appropriate intake and distribution of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Finding a nutritional balance as well as meeting recommended dietary intakes can often be challenging when food groups are eliminated due to food allergies.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Protein</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many excellent sources of protein are also common allergens, including cow's milk, hen's egg, soy, fish, shellfish, peanut, and tree nuts. Diets must be carefully planned to meet protein needs for optimal nutrition (and growth in children) when high-quality protein sources are eliminated from the diet.</p><p>Although rare in affluent countries when unrelated to chronic illness, cases of protein malnutrition have been reported in patients on elimination diets [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In a review of 12 cases of kwashiorkor referred to tertiary care centers in the United States (age range 1 to 22 months), one-half were the result of a deliberate deviation from a standard diet due to suspected food allergies without adequate protein in the diet [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Inadequate dietary protein intake may also contribute to decreased stature reportedly seen in children with food allergies [<a href="#rid9">9,21</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5883.html" rel="external">"Malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings: Clinical assessment"</a>.)</p><p>Quality and quantity of dietary protein must be considered as well as total energy intake when assessing adequacy of protein in the diet [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The AMDR for protein is 5 to 20 percent for children 1 to 3 years of age, 10 to 30 percent for children 4 to 18 years of age, and 10 to 35 percent for adults. Dietary protein recommendations are based upon the assumption that energy intake is adequate. If energy intake is insufficient, free amino acids will be oxidized for energy, allowing for fewer available amino acids for anabolic and synthetic pathways [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The ideal protein-energy ratio for children with malnutrition (wasting) requires calculation and is based upon energy needs for desired catch up-growth. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2874.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children younger than two years in resource-abundant settings: Management", section on 'Estimation of energy requirements'</a>.)</p><p>Dietary protein recommendations are also based upon an estimated 65 to 70 percent of protein intake coming from sources of high biologic value, typically animal products, which contain a full complement of essential amino acids. Animal products are not necessary to provide optimal protein, but most alternative sources from plants (eg, legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, and vegetables) do not contain a full complement of essential amino acids. Thus, a diet without animal products requires greater dietary planning to ensure that a variety of plant-based foods are provided throughout the day to meet essential amino acid needs. It is not necessary to combine proteins in each meal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5357.html" rel="external">"Dietary history and recommended dietary intake in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5353.html" rel="external">"Vegetarian diets for children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Fat</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dietary fat is an important source of energy, supports the transport of fat-soluble vitamins, and provides the two essential fatty acids (EFAs), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA). Assessing fat intake in the patient with food allergy is a simple but often overlooked step in the nutrition evaluation.</p><p>The AMDR for fat is 25 to 35 percent of total energy intake for older children and adults (30 to 40 percent for children one to three years of age). The risk of insufficient energy, vitamin E, and EFAs increases when fat intake falls below 20 percent of the total dietary energy intake [<a href="#rid19">19,22</a>]. The AMDR for LA and ALA is 5 to 10 percent and 0.6 to 1.2 percent, respectively, for children one year of age and older and adults. Although EFA deficiency is rare, the amount and type of dietary fat present in the diet will determine if fat intake is healthful. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5360.html" rel="external">"Micronutrient deficiencies associated with protein-energy malnutrition in children"</a>.)</p><p>To meet fat recommendations (AMDR), most dietary fats should come from monounsaturated and polyunsaturated sources  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80214" href="/z/d/graphic/80214.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Intake of saturated should be limited to &lt;10 percent of total energy intake in children greater than two years of age and adults [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Trans fat intake should be kept as low as possible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4555.html" rel="external">"Dietary fat"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2866.html" rel="external">"Dietary recommendations for toddlers and preschool and school-age children", section on 'Energy and macronutrient balance'</a>.)</p><p>The recommended intake for LA is easily met as LA is abundant in most diets and is found in a wide variety of vegetable oils  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80214" href="/z/d/graphic/80214.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51635" href="/z/d/graphic/51635.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). ALA is less abundantly found, and the best sources tend to be from more commonly allergenic foods, such as fatty fish, certain nuts, and seeds.</p><p>Dietary fat is present in a wide variety of foods, such as dairy products, hen's eggs, meat, fish, poultry, nuts, avocado, vegetable oils and margarines, and many convenience foods. Treatment of food allergy often results in the elimination of the allergen as well as many manufactured food products that contain the allergen. The resulting diet tends to come from primarily whole foods rather than processed foods, which may result in inadequate fat intake if additional fat is not added to the diet.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Replacement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vegetable oils are easily added to the allergen-restricted diet when fat and EFA needs are not met  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80214" href="/z/d/graphic/80214.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51635" href="/z/d/graphic/51635.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Refined oils (as opposed to unrefined oils such as cold-pressed oils) do not contain significant amounts of allergenic protein and therefore are a safe form of dietary fats for most patients with food allergies. The amount and type of oil used is individualized based upon current dietary intake and degree and type of dietary restrictions. Adding fats that are predominantly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated and those that contain at least 10 percent of daily EFA requirements are preferred. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2866.html" rel="external">"Dietary recommendations for toddlers and preschool and school-age children", section on 'Energy and macronutrient balance'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Carbohydrate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Carbohydrates make up the remaining energy sources and supply specific vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Individuals with grain allergies may have an especially difficult time ingesting sufficient carbohydrates without appropriate grain substitutions. In addition to grains, other foods that contribute carbohydrates in the diet are fruits, vegetables, milk products, and legumes. (See <a class="local">'Wheat allergy'</a> below.)</p><p>The AMDR for carbohydrate is between 45 to 65 percent of total caloric intake [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 130 grams/day for children one year of age and older and adults, based upon the role of carbohydrates as the primary source of energy for the brain [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Micronutrients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Micronutrients include vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Variety in the diet, within and among the food groups, contributes to adequacy of all nutrients provided. When a food group is eliminated, many nutrients provided by that food group must now be provided by other dietary sources.</p><p>Dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for micronutrients are available through the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fods.od.nih.gov%2FHealthInformation%2Fnutrientrecommendations.aspx&amp;token=9niZR91xyXLNDlfOIR0I5yDIbdpN%2BvEyQNspw6GD1o%2FdWYhjFOkMe%2FJZ6U8mkDlnDzu1G5uWKZO5zq6pQMHeMCwvUJhEZFVMgRAnobQfwC0%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2388" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health</a>. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5357.html" rel="external">"Dietary history and recommended dietary intake in children", section on 'Dietary reference intakes'</a>.)</p><p>It is important to ensure adequate intake of all essential nutrients in children with food allergies. However, there is a greater risk of insufficiency of certain nutrients, depending upon the food allergen(s) avoided. These nutrients must be adequately replaced by other foods in the diet  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55081" href="/z/d/graphic/55081.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54072" href="/z/d/graphic/54072.html" rel="external">table 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74067" href="/z/d/graphic/74067.html" rel="external">table 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72372" href="/z/d/graphic/72372.html" rel="external">table 6</a>).</p><p>Supplementation of micronutrients is considered when dietary modifications are inadequate to meet vitamin, mineral, and trace element needs. However, dietary supplements may contain or be contaminated with the very food allergen(s) the patient is trying to avoid. Thus, supplements should be assessed for allergen content prior to use [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">MONITORING GROWTH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Growth in children is a good indicator of adequate energy and protein intake. Weight is the most sensitive measure of energy intake and is affected earlier and to a greater extent than stature by dietary inadequacies.

These milk substitutes are low in protein and/or fat and micronutrients and do not provide comparable nutrition with whole cow's milk, breast milk, or hypoallergenic formula. In addition to the poor nutritional quality of rice milk beverage, the presence of inorganic arsenic makes it a poor daily milk substitute for young children. Young children drink a relatively large amount of milk/milk substitute relative to their body weight. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not issued specific guidance for the use of rice beverage as a milk substitute in young children, the European Food Standards Agency does not recommend the use of rice beverage as a daily milk substitute for children under 4.5 years of age based on the poor nutritional quality and inorganic arsenic content [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p>Enriched soy or pea protein beverages may be appropriate alternatives for older toddlers, if tolerated, and provide dietary calcium, vitamin D, and protein amounts similar to cow's milk  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74819" href="/z/d/graphic/74819.html" rel="external">table 7</a>).

The risk of inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D among children with CMA is decreased if a dairy-free enriched soy beverage or commercially prepared hypoallergenic infant/toddler formula is provided [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

Excessive intake of a nutritionally inferior milk substitute or juice may displace nutrients from other dietary sources resulting in subsequent deficiencies, particularly protein, fat, and energy.</p><p>There are numerous other "dairy-free" products on the market, such as plant-based yogurt and cheese. However, not all "dairy-free" products are cow's milk protein free; therefore, reading all ingredient labels is imperative. As an example, casein is an ingredient in a rice cheese brand. Additionally, many of these products are manufactured on shared equipment with milk products and run the risk of cross contact with milk. It is possible to find some dairy-like products that are truly milk protein free and manufactured on dedicated equipment or in a suitable way to prevent cross contact. The nutritional contribution of these foods should be evaluated, however, as they are not comparable with the cow's milk versions. As an example, coconut yogurt is essentially protein free.

However, the reverse may not be true, since rye and barley are also gluten-containing grains; therefore, a product made with barley may be wheat free but not gluten free. One issue is that many of these flours and products are not well fortified. Additionally, they may be lower in fiber. When choosing alternatives to wheat, the nutritional quality of the alternative flour or product should be considered. Choosing whole or enriched grains greatly improves the nutritional quality of the diet.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malnutrition</strong> – Dietary limitations due to food allergy can lead to malnutrition due to deficits in total energy and/or deficiencies in specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements). The specific impact varies depending upon the food or foods avoided. (See <a class="local">'General nutrition and food allergy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Energy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Protein'</a> above and <a class="local">'Fat'</a> above and <a class="local">'Carbohydrate'</a> above and <a class="local">'Micronutrients'</a> above and <a class="local">'Referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Referral to a registered dietitian</strong> – Patients with food allergies should be referred to a registered dietitian familiar with food allergies to avoid nutritional deficiencies and plan for a diet that promotes health. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Effect on growth in children</strong> – Children with food allergies are at greater risk of inadequate growth than those without food allergies. Thus, their growth (both length/height and weight) should be monitored closely. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring growth'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dietary substitutions</strong> – Measures that are essential to preventing inadequate growth and suboptimal nutrition include recommending nutrient-dense alternatives to the eliminated food at the time of diagnosis and following up to ensure that the alternative food is accepted and incorporated into the diet.
