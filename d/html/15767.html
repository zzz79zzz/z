The pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells required for this procedure are usually obtained from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of a related or unrelated donor. Umbilical cord blood (UCB), the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta following the birth of an infant, has emerged as an established alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells in allogeneic HCT.</p><p>Engraftment and survival rates following HCT are optimized when the donor and recipient are genetically compatible. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors are generally the preferred donor source for an allogeneic HCT. Unfortunately, finding an HLA-matched sibling is not always possible. Each full sibling potential donor has only a 25 percent chance of being fully HLA-matched with a sibling requiring a transplant. Therefore, most patients do not have an HLA-identical relative. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3535.html" rel="external">"Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Matched sibling donors'</a>.)</p><p>When a suitable related donor is not available, a search is conducted to identify a potential unrelated HLA-matched donor. Finding an appropriate donor through a national registry is a lengthy process that is not always successful, especially for individuals who are not of Northern European descent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3535.html" rel="external">"Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Unrelated donors'</a>.)</p><p>In comparison, the relative ease of procurement and the lower than anticipated risk of severe acute graft versus host disease has made unrelated UCB transplantation a possible alternative to unrelated donor bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant. The increased representation of ethnic underrepresented groups and the ability to use partially HLA-matched UCB units significantly expands the donor pool. In addition, the use of reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative preparative regimens to allow engraftment of UCB broadens the scope of patients who may benefit from allogeneic HCT, including older adult and medically infirm patients without an HLA-matched sibling donor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16563.html" rel="external">"Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Features of UCB grafts'</a>.)</p><p>The use of UCB transplantation in adults using myeloablative and non-myeloablative preparative regimens will be discussed here. Other issues related to UCB are discussed separately, including the advantages and limitations of using UCB as a graft, the collection, storage, and ethical issues regarding the use of UCB for HCT, and the selection of an UCB graft for a particular recipient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3531.html" rel="external">"Collection and storage of umbilical cord blood for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H61606400"><span class="h1">CORD BLOOD AS A RESOURCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unrelated UCB offers many practical advantages over unrelated donor bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells as a source of hematopoietic stem cells, including an expanded donor pool, ease of procurement and lack of donor attrition, and decreased graft-versus-host disease. Limitations to UCB included an increased risk of graft failure, delayed immune reconstitution, and unavailability of the donor for additional donations (ie, donor lymphocyte infusions). This is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16563.html" rel="external">"Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Features of UCB grafts'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H61606408"><span class="h1">CORD BLOOD UNIT SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main criteria for selecting UCB unit(s) for transplantation are the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype and the cryopreserved total nucleated cell dose per kilogram recipient body weight. This is discussed in more detail separately.

These approaches have not been compared directly in a prospective trial. As such, the ideal preparative regimen prior to UCB infusion is unknown and clinical practice varies by institution. Options include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myeloablative regimens</strong> – A myeloablative conditioning regimen consists of a single agent or combination of agents expected to destroy the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and produce profound pancytopenia within one to three weeks from the time of administration. The resulting pancytopenia is long-lasting, usually irreversible, and in most instances fatal, unless hematopoiesis is restored by infusion of hematopoietic stem cells. An example of a myeloablative regimen commonly used for UCBT is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8452" href="/z/d/drug information/8452.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a> 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> 120 mg/kg, and total body irradiation 13.2 Gy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3557.html" rel="external">"Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Myeloablative regimens'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Non-myeloablative (reduced intensity) regimens</strong> – A non-myeloablative regimen is one that combines the anti-leukemia effect of more modest doses of chemotherapy with the objective of achieving significant immunosuppression (to allow engraftment), thereby causing less organ and mucosal damage than myeloablative regimens. "Non-myeloablative" is probably not the most appropriate term, since the doses of alkylating agents typically used will result in long period of severe cytopenias prior to marrow recovery. An example of a non-myeloablative regimen commonly used for UCBT is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8452" href="/z/d/drug information/8452.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a> 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> 50 mg/kg, and total body irradiation 200 cGy (Flu/Cy/TBI 200 cGy) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3557.html" rel="external">"Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'NMA and RIC regimens'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>For younger patients without comorbidities, we suggest a myeloablative preparative regimen such as those used in the initial studies of UCBT. However, many older patients and patients with co-morbidities are not candidates for myeloablative preparative regimens due to high rates of morbidity and mortality with this approach. Because of toxicities from the intensive conditioning regimens to non-marrow organs such as gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, and heart, UCBT using myeloablative preparative regimen have been restricted to patients younger than 50 to 55 years of age, with none of the series reported thus far including patients older than 60 years of age.</p><p>Non-myeloablative conditioning regimens are an acceptable alternative for patients who are not candidates for myeloablative regimens. The ability to achieve stable mixed or full donor chimerism using these regimens, with successful eradication of primary disease in the absence of severe therapy-related toxicity in preliminary clinical studies, signifies an advance in the field of transplantation and immunobiology. However, there are several unresolved issues and remaining questions regarding the utility of this novel strategy, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How does the efficacy of non-myeloablative UCBT differ from that of myeloablative UCBT?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there a difference in the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What is the optimal GVHD prophylaxis for patients undergoing non-myeloablative UCBT?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How does immune reconstitution differ from that after myeloablative UCBT?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does the incidence of infection differ from that seen in myeloablative UCBT?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What is the optimal non-myeloablative preparative regimen?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does non-myeloablative UCBT require a different UCB cell dose?</p><p></p><p>Future studies should address these questions and carefully define the indications for non-myeloablative versus myeloablative preparative regimens. The benefit of reduced toxicity with non-myeloablative regimens may be offset by the loss of cytoreduction of the tumor cells induced by high dose chemotherapy. The use of non-myeloablative regimens has generally been more successful in patients with indolent lymphoid malignancies or malignancies that are susceptible to graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects, such as chronic myeloid leukemia. It is less successful in patients with aggressive malignancies or malignancies that appear relatively insensitive to GVL effect, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and high grade lymphoma. The rapid proliferation of these malignancies may outpace the developing immune response. Given the limitation of cell dose of UCB and logistic problem in donor recall, non-myeloablative UCBT does not afford the same advantage as in non-myeloablative transplant using hematopoietic stem cells from an adult donor, in which the transplant provides a platform for repeated delivery of adoptive cellular immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusions or other cellular therapies. In the case of an aggressive malignancy where the delayed graft-versus-malignancy effect cannot be relied upon, it may be more beneficial to use a preparative regimen ("reduced toxicity" ablative regimen) that provides some disease control and also facilitates engraftment.</p><p>Another important issue is the potential of non-myeloablative UCBT to minimize the in-patient stay and improve quality of life in the peri-transplant period, while reducing cost. The majority of patients at our institution have non-myeloablative transplantation performed largely in the outpatient setting. The median time for hematopoietic recovery is shorter than conventional UCBT. Longer follow-up with larger number of patients will be needed to determine the incidence of chronic GVHD and the quality of life of such recipients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1254174"><span class="h2">Myeloablative preparative regimens</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H61606828"><span class="h3">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Myeloablative preparative regimens have been used to successfully engraft both related and unrelated UCB in adults and children with hematological malignancies, marrow failure syndromes, and immune deficiencies. The results of several large series have been reported in the peer-reviewed literature [<a href="#rid3">3-15</a>]. The myeloablative preparative regimens employed in these studies were either total body irradiation (TBI)-based or chemotherapy-based, with inclusion of antithymocyte globulin in some of the patients. The data from these UCBT registries, in which the majority of the recipients were children, point to significant delay in the time of neutrophil recovery, with the median time to absolute neutrophil count &gt;500/microL ranging between 22 to 30 days. The overall probability of engraftment was between 80 and 90 percent. Despite a higher degree of HLA disparity, grade II to IV GVHD in those unrelated UCB recipients is lower than recipients of unrelated bone marrow or peripheral blood grafts from adult donors. (See <a class="local">'Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)'</a> below.)</p><p>Much of the initial data on UCBT were recorded in patients with very advanced disease with the expected poor results. Given significant improvements in understanding the biology of cord blood cells, importance of cell dose, use of double UCBT, and better patient selection, the outcomes following UCBT have improved. Analyses of registry data have compared the outcomes of UCB with unrelated bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An analysis of Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database compared outcomes of<sup> </sup>503 children with acute leukemia given an unrelated mismatched<sup> </sup>UCBT with 282 unrelated BM transplant recipients (116 HLA allele<sup> </sup>matched 8 out of 8) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. HLA allele mismatched BM recipients had<sup> </sup>more acute and chronic GVHD but similar rates of leukemia-free<sup> </sup>survival (LFS). The data demonstrated that even with an allele-matched BM donor, LFS was not statistically different from one<sup> </sup>or two HLA disparate UCBT. HLA-matched UCBT recipients<sup> </sup>had better outcomes compared with HLA allele matched BM recipients.<sup> </sup>In addition, there was higher transplant-related mortality (TRM)<sup> </sup>in children receiving a low UCB cell dose (&lt;3 x 10<sup>7</sup>/kg)<sup> </sup>and 5 of 6 HLA disparate UCB graft or in children given a 4 of 6 HLA disparate<sup> </sup>UCBT, independently of the cell dose infused. Also of interest was the observation that there was a lower incidence of relapse with the use of two cord blood units. This latter finding has also been observed by the group at the University of Minnesota [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An analysis of the Eurocord database compared the outcome of 442 children who underwent matched unrelated BM (either T depleted or replete) transplant with 99 children who underwent mismatched UCBT [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. After UCBT, engraftment was delayed and GVHD was reduced<sup> </sup>similarly to T cell depleted BM transplant. The relapse rate and the disease-free survival were equivalent in this analysis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another Eurocord analysis compared adults with acute leukemia receiving<sup> </sup>either a matched unrelated BM transplant (584 patients) or a mismatched UCBT (98 patients) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Despite a delay of engraftment, UCBT gave a similar leukemia-free<sup> </sup>survival to BM transplantation. Similar data were observed in the CIBMTR and<sup> </sup>New York Cord Blood Bank (NYCBB) where UCBT resulted in similar LFS survival to one antigen mismatched UBMT [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis included 161<sup> </sup>children and 316 adults undergoing UCBT along with 316 children and 996 adults undergoing unrelated BM transplantation and excluded T cell<sup> </sup>depleted unrelated BM transplant [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Pooled comparisons<sup> </sup>in children found that the incidence<sup> </sup>of chronic GVHD was lower with UCBT, but the incidence of grade<sup> </sup>III/IV acute GVHD did not differ. There was no difference<sup> </sup>in two-year overall survival in children. For adults, there was no statistical difference between TRM and LFS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A subsequent retrospective analysis included 1525 adults who underwent UCB (165 patients), mobilized PBPCs (888 patients), or BM (472 patients) transplantation with a myeloablative preparative regimen between 2002 and 2006 for acute leukemia [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. UCB units were 6 of 6 HLA-matched (10 patients), 5 of 6 HLA-matched (40 patients), or 4 of 6 HLA-matched (115 patients) based upon testing for HLA-A and HLA-B at antigen level and HLA-DRB1 at allele level. PBPCs and BM grafts from unrelated adult donors were matched for allele-level HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1 (632 and 332 patients, respectively), or mismatched at one locus (256 and 140 patients, respectively). UCBT resulted in the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Similar LFS as that after 8/8 and 7/8 allele-matched PBPC or BM transplantation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Higher rates of TRM than after 8/8 allele-matched PBPC recipients (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.18-2.23) or BM transplantation (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.19-2.39)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lower rates of grade II to IV acute (HR 0.57, 95% 0.42-0.77) and chronic (HR 0.38, 0.27-0.53) GVHD than allele-matched PBPC transplantation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lower rates of chronic (HR 0.63, 0.44-0.90), but not acute, GVHD than after 8/8 allele-matched BM transplantation</p><p></p><p>These results support the use of a myeloablative preparative regimen followed by UCBT in adults who do not have an HLA-matched unrelated adult donor available.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H426439939"><span class="h3">Toxicity and transplant-related mortality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data regarding the toxicity and TRM of myeloablative UCBT are derived from case series and retrospective analyses of highly select, predominantly pediatric, patient populations. These studies have reported TRM between 27 and 39 percent at 100 days post-transplant and between 30 and 44 percent at one year post-transplant [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. A relatively higher incidence of TRM at 100 days post-transplant has been observed in adults, ranging between 43 and 56 percent [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. The high non-relapse mortality in these series is partially attributable to the high risk nature of the patient population. Infection and acute GVHD are the main causes of death within the first 100 days of transplant. Organ toxicity associated<sup> </sup>with the intensive treatment administered to patients before UCBT is another leading cause of nonrelapse mortality in adult UCB recipients.</p><p>Given the heterogeneity of the<sup> </sup>patient populations, conditioning regimens, GVHD prophylaxis, and supportive care, it is difficult to reliably evaluate<sup> </sup>the impact of pre-transplant variables on TRM. However, among prognostic variables that have been evaluated, increased cell dose of the UCB graft and improved matching by having more units available has resulted in better outcomes [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Future efforts to lower TRM should focus on improving transplant methodology and supportive care. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16563.html" rel="external">"Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Cell dose'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H61606857"><span class="h4">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When compared with recipients of BM or PBPCs, adults receiving UCB have a higher risk of opportunistic infections for up to two to three years after transplantation. Infection may account for half of all treatment-related-death after UCBT following an ablative regimen. Apart from the prolonged neutropenia associated with myeloablative UCBT, the risk of infection may be an intrinsic property of UCB, because UCB have been shown to be phenotypically naïve [<a href="#rid24">24</a>] and to expand slowly in response to antigen stimulation, demonstrated a higher threshold for cytokine stimulation, and possess a lower effective cytotoxicity relative to adult donor T cell controls. Moreover, thymic production of new T cells is substantially delayed and remains limited in adult recipients of UCB following an ablative preparative regimen.</p><p>The increased risk of infection within the first 100 days of UCBT may be related to delayed engraftment, GVHD, and impaired immune recovery. Immune dysfunction is at least partially related to the UCB cell dose.

While the total numbers of mononuclear cells in UCB are limited, the progenitor content and the proliferative potential of cord blood cells are high. Non-myeloablative preparative regimens allow engraftment of the UCB stem cells, establishing full-donor chimerism with a lower risk of transplantation-related morbidity in older patients and in patients who are deemed unfit to undergo transplantation using conventional myeloablative preparative regimens.</p><p>The nature and extent of prior cytotoxic therapy is recognized as an important factor in the likelihood of donor stem cell engraftment following non-myeloablative bone marrow conditioning. It is assumed that patients carrying the diagnosis of acute leukemia or lymphoma will have had significant cytotoxic chemotherapy exposure prior to transplantation. In contrast, many patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, and certainly those patients with non-malignant conditions, will enter UCBT with little or no prior cytotoxic therapy. Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy exposure is not specifically addressed in the published non-myeloablative UCBT studies to date. It should be noted that fewer than 5 percent of the patients in the largest of the prospective studies carried the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome or non-malignant disorders [<a href="#rid33">33,39</a>]. Therefore, the likelihood of donor engraftment of the UCB stem cells following non-myeloablative conditioning may be considerably lower in the previously untreated subset of patients compared with what is reported in these studies.

A wide range of non-myeloablative conditioning regimens has been employed. These regimens are designed not to eradicate the underlying malignancy but to provide sufficient immunosuppression to facilitate engraftment. The question posed is how immunosuppressed the patients need to be to overcome the risk of graft rejection. The benefit of reduced toxicity with non-myeloablative regimens may be offset by the loss of cytoreduction induced by high dose chemotherapy. </p><p>As noted above, the use of non-myeloablative UCBT has generally been less successful in aggressive malignancies that are likely to recur rapidly and outpace immune reconstitution. Given the increasing indication of applying non-myeloablative UCBT in older patients with refractory malignancies, future efforts may focus on the development of a more tolerable regimen that has broad anti-neoplastic and immunosuppressive activity that not only facilitates engraftment, but also provides some disease control. The challenge becomes greater when mismatched UCBT is used, where HLA disparity and lower cell dose is associated with higher risk of graft rejection. Further studies are necessary to define the best regimen that reduces the risk of rejection without increasing the risk of relapse and regimen-related toxicity.

The ability of patients receiving non-myeloablative transplantation to recover within a few months suggests that the peripheral "niches" in which T cells can proliferate are preserved in these patients compared with those receiving myeloablative regimens. Moreover, the presence of TREC-positive cells within one year suggests that thymic recovery is likewise accelerated in recipients of non-myeloablative regimens compared with recipients of myeloablative regimens. These favorable results of T cell recovery suggest that it may be possible to have an excellent outcome with an unrelated mismatched UCBT in adult patients who are unable to undergo myeloablative conditioning. The primary difference between the recipients of myeloablative and non-myeloablative regimens is the extent of physiologic damage caused by the preparatory regimen. When the damage is relatively mild, as in non-myeloablative regimen, the donor T cells are able to expand effectively in the periphery and the development of new T cells through the thymus is also accelerated compared with the rate of development in those receiving ablative regimens.

The risk of infection in both myeloablative and non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients are dependent on the degree of immuno/myeloablation, severity of GVHD and its immunosuppressive therapies, as well as the rate of immune reconstitution. Preliminary results suggest that non-myeloablative conditioning regimens may decrease risks of bacterial infections associated with mucosal damage and persistent neutropenia; however, risks for late viral and fungal infections persist during severe GVHD [<a href="#rid48">48</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1254244"><span class="h4">Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>UCBT has been associated with a reduced risk of developing severe GVHD in children and adults, even when cells from partially HLA-mismatched donors are used. Non-myeloablative preparative regimens were introduced with the hope that patients would experience less GVHD following reduced intensity conditioning regimens. This was based on the hypothesis that less tissue injury would occur due to lower dose of cytotoxic agents and the induction of mixed chimerism could reduce the incidence of GVHD. However, GVHD remains the significant cause of morbidity and mortality following non-myeloablative conditioning. Previously published reports on non-myeloablative have shown a 38 to 60 percent incidence of grade II to IV of acute GVHD [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].<sup> </sup>The early data suggest that the incidence of acute GVHD is somewhat lower compared with myeloablative regimens.</p><p>In addition, studies on immune recovery have shed some light of hope that patients undergoing non-myeloablative UCBT may experience less GVHD. These studies on immune reconstitution among patients receiving following UCBT and bone marrow transplantation have demonstrated the potential benefit of minimizing thymic damage through non-myeloablative conditioning. The early restoration of thymic function could allow early dominance of thymus-dependent phase and thus preventing the exclusive expansion of peripheral T cell clones. In addition, the increased level of T cell repertoire complexity observed in patients receiving non-myeloablative regimens may lead to increased numbers of alloreactive immunoregulatory cells such as those marked by CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> expression and thereby suppressing GVHD. Nevertheless, determining whether the incidence and severity of GVHD following non-myeloablative conditioning and UCBT is lower than myeloablative UCBT will require clinical trials in comparable groups of patients.</p><p>GVHD remains the leading cause of death among patients receiving non-myeloablative conditioning. Thus, optimizing the GVHD prophylaxis regimen is of paramount importance in improving the transplantation outcome. Although acute GVHD tends to be less severe after a non-myeloablative preparative regimen, it frequently occurs after the early termination of immunosuppressive therapy. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1254265"><span class="h1">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Umbilical cord blood (UCB), the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta following the birth of an infant, has emerged as an established alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>UCB transplantation (UCBT) has been performed in adults using both myeloablative and non-myeloablative preparative regimens.
