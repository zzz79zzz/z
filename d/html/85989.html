However, because these are unexpected, devastating conditions, concerted efforts have been made to continue to find evidence-based strategies to reduce or prevent these events.</p><p>The incidence, etiology, and prodromal signs of SCA/SCD in children and adolescents will be reviewed here. In addition, the role of screening to prevent pediatric SCA/SCD and the approach to evaluating survivors of SCA and victims of SCD will also be discussed.</p><p>The management of children with cardiopulmonary arrest is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6392.html" rel="external">"Pediatric advanced life support (PALS)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6311.html" rel="external">"Technique of defibrillation and cardioversion in children (including automated external defibrillation)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H192520693"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The reported incidence of SCA/SCD in children and young adults ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 per 100,000 person-years [<a href="#rid1">1-11</a>]. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that approximately 1500 people under 25 years of age die each year of SCD [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The mortality rate for children presenting to the emergency department after SCD is approximately 90 percent [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Most studies have shown a bimodal age distribution, with higher incidence rates in infancy and adolescence/young adulthood [<a href="#rid6">6,8,13</a>]. In one report, the male to female ratio was 1.7:1 [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>In a population-based study from the state of Washington (1980 to 2009), the overall incidence of SCA among people aged 0 to 35 years was 2.28 per 100,000 person-years [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Incidence rates and survival rates varied according to age:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>0 to 2 years – 2.1 cases per 100,000 person-years; 27 percent survival</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>3 to 13 years – 0.61 cases per 100,000 person-years; 40 percent survival</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>14 to 25 years – 1.44 cases per 100,000 person-years; 37 percent survival</p><p></p><p>Overall survival improved considerably over the course of the study period (from 13 percent in the 1980s to 40 percent in the 2000s), which the authors attributed to improvements in the community-based emergency medical services and changes in resuscitation protocols.</p><p>In a prospective study carried out in Australia and New Zealand from 2010 to 2012, the annual incidence of SCD among people age 1 to 35 years was 1.3 cases per 100,000; 72 percent of cases involved boys or young men [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>In a report using data from the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths database (2005 to 2009), 1098 cases of pediatric cardiovascular deaths were identified [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In this cohort, there was a male predominance (58 percent); 71 percent were White, 22 percent were Black, and 20 percent were Hispanic.</p><p>Approximately one-half to three-quarters of victims of SCA/SCD do not have antecedent symptoms prior to the event; however, a significant minority of patients do have antecedent symptoms (see <a class="local">'Warning signs'</a> below). In a population-based study from Denmark, antecedent symptoms were noted days to years prior to SCD in 45 percent of cases [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The most common antecedent symptoms were syncope, dyspnea, and seizure. Two-thirds of the SCD cases in this study had no previous medical history, whereas 18 percent had known cardiac disease.</p><p>Whether exercise and athletic activity increase the risk of SCA/SCD is uncertain [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In the prospective study from Australia and New Zealand, most cases of SCD occurred while the person was sleeping (38 percent) or at rest (27 percent), whereas SCD during exercise (11 percent) or after exercise (4 percent) was relatively uncommon [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In the previously described study from Washington state, among the SCA cases in which the relationship with exercise could be determined (n = 302), 25 percent occurred within one hour of exercise [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H192520700"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In many cases of SCA/SCD, the cause is not identified.

In young children (&lt;2 years old), CHD is a major cause, while primary arrhythmia and myocarditis are less common. In adolescents and young adults, primary arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis are more common and CHD is a less common cause of SCA/SCD. Premature atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is an uncommon cause of SCA/SCD in patients &lt;25 years old. However, children and adolescents can have coronary disease from Kawasaki disease or anomalous origin of the coronary arteries, which may cause SCD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114918.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Management and prognosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1536.html" rel="external">"Congenital and pediatric coronary artery abnormalities"</a>.)</p><p>The etiology of SCA/SCD in young competitive athletes may differ somewhat from the general population. This is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/986.html" rel="external">"Athletes: Overview of sudden cardiac death risk and sport participation", section on 'Etiology of sudden death'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H268779936"><span class="h1">WARNING SIGNS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H899181607"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although SCA/SCD is often the initial presenting event, retrospective studies have shown that warning signs or symptoms (eg, chest pain, fatigue, and syncope/lightheadedness) were noted by one-quarter to more than one-half of affected individuals prior to SCA/SCD [<a href="#rid15">15,17,18</a>]. The most common symptoms were chest pain and syncope/presyncope. Other symptoms included dizziness, palpitations, or dyspnea. It is important to note that these are nonspecific symptoms that occur commonly in the general pediatric and adolescent population. Thus, whether they truly are warning signs remains uncertain. None of these studies included a control group. </p><p>In addition to preceding symptoms, many patients (25 to 61 percent) who experience SCA/SCD have a family history of premature unexpected death in other family members [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].</p><p>In a study based on surveys completed by parents of 86 children and young adults (&lt;30 years old) with SCA, at least one prior cardiovascular symptom was reported by 70 percent of respondents [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Fatigue (44 percent) and near syncope/lightheadedness (30 percent) were the most common complaints, with onset of symptoms on average 30 months prior to SCA. In addition, 24 percent of SCA victims had one or more events (average 2.6) of syncope or unexplained seizure-like activity that remained undiagnosed before SCA. In approximately 40 percent of cases, the symptom was brought to the attention of the child's clinician, and 27 percent of families reported a history of a family member who had suffered SCD before 50 years of age.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3565050445"><span class="h2">Differential diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prodromal symptoms described above are nonspecific and noncardiac causes should also be considered. The distinction can often be made based upon the presentation, though sometimes additional tests are necessary to exclude underlying cardiac disease.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Syncope</strong> – In children, the most likely cause of syncope or presyncope is neurocardiogenic syncope, also referred to as vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope is often triggered by pain or fear and is commonly accompanied by premonitory symptoms before collapse, such as lightheadedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, nausea, and tunnel vision. In contrast, syncope associated with arrhythmia generally occurs without warning or during exercise, or is associated with chest pain or palpitations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other less common causes of pediatric syncope include migraine headaches, seizures, and brain tumors. These conditions, like vasovagal syncope, are associated with prodromal symptoms or, in the case of seizures, a postictal state and incontinence. The causes and evaluation of pediatric syncope are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6466.html" rel="external">"Causes of syncope in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6464.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of syncope in children and adolescents", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chest pain</strong> – Chest pain is a common finding in children and is generally due to musculoskeletal conditions, such as costochondritis or trauma. In contrast, cardiac disease is an uncommon cause of chest pain [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Patients with cardiomyopathies or abnormalities of the coronary arteries or aorta may present with chest pain, but chest pain is very uncommon in patients with primary electrical disorders. Cardiac disease is more likely if chest pain occurs during exertion, is recurrent, or is accompanied by palpitations or syncope. The approach to evaluation of chest pain in children is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6469.html" rel="external">"Nontraumatic chest pain in children and adolescents: Approach and initial management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Respiratory difficulties/dyspnea on exertion</strong> – Common noncardiac causes of respiratory symptoms in children include asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Patients with cardiomyopathy, structural heart disease, and arrhythmia may present with dyspnea on exertion. Exercise-induced bronchospasm associated with cardiomyopathy is generally unresponsive to bronchodilator therapy, which differentiates it from asthma. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can help differentiate cardiac from pulmonary limitation of functional capacity, particularly when the cause is unclear from the history and physical examination. Causes of respiratory distress and the assessment of children who present with respiratory difficulties are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16315.html" rel="external">"Causes of acute respiratory distress in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H780323955"><span class="h2">Electrocardiogram findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are obtained in children for a variety of reasons (evaluation of concerning symptoms, screening prior to starting certain medications). A high-quality 12-lead ECG, with standard paper speed and amplitudes, is necessary to make accurate measurements and avoid artifact in ECG interpretation. It is important to recognize potentially pathologic ECG findings and distinguish them from findings that are generally benign. Though the distinction can often be made by the non-cardiologist, consultation with a pediatric cardiologist may be warranted.</p><p>ECG findings that warrant further evaluation (which, depending on the finding, may include review of the history and physical examination, echocardiography, ambulatory ECG monitoring, implantable loop recorder, stress testing, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and/or or genetic testing) include the following [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prominent/abnormal Q waves – Q waves &gt;3 mm in depth and/or &gt;40 ms duration in at least two leads are characteristic findings for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef110278" href="/d/graphic/110278.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a>).
