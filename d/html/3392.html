These approaches have been applied for patients with unresectable cancers and those with resectable disease in whom a functional organ-preservation technique is either of equivalent oncological benefit or preferred. (See <a class="local">'Available techniques'</a> below.)</p><p>The general application of these approaches to patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer arising in the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx will be reviewed here. More detailed discussions for locoregionally advanced cancer of each of these sites, plus a review of the management of advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, are presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3389.html" rel="external">"Treatment of locoregionally advanced (stage III and IV) head and neck cancer: The oral cavity"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3385.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer: The oropharynx"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3402.html" rel="external">"Treatment of locoregionally advanced (stage III and IV) head and neck cancer: The larynx and hypopharynx"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3372.html" rel="external">"Treatment of early and locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1049946212"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO FUNCTIONAL ORGAN PRESERVATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2982490408"><span class="h2">Available techniques</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer, combined modality functional organ-preservation approaches that are nonsurgical include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Concurrent chemoradiation </strong>– Chemotherapy is administered at the same time as radiation therapy (RT). This approach has also included various schedules in which cycles of induction chemotherapy are alternated with RT [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Chemotherapy plus definitive locoregional therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Induction chemotherapy </strong>– Chemotherapy administered prior to definitive RT.

However, even with significant tumor volume reduction, the target volume should be based upon the anatomic compartments that encompass the pretreatment sites of gross disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Induction chemotherapy could treat subclinical distant metastatic disease without delay, especially in patients with advanced disease in the lymph nodes who are at risk of distant failure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A favorable initial response to induction chemotherapy can predict efficacy for further functional organ-preserving therapy such as chemoradiation. In contrast, an unfavorable response to induction chemotherapy may signal some form of primary tumor resistance, and alternative treatments may be necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3364.html" rel="external">"Treatment of metastatic and recurrent head and neck cancer", section on 'Subsequent therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The administration of chemotherapy concurrently with RT may sensitize tumor cells to the effects of radiation and thus overcome radiation resistance. Reduction of repopulation between radiation treatment fractions may also contribute to the benefits of concurrent chemotherapy. This could improve locoregional control and organ preservation. If systemically active doses of chemotherapy are administered, it may also have direct cytotoxic effects. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3371.html" rel="external">"Methods to overcome radiation resistance in head and neck cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sequential therapy, the combination of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation, may combine the benefits of both induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiation.</p><p></p><p>However, in some patients, concurrent chemoradiation alone may be preferred over induction chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy is most appropriate for patients with good performance status and minimal comorbidities who are able to manage treatment-related toxicities. However, such toxicity may limit patient compliance and delay or prevent the completion of subsequent chemoradiation.</p><p>When the tumor has already destroyed the organ, functional organ-preservation approaches are usually not appropriate, and surgery is generally preferred. This situation occurs most frequently in patients with far advanced laryngeal or oral cavity cancers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3402.html" rel="external">"Treatment of locoregionally advanced (stage III and IV) head and neck cancer: The larynx and hypopharynx", section on 'Total laryngectomy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3389.html" rel="external">"Treatment of locoregionally advanced (stage III and IV) head and neck cancer: The oral cavity"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3347738309"><span class="h2">Patient selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Combined approaches using chemotherapy and definitive RT are used in patients with both resectable and unresectable disease. The definitions of resectable and unresectable disease vary among practitioners and a large fraction of resectable patients can be treated nonsurgically in an effort to preserve organ anatomy and function:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients whose disease is considered resectable, concurrent chemoradiation with or without induction chemotherapy may be useful as an approach for functional organ preservation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the disease is unresectable then concurrent chemoradiation with or without induction chemotherapy or (in patients not considered to be candidates for multimodality therapy) RT alone are the only treatment options. Such treatment may render the patient free of disease and may result in functional organ preservation. In some cases with persistent disease following completion of chemoradiation, salvage surgery can be performed.</p><p></p><p>Induction chemotherapy and/or concurrent chemoradiation for locally advanced head and neck cancer are associated with significant toxicity that can result in treatment delays or interruptions. Appropriate patient selection is critical to successfully complete therapy. The patient's performance status, comorbidities, age, and psychosocial support network are important factors that need to be considered prior to proceeding with a combined modality approach.</p><p>Key factors to consider in selecting appropriate treatment for an individual patient include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most randomized clinical trials limited enrollment to patients with minimal comorbidities and a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 0 and 1  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901" href="/z/d/graphic/72901.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although older adults have been successfully treated, the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC) meta-analysis found that older patients are less likely to benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to definitive locoregional treatment and the meta-analysis could not demonstrate a benefit in those over 70 years. In fact there is suggestion that in those over 80, the addition of chemotherapy may be harmful [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. Age alone should not be used as a criterion in selecting treatment approaches; rather comorbidities and performance status should be critically assessed in all patients, especially in older adults [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Chemotherapy plus definitive locoregional therapy'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2808.html" rel="external">"Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2823.html" rel="external">"Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in older adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with a poor performance status, significant comorbidities, or psychosocial issues that limit their ability to participate in their treatment may be best managed with definitive RT alone or laryngectomy for larynx cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3409.html" rel="external">"Definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Dose and fractionation considerations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3402.html" rel="external">"Treatment of locoregionally advanced (stage III and IV) head and neck cancer: The larynx and hypopharynx", section on 'Total laryngectomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H281026429"><span class="h2">Chemotherapy plus definitive locoregional therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A combined modality approach incorporating both chemotherapy and RT improved results compared with RT alone and achieved improved or equivalent overall survival (OS) compared with definitive locoregional therapy alone (surgery and/or RT). This is based upon data from multiple randomized trials [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>] as well as the MACH-NC [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. This approach applies to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in general and for tumors of specific anatomic sites. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3402.html" rel="external">"Treatment of locoregionally advanced (stage III and IV) head and neck cancer: The larynx and hypopharynx", section on 'Nonsurgical functional organ preservation versus surgery'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3385.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer: The oropharynx", section on 'Concurrent chemoradiation'</a>.)</p><p>The MACH-NC pooled individual patient data from 107 randomized trials and 19,805 patients with resectable or unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; a majority (90 percent) had stage III or IV disease [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. In all trials, patients were randomly assigned to definitive locoregional therapy alone (surgery and/or RT) or definitive locoregional therapy in combination with chemotherapy (either induction, concurrent, or adjuvant). The trials included patients with oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers; trials that were limited to patients with primary nasopharyngeal tumors were excluded. Importantly, these data were analyzed from studies that preceded the routine identification of patients as human papillomavirus (HPV) positive or stratification of oropharyngeal patients by HPV status.</p><p>Updated results from this meta-analysis include the following [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Concurrent chemoradiation </strong>– In 71 trials that included 10,680 patients, at median follow-up of 9.2 years, concurrent chemoradiation significantly improved OS compared with definitive local therapy alone (five- and ten-year absolute OS benefit of 6.5 and 3.6 percent, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.79-0.86).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The OS benefit was due to a decrease in cancer-related deaths, which was influenced by reduced rates of locoregional (but not distant metastatic) failure. No increase in non-cancer deaths was observed with concurrent chemotherapy, although longer follow-up is necessary to evaluate for long-term treatment related complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89977.html" rel="external">"Overview of approach to long-term survivors of head and neck cancer", section on 'Late and long-term complications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No differences in OS were observed with different RT schedules (once daily versus altered fractionation) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The OS benefit for concurrent chemoradiation over definitive locoregional therapy decreased with increasing patient age, and no OS benefit was observed in those over age 70 years (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81-1.16).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Induction chemotherapy </strong>– In 45 trials that included 7054 patients, at median follow-up of 5.7 years, the addition of induction chemotherapy did not improve OS compared with surgery and/or RT alone (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90-1.01). There was also no clear OS benefit even when specific induction chemotherapy regimens were assessed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Concurrent chemoradiation versus induction chemotherapy </strong>– In eight trials that included 1214 patients, at median follow-up of 9 years, concurrent chemoradiation improved OS (five-year absolute OS benefit of 6.2 percent; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.95) and locoregional failure (LRF; five-year absolute benefit of 5.8 percent; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.97) compared with various induction chemotherapy regimens followed by definitive locoregional therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, extended follow-up of one randomized trial (Intergroup RTOG 91-11) in patients with laryngeal cancer suggested worse OS for concurrent chemoradiation compared to induction chemotherapy plus RT. This finding was attributed to an increase in non-cancer related causes of death, potentially from long-term toxicity from chemoradiation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Further details of this trial are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3402.html" rel="external">"Treatment of locoregionally advanced (stage III and IV) head and neck cancer: The larynx and hypopharynx", section on 'Comparison of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy approaches'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adjuvant chemotherapy</strong> – In 14 trials with 2915 patients, at median follow-up of 5.4 years, the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to definitive local therapy did not improve OS (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92-1.13).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1049946399"><span class="h2">Sequential therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The optimal timing and integration of chemotherapy with RT remains uncertain. Based upon the demonstrated benefit of concurrent chemoradiation over RT alone and the decrease in distant metastases seen with induction chemotherapy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], sequential therapy (ie, induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation) has been proposed as the optimal way to incorporate chemotherapy with locoregional therapy.</p><p>Multiple clinical trials have studied the question of whether sequential therapy offers a significant benefit compared with concurrent chemoradiation alone [<a href="#rid2">2-4,9-13</a>]. These are illustrated by the four largest trials, which are heterogenous in design and treatment and which resulted in different conclusions:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a trial conducted by the Spanish Head and Neck Cancer Cooperative Group, 439 patients with stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomly assigned to concurrent chemoradiation alone (seven weeks of RT plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> on days 1, 22, and 43) or induction chemotherapy with three cycles of one of two regimens (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a>, cisplatin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> [TPF  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65438" href="/z/d/graphic/65438.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)] or PF), followed by the same concurrent chemoradiation [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There were no statistically significant differences in the progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-treatment failure, or OS between the three treatment arms. Notably completion of therapy as planned on the two sequential arms involved the administration of 525 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> total <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>. A substantial number of patients treated with induction chemotherapy also did not complete therapy due to toxicity, and mortality rates were high in this study. Perhaps for this and other reasons, approximately half of patients did not complete radiation and/or concurrent chemotherapy as planned, and analysis by intention to treat showed no survival benefit. A secondary analysis restricted to patients who completed treatment per protocol showed a statistically significant benefit in PFS in those patients receiving induction chemotherapy with TPF.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a phase II/III Italian trial, 421 patients with locally advanced (stage III or IV) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomly assigned to induction chemotherapy with three cycles of TPF  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65438" href="/z/d/graphic/65438.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) followed by chemoradiation, or to immediate chemoradiation, and 414 were fully evaluable [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Within each group, patients were secondarily randomized to concurrent chemotherapy with two cycles of PF or to concurrent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9209" href="/z/d/drug information/9209.html" rel="external">cetuximab</a>. Thus, two groups received concomitant chemoradiation alone, with either PF or cetuximab, and two groups received induction chemotherapy with TPF, followed by concomitant chemoradiation with either PF or cetuximab.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">At a median follow-up of 44.8 months, treatment with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation significantly improved OS compared with concurrent chemoradiation alone (median 54 versus 30 months, three-year survival rate 58 versus 47 percent, HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.97). Similarly, PFS was also significantly improved with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation (median 30 versus 19 months, three-year survival rate 47 versus 39 percent, HR 0.72, 95% CI 0. 56-0.93).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">LRF was also lower in the induction chemotherapy arm, but unlike in other studies, distant failure was not reduced. While not powered to make such conclusions, there was a trend to more benefit when induction chemotherapy was added to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9209" href="/z/d/drug information/9209.html" rel="external">cetuximab</a> chemoradiation. While there may be a biological explanation for this difference, this may reflect inferiority of the cetuximab chemoradiation regimen. (See <a class="local">'Cetuximab versus cisplatin for definitive chemoradiation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additionally, there was a trend towards more benefit in non-oropharynx sites.

The subgroup of patients that may benefit most are those with bulky N2b, N2c low nodes or N3 nodal stage, and perhaps the T3 and T4 populations, as suggested by subgroup analysis of the DeCIDE trial and Italian trial.
