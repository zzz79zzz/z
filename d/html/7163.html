Loss of the complement inhibitors, CD55 and CD59, on the surface of red blood cells leads to chronic and/or paroxysmal intravascular hemolysis and a propensity for thrombosis. Patients may also have hypocellular or dysplastic bone marrow, and a subset have clinically significant aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

All symptomatic patients with PNH can benefit from supportive care, as described below. (See <a class="local">'Supportive care'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach to management of PNH  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131709" href="/z/d/graphic/131709.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) is consistent with recommendations of expert panels from the American Society of Hematology [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], Belgium [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], and Canada [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1137835899"><span class="h1">SYMPTOMATIC HEMOLYTIC PNH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with symptomatic hemolytic PNH (eg, pain, thrombosis, organ dysfunction), who do <strong>not</strong> have severe bone marrow failure (BMF), we recommend treatment with a complement inhibitor, rather than supportive care alone  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131709" href="/z/d/graphic/131709.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Complement inhibitors are effective for symptom relief and prevention of thromboses and are associated with only modest toxicity. Although supportive care alone can alleviate pain and anemia-related symptoms, it may be associated with transfusion-associated iron overload, alloimmunization, and thrombotic events, which are common, difficult to predict, and may recur or progress despite anti-thrombotic therapy [<a href="#rid5">5-9</a>].</p><p>Selection of a complement inhibitor for initial treatment of symptomatic hemolytic PNH is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Choice of initial agent'</a> below.)</p><p>Complement inhibitors have proven efficacy and safety for hemolytic PNH. Based on a randomized trial, the C5 complement inhibitor (C5i), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8836" href="/z/d/drug information/8836.html" rel="external">eculizumab</a>, was more effective than placebo for relieving symptoms and reducing red blood cell (RBC) transfusions [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Other randomized trials reported that another C5i, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="119990" href="/z/d/drug information/119990.html" rel="external">ravulizumab</a>, was associated with efficacy and safety that were comparable to eculizumab [<a href="#rid10">10-13</a>]. At present, there are limited reports of initial treatment of hemolytic PNH with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="131650" href="/z/d/drug information/131650.html" rel="external">pegcetacoplan</a> or other complement inhibitors.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Eculizumab</strong><strong> versus placebo</strong> – In the TRIUMPH trial, which randomly assigned 87 patients with severe PNH to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8836" href="/z/d/drug information/8836.html" rel="external">eculizumab</a> versus placebo for 26 weeks, eculizumab more effectively reduced transfusion-dependence and improved quality of life (QoL); there were no deaths or serious adverse events (AEs) related to eculizumab [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Eculizumab more effectively achieved RBC transfusion-independence (TI; 49 versus 0 percent, respectively) and led to clinically meaningful improved QoL, using two different assessment instruments [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. There was no difference in overall survival (OS) between treatment arms during the 26-week trial and no deaths or serious AEs were attributed to eculizumab; one thrombotic event was reported in the placebo group. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other studies of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8836" href="/z/d/drug information/8836.html" rel="external">eculizumab</a> are presented below.

In another phase 3 trial, among 195 clinically stable patients with PNH who were previously treated with eculizumab and then randomly assigned to continue eculizumab or switch to ravulizumab, the two agents achieved similar results [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other studies of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="119990" href="/z/d/drug information/119990.html" rel="external">ravulizumab</a> are presented below.

Importantly, treatment of PNH with these agents must be continued indefinitely, is expensive, and does not ameliorate PNH-associated BMF; in addition, all complement inhibitors can be associated with increased risk for serious and life-threatening infections, especially those caused by encapsulated bacteria. (See <a class="local">'Adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p>We favor a C5i, rather than other complement inhibitors for initial treatment of hemolytic PNH, because of their proven efficacy for symptom relief and thrombosis prevention, low toxicity, convenience of periodic infusions, long track record, and limited reports of initial treatment with other agents. (See <a class="local">'Symptomatic hemolytic PNH'</a> above.) </p><p>Administration of individual complement inhibitors is presented below. (See <a class="local">'Complement inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p>The terminal half-life of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="119990" href="/z/d/drug information/119990.html" rel="external">ravulizumab</a> is four times longer than that of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8836" href="/z/d/drug information/8836.html" rel="external">eculizumab</a>, which enables longer intervals between treatments (eg, eight weeks versus two weeks) and reduces annual costs; the safety profiles are similar. Both agents bind the same epitope on C5 and inhibit complement activity by preventing C5 convertase from cleaving C5 into C5a and C5b.
