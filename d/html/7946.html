         Prior to 1985, only two infectious disease screening assays were performed on donated blood. Many additional assays have subsequently been introduced into routine blood screening; several of these assays have undergone significant modifications to increase sensitivity and specificity (these revised assays are designated by a change in name, or generation or version number) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Minipool nucleic acid testing (NAT) was added to routine serologic screening in 1999. As the risk for transfusion transmission of additional infectious agents has been recognized, testing has been added and/or removed as needed (eg, for Zika virus). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Zika virus'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Testing of the donated unit consists of determining the ABO blood group, RhD typing, and testing for red blood cell (RBC) antibodies. In some cases, a more extensive RBC antigen profile is obtained. Historically this was done using serologic (antibody-based) methods, referred to as extended RBC phenotyping, but genomics technology (referred to as extended RBC genotyping) may also be used [

         Many apheresis platelet units are tested for bacterial contamination by an automated culturing technique initiated 24 hours after collection, and whole-blood-derived platelets undergo bacterial testing with point-of-release immunoassays. As an alternative to bacterial testing, apheresis platelet units may undergo a pathogen inactivation process. In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued guidance for platelet products that includes measures to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections, as discussed separately. (See

         All infectious disease screening assays must be negative to release the blood unit or its components to hospitals for transfusion.

        <p>
         This testing has resulted in very low risk of infectious disease from transfused blood components, as summarized in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69661" href="/z/d/graphic/69661.html" rel="external">

         Testing of donated blood in the United States occurs at large centralized laboratories to ensure compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and which use expensive high throughput automated equipment, minimizing the chance for human error.
        </p>
        <p>
         Specific testing protocols can vary by country and sometimes by region (see
         <a class="local">
          'Babesia microti'
         </a>
         below). As an example, donated blood in the United States is not routinely screened for evidence of infection with human parvovirus B19, a respiratory virus that can cause fifth disease in children and red cell aplasia in individuals with chronic hemolytic anemia (eg, sickle cell disease). In contrast, all Japanese Red Cross Blood Centers have screened for parvovirus B19 since 1997 using immunoassays or NAT [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Some countries only use serologic testing (without NAT). (See

         The infectious disease screening assays for antibodies to pathogenic organisms (which demonstrate host response to an infection) and antigens from these organisms historically used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) method, which has generally been replaced by a similar chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay method using the following general testing protocol:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If the initial sample readout is below the cutoff, the sample is classified as negative for that agent.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If the sample readout exceeds that of the cutoff, the result is classified as initially reactive.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         All initially reactive samples are retested in the same assay system in duplicate, usually on the next working day. If one or both of the duplicate tests are also reactive the sample is classified as repeat reactive and is, by definition, positive. A positive screening test results in the destruction of the unit. If both repeat test results are negative, the initially reactive result is equivalent to a negative result and the unit is released from quarantine and made available for transfusion.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Such an approach is scientifically sound due to known problems with nonspecific binding, resulting in initially reactive immunoassay test results that cannot be duplicated on careful repeat testing.

         Beginning in 1999, blood collection centers implemented minipool nucleic acid testing (NAT) technology for detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV nucleic acids (RNA) in donated blood. Since 2009, blood centers have replaced the dual assay for HIV and HCV nucleic acids with a triplex assay that detects hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and HIV and HCV RNA. West Nile virus (WNV) NAT was added in 2003 and Zika virus NAT in 2016 (subsequently the requirement for Zika virus was removed) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For logistical and cost reasons, NAT in the United States is performed on pools (designated minipool NAT or MP-NAT) of samples from 6 to 16 blood donors. There are two major methods in use: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA). If a positive result is obtained on a pool of samples, it is necessary to determine which of the three viruses (HIV, HCV, or HBV) is present (this may require testing by an additional discriminatory assay); also, further testing is performed to establish which donation in the pool was the source of the positive result. The positive unit is discarded and all the negative units in the pool are used for transfusion.

         NAT of individual samples (ID-NAT) is more expensive and time-consuming than MP-NAT, but ID-NAT results in higher assay sensitivity. As an example, it has been estimated that the time period in which transfusion of a blood component will cause infection (referred to as the "window period" and estimated to occur at a concentration of 1 viral copy per 20 mL) and its detection by NAT can be shortened from 9.0 to 5.6 days for HIV and from 7.4 to 4.9 days for HCV by replacing MP-NAT with ID-NAT [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. This resultant shortening of the window period by conversion to ID-NAT has been estimated to result in an approximately 50 percent reduction in the very small risk of developing HIV or HCV infection from blood transfusion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69661" href="/z/d/graphic/69661.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). However, taking MP-NAT as a baseline, the marginal cost of introducing ID-NAT has been estimated to exceed USD $12 million per quality-adjusted life-year [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. This low cost-effectiveness has resulted in the continued use of MP-NAT for simultaneous detection of HIV, HCV, and HBV.
        </p>
        <p>
         The situation with regard to ID-NAT for WNV is different, as it has been demonstrated that a significant proportion of WNV RNA-positive units will be missed by MP-NAT due to the low viral titers present in WNV infection. In the United States, blood collectors have adopted a more cost-effective strategy of targeted ID-NAT, implementing this test if and when the WNV infectivity exceeds a defined threshold in a given geographic region [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Most blood centers request that their testing laboratory implement ID-NAT after the detection of one or two MP-NAT positive donations and then revert back from ID-NAT to MP-NAT when the region has no ID-NAT reactive donations for at least 14 days [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'West Nile virus'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In August 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended national Zika virus ID-NAT be implemented. This extremely precautionary measure was taken due to the potentially severe effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy and concerns that donor history questions (previously implemented in March 2016) would be insufficient to completely address the risk of transfusion-transmission. In July 2018, due to the significant decrease in cases of Zika virus infection, the FDA issued new guidance that recommended MP-NAT testing could be performed if reflexed to targeted ID-NAT using a strategy similar to that for WNV; This guidance was removed in May 2021 when cases of Zika infection were no longer recorded, making it unnecessary to continue Zika testing.

         Because all transfusion-transmitted infectious agents are of low prevalence in the asymptomatic donor population, the predictive value of a positive screening test is also low [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Thus, since a positive screening result will usually be a false positive result, it is essential that screening tests be followed with a more specific supplementary or confirmatory test (US Food and Drug Administration licensed) prior to notifying donors of their test results. Results of supplemental testing may indicate that the donor is infected, is false positive and is not infected, or may be inconclusive (indeterminate) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. In the case of reactivity by nucleic acid testing (NAT) in the absence of positive serological assays, further NAT testing of an alternate sample source (eg, the plasma component bag) or follow-up sampling of the donor is needed to confirm the test results.

         Blood centers have developed notification and counseling procedures for each type of result for each tested agent [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15
         </a>
         ]. Most notifications, other than for HIV-seropositive donors, are done by letter. In addition to receiving the information, the donor is instructed to telephone an appropriate person at the blood center to discuss his or her test results. The basic principles of donor notification for confirmed seropositive donors involve providing information to the donor accurately, confidentially, as quickly as possible, and in a manner that alleviates anxiety and promotes understanding. Seropositive (or NAT positive) donors need to be informed of their ineligibility as donors, the medical significance of their test result, the need to see a physician (if appropriate), and the possible modes of transmission of the agent. Because notification of indeterminate donors carries uncertainty about their infection status, the counseling process is difficult and often results in donor anxiety [

         A United States national system (the Transfusion-Transmissible Infection Monitoring Systems [TTIMS]) that tabulates HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing data and donor demographic data from the largest United States blood collection organizations (accounting for approximately 60 percent of United States blood collections) was established late in 2015 [

         This system has provided (and continues to provide) an important source of data concerning prevalence and incidence of blood donor infections sorted by demographic characteristics and geographic region. It also allows for monitoring of trends over time, which in turn can be correlated with changes in donor eligibility criteria or donor demographics. One general conclusion from the first four years of TTIMS data is that residual risks of transfusion-transmission for the three major viruses (HIV, HCV, and HBV) have been decreasing or have remained constant over time [

          17

In addition, TTIMS data as well as a decade of data from the American Red Cross show that the prevalence of these infections in persons who are first-time blood donors continues to be substantially higher than in repeat blood donors (persons who have previously donated blood and have previously tested negative for these viruses) [

         HIV is a lentivirus, a type of retrovirus that stores its genetic information as RNA. Infection with HIV causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), due to progressive depletion of CD4 T cells. The first cases of AIDS were described in 1981, with subsequent expansion of cases around the world. The modes of transmission include sexual, perinatal, and bloodborne, principally via sharing of needles among people who inject drugs. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Transmission by through blood products obtained from viremic individuals was noted in the early years of the pandemic. Historically (prior to 1985, when HIV testing was first instituted), transfusion of a product from an individual with HIV had a high probability (90 percent) of transmitting HIV. Rates of transfusion-transmitted HIV were equivalent from red blood cells (RBCs) stored for &lt;21 days, platelets, or plasma. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The historical evolution of testing procedures has resulted in progressively lower risk of transmission, mostly due to a narrowing of the window period (the period during which a donor with HIV is potentially infectious via the blood transfusion route but has not yet developed any laboratory evidence of HIV infection).

          Antibody testing
         </strong>
         – HIV-1 antibody testing was first implemented in 1985 and has subsequently undergone significant improvements. In 1992, an assay (HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody test) with improved sensitivity was implemented; the increased sensitivity was due both to its ability to detect IgM in addition to IgG antibody, and its detection of HIV-2 antibody due to the addition of HIV-2 specific antigens [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19

         Samples that test positive by the antibody screening assay (either an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [EIA] or a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay) are either confirmed as positive if they have a concurrently positive HIV-1 RNA result (see section immediately below) or are further tested by a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed antibody confirmatory assay. Donors with confirmed positive results are counseled that they have been infected with HIV-1 (or in very rare cases, HIV-2); however, false positive confirmatory results can sometimes occur in the low prevalence setting of blood donor screening [

         – HIV-1 RNA testing in minipools (MP) of 6 to 16 samples was introduced into routine blood donor screening in 1999/2000 [

          28

         Screening of donated blood for antibodies to HTLV-I began in late 1988 using HTLV-I viral lysate as antigen in an EIA format. Due to immunologic crossreactivity, antibodies to HTLV-II, a closely related retrovirus prevalent in United States blood donors, are often but not always detected by this assay. Consequently, in early 1998, the screening assay was improved by inclusion of HTLV-II antigens. As of 2016, screening test results are confirmed by an FDA-licensed confirmatory assay.

         Screening for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was introduced in the early 1970s. Samples testing positive by EIA (or chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay) are confirmed using a neutralization assay provided with the test kit. HBsAg may be positive in acute infection or as a result of a chronic carrier state. False positive neutralization results occasionally occur in the blood donor setting [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. Neutralization-positive donors are deferred from future donation. Despite the improved sensitivity of the chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay, the infectious window period prior to development of HBsAg positivity has been estimated to range from 18 to 27 days and possibly to last as long as 38 days [

         Screening for antibody to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) began in 1987 as a surrogate assay for carriers of non-A, non-B hepatitis [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48,49
         </a>
         ]. In 1990, the anti-HBc assay was licensed by the FDA based upon its ability to decrease the risk of HBV infection by detecting some HBsAg-negative donors who are capable of transmitting HBV [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49,50
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Anti-HBc develops early in the course of HBV infection and remains positive whether infection is resolved or becomes chronic. Approximately 1 percent of donors test anti-HBc positive [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]; however, some older FDA-approved assays had poor specificity and there are no confirmatory assays to determine with certainty which donation is potentially infectious [

        <p>
         Deferral is not required by the FDA until two independent donations test anti-HBc positive; however, many blood collection centers will defer such donors after a single test for cost efficiency reasons. Upon referral to a physician, detection of antibody to HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs) often serves as a second independent assay to establish past HBV infection provided the donor has not received HBV vaccine.

         WNV transfusion-transmission occurs solely from acutely infected asymptomatic donors rather than from donors with chronic infection. Therefore, WNV blood donor screening is performed using only a NAT system; serological screening is not used in conjunction with NAT [
         <a href="#rid57">

         WNV NAT was implemented nationwide in the United States under FDA approval in July 2003, using MPs of 6 or 16 different donation samples, depending on the manufacturer's format. However, in late 2003, data indicated that despite MP-NAT screening, a small number of breakthrough transfusion-transmitted cases of WNV occurred; these were due to donors who were very early in infection and whose viral loads were below the threshold of detection by MP-NAT [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57-63
         </a>
         ]. This led to the strategy of targeted individual donation nucleic acid testing (ID-NAT).

         Unlike other transfusion-transmitted viruses, WNV is seasonal in its occurrence and has shown significant geographic and temporal variation throughout the United States [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58,59,64
         </a>
         ]. The targeted ID-NAT testing strategy was designed to balance the residual risk of transfusion transmission from units screened with MP-NAT against the limitations in testing capacity due to lack of sufficient automation for performing ID-NAT. It involves real-time tracking of MP-NAT results in defined geographic regions, based on a predetermined initiation trigger, at which point all units will be tested by ID-NAT rather than MP-NAT.
        </p>
        <p>
         The initiation trigger for ID-NAT at most blood centers is detection of a single MP-NAT-positive donation. The criterion for discontinuing ID-NAT and reverting to MP-NAT is the absence of ID-NAT-reactive donations for a defined time frame (usually a minimum of 14 consecutive days, although it may be longer in some programs in WNV epidemic areas) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,65-67
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         All WNV transfusion-transmissions, with one possible exception, have been from viremic donors who were IgM negative, leading to the conclusion that the presence of IgM antibody is protective against transmission via transfusion [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been estimated that if ID-NAT testing is implemented early in the course of a region-specific epidemic, 5 to 10 percent of the units detected would be MP-NAT-negative, ID-NAT-positive, IgM- and IgG-negative, and therefore potentially infectious [

         Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients, such as hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and organ transplant recipients and those infected with HIV. CMV-safe blood is required only for these selected patient populations. In the past, CMV-safe blood needed to be supplied from donors who had no evidence of current or past CMV infection; such donors were identified by testing negative on a CMV antibody assay.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unlike the previous screening assays, CMV antibody testing is not performed on each unit of donated blood prior to transfusion, but only on enough units to establish a sufficient inventory of CMV-negative units to supply patient needs. The presence or absence of CMV antibody does not affect a donor's eligibility.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the presence of CMV antibody is a nonspecific assay for CMV infectivity and because 30 to 70 percent of blood donors (depending upon geographic region) test CMV antibody positive, much effort has gone into finding another method of providing CMV-safe blood [

         Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus (the same virus family that includes WNV and dengue virus). Infection causes mild disease or no symptoms in most individuals but carries a risk for fetal loss, microcephaly, and other adverse fetal and newborn outcomes if infection occurs during pregnancy.

         Policies with regard to Zika virus testing have evolved over time. In May 2021, the FDA removed guidance from 2016 and 2018 that had required testing of donated blood for Zika virus [

          76

        </p>
        <p>
         In mid-2018, the FDA changed to recommending minipool testing using either of the licensed tests based on the changed epidemiology of Zika virus infection in the Western Hemisphere (very few cases occurred in 2017 and 2018) [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79

        </p>
        <p>
         In May 2021, FDA stated that there had been no local, mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission in the United States since 2017 and only four travel-related cases in 2020, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that there are no countries with active Zika outbreaks [

         <em>

Additional testing with a nontreponemal test can be performed to assist with donor notification and counseling. If screening is performed with a nontreponemal test, additional specific treponemal tests can be performed; under some instances as described in the Guidance document, such as having been treated for syphilis the donor can be reinstated for future donation [

A second manufacturer has an approved assay for MP testing in pools of six samples. Due to the high sensitivity of the NAT assay, there is no requirement for Babesia antibody testing; however, some blood collectors still perform this test to gather further information and/or for counseling purposes.

In 2019, the FDA issued a guidance document that requires blood collectors in 14 endemic or at-risk states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin) plus the District of Columbia (Washington, DC) to perform

Follow-up testing of positive donors at one year demonstrated that 86 percent of PCR-positive donors had clearance of parasite DNA, but only 8 percent of antibody-positive donors showed loss of antibody reactivity. Based on these data, the FDA has recommended a two-year deferral following a reactive NAT result.

         Based on recommendations from the Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), donated blood is not screened for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). At the outset of the pandemic, this policy was established based on prior observations that viruses transmitted primarily by the respiratory route have not been documented to be transmitted by transfusion [

        <p>
         In the absence of laboratory testing, blood collection centers have adopted donor deferral policies related to recent infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, blood centers inform donors that they should contact the blood center if they develop symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or are diagnosed with COVID-19 in a defined period after donation (ranging from 48 hours to 14 days depending on the blood center). Units from these individuals are removed from inventory. These policies are discussed separately. (See

         The largest study evaluating SARS-CoV-2 in donated blood is a 2020 multicenter study that used a highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification test to screen blood donations collected over a six-month interval in six United States metropolitan areas [

The RNA-reactive samples were non-reactive for antibody, and the estimated viral loads of the (presumed single) positive donations within each MP were low, ranging from &lt;1000 to &lt;4000 copies/mL. Because samples were tested retrospectively in a deidentified manner, there are no data on the recipients who received these units.

         In most studies, the potentially infectious units were interdicted prior to transfusion, so there are limited data to directly evaluate transfusion-transmission. However, a few studies have evaluated recipients for the acquisition of transfusion-transmitted infection. In a Korean study, six blood donors were found to have confirmed COVID-19 within two weeks post donation. Nine patients received units from these donations, none developed COVID-19 symptoms, and the three recipients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in nasopharyngeal samples were negative [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104
         </a>
         ]. Several other case reports of donors who reported post-donation COVID also have failed to identify COVID symptoms in recipients [
         <a href="#rid105">
          105-107
         </a>
         ]. In addition, almost three years into the pandemic, no cases of transfusion-transmitted COVID-19 have been reported in the United States or internationally [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One explanation for these findings is that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood may not represent fully competent infectious virus but instead could be due to incomplete RNA fragments that are not infectious; this hypothesis is supported by the low concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in PCR-positive units and by the negative infectivity results in cell culture and mouse models [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99,101
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Taken together, these studies indicate a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-emia in donated blood and document that viral RNA is at low concentration when detected, and they show no ability to transmit infection in limited investigations in humans. Although it cannot be ruled out that transfusion transmission may occur rarely, all studies to date support the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 is not transmissible by transfusion.

There are many antigens of the Rh system other than D that are present on every individual's blood cells; nevertheless, the presence of the D antigen designates a unit as Rh-positive, whereas its absence is designated as Rh-negative.

         Other than ABO mismatches, RhD is the most immunogenic of the common RBC antigens, with approximately 40 to 80 percent of RhD-negative individuals forming an anti-D upon exposure to an RhD-positive RBC unit. Historically, anti-D is the primary cause of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), although routine screening and administration of

         There are other important antigens of clinical significance; these are less immunogenic than RhD, with alloantibodies developing in a minority of recipients negative for the antigen who are exposed to an antigen-positive unit. These include antigens in the Kell system (with approximately 10 percent of K-negative individuals forming anti-K upon exposure to a K-positive RBC unit), followed by lesser antibody formation rates from other Rh system antigens (C, E) as well as for certain antigens in the Duffy, Kidd, and other blood group systems [

         Blood centers maintain an inventory of special RBC units that have been determined to be negative for common antigens in the Rh and other common blood group systems (Kell, Duffy, Kidd). These antigen-negative units are identified by more extensive RBC phenotyping or genotyping of selected donors. The units can be made available to patients who have developed antibodies against specific RBC antigens and, if transfusion is needed, who require RBCs lacking those specific antigens. Examples of individuals more likely to have developed alloantibodies include multiply-transfused patients with sickle cell disease, thalassemia, aplastic anemia, or a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

         Donor serum is also tested for unexpected RBC antibodies, which may have been formed through prior transfusion or pregnancy in the donor. For a recipient, these antibodies in the donor serum could cause a transfusion reaction if the recipient's RBCs carry the relevant antigen [

        <p>
         The antibody screen is performed using one of several different methods (solid phase, gel card, tube testing), all of which use indicator RBCs that have the common significant RBC antigen specificities. Observational data compiled from over a 4.5 year timeframe from four United States blood centers indicated that 0.5 percent of donations were antibody screen-positive and that the likelihood of a positive antibody screen increased with increasing donor age, female sex, RhD-negative status, and history of transfusion or pregnancy [

         Most blood collectors in the United States screen some blood donors for sickle cell trait. However, there are no uniform requirements for such testing, nor is there a single standardized testing method, and policies vary across institutions. More information can be obtained by contacting individual blood collection agencies. The main reason for testing is to be able to provide recipients with sickle cell disease with blood that does not contain sickle hemoglobin. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90145.html" rel="external">
          "Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques", section on 'Overview of transfusion techniques'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some blood centers use self-reported donor race to select units donated by African Americans or multiracial persons for sickle cell trait testing. Policies with regard to notification of positive test results and future donation eligibility vary across blood collectors; these include deferral from whole blood or RBC donation and restriction to platelet and/or plasma donation only. As one example, the American Red Cross screens for sickle cell trait in donors who self-identify as African American or multiracial [
         <a href="#rid116">
          116
         </a>
         ]. Additional confirmatory testing is not performed, but the donor is notified of their screening results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another reason for sickle cell trait testing is when the leukoreduction filter becomes clogged or fails to pass quality control requirements due to inadequate removal of leukocytes; these complications are known to occur at higher rates in RBC units from donors with sickle cell trait.
