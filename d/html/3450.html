The clinical syndrome is characterized by the development of dyspnea, generally associated with rapid accumulation of fluid within the lung's interstitial and alveolar spaces, which is the result of acutely elevated cardiac filling pressures (cardiogenic pulmonary edema) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. ADHF can also present as elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressures and dyspnea without pulmonary edema.</p><p>ADHF is most commonly due to LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, with or without additional cardiac pathology, such as coronary artery disease or valve abnormalities. However, a variety of conditions or events can cause cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the absence of heart disease, including primary fluid overload (eg, due to blood transfusion), severe hypertension (particularly renovascular hypertension), and severe renal disease.</p><p>In the large majority of patients who present with ADHF, acute or subacute decompensation is in the context of chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (also known as systolic HF) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (also known as diastolic HF) and in many cases, there is a prior history of episodes of decompensation. In such patients, information regarding the precipitating factors, workup for HF, and the elements of successful therapy for prior episodes (eg, types and doses of diuretics used) can be of great value in approaching the current episode.</p><p>The components of therapy of ADHF in patients without acute myocardial infarction (MI) will be reviewed here. A table to assist with emergency management of ADHF is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75041" href="/z/d/graphic/75041.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). General considerations for treatment of ADHF and the pathophysiology and evaluation of patients with ADHF are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3454.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3497.html" rel="external">"Approach to diagnosis and evaluation of acute decompensated heart failure in adults"</a>.) <span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-120052">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-120052" href="/pathway/120052?topicRef=3450&amp;source=see_link">Acute decompensated heart failure: Initial management of hypervolemic patients with adequate perfusion</a>.)</span></p><p>Treatment of ADHF and cardiogenic shock in the setting of acute coronary syndrome and management of refractory HF (including inadequate response to diuretic therapy) are discussed separately. Management of right ventricular MI, which typically presents with hypotension and clear lungs, is also discussed separately.

A table to assist with emergency management of ADHF is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75041" href="/z/d/graphic/75041.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The initial approach is similar in patients with ADHF whether caused by systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Initial measures include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Airway assessment and continuous pulse oximetry to assure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support (noninvasive ventilation [NIV] or intubation) as indicated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vital signs assessment with attention to hypotension or hypertension.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Continuous cardiac monitoring.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intravenous (IV) access.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seated posture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prompt diuretic therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early vasodilator therapy (for severe hypertension, acute mitral regurgitation, or acute aortic regurgitation); later vasodilator use for refractory cases is discussed below.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urine output monitoring (perhaps with urethral catheter placement).</p><p></p><p>Following airway and oxygenation assessment and management, initial therapy includes the initiation of treatments aimed at rapidly correcting hemodynamic and intravascular volume abnormalities. It is important to tailor the therapy to the individual patient. The mainstay of therapy in the acute setting is the use of diuretics to alleviate volume overload.</p><p>Early IV vasodilator therapy with an agent that lowers arterial tone (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9707" href="/z/d/drug information/9707.html" rel="external">nitroprusside</a>) is suggested in selected patients with ADHF who require a rapid decrease in systemic vascular resistance and LV afterload (eg, those with severe hypertension, acute mitral regurgitation, or acute aortic regurgitation). Early use of a vasodilator that acts to lower venous tone (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">nitroglycerin</a>) is suggested when the initial response to diuretics is not sufficient to alleviate respiratory distress. The aggressiveness of diuretic and vasodilator therapy depends on the patient's hemodynamic and volume status. Patients with flash pulmonary edema due to hypertension, for instance, require aggressive vasodilatory therapy, as they often are not fluid overloaded. Patients with normotension and volume overload may be treated with diuretic therapy with or without vasodilator therapy.</p><p>Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is indicated in patients hospitalized with acute HF. Sodium restriction is suggested in all patients with HF.</p><p>Vasopressin receptor antagonists are a rarely required option for patients with volume overload with severe hyponatremia (ie, serum sodium ≤120 mEq/L) despite fluid restriction. We suggest generally avoiding opiate therapy in patients with ADHF.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Supplemental oxygen and assisted ventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Supplemental oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation should be provided as needed to treat hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;90 percent). Oxygen is not recommended as routine therapy in patients without hypoxemia, as it may cause vasoconstriction and reduction in cardiac output [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>For patients requiring supplemental oxygen, we suggest initial therapies in the following order:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In general, a nonrebreather face mask with high-flow 100 percent O<sub>2</sub> is used because the concentration of delivered oxygen is greater than with nasal cannula. However, patients who also have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may not require aggressive oxygen therapy, since the target O<sub>2</sub> saturation in such patients is 88 to 92 percent. In patients with both acute HF and COPD, we aim for the upper end of that range. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1461.html" rel="external">"COPD exacerbations: Management", section on 'Oxygen therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If respiratory distress, respiratory acidosis, and/or hypoxia persist on oxygen therapy, we recommend a trial of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) if emergent intubation is not indicated  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68216" href="/z/d/graphic/68216.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), no contraindications to NIV exist  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60442" href="/z/d/graphic/60442.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and personnel with experience in NIV are available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This approach is supported by evidence from meta-analyses and randomized trials in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, indicating that NIV decreases the need for intubation and improves respiratory parameters, such as dyspnea, hypercapnia, acidosis, and heart rate. NIV may be particularly beneficial in patients with hypercapnia. These issues and conflicting data on a possible impact on mortality are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1636.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications", section on 'Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with respiratory failure who fail to improve with NIV (within one-half to two hours) or do not tolerate or have contraindications to NIV  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60442" href="/z/d/graphic/60442.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) should be intubated for conventional mechanical ventilation. In such patients, positive end-expiratory pressure is often useful to improve oxygenation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1642.html" rel="external">"Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Once initial therapy has begun, oxygen supplementation can be titrated in order to keep the patient comfortable and arterial oxygen saturation consistently above 90 percent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Diuretics</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2046557920"><span class="h3">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Limited clinical trial data have shown a mortality benefit from diuretic therapy in patients with chronic HF (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3512.html" rel="external">"Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure", section on 'Efficacy and safety'</a>). Although the safety and efficacy of diuretics to treat ADHF have not been established in randomized trials, extensive observational experience has demonstrated that they effectively relieve congestive symptoms [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and are essential for the successful treatment of most patients with ADHF and volume overload.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1063528069"><span class="h3">Urgency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with ADHF and evidence of volume overload, regardless of etiology, should be promptly treated with IV diuretics as part of their initial therapy [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. As noted in the 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) HF guidelines, patients admitted with significant fluid overload should receive diuretic therapy without delay in the emergency department or outpatient clinic, as early intervention may produce better outcomes [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>The expeditious initiation of an effective IV loop diuretic regimen is important in controlling dyspnea and other symptoms related to fluid overload, and in addition, may improve in-hospital outcomes. A multicenter, prospective observational study of 1291 patients with ADHF treated with IV <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8482" href="/z/d/drug information/8482.html" rel="external">furosemide</a> within 24 hours of their arrival in an emergency department found that early treatment (&lt;60 minutes) was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality than later treatment (2.3 versus 6.0 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Early treatment remained significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.20-0.76). As time to diuresis was delayed, the risk of mortality increased steeply during the first 100 minutes and then leveled off.</p><p>Rare exceptions in which some delay in diuresis may be required include patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock. In such cases, the underlying cause for hemodynamic instability should be sought, and the patient may require hemodynamic and mechanical ventilatory support along with diuresis. Such patients may have inadequate LV filling pressures, and could be adversely affected by a diuresis. Patients with aortic stenosis with volume overload should be diuresed with caution.</p><p>Patients with ADHF are usually volume overloaded. Even in the less common situation in which cardiogenic pulmonary edema develops without significant volume overload (eg, with hypertensive emergency, acute aortic or mitral valvular insufficiency), fluid removal with IV diuretics can relieve symptoms and improve oxygenation. IV rather than oral administration is recommended because of greater and more consistent drug bioavailability.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Diuretic administration</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H454250536"><span class="h4">Individualized dosing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diuretic dosing should be individualized and titrated according to patient status and response. The approach to initial diuretic therapy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload varies according to whether or not the patient has received prior loop diuretic therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who have not previously received loop diuretic therapy, the following are common initial IV doses of loop diuretics in patients with normal renal function:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8482" href="/z/d/drug information/8482.html" rel="external">Furosemide</a> – 20 to 40 mg IV</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9168" href="/z/d/drug information/9168.html" rel="external">Bumetanide</a> – 1 mg IV</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10008" href="/z/d/drug information/10008.html" rel="external">Torsemide</a> – 10 to 20 mg IV</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If there is little or no response to the initial dose, the dose should be doubled at two-hour intervals as needed up to the maximum recommended doses. While patients with a relatively normal glomerular filtration rate (typically estimated from the serum creatinine concentration, although this method can be used only if kidney function is stable) can usually be diuresed with IV doses of 40 to 80 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8482" href="/z/d/drug information/8482.html" rel="external">furosemide</a>, 20 to 40 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10008" href="/z/d/drug information/10008.html" rel="external">torsemide</a>, or 1 to 2 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9168" href="/z/d/drug information/9168.html" rel="external">bumetanide</a>, patients with renal insufficiency or severe HF may require higher maximum bolus doses of up to 160 to 200 mg of furosemide, 100 to 200 mg of torsemide, or 4 to 8 mg of bumetanide [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2324.html" rel="external">"Causes and treatment of refractory edema in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients treated with loop diuretics chronically may need a higher dose in the acute setting; the initial daily IV dose should be equal to or greater than (eg, 2.5 times) their maintenance total daily oral dose (eg, for a patient who had been taking 20 mg orally twice daily, an initial daily IV <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8482" href="/z/d/drug information/8482.html" rel="external">furosemide</a> dose of 40 to 100 mg which could be administered as 20 mg to 50 mg IV boluses twice daily) and then adjusted depending upon the response. In the DOSE trial of IV furosemide in patients with ADHF, there was no clear difference in improvement of patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high-dose (total daily IV dose 2.5 times the patients' prior total daily oral diuretic dose) group compared with the low-dose (equal to the prior total daily dose) group [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Subsequent dose escalation and maximum doses are similar to those used in patients who are not already being treated with loop diuretics.</p><p></p><p>Bolus diuretic administration two or more times per day may be necessary. A continuous IV infusion is an alternative to IV bolus therapy, although data are limited [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Use of a continuous IV infusion requires that the patient be responsive to IV bolus therapy, which results in higher initial plasma concentrations and therefore higher initial rates of urinary diuretic excretion than a continuous infusion. A continuous infusion should <strong>not</strong> be tried in patients who have not shown response to a maximum IV bolus dose. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3512.html" rel="external">"Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2324.html" rel="external">"Causes and treatment of refractory edema in adults"</a>.)</p><p>As an example, an initial IV bolus of 20 to 40 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8482" href="/z/d/drug information/8482.html" rel="external">furosemide</a> administered over one to two minutes may be followed by a continuous infusion of approximately 5 mg/h in patients with relative intact renal function (estimated glomerular filtration [GFR] rate greater than 75 mL/min) and rates of up to 20 mg/h in patients with an estimated GFR less than 30 mL/min. Adding a thiazide diuretic may potentiate the effect, but hypokalemia should be avoided [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>The onset of diuresis typically occurs within 30 minutes with peak diuresis usually at one to two hours after IV diuretic administration.</p><p>We suggest switching from an effective IV dose to an oral regimen once the patient’s acute symptoms have been stabilized to help ensure that an effective outpatient dose is identified and prescribed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H454250542"><span class="h4">Evidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No single IV dosing regimen (bolus versus continuous infusion; high versus lower dose) has been shown to be superior to others, as discussed separately.

Monitoring should also include watching for and guarding against side effects (including electrolyte abnormalities, symptomatic hypotension, worsening renal function and metabolic alkalosis). Diuretic therapy can also precipitate attacks of gout. The later transition from IV to oral diuretics should be made with careful attention to HF status, supine and upright hypotension, renal function, and electrolytes.

Patients with HF with preserved LV ejection fraction [LVEF] or restrictive physiology are often more sensitive to diuresis-induced reductions in preload.

In the absence of other causes for an elevated BUN, a disproportionate rise in BUN relative to serum creatinine (BUN/serum creatinine ratio &gt;20:1) suggests a prerenal state with increased passive reabsorption of urea. An initial rise in BUN may be accompanied by a stable serum creatinine, reflecting preserved GFR. Further elevations in BUN along with a rise in serum creatinine are likely if diuresis is continued in such patients.

Patients in whom this occurs before euvolemic status is achieved have a worse prognosis. Nevertheless, fluid removal may still be required to treat signs and symptoms of congestion, particularly pulmonary edema. On the other hand, a stable serum creatinine suggests that perfusion to the kidneys (and therefore to other organs) is being well maintained and that the diuresis can be continued if the patient is still edematous.
