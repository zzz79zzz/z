Successful treatment requires prompt transfer of the snakebite victim to definitive medical care, careful clinical assessment, and timely administration of antivenom in selected patients. Consultation with a medical toxicologist or other physician with experience in managing venomous snakebites is recommended prior to antivenom administration. Phone consultation with a medical toxicologist is available through a United States regional poison control center by calling 1-800-222-1222. Contact information for poison centers around the world is provided separately. (See <a class="local">'Additional resources'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical evaluation and management of coral snakebites are reviewed here. The principles of management of Crotalinae (eg, "pit vipers," including rattlesnakes, water moccasin [cottonmouth], or copperhead) snakebites and snakebites outside the United States are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6595.html" rel="external">"Bites by Crotalinae snakes (rattlesnakes, water moccasins [cottonmouths], or copperheads) in the United States: Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6594.html" rel="external">"Snakebites worldwide: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93182.html" rel="external">"Snakebites worldwide: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Coral snakes are native to a large portion of the Americas from the southern United States through Mexico, Central America, and South America to southern Argentina  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98401" href="/d/graphic/98401.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Throughout the Americas, coral snakebites are uncommon, ranging from two bites per year in Argentina to fewer than 100 bites per year in the United States [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In Central America, Colombia, and Brazil, coral snakes comprise &lt;1 to 2 percent of all snakebites [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. Most bites involve <em>Micrurus</em> species [<a href="#rid1">1,3,4</a>], and <em>Micrurus fulvius </em>(eastern coral snake)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98341" href="/d/graphic/98341.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) and <em>Micrurus tener</em> (Texas coral snake) account for almost all bites reported in the United States  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122086" href="/d/graphic/122086.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Envenomation usually causes neurologic symptoms. Envenomations, which are less common than total snakebites, including "dry bites" (in which no venom is transferred), occur approximately 75 to 80 times per year [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Fatalities from coral snake envenomation are rare but have been described [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. </p><p>Coral snakes are also found outside of the Americas, including Asia and southern Africa. Neurotoxicity with bites by these snakes is possible but rarely described [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H533705871"><span class="h1">CORAL SNAKE CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Appearance, venom apparatus, and venom actions for coral snakes are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Appearance</strong> – Coral snakes have small, oblong heads; lack a pit; and have very short, hollow fangs [<a href="#rid1">1,10</a>]. They can be identified by their brightly colored bands. Banding patterns can sometimes help distinguish coral snakes from similar nonvenomous snakes but should never be relied on for exclusion of diagnosis without the offending snake or a reliable photograph. As an example, venomous coral snakes within the United States and northern Mexico have red and yellow bands adjacent to each other (remembered by the phrase "red on yellow, kill a fellow; red on black, friend of Jack" or "venom lack")  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98341" href="/d/graphic/98341.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). However, color intensity and banding patterns are variable and in other parts of the Americas can be reversed (red bands adjacent to black bands). In Mexico (south of Mexico City), Central America, and South America, some coral snakes are red and black, and several species of snakes without neurotoxic venom closely mimic the banding of coral snakes. Rarely, coral snakes can be all black or albino.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Misidentification (particularly in an emergency) may have potentially serious outcomes if a coral snake is mistaken for a nonvenomous snake. Thus, patients bitten by a banded snake in the geographic regions where coral snakes reside should be observed closely for an extended period of time before envenomation is excluded. (See <a class="local">'Disposition'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Venom apparatus and requirements for envenomation</strong> – Coral snakes deliver venom through very small, fixed, hollow fangs located in the anterior maxilla. Envenomation usually requires that the snake chews on its victim [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Because the other teeth in the snake's mouth are rear-facing, once the snake becomes attached, it can be difficult to remove.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most coral snakes play dead or retreat as a first response to a threat. Thus, a coral snakebite typically results from harassment by a human or companion animal such as a curious dog, or excessive handling of a snake.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Venom mechanism of toxicity</strong> – Phospholipases A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) and "three finger" toxins (3FTx) are the most abundant toxins found in coral snake venom. The PLA<sub>2</sub>s produce neurotoxicity by inhibiting presynaptic release of neurotransmitters at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), while the 3FTxs act by blocking postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Both are present in the venom of North American <em>Micrurus spp</em>, though the PLA<sub>2</sub>s appear to predominate. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Rarely, local tissue damage, direct muscle toxicity, and coagulopathy in addition to neurotoxicity have been reported with bites by selected species of coral snakes (eg, <em>Micrurus lemniscatus halleri</em>) [<a href="#rid1">1,13</a>]. However, pain at the bite site is frequently reported immediately after the bite even if neurotoxic signs and symptoms are delayed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Animal models suggest that venom absorption from subcutaneous injection into the central circulation is primarily via the lymphatic system [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Intravenous antivenom does not rapidly or completely neutralize lymphatic venom; the lymph then functions as a depot for ongoing systemic absorption. Similarly, intravenous antivenom is unable to bind venom retained at the injection site, which may be subsequently absorbed [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Antivenom has no ability to reverse presynaptic toxicity at the NMJ. Giving antivenom early may prevent those components from being taken into the presynaptic membrane. Postsynaptic venom components may still be accessible to antivenom, meaning that there is a possible role for late administration even with established symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1136670103"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When a coral snakebite is reported or suspected, the clinician should determine the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Where and when the bite occurred</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A description of the snake if the snake has not been brought in or photographed</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How the bite occurred and whether there was more than one bite</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Any signs or symptoms and the timing of onset</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Initial treatment and first aid that was provided, including timing of first aid </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Any recent ethanol or recreational drug use that may modify the patient's presentation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pertinent past medical history, such as current medications (especially anticoagulants or beta blockers), any prior snakebites for which antivenom was given, or allergy to animals used in antivenom production (eg, horses, sheep, rabbits)</p><p></p><p>Coral snakebites frequently occur after intentional handling of the snake [<a href="#rid6">6,16</a>]. Most victims are male, and many patients are intoxicated at the time of the bite. In some cases, the coral snake is mistaken for other banded snakes (eg, king snake or milk snake) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In other instances, the patient is bitten while trying to kill the snake. In tropical regions, snakebites may also occur when farmers encounter snakes in fields [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Patients may report pain and swelling or paresthesias at the bite site [<a href="#rid1">1,3,6,16-18</a>]. Initial systemic symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, myalgia, or dizziness. Patients with neurotoxicity may complain of double vision, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, or generalized weakness [<a href="#rid3">3,16,19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1136670183"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neuromuscular signs of coral snake envenomation typically develop four to six hours after the snakebite but can be delayed for more than 12 hours [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Findings include salivation, drowsiness, and a descending muscle weakness that usually begins with ocular and bulbar signs including ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria, and dysphagia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122086" href="/d/graphic/122086.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16,18</a>]. Generalized muscle weakness can cause respiratory depression or failure.</p><p>In most patients, pain at the bite site is minimal or absent. Although swelling at the bite site may be present, it is usually less pronounced than in patients with pit viper envenomations. Significant local tissue damage and coagulopathy are <strong>not</strong> typical of coral snake envenomation in the United States [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, severe local pain, myolysis, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy in addition to delayed neurotoxicity have been described after envenomation by <em>Micrurus lemniscatus halleri</em>, which is found in Central and South America [<a href="#rid1">1,13,20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1136670756"><span class="h2">Ancillary studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with suspected or confirmed coral snakebites require serial assessment of respiratory function.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H487520645"><span class="h3">Respiratory function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the decision to perform endotracheal intubation and institute mechanical ventilation should be made on clinical grounds (including the need for airway protection associated with bulbar palsy), ancillary studies may provide additional objective information to augment serial clinical assessment in some patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pulmonary function testing</strong> – Serial measurements of pulmonary function, especially maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP, sometimes called negative inspiratory force [NIF]), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), and forced vital capacity (FVC), can identify the presence and degree of respiratory muscle weakness. Serial measures of pulmonary function (instead of using one measure at one point in time) can be used as rough guidelines, especially when the respiratory decline is acute in children under six years of age. MIP can be obtained even when a lack of cooperation does not allow measurement of MEP or FVC. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6965.html" rel="external">"Tests of respiratory muscle strength", section on 'Interpretation (PImax, PEmax, SNIP)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5124.html" rel="external">"Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Management", section on 'Chronic ventilatory support'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ventilatory support is indicated when the FVC is less than 50 percent of predicted, when the MIP is less negative than -30 cmH2O (eg, -20 cmH2O), or when the MEP is below -40 cmH2O. The diminished MIP indicates a high risk for hypercapnia, while the low MEP indicates inadequate cough strength and risk for secretion retention.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Capnography</strong> – Capnography measures end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) and respiratory rate with each breath in spontaneously breathing patients. Continuous capnography provides instantaneous feedback on the clinical status of the patient and can provide early detection of hypercarbia in victims of coral snake envenomation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/273.html" rel="external">"Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)", section on 'Acute respiratory distress'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood gas measurement</strong> – Arterial or venous blood gas may also be used to assess the degree of respiratory acidosis in patients with weakness or declining clinical status. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2352.html" rel="external">"Simple and mixed acid-base disorders", section on 'Response to respiratory acidosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Continuous pulse oximetry is also appropriate but is insensitive for the detection of respiratory failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1303657211"><span class="h3">Signs of hemo- or myotoxicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hemo- or myotoxicity has only been described after envenomation by the South American coral snake (<em>Micrurus lemniscatus helleri</em>) [<a href="#rid1">1,13</a>]. When a bite by this snake is confirmed or when the patient is bitten by a banded snake but is displaying signs of significant local pain, muscle pain, or bleeding that is atypical for most coral snakes, then the following studies should be obtained:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Coagulopathy</strong> – Clotting parameters should be measured as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Complete blood count with platelets</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fibrinogen (only direct fibrinogen measurement is reliable; derived fibrinogen is not reliable in snakebites)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products or D-dimer</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rhabdomyolysis </strong>–<strong> </strong>Studies helpful in identifying rhabdomyolysis and associated renal impairment include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rapid urine dipstick for blood</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Urine for myoglobin</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Microscopic urinalysis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Serum creatine kinase</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1672335462"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of a coral snakebite is typically straightforward because it often results from direct handling of a banded snake that must often be forcibly removed, as coral snakes frequently adhere tightly to the bite site.

When antivenom was scarce, observation of patients for onset of symptoms prior to administering antivenom became a more common practice in the United States. Subsequent experience suggests that the risk of empiric antivenom administration may outweigh the benefits in most asymptomatic patients. For example, in a retrospective observational study of 240 patients with eastern coral snakebites reported to the Florida Poison Information Network and who were asymptomatic at presentation, only 6 of 106 patients (5.7 percent) who had antivenom initially withheld ultimately received antivenom; one of these patients went on to require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for 24 days [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In the 134 asymptomatic patients who received antivenom empirically, three underwent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for an average of six days. Of the 252 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who received antivenom in this study, 18 percent had adverse reactions including shortness of breath (8 percent), hypotension (2 percent), and angioedema (1 percent).

Bites are uncommon but can be life-threatening. Coral snake venom produces weakness and paralysis via toxins that target the neuromuscular junction. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Coral snake characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Findings of coral snake envenomation are provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122086" href="/d/graphic/122086.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Important history includes (see <a class="local">'History'</a> above): </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>When the bite occurred </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>When symptoms began </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prior history of snakebite treated with antivenom</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Allergy to horses or sheep</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Neuromuscular signs of coral snake envenomation are characterized by ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria, and/or dysphagia with potential progression to respiratory failure (see <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above). These findings may be delayed more than 12 hours after the snakebite.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Recommended ancillary studies consist of (see <a class="local">'Ancillary studies'</a> above): </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pulmonary function testing, especially maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP, sometimes called negative inspiratory force [NIF]), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), and forced vital capacity (FVC); MIP alone is performed in uncooperative children. </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with signs of weakness, blood gas measurement. </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who are displaying signs of significant local pain, muscle pain, or bleeding (atypical for most coral snakebites), clotting parameters and studies to assess for rhabdomyolysis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of a coral snakebite relies on a history of banded snakebite. It is further supported by accompanying signs of envenomation, especially muscle weakness. A digital photograph or verified coral snake specimen confirms the diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Clinicians who lack experience caring for patients with coral snakebites should seek expert consultation with a medical toxicologist, regional poison control center, or physician experienced in management of coral snakes in the region. (See <a class="local">'Additional resources'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Management is based on the clinical presentation:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Asymptomatic or minor local symptoms (mild pain or swelling at the bite site)</strong> – Patients with no symptoms or only minor local swelling and pain at the bite site after suspected or confirmed eastern, Texas, or other coral snakebite warrant observation for 24 hours. For these patients, we suggest <strong>against</strong> empiric antivenom administration because the risk of antivenom administration appears to exceed the risk of neurotoxicity (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, some experts treat all confirmed coral snakebites with antivenom regardless of clinical findings. (See <a class="local">'Asymptomatic or minor local symptoms'</a> above and <a class="local">'Coral snakebites by other species'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">During observation, these patients require continuous capnography and: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Serial assessment of motor strength, especially ocular and bulbar findings such as ptosis, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, and dysarthria. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Serial measures of pulmonary function, especially MIP, NIF, and in cooperative patients, MEP and FVC.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">A reasonable approach is to assess motor weakness and pulmonary function hourly for the first 12 hours and then, if no progression, decrease to every two hours for the remaining 12 hours. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Neuromuscular or other systemic findings of envenomation</strong> – For patients with weakness or other systemic findings of envenomation (eg, salivation, vomiting, or paresthesias) beyond minor pain and swelling at the bite site after a suspected or confirmed eastern or Texas coral snakebite, we recommend the administration of antivenom rather than supportive care alone (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_3" rel="external">Grade 1C</a>). For symptomatic patients with coral snakebites by species typically found in Mexico, Central America, and South America, we suggest antivenom rather than supportive care alone (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Antivenom is most effective when given as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. Coral snake antivenoms can cause severe allergic reactions and require administration in an acute care setting. (See <a class="local">'North American coral snake antivenom'</a> above and <a class="local">'Antivenom'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The initial dose of antivenom does <strong>not</strong> differ between adults and children. For specific antivenom dosing, the clinician should refer to the manufacturer's directions for use and local guidelines. (See <a class="local">'North American coral snake antivenom'</a> above and <a class="local">'Antivenom'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If anaphylaxis occurs, stop antivenom infusion and provide emergency management as described in the rapid overviews  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346" href="/d/graphic/58346.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242" href="/d/graphic/74242.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Symptomatic patients also warrant monitoring and serial assessment of motor strength and pulmonary function, as described above, but with more frequent assessment of motor weakness and pulmonary function (eg, hourly).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Patients with clinical evidence of ventilatory failure or who cannot maintain their airway warrant prompt endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, regardless of whether they have received antivenom or not. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Neostigmine</strong> – If there is a delay in obtaining species-specific antivenom and neurotoxicity is developing after a suspected South American coral snakebite, it is reasonable to perform a trial of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9693" href="/d/drug information/9693.html" rel="external">neostigmine</a> with coadministration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8983" href="/d/drug information/8983.html" rel="external">atropine</a>. However, it should<strong> not</strong> delay endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for patients who cannot maintain their airway or who develop respiratory failure. Neostigmine is unlikely to be beneficial for neurotoxicity caused by eastern or Texas coral snake envenomation. (See <a class="local">'Neostigmine'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93182.html" rel="external">"Snakebites worldwide: Management", section on 'Anticholinesterases'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">If antivenom is not available to treat an eastern or Texas coral snakebite, a trial of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9693" href="/d/drug information/9693.html" rel="external">neostigmine</a>, coadministered with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8983" href="/d/drug information/8983.html" rel="external">atropine</a>, is unlikely to be beneficial and should not be given.
