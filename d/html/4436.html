         Bone marrow examination is useful in the diagnosis and staging of hematologic disease, as well as in the assessment of overall bone marrow cellularity. Because of easy accessibility, aspiration, biopsy, and culture of the bone marrow may also play a role in the assessment of patients with fever of undetermined origin as well as in the diagnosis of various storage and infiltrative disorders.

         The indications, contraindications, technique, and complications of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be reviewed here [

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The bone marrow is one of the most widely distributed organs in the human body. It is the principal site of blood formation beginning at the time of birth, at which time all bone cavities are filled with hematopoietic tissue. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3536.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of hematopoietic stem cells", section on 'Bone marrow anatomy and microenvironment'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         By adolescence, active marrow is usually only found in the cavities of axial bones (sternum, ribs, vertebrae, clavicles, scapulae, skull, pelvis, and the proximal ends of the femurs and humeri) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Overall bone marrow cellularity approximates 100 percent at birth and declines with time, paralleling an age-associated reduction in hematopoietic activity. Accordingly, bone marrow cellularity in the adult is approximately 50 percent, with the remainder of the marrow being composed of adipose tissue  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68384" href="/z/d/graphic/68384.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4434.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of bone marrow aspirate smears", section on 'Estimation of cellularity and myeloid to erythroid ratio'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Under physiologic conditions, all sites of hematopoiesis tend to exhibit uniform cellularity and cell lineage proportions. Thus, generalizations can be made regarding overall hematopoiesis from the evaluation of bone marrow at a single site. In most hematologic disorders, study of bone marrow at multiple sites has not been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Exceptions include malignancies that may have patchy marrow involvement (eg, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, metastatic disease), requiring either larger specimens or specimens from multiple sites. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Adequacy of the biopsy specimen'
         </a>

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         The decision to perform a bone marrow evaluation must be made after the critical assessment of pertinent information available from the history, physical, and laboratory studies, including a review of the complete blood count (CBC) and examination of the peripheral blood smear. As noted above, bone marrow examination is a useful tool in the diagnosis and staging of various hematologic diseases and in the assessment of bone marrow cellularity, cellular morphology, and maturation. Highly specialized testing, such as cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and molecular analyses, can be performed on these specimens, and have become critically important in establishing certain diagnoses, especially the leukemias and lymphomas [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4695.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and initial evaluation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma", section on 'Analysis of biopsy material'
         </a>
         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4497.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia", section on 'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to accommodating blood cell formation, the bone marrow also houses a complex stromal complex, along with elements of the monocyte-macrophage system. These supporting cellular systems may also become involved in a number of systemic diseases. Accordingly, aspiration, biopsy, and culture of the bone marrow may have value in the assessment of patients with fever of undetermined origin and in the diagnosis of various storage and infiltrative diseases, in which the number and/or activity of these stromal cells may be deranged.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most clinical scenarios require both bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for a complete hematologic evaluation. This is especially true when assessing overall bone marrow cellularity, determining patterns of marrow involvement, and searching for evidence of infiltration associated with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, solid malignancies, or storage diseases. Accordingly, bone marrow aspiration is most often accompanied by biopsy [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Exceptions to this rule are circumstances in which a very specific clinical question can be answered via aspiration alone. An example might be in the diagnosis and follow-up of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), as the diagnosis relies heavily on cytogenetic and molecular findings, as well as morphology, all of which can be obtained by aspiration or by sampling peripheral blood [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. However, even this is controversial, as some cases of CML may be accompanied by fibrosis, which is best assessed on the biopsy specimen. Aspiration alone may be adequate for the initial diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as routine surveillance bone marrow examinations on these patients [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].

         </span>
         The only absolute contraindications to performing a bone marrow biopsy are the presence of severe hemophilia, severe disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, or other related severe bleeding disorders. Thrombocytopenia, regardless of severity, is not a contraindication [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. However, depending on the circumstances, platelet transfusion to insure a platelet count &gt;20,000/microL may be warranted prior to the procedure [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. (See

         Most hematologists do not consider therapeutic anticoagulation to be an important risk factor for bleeding following bone marrow biopsy, although practice patterns in this regard vary widely. As an example, an email survey of members of the Australasian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis and the Hematology Society of Australia and New Zealand asked hematologists about their current approaches to performing bone marrow biopsy among thrombocytopenic or anticoagulated patients. Results of this informal survey included the following [
         <a href="#rid17">

         In thrombocytopenic patients, 48 percent did not transfuse platelets, 49 percent transfused platelets only in selected patients, and 3 percent transfused platelets routinely.

         In anticoagulated patients, 13 percent performed the biopsy irrespective of the INR, 51 percent performed the biopsy if the INR was not above the therapeutic range, 18 percent performed the biopsy if the INR was &lt;2.0, and 18 percent stopped

        <p>
         There is little or no information concerning the risk of bleeding following bone marrow aspiration/biopsy in patients who are taking one or more antiplatelet agents. It is the general consensus that bone marrow aspiration/biopsy is a low-risk procedure and that the risk of thrombosis from stopping these agents prior to the biopsy is greater than the risk of bleeding if these agents are not stopped. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1312.html" rel="external">
          "Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants", section on 'Estimating thromboembolic risk'

        </p>
        <p>
         Post-procedural bleeding, if any, is almost always controlled by manual application of pressure to the site. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Bleeding'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with suspected multiple myeloma or other disorders associated with bone resorption should not undergo sternal bone marrow aspiration due to an increased risk of sternal perforation. Bone marrow biopsy of the sternum should
         <strong>
          never
         </strong>
         be attempted in any patient, due to the fragility of the bone at this site as well as its proximity to the heart and great vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
         Precautions may need to be taken if there is skin infection or osteomyelitis in the area of proposed aspiration or biopsy, or if the patient is unable to remain still for the procedure. Several complications may accompany bone marrow aspiration or biopsy despite adherence to these precautions (see
         <a class="local">

         The tests that are obtained depend on the clinical scenario and the diagnoses that are being considered.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before starting the procedure, decisions should be made about whether both an aspirate and biopsy are required, and if special samples are needed for additional tests (eg, cytogenetics, flow cytometry, special stains)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82481" href="/z/d/graphic/82481.html" rel="external">

         ). A discussion with the hematopathology laboratory should occur before the procedure is undertaken to make sure that the appropriate samples, sample collection vials, and tests have been agreed upon. As examples, cytogenetic testing requires live cells, ideally in culture medium (not formalin-fixed cells), and special stains may require more slides than are routinely prepared.

         Obtaining the sample when laboratory personnel are available for discussion and optimal specimen handling is generally preferable. However, in certain cases it may be necessary to obtain the sample in off-hours. Examples may include obtaining a sample before glucocorticoids are administered to a patient with possible lymphoid malignancy. Importantly, however, treatment of the patient should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be delayed solely to obtain a better sample.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also preferable to have a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood smear that was obtained on the same day as the bone marrow sample, to allow identification of specific cells and to correlate the bone marrow cellularity with cytopenias in the peripheral blood.

         In selected cases, bone marrow may be obtained from the greater trochanter of the femur, individual vertebral bodies, or ribs. Such procedures, including open bone biopsies, are best obtained through surgical consultation, and may require CT guidance (see

         Bone marrow may be aspirated from the sternum in patients over 12 years of age  (

         ), although
         <strong>
          biopsy at this site is contraindicated
         </strong>
         because of its minimal thickness. Special care needs to be taken if this site is chosen for marrow aspiration, since penetration of the inner table of the sternum or penetration through a rib interspace may lead to fatal hemorrhage (see

         In premature infants and some full-term infants, the iliac bone has not completely ossified, and an alternative bone (eg, the anterior portion of the tibia) should be used [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

        <p>
         On occasion, it may not be possible to identify an aspiration/biopsy site because of the presence of excessive adipose tissue; surface landmarks may be difficult to identify and/or the available needle may not reach the bone surface (see

         Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies often clot within minutes of being obtained. During this time, the person performing the procedure may still be busy performing an aspiration or biopsy at the same or another site, reassuring the patient, or initiating local hemostasis. Ideally, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy be carried out with the help of a trained assistant who can either help prepare the slides and specimens or who assist in achieving adequate hemostasis following completion of the procedure.

         Disposable aspiration and biopsy needles are preferred in order to guarantee sterility and sharpness, as well as to reduce procedure-related pain and "failure" rates [

          30

It is important to use a sharp needle, as well as one long enough to penetrate through the subcutaneous tissues and into the marrow cavity. A needle chosen for sternal aspiration should be shorter than one used for aspiration at the iliac crest, and should be equipped with a guard to insure controlled entrance into (and not beyond) the sternal marrow cavity (see

In heavier patients, a lateral decubitus position with the knees pulled closer to the chest, or a prone position accompanied by pressure over the bone, may help to identify the landmarks by reducing the depth of the fat pad overlying the iliac crest [

         In the absence of local skin problems (eg, infection, induration, ulceration), the usual site for aspiration and biopsy is approximately three finger-widths from the midline and two finger-widths inferior to the iliac crest. Mark the chosen area by making an indentation in the skin with a coin, fingernail, or the end of a ballpoint pen with the writing tip retracted.

         Use a steady twisting back and forth motion. Do not twist more than 180 degrees to penetrate the periosteum and the cortical bone; a "give" is felt when the needle enters the marrow cavity. At the point of entry, the patient may express complaints of a deep-seated pain. It is important to alert the patient to this possibility ahead of time. Continue to advance the needle slightly to ensure that it is anchored into the bone.

         Aspirate 0.2 to 0.5 mL of marrow contents and remove the syringe. It may be necessary to attach additional syringes if many studies have been ordered. In general it is prudent to avoid aspirating more than 0.5 mL per syringe, as greater amounts may be prone to dilution of the bone marrow sample with peripheral blood or to clotting [

         The non-anticoagulated specimen should be handed to the assistant, who will assess the quality of the sample (ie, determine the presence or absence of grossly visible bone spicules) and prepare the various smears. If an assistant is not available, the sample should be used immediately to make a bone marrow aspirate smear and/or placed in an appropriate tube for later smear preparation. Anticoagulated specimens should be sent to the laboratory for further preparation and other tests (eg, cytogenetics, molecular studies, cultures, flow cytometry). The patient should be made aware of the need for multiple specimens at the outset, since each separate aspiration may be painful, despite fully adequate local anesthesia. (See

         If aspiration attempts are not successful, reinsert the stylet (the needle may be rotated) and advance the needle a short distance; repeat attempts at aspiration with the syringe and suction.

         Once the biopsy needle has been removed, the specimen may be extracted from the needle by inserting the obturator (or stylet) through the distal (cutting) end of the needle. The bone marrow biopsy can then be placed on a slide, where imprints ("touch prints") are made before the core specimen is further processed for cytologic investigations. This step is especially useful in situations where a bone marrow aspirate could not be obtained (see

         Examine the biopsy specimen. If the specimen consists mostly of homogeneous, white material (cortical bone) or glistening tissue (cartilage), it may be necessary to attempt a second biopsy for a more satisfactory specimen. This should be done with a new biopsy needle, as the original needle may have been damaged by the process of inserting the obturator or stylet through the distal end of the biopsy needle.

         Bone marrow examination may be obtained by an incisional biopsy at a number of different bony sites. An appropriate site is usually determined by prior examination of the patient or by the appropriate radiologic method (eg, CT scan, MRI). As an example, when investigating a patient with possible metastatic cancer or multiple myeloma, it is important to choose an area where there is clinical or radiologic evidence for potential bone marrow invasion [

Place approximately 0.5 mL of marrow aspirate on one glass slide; if only one or two aspirate samples are to be prepared, the remainder may be added to an EDTA-anticoagulated sample collection tube, mixing well. This should be done immediately to prevent clotting of the specimen. Preparations are then made using one or more of the following three techniques:

         A "dry tap" is defined by a situation in which no bone marrow sample is obtainable by aspiration (ie, there are no identifiable bone spicules in the specimen) despite easily obtained marrow blood. Faulty technique may be the cause, in that the tip of the aspirating needle may not have penetrated into the marrow cavity.
        </p>
        <p>
         More often, a dry tap is due to alterations within the marrow associated with myeloproliferative or leukemic disorders. Such marrow changes usually involve an element of fibrosis, metastatic tumor infiltration, or granuloma formation [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In such cases, bone marrow biopsy should always be performed. Touch preparations of the biopsy can be made which will often provide sufficient cellular material for diagnostic evaluation [

          44

         If the aspirated specimen is inadequate (devoid of particles) or unobtainable (dry tap), a touch preparation may be prepared from the biopsy core. Cells on the surface of the biopsy core stick to slides and are stained for morphologic, cytochemical, or immunoperoxidase evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
         This technique requires placing a fresh core biopsy specimen onto a clean microscope slide. A second slide is then pressed against the core specimen and rolled slightly from side to side. Two or three slides with several imprints on each slide should be prepared in this manner [

         The patient should avoid overexertion (eg, heavy activity or exercise) for at least 24 hours, to avoid potential pain or bleeding at the site of the procedure. The area of the aspiration/biopsy should be kept dry, using a small dressing or bandage, during this time to minimize the chance of infection or bleeding.

         If the patient continues to bleed from the aspirate/biopsy site after an initial observation period of 10 to 15 minutes, it may be prudent to reapply pressure to the site and have the patient lie supine for at least one hour. If bleeding continues after this additional time of observation, it may be necessary to transfuse platelets if the patient is severely thrombocytopenic or if platelet function is suspected to be compromised.

         Complications following bone marrow biopsy are rare. In a survey of members of the British Society of Haematology reported in 2003, there were 26 adverse events, including one fatality, out of an estimated total of 55,000 biopsy procedures (0.05 percent) [

         In most cases, bleeding is controlled by manual application of pressure to the site.

         Complications of sternal aspiration are rare, but merit special consideration due to their potential seriousness. The sternum is only one centimeter thick in the adult, which may predispose to through-and-through penetration of the sternum with potentially fatal cardiovascular complications, pericardial tamponade, pneumothorax, pulmonary emboli, infection, and bone erosion, thinning, or sternal fracture [

          63

         Bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy is contraindicated patients with severe hemophilia, severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, or other related severe bleeding disorders. Thrombocytopenia, regardless of severity, is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         a contraindication. (See

         <strong>
          Aspiration/biopsy sites
         </strong>
         – The following anatomical sites can be used for bone marrow aspiration. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choice of aspiration or biopsy site'
         </a>
         above.)
