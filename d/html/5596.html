         Paget disease of bone, also known as osteitis deformans, is a focal disorder of bone metabolism characterized by an accelerated rate of bone remodeling, resulting in overgrowth of bone at selected sites and impaired integrity of affected bone. The main clinical manifestations are pain and deformities in affected areas and a heightened risk of fracture, although many patients are asymptomatic. Osteoarthritis in nearby joints and neurologic disease are common complications, and the vascularity of pagetic bone may result in excessive bleeding during orthopedic surgery on affected areas.

         , can usually ease pain, slow bone turnover, and promote deposition of normal lamellar bone, which in turn results over time in the normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase and other markers of bone turnover and may lead to radiographic healing of lytic lesions [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ]. However, alternative agents, such as

          calcitonin

         , are sometimes required in patients unable to use these bisphosphonates. Analgesic, rehabilitative, surgical, and other measures may also be of benefit.

         The treatment of Paget disease of bone will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See

         Treatment is indicated in patients with symptomatic Paget disease and in selected asymptomatic patients with significant biochemical abnormalities or imaging changes indicating risk of complications from untreated disease. The goals of treatment are to ease pain and to reduce the rate of bone remodeling towards normal, which will enhance the deposition of normal lamellar bone, decrease the vascularity of bone, and slow disease progression. (See

         Treatment is indicated in patients with symptoms caused by metabolically active Paget disease, which is usually associated with an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase of bone origin, although this might not be so in those with mono-ostotic disease. The most common symptom is bone pain at a pagetic site (eg, headache, limb, joint, or back pain) or radicular pain due to neural impingement by pagetic bone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms and findings that may respond to pharmacologic treatment in patients with active disease include bone pain and symptomatic nerve compression, as well as radiographic findings of osteolytic bone lesions. However, patients with back or joint pain often have coexistent neuromuscular or joint disease, such as osteoarthritis, associated with nearby pagetic involvement [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. The precise cause of pain in these patients may be difficult to determine; thus, a trial of bisphosphonate therapy is generally indicated, even if the serum alkaline phosphatase level is normal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fracture through a pagetic bone lesion is an additional manifestation of Paget disease in which treatment may be beneficial. Although formal recommendations from professional societies to guide therapy are lacking, we suggest antipagetic treatment in patients presenting with a pathologic fracture once the patient is stable, provided no contraindications to therapy exist.

         Treatment is indicated in some patients with asymptomatic Paget disease, which has typically been detected in the course of evaluation of an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase or noted incidentally on imaging studies performed for some other reason. Decisions regarding therapy in asymptomatic patients should take into account the location of the disease and the presence of comorbidities.

          and
         </strong>
         there is evidence of active disease, either based upon elevated alkaline phosphatase or bone scintigraphy. Specific examples include lesions involving spine (risk of pathologic fracture or nerve impingement), weightbearing bones (risk of fracture), skull (risk of hearing loss), or bone abutting a joint (risk of secondary osteoarthritis).

         Surgery is planned at an active pagetic site. In patients with active disease in planned operative sites we initiate antipagetic therapy prior to surgery, preferably beginning three months before elective procedures.

         Hypercalcemia develops in the setting of immobilization. Hypercalcemia has been noted in some immobilized patients with polyostotic disease [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, hypercalcemia in an ambulatory patient suggests the presence of a second disorder, such as primary hyperparathyroidism, and would not itself be sufficient to indicate a need for antipagetic therapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Preoperative antipagetic therapy'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5601.html" rel="external">

         Our approach to asymptomatic disease is consistent with the 2014 Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. It is important to note that while bisphosphonate treatment is clearly effective at reducing metabolic activity [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ], strong evidence demonstrating that treatment prevents complications of disease is lacking. Indeed, the 2019 guidelines developed by the Paget's Association (United Kingdom)-led Guidelines Development Group state only that bisphosphonate therapy "may be considered" in asymptomatic patients with evidence of pagetic disease activity [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Thus, when treatment for asymptomatic patients is considered for the reasons noted above, we provide patient education with respect to guidelines, existing clinical evidence, and risks of treatment, thereby facilitating the incorporation of patient preference in treatment decisions. It is important to note that while data supporting the long-term benefit of treating asymptomatic Paget disease are sparse or lacking, many experts have expressed that the potential for benefit outweighs the risk.

         Several antiresorptive agents are effective in treating Paget disease. These drugs target the osteoclast, which is the primary cell that mediates the high bone turnover characteristic of Paget disease. There are three classes of antiresorptive agents: the bisphosphonates,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9182" href="/z/d/drug information/9182.html" rel="external">
          calcitonin

         , and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">
          denosumab
         </a>
         . Of these drugs, bisphosphonates and calcitonin are used for the treatment of Paget disease. These drugs suppress bone resorption within days to weeks, followed by suppression of bone formation in weeks to months, with a reduction in the serum fraction of alkaline phosphatase that comes from bone [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Denosumab is not routinely used for Paget disease. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Antipagetic agents'

         below.)

          Zoledronic acid
         </a>
         is the first-choice treatment for Paget disease because of its efficacy and ease of administration. The choice of zoledronic acid as the initial agent for most patients with active Paget disease is consistent with both the 2014 clinical practice guidelines of the Endocrine Society and the 2019 Paget's Association guidelines [
         <a href="#rid10">

          Zoledronic acid
         </a>
         is highly potent, has the advantage of being infused over 15 to 20 minutes, and produces the most sustained response among the available bisphosphonates. In osteoporotic women, zoledronic acid reduced bone turnover markers for up to 3 years after administration [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. In Paget disease, biochemical remission was induced in 96 percent of patients after a single dose [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Remission is maintained in the majority of patients out to 5 to 6 years [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ] and as long as 10 years, with only 14 percent of patients having a biochemical relapse by 9 years [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. In addition, zoledronic acid is effective in patients previously treated with other bisphosphonates [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ] (see

         recommended by the FDA for use in patients with a creatinine clearance &lt;30 to 35 mL/minute.

Zoledronic acid is well tolerated, although some patients who are naïve to nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates experience "flu-like" symptoms for several days following initial drug administration.

         Sustained biochemical remissions are achieved in most patients. In a cohort of patients treated at a mean age of 76, more patients died (&gt;50 percent) due to an unrelated cause than experienced a biochemical relapse (14 percent) after 10 years of follow-up [

Zoledronic acid resulted in more frequent attainment of the primary endpoint, normalization of the serum alkaline phosphatase, or a 75 percent reduction in total alkaline phosphatase excess (the difference from the midpoint of the reference range [96 versus 74 percent]); and was associated with a shorter median time to therapeutic response (64 versus 89 days) and a much lower frequency of loss of response in post-trial follow-up for a median of 190 days (1 versus 27 percent).

The 33 nonresponders to pamidronate were crossed over to zoledronic acid or neridronate (100 mg intravenously for two consecutive days).

Pamidronate nonresponders were crossed over to alendronate after one year. At one year, biochemical remission (defined as both the serum alkaline phosphatase and urine deoxypyridinoline/creatinine ratio being in the normal range) occurred more often in the alendronate group (86 versus 56 percent). However, the results were affected by whether or not the patients had previously been treated with pamidronate. In the 44 previously untreated patients, the rate of biochemical remission was similar in the two groups (91 versus 86 percent). By contrast, in the 28 patients previously treated with pamidronate, the rate of biochemical remission was higher with alendronate (79 versus 14 percent). These data suggested a high rate of acquired resistance to pamidronate and were consistent with prior observations of pamidronate resistance [

         In most patients who have elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline, serial measurement of this marker can be useful for monitoring the response to therapy. In patients with normal bone turnover markers at baseline, such as many with very limited disease, the use of bone scintigraphy may be indicated. We take the following approach:

          Baseline elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase
         </strong>
         – Serum alkaline phosphatase should be measured at three to six months to assess the initial response to therapy; once the value plateaus, it can be measured once or twice a year as a marker of bone activity [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. The more potent bisphosphonates suppress bone resorption within days to weeks, as shown by decreased urine n-telopeptides or serum C-telopeptide (beta-CTX), followed by suppression of bone formation in weeks to months, with a reduction in the serum fraction of alkaline phosphatase that comes from bone [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. However, we do not routinely measure other markers of bone turnover, such as urinary pyridinium crosslink excretion, since there is no evidence that they are better measures of clinical response than serum alkaline phosphatase [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72

         Normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with a sustained period of biochemical remission and histologic evidence of normal bone turnover; on the other hand, increases in serum alkaline phosphatase are consistent with increases in disease activity [

          1,2,14,31,73-75

         – A measurement of the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) level can help discriminate between liver and bone as the source of an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase; it is usually unnecessary to order more expensive bone markers to determine this, as the GGT is elevated in liver disease but is not in disorders of bone. For a patient with both Paget disease and liver disease, we use measurement of the serum procollagen type 1 propeptide (PINP) level as a marker to assess bone formation rate.

          RETREATMENT: INDICATIONS AND APPROACH

         Indications for retreatment with bisphosphonates generally depend upon evidence of increased or recurrent abnormal bone turnover, as determined by recurrent pain, periodic serial measurements of serum alkaline phosphatase, or radiographic progression of disease. Some clinicians retreat patients only for symptoms related to Paget disease, while others retreat whenever the serum alkaline phosphatase becomes elevated above normal or rises to a significant degree above the previous nadir [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,9
         </a>
         ]. New symptoms, which may respond to retreatment if due to Paget disease, should be distinguished from secondary or unrelated changes that are not caused by current disease activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data from clinical trials do not address the issue of retreatment adequately, but available guidelines have been summarized [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In the Paget disease: randomized trial of intensive versus symptomatic management (PRISM) trial, which included an older adult population (mean age 74) with extant deformity and abnormal bone architecture, the findings suggested that an abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase was not by itself an indication for retreatment, as outcomes did not differ between the groups [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77,78
         </a>
         ]. In an extension of this trial (PRISM-EZ), intensive treatment with zoledronate to maintain normal serum alkaline phosphatase over an additional three years conferred no clinical benefit compared with symptomatic treatment only [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ]. However, the duration of follow-up in these studies was short and many experts believe that retreatment is beneficial.
        </p>
        <p>
         We take the following approach, which is in accordance with the available evidence and expert opinion [

         In patients with active Paget disease by biochemical markers or active lesions on bone scan, periodic retreatment is indicated in hopes of preventing progression of deformity of bone with aging. This can be done at intervals of 5 to 10 years in many, using

         Orthopedic surgical options that may be considered in selected patients with Paget disease include corrective osteotomy for long bone deformity, fracture fixation, joint arthroplasty, spinal decompression, and resection of bone tumors [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80
         </a>
         ]. Factors that may pose additional challenges for the surgeon include the abnormal quality and hypervascularity of bone, bowing deformity of the limbs, and/or distortion of the acetabulum. It has been reported that Paget disease increases risk for postoperative heterotopic bone formation [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80,81
         </a>
         ]. However, a recent large retrospective case control study did not find an increased rate of heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty in patients with Paget disease compared with controls [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, prior reports of high risk for implant loosening and revision arthroplasty were borne out by this study. (See

         Patients with active disease in operative sites are at increased risk for blood loss, which may be decreased by preoperative antiresorptive treatment. We suggest that treatment with bisphosphonates be initiated three months prior to elective surgery. (See

         Life expectancy, which may be difficult to predict, should only be a limited consideration in decisions to treat. Age alone is generally not a factor, as the newer bisphosphonates are usually well tolerated. Further, in our view, when one weighs the consequence of this disease to an aging skeleton, and the increasing life expectancy of the population, treatment is also indicated in the younger population in hopes of preventing progression to deformity, easing pain, and restoring bone remodeling to more normal levels.

         <a href="#rid16">

          87
         </a>
         ]. Pain arising from pagetic bone usually responds rapidly to therapy, followed in weeks to months by gradual normalization of the serum alkaline phosphatase. However, most studies have not been designed to confirm the expectation that bisphosphonate therapy will prevent long-term complications [

         In randomized trials of the bisphosphonates in patients with Paget disease, outcomes of effective treatment have included reduction in pain, reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase, normalization of other bone turnover markers, the replacement of abnormal bone with normal lamellar bone, radiographic healing, and some improvement in measures of quality of life [

         Some manifestations of Paget disease may not be reversible. As examples, antipagetic therapy will rarely restore hearing, although it may stabilize hearing loss; it will not reverse deformity of bone or, as noted, all radiographic evidence of Paget disease on plain radiography; and it will not diminish the pain and dysfunction caused by secondary osteoarthritic changes. There are also case reports of improvement in paraparesis or symptoms of spinal stenosis with bisphosphonate therapy [

         The goals of pharmacologic treatment for Paget disease are to ease pain and to normalize the rate of bone remodeling, which is pathologically increased in untreated patients. Success of treatment is generally assessed by periodic monitoring of the alkaline phosphatase. The secondary consequences of Paget disease need to be treated with other modalities. These include hearing aids, analgesics for arthritis pain, and, as adjuncts to antipagetic medications, physical therapy and walking aids. In addition, attention must be paid to psychosocial issues.

         Symptoms and findings that may respond to pharmacologic treatment in patients with active disease include bone pain, symptoms of nerve compression, and radiographic findings of osteolytic bone lesions. Although unproven, treatment with nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates is generally expected to prevent the long-term complications of disease, such as pathologic fractures, skeletal deformity, secondary osteoarthritis, and neurologic disorders including deafness.

         In all patients who will be treated with bisphosphonates, normal serum levels of calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol) should be documented, and supplemental vitamin D and calcium supplements provided as needed. (See

         Because of a small but undetermined level of risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in association with bisphosphonate use in Paget disease, planned invasive dental work, such as extractions or implants, should be performed at least three to six months prior to institution of bisphosphonate therapy whenever possible.

         Indications for retreatment with bisphosphonates include evidence of increased or recurrent abnormal bone turnover as determined by periodic serial measurements of serum alkaline phosphatase, radiographic progression of disease, or recurrent pain. New symptoms, which may respond to retreatment if due to Paget disease, should be distinguished from secondary or unrelated changes that are not caused by current disease activity. (See
