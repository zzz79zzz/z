While prosthetic materials have replaced the arterial homografts used originally, the technical conduct of the operation has remained largely unchanged for nearly 70 years. Open surgical repair of abdominal aneurysms has proven to be safe, widely available, effective in preventing aneurysm rupture, and remarkably durable [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm is performed under general anesthesia with appropriate monitoring of volume status and fluid administration and transfusion, as needed. Repair of the aorta is carried out in a systematic fashion that involves clamping the aorta to stop blood flow, opening the aneurysm to remove thrombus and debris from within the aorta, and suturing a synthetic graft to replace the diseased arterial segment.</p><p>The preoperative evaluation and preparation, operative technique, and postoperative care and follow-up of patients undergoing AAA repair is reviewed here. General issues regarding the management of AAA and the surgical and endovascular management of ruptured AAA are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15188.html" rel="external">"Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15191.html" rel="external">"Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16843.html" rel="external">"Surgical and endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm"</a>.)</p><p>Anesthesia choices, monitoring, and the conduct of anesthesia for open aortic surgery is reviewed separately.

The clinical evaluation and management of AAA are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15188.html" rel="external">"Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Summary of indications for elective AAA repair'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15191.html" rel="external">"Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Approach to AAA associated with symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H273860729"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm is contraindicated in patients in whom the estimated risk of the procedure exceeds the risk of rupture. These risk factors are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Medical risk assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>Relative contraindications to open surgical repair of AAA in the era of endovascular aneurysm repair may include the following: hostile abdomen, obesity, major cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities, and limited life expectancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15188.html" rel="external">"Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Open versus endovascular aneurysm repair'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15191.html" rel="external">"Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H273861107"><span class="h1">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The abdominal aorta is defined as aneurysmal when a localized dilation is more than 50 percent larger than the normal adjacent aortic diameter [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. From a practical standpoint, an infrarenal aortic diameter greater than 3.0 cm (measured outer wall-to-outer wall) is considered aneurysmal for most individuals [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Aortoiliac anatomy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/87283.html" rel="external">"Overview of abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Definitions and aortoiliac anatomy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H273861121"><span class="h2">Aneurysm extent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are commonly described based on the relationship to the renal arteries as infrarenal, juxtarenal, pararenal, and suprarenal  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90459" href="/d/graphic/90459.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). AAAs most often occur in the segment of aorta between the renal arteries and the bifurcation of the aorta. Only 5 percent of aortic aneurysms involve the renal or visceral arteries  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60682" href="/d/graphic/60682.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Up to 40 percent of AAAs are associated with iliac artery aneurysm(s). The presence of iliac artery aneurysm may necessitate placement of a bifurcated graft. The extent of the aneurysm also affects the surgical approach. (See <a class="local">'Incision and aortic exposure'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H365977525"><span class="h1">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H273861029"><span class="h2">Medical risk assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Perioperative morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with advanced age; female sex; and severe cardiac, pulmonary, liver, or kidney disease [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Preoperative consultation with the anesthesia team is appropriate. Medical risk assessment and factors that assist in determining the appropriateness of open surgical repair for a specific patient are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94260.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for open abdominal aortic surgery", section on 'Preanesthetic consultation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15188.html" rel="external">"Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Medical risk assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair are often taking medications for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Patients who are currently taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, beta blockers, and lipid-lowering therapy should continue these medications throughout the perioperative period. Many surgeons prefer to discontinue <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> prior to surgery if not indicated for coronary drug-eluting stent or recent carotid stent. For patients who are not currently taking these medications, whether or not and when to initiate therapy is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery", section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>The management of other medications common in this population is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4814.html" rel="external">"Perioperative medication management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H589887624"><span class="h2">Estimation of perioperative risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of risk calculators have been developed to estimate the risk of perioperative adverse events. The updated guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) endorse the use of a scoring system derived from data collected by the Vascular Study Group of New England, part of the National Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p>Using this dataset, major factors that affect in-hospital mortality after elective AAA repair were identified. The strongest risk factors for mortality in order of significance were: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Placement of a suprarenal clamp</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Open aortic surgery </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Renal dysfunction (particularly serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>AAA diameter &gt;6.5 cm</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Advanced age</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cerebrovascular disease</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Female sex </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heart disease</p><p></p><p>Using a simple point system, the VQI risk calculator recognizes four risk categories: low (&lt;1 percent), moderate (1 to 5 percent), high (8 to 20 percent), and prohibitive risk (&gt;30 percent). As an example, the estimated risk of mortality with open AAA repair for a 55-year-old otherwise healthy woman with a 5.0-cm aneurysm is &lt;1 percent. By comparison, a 75-year-old man with a 6.5-cm juxtarenal AAA and a history of COPD, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease with a serum creatinine level &gt;2.0 has an estimated risk of mortality of more than 40 percent. It is recommended that the estimated risk of mortality be included during informed consent discussions.</p><p>The SVS also recommends that open AAA repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of &lt;5 percent and that perform at least 10 open aortic procedures annually [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Data from the International Consortium of Vascular Registries indicated that centers with an annual volume of at least 13 open aneurysm repairs were associated with lower in-hospital mortality in comparison to lower volume centers [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The European Society for Vascular Surgery has recommended that open AAA repair be restricted to centers with an annual open and endovascular volume in excess of 20 AAA repairs [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Decreasing open AAA volumes may have significant implications for training the next generation of vascular surgeons [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H365977647"><span class="h2">Vascular evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The status of the peripheral circulation should be assessed prior to open repair of AAA. The clinical examination should focus on the identification of coexistent aneurysms (eg, iliac aneurysm, popliteal aneurysm) and/or occlusive disease. The diagnosis and management of peripheral aneurysms and peripheral artery disease are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15703.html" rel="external">"Iliac artery aneurysm"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15187.html" rel="external">"Popliteal artery aneurysm"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8208.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease"</a>.)</p><p>For patients who present with lower extremity symptoms such as claudication, noninvasive vascular studies (ankle-brachial index, segmental pressures) should be performed. The character and location of peripheral pulses should be noted for comparison at the completion of the aneurysm repair. If computed tomography (CT) imaging of the aneurysm has not included lower extremities, duplex arterial imaging can be performed to assess the distal vasculature, rather than repeat CT or arteriography. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8201.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive diagnosis of upper and lower extremity arterial disease"</a>.)</p><p>The risk of perioperative death is increased in patients with peripheral artery disease and should be taken into account when choosing between endovascular aneurysm and open repair [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The preoperative sexual health of the patient should be documented. In the past, postoperative sexual dysfunction was thought to be related to pelvic arterial insufficiency alone, or in combination with intraoperative injury to the autonomic nerves located to the left of the aortic bifurcation. It has been demonstrated that preoperative sexual dysfunction is common in the population of patients with abdominal aneurysm. In the Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management (DREAM) trial [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>], more than 60 percent of patients admitted symptoms of sexual dysfunction preoperatively. Repair of AAA, open or endovascular, was associated with modest deterioration in reported sexual function in the early postoperative period, which casts doubt on the true incidence of sexual dysfunction that results directly from aneurysm repair. Nonetheless, every effort should be made to avoid autonomic nerve injury and preserve arterial blood flow to the internal iliac arteries, whenever possible. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H273863881"><span class="h2">Aortic imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to open AAA repair, CT angiography is the imaging test of choice to evaluate the location (eg, infrarenal, suprarenal) and anatomic features (eg, extent of thrombus, calcification, inflammation) of the aneurysm and to identify other abnormalities (eg, retrocaval left renal vein, accessory renal arteries, horseshoe kidney) that may alter the approach to repair. CT has replaced conventional contrast arteriography in the preoperative assessment of aneurysm, but the latter may be appropriate to answer specific anatomic questions (eg, adequacy of pelvic collateral circulation) or to perform preoperative catheter-based intervention in selected patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15229.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The extent of exposure during open surgery depends upon the extent of the aneurysm and the identification of suitable arterial sites for clamping and for suturing the proximal and distal anastomoses. In general, preoperative imaging should aid in predicting the proximal and distal extent of exposure. Imaging studies should be reviewed and the amount of thrombus and location of calcification carefully assessed to determine the best locations for arterial clamping. In addition, the presence and location of distal occlusive disease should be identified in patients with diminished femoral, popliteal, or foot pulses. </p><p>The vascular supply to the intestines should also be evaluated preoperatively. Occlusive vascular disease is frequently present in the visceral circulation in patients with AAA. As an example, the presence of an enlarged meandering mesenteric artery on preoperative imaging should alert the surgeon to the possibility of significant stenosis or occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery. It is incumbent on the surgeon to assure the adequacy of visceral perfusion prior to completion of the case. In some cases, it may be best to revascularize the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) at the time of open aneurysm repair [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. Alternatively, percutaneous visceral revascularization may be performed preoperatively or in conjunction with open repair [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The status of the SMA also influences the management of the inferior mesenteric artery at the time of surgery. (See <a class="local">'Handling the inferior mesenteric artery'</a> below.)</p><p>Horseshoe kidney is a congenital fusion anomaly wherein the lower pole of the one kidney is fused anteriorly across the aorta to the contralateral kidney; fusion at the lower poles is most common. Horseshoe kidney is associated with urologic anomalies including ureteral duplication, ectopic ureter, retrocaval ureter, and supernumerary renal arteries. The location, size, and importance of various renal vessels needs to be determined to prevent postoperative renal ischemia, segmental infarction, hypertension, and acute renal injury. CT angiogram is usually adequate to visualize renal artery anatomy, but conventional arteriography may occasionally be needed. Small vessels originating from the isthmus may be amenable to sacrifice. A retroperitoneal approach is preferred for open AAA repair associated with horseshoe kidney; however, the presence of large renal arteries originating from the iliac arteries will contraindicate a retroperitoneal approach. General features of renal fusion abnormalities are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6107.html" rel="external">"Renal ectopic and fusion anomalies", section on 'Horseshoe kidney'</a>.)</p><p>Inflammatory aneurysm is identified by the presence of contrast-enhancing thickening of the aneurysm wall and perianeurysmal fibrosis. The ureters may be drawn towards the inflammatory process involving the aorta. Approximately 3 percent of abdominal aortic aneurysms have an inflammatory component [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Inflammatory aneurysms are more often symptomatic, and perioperative mortality rates appear to be higher following open repair compared with noninflammatory aneurysms. As with any AAA, a choice between open versus an endovascular approach to inflammatory AAA should be based upon patient characteristics and anatomic suitability [<a href="#rid22">22-26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15229.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Infected versus inflammatory AAA'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H273861446"><span class="h3">Suitability for endovascular repair</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to embarking on open repair of AAA, it is important to determine if the patient would be better served by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Perioperative morbidity and mortality is lower for elective endovascular compared with open surgical repair of AAA, but long-term outcomes have not shown to be different [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. Although advances in endovascular aneurysm repair have extended its use to a large proportion of the elective AAA repair population, open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is still needed for patients with anatomy outside device protocols [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. For patients with juxtarenal aneurysm, the choice between complex endovascular treatment using fenestrated or branched grafts versus open repair requiring suprarenal clamping can be particularly challenging. Data suggest that open surgical repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms in older adults is associated with similar 30-day mortality compared with fenestrated endovascular grafting [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Criteria for endovascular repair and a decision for open versus endovascular AAA repair are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15203.html" rel="external">"Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Anatomic suitability'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15188.html" rel="external">"Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Choice of AAA repair approach'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H273861335"><span class="h1">PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to surgery, preoperative baseline laboratories including complete blood count, chemistry panel, and coagulation studies should be obtained. These tests will serve as baseline values for comparison with intraoperative and postoperative studies. The blood bank should determine the patient's blood type and perform a screen for common antibodies. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1081435143"><span class="h2">Blood for transfusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a review of nearly 4000 open aneurysm operations in the Vascular Quality Initiative database, transfusions were required in 37.5 percent of these cases [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. To minimize the need for cross-matched blood, we recommend the use of blood salvage systems (eg, CellSaver) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7937.html" rel="external">"Surgical blood conservation: Intraoperative blood salvage"</a>.) </p><p>We suggest that no more than 2 units of typed and cross-matched packed red blood cells should be made available at the beginning of elective open AAA repair. Cross-matched blood can usually be supplied within a reasonable timeframe if additional blood is needed. Preparing fully cross-matched blood that is not transfused is inefficient since the blood is not available for others, expensive, and may strain the manpower in the blood bank; however, the lag time needed to prepare cross-matched blood depends upon the delivery capacity of the local blood bank and transfusion services. The presence of unusual antibodies will, by necessity, require preoperative consultation with the appropriate institution-specific hematology resources.</p><p>For patients with religious beliefs that impact their willingness to accept banked blood, it is important that the surgeon and patient (and patient proxy) have the acceptable conditions governing blood-product transfusion precisely described and recorded in the chart.

There are four common etiologies of suture line hemorrhage, and each requires a unique treatment. These are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loose suture line – Due to the thickness of the aortic tissue and the use of self-retaining retractors, it is not uncommon for a suture line to be loose. The most common remedy is to use a nerve hook to take up the slack and then tie the loop to an anchoring suture. This can be facilitated by placing a silk suture through the loop of excess suture to serve as a handle while tying. Be sure to check the nerve hook for any sharp burs or edges on a spare suture because it can cut the suture. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pleat formation – A pleat occurs when the space between adjacent sutures is excessive. A simple stitch placed at the apex of the pleat will usually stop the bleeding. A pledget is not usually required or beneficial, because it may serve to obscure the source of bleeding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Needle hole bleeding from the aorta – If the curve of the needle is not respected while placing a suture, it may cause a longitudinal tear in the aortic wall. This can be repaired by placing a simple transverse-oriented figure-of-eight suture (5-0 polypropylene) in the adventitia adjacent to the needle hole. Avoid the desire to place additional longitudinal sutures across the anastomosis, as this may exacerbate the bleeding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Retraction of the adventitia – One of the most serious causes of suture line bleeding is caused by not taking full-thickness bites in the aortic wall. This is particularly common on the posterior aspect of the aortic wall. Failure to pass the needle through the full thickness of the aortic wall will result in an anastomosis that is structurally not sound because the suture is only held in place by aortic plaque. If this problem is identified, the suture line usually needs to taken down and redone, making certain to obtain full-thickness bites. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1081443051"><span class="h1">ABDOMINAL CLOSURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to abdominal closure, distal perfusion should be assessed by palpating the femoral vessels and pedal vessels or by using a handheld Doppler. The quality of the pulses or Doppler signals should be compared with the preoperative examination. If the distal pulses are diminished by comparison, embolization to the infrainguinal vessels may have occurred and femoral exploration may be indicated. (See <a class="local">'Need for thromboembolectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Once adequate flow through the graft and distally has been confirmed, the aneurysm sac should be reapproximated using absorbable sutures to cover the graft and prevent abrasion of the overlying bowel that could lead to aortoenteric fistula formation. (See <a class="local">'Graft infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Following open AAA repair, the midline abdominal incision is typically closed primarily. However, incorporating mesh may help reduce the incidence of incisional hernia [<a href="#rid71">71-74</a>]. While we do not routinely incorporate mesh into abdominal wall closure following open AAA repair, based upon randomized trials, mesh can be considered in patients with additional risk factors for incisional hernia such as obesity or connective tissue disorders. In one early trial of abdominal wall closure after AAA repair, postoperative incisional hernia developed in 16/45 patients in the control group compared with 5/40 in the mesh group (hazard ratio 4.10, 95% CI 1.72-9.82) [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. Hernias developed between 170 and 585 days after surgery in the control group, and between 336 and 1122 days in the mesh group. A later review identified four trials with a total of 388 patients [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. Mesh reinforcement significantly reduced the risk of incisional hernia after AAA repair compared with standard sutured closure (pooled risk ratio [RR] 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.66). However, the pooled rate of reoperation was no different between groups. Mesh reinforcement also did not cause more intraoperative or postoperative complications compared with sutured closure.

In one trial, patients with a confirmed patent IMA were randomly assigned to replantation or ligation [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. There was no significant difference in the incidence of ischemic colitis between the groups (replanted: 6 patients, ligated: 10 patients). However, in patients with prior colon resection or reduced inflow to one or both internal iliac arteries, reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery is appropriate. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H273864246"><span class="h2">Need for thromboembolectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All aortic aneurysms have some degree of mural thrombus and cholesterol plaque, which have the potential to dislodge and embolize during the course of aortic dissection and clamping. However, thromboembolism is uncommon with elective AAA repair. Nevertheless, diminished backbleeding from the iliac vessels (or femoral arteries) should prompt Fogarty catheter embolectomy. </p><p>Once the graft has been placed and the vascular clamps have been removed, the femoral pulses should be palpable. If the femoral pulses cannot be palpated, the cause must be determined. It is important to ensure that any self-retaining retractors have been release or removed, as these can compress the external iliac arteries and give the errant impression of arterial obstruction. After reapplying a clamp on the proximal graft, opening the distal anastomosis is usually the most appropriate initial step, allowing inspection to of the anastomosis for technical defects and passage of a Fogarty balloon catheter distally into the lower extremity vessels. </p><p>Sometimes occlusive disease or excessive tortuosity of the iliac arteries prevents effective passage of the Fogarty catheter. In this case, the common femoral artery should be exposed and a femoral embolectomy performed. If unimpeded inflow can be established, the femoral arteriotomy can be closed primarily; however, if inflow cannot be established, then the aortic graft can be extended to the femoral level.

Arterial inflow should be preserved to at least one of these vessels. It is always prudent to assess the viability of the colon at the completion of all aortic procedures. Reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery may reduce the risk of colon ischemia in selected cases. (See <a class="local">'Handling the inferior mesenteric artery'</a> above.)</p><p>In the absence of prior colon surgery, it is usually safe to ligate the inferior mesenteric artery provided at least one of the internal iliac arteries remains patent. In rare cases, it may be necessary to ligate one or both internal iliac arteries. This occurs most commonly due to extensive aneurysmal involvement of the internal iliac artery deep into the pelvis that precludes arterial reconstruction. In this setting, the inferior mesenteric artery should usually be replanted to reduce the risk of colonic and/or pelvic ischemia.

Issues related to the proximal aortic anastomosis are uncommon; however, late pseudoaneurysm can occur, and dilation of the proximal aorta has been reported, particularly if the graft was placed too inferiorly [<a href="#rid82">82,83</a>]. Thus, we routinely obtain computed tomography five years following the open repair to assess the aorta for the late aortic dilation or pseudoaneurysm.

A review of the Vascular Quality Initiative database from 2003 to 2019 reported that 97.1 percent of patients undergoing open AAA repair were alive at hospital discharge [<a href="#rid90">90</a>]. The cause of perioperative death for most patients is multisystem organ failure. </p><p>The presence of peripheral artery disease increases the risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. After risk adjustment, when compared with males without PAD, males with PAD undergoing AAA repair had almost three times the odds of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.77, 95% CI 1.42-5.40) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Similarly, compared with females without PAD, females with PAD undergoing AAA repair had nearly four times the odds of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 3.86, 95% CI 1.55-9.64). </p><p>For patients who survive open AAA repair, the main cause of death in the long-term is cardiovascular disease. In a study that evaluated 297 patients following open infrarenal/juxtarenal AAA repair, cardiovascular events occurred at a rate of 0.16 cardiovascular events/patient-year [<a href="#rid91">91</a>]. Freedom from cardiovascular events at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years was 94, 67, 46, and 28 percent, respectively. Survival was 97, 75, 51, and 32 percent, respectively. The main cause of death was cardiovascular disease (18.2 percent), followed by cancer (14.5 percent). Only four (1.3 percent) deaths were graft related. </p><p>In patients with complex aneurysms, defined as short neck, juxtarenal, pararenal, and suprarenal AAAs, open AAA repair compared with endovascular repair was associated with improved long-term survival without any increase in perioperative death [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. </p><p>Complications following open AAA repair are similar to those of other major surgical procedures and are most often related to preexisting medical conditions. Complications include heart failure, myocardial ischemia, acute kidney injury, pulmonary insufficiency, and pneumonia. Management of these complications can be found in separate topic reviews. A thorough preoperative evaluation and proper patient selection help to reduce the incidence of these complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15188.html" rel="external">"Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Medical risk assessment'</a>.) </p><p>Perioperative complications related to the aortic procedure include lower extremity ischemia, bowel ischemia, pelvic ischemia, and renal dysfunction, and late complications include incisional hernia, anastomotic aneurysm, and graft infection/aortoenteric fistula. Late complications of open surgical aneurysm repair were identified in 9.5 percent of patients in one retrospective review [<a href="#rid92">92</a>]. The mean time between aortic repairs was 11 years. When compared with 993 other patients for whom endovascular repair was the primary aortic repair, late complications following primary open AAA repair occurred in patients who were significantly younger at the time of their first repair (61 versus 74 years), and more patients had a family history of aneurysm (20 versus 7 percent). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H365977664"><span class="h2">Lower extremity ischemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lower extremity ischemia may occur as a result of arterial occlusion due to clamp injury, arterial wall dissection, or thrombosis or thromboembolism distally.

In a retrospective review of 2347 patients, renal failure occurred in 140 patients (6 percent) [<a href="#rid95">95</a>]. Risk factors for postoperative renal failure included age &gt;75, symptomatic AAA, supra/juxtarenal AAA, elevated preoperative serum creatinine, treated hypertension, and respiratory disease.

Patients suspected of postoperative colon ischemia should undergo immediate sigmoidoscopy to assess the viability of the colonic mucosa. Patients with full-thickness ischemia are treated with colon resection. For partial-thickness ischemia, most surgeons recommend bowel rest, antibiotics to cover typical colon flora, and repeat sigmoidoscopy in one to two days to assess resolution or identify progression. It may occasionally be appropriate to consider late reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) for partial-thickness bowel ischemia that does not mandate resection.

Although we generally reverse heparin with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9831" href="/d/drug information/9831.html" rel="external">protamine sulfate</a> after completion of the aneurysm repair and assessment of the extremity circulation, heparin reversal with protamine has never been shown to be of benefit, and there are potential serious side effects. (See <a class="local">'Anticoagulation and reversal'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Preventing thromboembolism</strong> – All aortic aneurysms have some degree of mural thrombus and cholesterol plaque, which have the potential to dislodge and embolize during the course of aortic dissection and clamping. However, thromboembolism is uncommon with elective AAA repair. Prior to closure, distal perfusion should be assessed by palpating the femoral vessel and pedal vessels or by using a handheld Doppler. The quality of the pulses or Doppler signals should be compared with the preoperative examination. If the pulses are diminished, embolectomy should be performed. (See <a class="local">'Need for thromboembolectomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Preserving pelvic inflow</strong> – Colonic ischemia is uncommon following elective AAA repair. Pelvic arterial inflow should be preserved to at least one vessel (inferior mesenteric artery, right internal iliac artery, left internal iliac artery). Reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery may reduce the risk of colon ischemia in selected patients, particularly those with prior colon resection or reduced inflow to one or both internal iliac arteries. (See <a class="local">'Handling the inferior mesenteric artery'</a> above and <a class="local">'Handling the internal iliac arteries'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Morbidity and mortality</strong> – Perioperative (30-day) mortality for elective open AAA repair in contemporary series is between 1 and 5 percent. Perioperative morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with advanced age; female sex; or cardiac, pulmonary, or kidney disease. The cause of death for most patients is multisystem organ failure. For patients who survive open AAA repair, the main cause of death in the long term is cardiovascular disease. Perioperative complications related to the aortic procedure include lower extremity ischemia, bowel ischemia, pelvic ischemia, and renal dysfunction, and late complications include incisional hernia, anastomotic aneurysm, and graft infection/aortoenteric fistula.
