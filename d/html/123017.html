Additional common problems include mucocutaneous telangiectasia, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and iron deficiency anemia. Despite these disease manifestations, some patients may present with pulmonary AVMs only and have a paucity or absence of clinical signs and symptoms [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'PAVM screening'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic review discusses an approach to screening of individuals with HHT for disease complications for which they are asymptomatic, as well as genetic testing and counseling of at-risk family members.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Any <strong>symptoms</strong> related to HHT should be investigated, as discussed separately.

Vascular abnormalities seen at a higher prevalence than in the general population include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Arteriovenous malformation</strong> – An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal vascular structure that provides a direct communication between one or more arteries and one or more veins. These may be sacs (eg, for pulmonary AVMs [PAVMs]), small collections of intervening vessels (nidal AVMs), or direct high-flow connections between the arterial and venous side (arteriovenous fistulas [AVFs]). AVMs result in arteriovenous shunting. Shunting may also be observed secondary to dilatation of existing normal capillaries (eg, intrapulmonary shunting in the hepatopulmonary syndrome and as part of normal physiologic responses).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Telangiectasia</strong> – A telangiectasia is a small, dilated blood vessel (arteriole, venule, or capillary). The term is descriptive and refers to telangiectasia of many anatomic types and etiologies. HHT telangiectasia usually contain small arteriovenous communications and are commonly located near the surface of the skin or mucous membranes.</p><p></p><p>These lesions can also be seen in other disorders besides HHT, or in otherwise healthy individuals, as part of a syndrome or in isolation. As discussed in detail below, additional vascular lesions are increasingly recognized, some seen more commonly in patients with HHT and others, such as aneurysms, present at similar or only marginally increased rates to the general population.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3786369250"><span class="h2">General principles of management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Major management issues in individuals with HHT span the full range of clinical manifestations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74593" href="/d/graphic/74593.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and include the following [<a href="#rid2">2-13</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient education</strong> – Educational materials for patients with HHT and the location of specialized centers for diagnostic testing and management are available from the websites of <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcurehht.org%2F&amp;token=rWiM7INmmrcnF9xm6qIA0djDtHz5Nlaemfv%2BeriRPDc%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=123017" target="_blank">Cure HHT</a>, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvascern.eu%2Fexpertise%2Frare-diseases-wgs%2Fhht-wg%2F&amp;token=VVq4MOGhA8xc7GYzTpiZNi47aji3yU7jI3qhjgaDI%2B65yNitCixg6te3pHzT465ASOUbGTgUTkHvs358fl34aQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=123017" target="_blank">VASCERN</a> (the European Reference Network on Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases) and country-specific patient groups.

Although randomized controlled trials are increasingly conducted, they have not delivered statistical support for several proposed treatments; results are awaited from larger studies and studies of longer duration that are underway. In the meantime, uniformity of expert opinion varies depending on the clinical situation and prevailing health care practices.</p><p>Updated guidance from the second International Consensus Guidelines on management of HHT was published in 2020 [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. This followed the first International Consensus Guidelines, which were developed in 2006, and published in print in 2011 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>The 2020 Guidelines focused on six topics and provided greater nuance than the first Guidelines in separating the severity of indications for elements of care and presenting guidance in a step-wise fashion, according to the severity of the disease [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The six topics addressed were:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Epistaxis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gastrointestinal bleeding</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anemia and anticoagulation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hepatic vascular malformations</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pediatrics</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnancy</p><p></p><p>Several other recommendations from the first International Guideline were not reassessed and remain in place [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Details from these Guidelines, including new recommendations and affirmation of existing recommendations, are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Overview of screening strategy'</a> below.) </p><p>As noted above, consensus statements on good practice in HHT have also been developed by the European Reference Network (ERN) on Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvascern.eu%2F&amp;token=ct6D3Xy7Zolq4eEnnIfmLcL1sc1tfPgYoiJAYfXUyqI%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=123017" target="_blank">VASCERN</a>). This group has identified core Outcome Measures suitable to be implemented by all clinicians evaluating a patient with HHT: pulmonary AVM (PAVM) screening, antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental and surgical procedures for those with PAVMs, epistaxis advice, assessment of iron deficiency, and advice on pregnancy [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Subsequent manuscripts include evidence from HHT patients across the ERN [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>], address nuances of cerebral screening [<a href="#rid19">19</a>], and are summarized in a single Frameworks manuscript targeting general and speciality care [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1869879130"><span class="h2">Overview of screening strategy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Screening to diagnose AVMs in individuals at risk for HHT, or those with HHT but without symptoms relevant to the AVMs, is distinct from investigation of a symptomatic patient.</p><p>Some countries have historically placed particular emphasis that screening within clinical practice should be clearly linked to a proven patient-recognizable benefit [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. In some cases, such as identification of PAVMs, results of screening may lead to risk-reducing interventions. In other cases where risk cannot be altered, the stated or implied purpose of screening can be that it allows information considered valuable about the risk to be provided to the patient and/or family [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p>It is good practice, prior to screening patients, to counsel them on how the screening could impact their health and management. The challenge for all screening programs is to establish whether, across the selected population, the expected benefits are likely to outweigh the harms and burdens of screening. </p><p>Clinicians should be cognizant of the significant radiation exposure that can occur during a lifetime of imaging studies [<a href="#rid23">23</a>] and should minimize these risks by restricting imaging studies to individuals for which the results will affect evidence-based management [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14613.html" rel="external">"Radiation-related risks of imaging"</a>.)</p><p>New recommendations for screening in the 2020 International Consensus Guidelines included a clearer recommendation for hepatic AVM screening for all adults and discussion of preconception and prenatal diagnostic options, including preimplantation genetic testing [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Additional screening recommendations for children and during pregnancy were similar to the first International Consensus Guidelines, published in 2011, including cerebral and pulmonary screening and genetic testing [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. There was no discussion of these topics for other adults, although cerebral AVMs have been addressed in a 2020 Position Statement from VASCERN on cerebral vascular malformations [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. The British Thoracic Society provided a 2017 Position Statement on pulmonary AVMs [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. </p><p>Recommendations for evaluation of iron deficiency, anemia, and symptomatic lesions, as well as recommendations for therapy, are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109902.html" rel="external">"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): Evaluation and therapy for specific vascular lesions"</a>.)</p><p>In general, protocols for screening asymptomatic individuals depend upon the importance attached to the detection of asymptomatic lesions in particular viscera, the diagnostic and therapeutic expertise available locally, and the degree to which establishment of the extent of HHT is important in the particular health care system. Assuming the individual is in agreement, screening of adults with HHT typically consists of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical evaluation</strong> – History and physical examination may identify clinically significant features that would modify subsequent management [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109902.html" rel="external">"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): Evaluation and therapy for specific vascular lesions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anemia and iron deficiency</strong> – All individuals are evaluated for anemia and iron deficiency, with treatment if identified. This is an Outcome Measure to define good clinical HHT practice from VASCERN [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. It was also recommended in the second International HHT Guidelines in 2020 [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Iron status'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs)</strong> – PAVMs are always considered worthy of treatment, and screening should be offered for all adult patients over 16 years with known or suspected HHT [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. All individuals with PAVMs should receive advice on antibiotic prophylaxis and many proceed to interventions to occlude the AVMs, which have been shown to reduce PAVM complications [<a href="#rid25">25-27</a>]. This is an Outcome Measure to define good clinical HHT practice from VASCERN [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. It was also addressed in a British Thoracic Society Clinical Statement in 2017 and recommended in the 2006 International HHT Guideline, published in 2011 [<a href="#rid3">3,24</a>]. (See <a class="local">'PAVM screening'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cerebral AVMs</strong> – There is widespread agreement that any HHT patient with neurologic symptoms potentially attributable to a cerebral AVM should be investigated (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109902.html" rel="external">"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): Evaluation and therapy for specific vascular lesions", section on 'Cerebral lesions'</a>). However there has been significant controversy and ongoing debate regarding the optimal management of asymptomatic cerebral vascular malformations and the role of cerebral screening in asymptomatic individuals with HHT. The first International Guidelines recommended brain AVM screening in adults, with lower agreement than most of the other recommendations; this recommendation was not reassessed and remains in place [<a href="#rid3">3,13</a>]. Important considerations were addressed in a 2020 Neurovascular-led Position Statement from VASCERN and are discussed in more detail below [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hepatic AVMs</strong> – There is consensus that any HHT patient with symptoms potentially attributable to hepatic AVMs should be investigated, and in the 2020 International Guidelines, this was extended to all adults [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Asymptomatic, incidentally discovered hepatic AVMs are not treated, but the value of early detection to guide management in symptomatic patients has been increasingly recognized. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109902.html" rel="external">"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): Evaluation and therapy for specific vascular lesions", section on 'Hepatic AVMs'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spinal AVMs</strong> – Screening has performed in pregnancy in countries where epidurals may be withheld due to a perceived risk of spinal AVMs and often for patients undergoing surgery when epidural analgesia may be required [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. The 2020 International HHT Guidelines recommended against withholding an epidural because of a diagnosis of HHT, and stated that screening for spinal vascular malformations is not required [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]<em>.</em></p><p></p><p>Additional investigations are performed based upon patient symptoms, results of the initial assessment, and sometimes specific family issues [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Screening in children is discussed below.

A discussion of <em>SMAD4</em>-specific issues related to polyposis and aortopathy screening is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15805.html" rel="external">"Juvenile polyposis syndrome", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>Other management does not differ from that for individuals with <em>ENG </em>or <em>ACVRL1</em> HHT.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4028878716"><span class="h2">Other elements of genomic variability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A 2022 study highlighted that the severity of hemorrhage is higher in HHT patients with rare, high-impact deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variants in genes associated with bleeding diatheses [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. HHT patients with concurrent changes in T-helper lymphocytes may be more at risk of infectious complications [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. These associations may lead to additional investigation of patients with more severe phenotypes, but there has been no recommendation to screen all individuals with HHT for such changes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H964702975"><span class="h1">IRON STATUS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assessment of iron stores and optimization of iron status is crucial in HHT. As noted separately, the major cause of iron deficiency is bleeding, including bleeding from epistaxis and gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), with insufficient iron supplementation for the degree of bleeding. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1345.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)", section on 'Iron deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>A survey of 50 individuals with HHT emphasized that epistaxis is usually sufficiently severe to account for the iron deficiency [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The approximate blood loss from epistaxis was in the order of 277 mL per month resulting in hemorrhage-adjusted iron requirements (HAIR) that could <strong>not</strong> be met from dietary sources alone in 80 percent of the study participants. Forty-three patients (86 percent) met their recommended dietary allowance of iron, but only 10 (20 percent) met their HAIR.</p><p>Regular complete blood counts (CBCs) are recommended [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Review of other red blood cell (RBC) indices such as the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are also important [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. This is particularly true for patients who have hypoxemia due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), when a "normal" hemoglobin may be inappropriately low for the expected degree of polycythemia [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. Regular assessment of iron status is recommended regardless of the hemoglobin level, to detect iron deficiency that is likely to progress to anemia if not treated [<a href="#rid13">13,16</a>]. We routinely measure serum iron and transferrin saturation index in addition to ferritin. While a low ferritin confirms the presence of iron deficiency, a normal or high ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency since it is an acute phase protein and can be elevated despite iron deficiency being present [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

However, many HHT-related cerebral vascular malformations rarely bleed, including several types that may be identified by cerebral imaging [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The absolute risk of bleeding for any particular lesion has been evaluated across the European Centres of excellence in VASCERN and may be estimated from the literature [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. Precise angioarchitecture and location of the lesion are also relevant [<a href="#rid57">57,58</a>].

Asymptomatic AVMs are less likely to be treated according to the results of a consensus from European interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons in three specialist societies spanning the three forms of treatment: the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS), the European Society of Interventional Therapy (ESMINT), and the European Society for Radiosurgery (EGKS) [<a href="#rid19">19,59</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The expert authors specifically integrated review of the ARUBA trial (<strong>A</strong> <strong>R</strong>andomized trial of <strong>U</strong>nruptured <strong>B</strong>rain <strong>A</strong>VM), which found that in unruptured cerebral AVMs, conservative management was less harmful than interventional treatments [<a href="#rid60">60</a>].

Clinicians should be aware of typical arteriovenous malformation (AVM) symptoms. Many recommendations are based on expert opinion and observational studies; the uniformity of expert opinion varies depending on the clinical situation and prevailing practices. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109902.html" rel="external">"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): Evaluation and therapy for specific vascular lesions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Asymptomatic individuals; general principles</strong> – Education and screening are important. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Educational materials and specialized testing and management centers are available from the European Reference Network on Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases and country-specific patient groups. (See <a class="local">'General principles of management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Screening</strong> – AVM screening in individuals at risk of HHT or asymptomatic individuals with HHT is recommended universally for PAVMs. For other AVMs, screening is more controversial than evaluating symptomatic lesions. It is good practice to counsel patients on risks and benefits prior to screening. Assuming the individual agrees, screening generally consists of an examination, evaluation for anemia and iron deficiency, pulmonary AVM (PAVM) screening, and discussions of screening for AVMs at other sites (hepatic, cerebral). Individuals with <em>SMAD4</em>-related HHT require more extensive surveillance due to the risk of juvenile polyposis and aortopathy. (See <a class="local">'Overview of screening strategy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cerebral AVM screening'</a> above and <a class="local">'Individuals with SMAD4 HHT'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Iron deficiency</strong> – We obtain regular complete blood counts (CBC) and examine serial trends and red cell indices, particularly for patients who have hypoxemia due to PAVMs, for whom a "normal" hemoglobin may be inappropriately low for the expected degree of polycythemia. We regularly assess iron status regardless of the hemoglobin level, since iron deficiency is likely to progress to anemia if not treated. (See <a class="local">'Iron status'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>PAVMs</strong> – Adults with HHT should be screened for PAVMs. Unsuspected PAVMs are common, and treatment reduces risks of stroke and brain abscess in adults. Females with HHT should undergo screening before becoming pregnant, since PAVMs can bleed in later pregnancy leading to life-threatening hemoptysis or hemothorax. Screening may consist of contrast (bubble) echocardiography in institutions with very strong local expertise, or with chest computed tomography (CT). Negative contrast echocardiography in experienced hands or negative CT can rule out PAVMs; a negative chest radiograph cannot. The timing and repeat screening in individuals with a negative initial screen depends on patient age and other findings. (See <a class="local">'PAVM screening'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cerebral AVMs</strong> – Screening for cerebral arteriovenous (AV) shunts can be undertaken, noting the importance of shared decision-making and other considerations discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Cerebral AVM screening'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Children</strong> – Screening asymptomatic children within HHT families differs between institutions due to variable risk-benefit assessment. Evidence of benefit is generally lacking, and certain risks are recognized (radiation exposure from some imaging studies). All specialists agree on the importance of informed consent that weighs risks and benefits for each individual. Other considerations include uncertainty about the risk of complications from silent AVMs in children, concerns about the ethics of screening children, and lack of information about how treatment affects the natural history of disease in children. (See <a class="local">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>VTE risk</strong> – Individuals with HHT have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and should follow general population guidance for VTE treatment and prophylaxis. (See <a class="local">'Individuals who require anticoagulation (VTE and AF)'</a> above and <a class="local">'Air travel'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reproductive counseling and testing</strong> – Individuals with HHT should be aware of the autosomal dominant transmission and possibility of having an affected child. Genetic testing of family members can be complicated. The possibility of disease can be excluded in relatives only if a familial pathogenic variant has been identified.
