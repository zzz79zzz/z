Among all travel-related diagnoses, malaria accounted for 3.5 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of etiology of fever in returning travelers and migrants, malaria accounted for 22 percent, dengue 5 percent, and enteric fever 2 percent of fever diagnoses [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In another study including more than 82,000 ill travelers, acute and potentially life-threatening tropical diseases occurred in 4.4 percent of patients [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Malaria and enteric fever accounted for 77 and 18 percent, respectively; other life-threatening diagnoses included leptospirosis, severe dengue, rickettsial infection, relapsing fever, melioidosis, and African trypanosomiasis. There were 13 deaths; of these, 10 (77 percent) were caused by falciparum malaria.</p><p>Within the United States, geographically localized infections that can be acquired during travel include plague, babesiosis, Lyme disease, coccidioidomycosis, ehrlichiosis, relapsing fever, Colorado tick fever, rickettsial infections, tularemia, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. </p><p>Within Europe, geographically localized infections include visceral leishmaniasis, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, rickettsial infections, Q fever, sand fly fever, tickborne encephalitis, and other arboviruses. </p><p>Local and regional outbreaks of infection, such as chikungunya virus infection or Zika virus infection, may modify the expected epidemiology [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].</p><p>In addition to travel-related infections, cosmopolitan causes of fever should be considered in ill travelers; patients may have been incubating an infection prior to departure or have become ill after their return  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75701" href="/d/graphic/75701.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

In some circumstances, infection control precautions may be warranted based on clinical and exposure history before diagnostic results are available  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50001" href="/d/graphic/50001.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Relevant activities and exposures (such as consumption of unclean water or risky foods, insect bites, animal exposure, sexual contact) – (See <a class="local">'Consider the exposure history'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General medical information (including vaccination history, past medical history, and medications) – If malaria chemoprophylaxis was taken, the clinician should inquire as to the drug, the dose, the intervals between doses, and the duration of therapy prior to arrival and following departure from the transmission area.

Because parasites may be sequestered in the deep vasculature in patients with falciparum malaria, few parasites may be visible on a peripheral smear even in severe infection. Therefore, if the initial smear is negative, additional smears should be evaluated over the subsequent 24 to 72 hours. Rapid diagnostic tests should be used if available.

Fevers in malaria wax and wane; ≥40 percent of patients may not have fever at the time of the initial evaluation, and physical examination can be normal [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>].</p><p>Malaria is transmitted by <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes. The incubation period of malaria due to <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> is usually 7 to 30 days (but may be longer). The shortest incubation period of non-falciparum malaria is 9 to 14 days but can be delayed by weeks or months. The diagnosis of malaria is established by visualization of parasites on peripheral smear or rapid antigen tests.

Infection also occurs in non-travelers. The incubation period is 2 to 10 days (usually 5 to 6 days). Special media is needed to culture the organism; the diagnosis can also be established by specific rapid tests, urine antigen, and serologic testing.

The illness occurs worldwide and is most commonly transmitted by contact with infected animals, materials contaminated with animal manure, contaminated aerosols, or ingestion of unpasteurized milk. The incubation period for acute infection is usually 2 to 3 weeks (range few to 30 days). The diagnosis is established via serologic testing. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Histoplasmosis</strong> – Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis is characterized by fever, headache, nonproductive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and fatigue. The infection is transmitted via inhalation of spores from soil contaminated with bird droppings or bat guano.
