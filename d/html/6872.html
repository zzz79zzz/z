         Acute otitis media (AOM) is primarily an infection of childhood and is the most common pediatric infection for which antibiotics are prescribed in the United States [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The vast majority of the medical literature focuses on the diagnosis, management, and complications of pediatric AOM, and much of our information of AOM in adults is extrapolated from studies in children.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will address the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of AOM in adults. Issues related to AOM and other common middle ear pathology in children are discussed separately. (See

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         Acute otitis media (AOM) is an acute, suppurative infectious process marked by the presence of infected middle ear fluid and inflammation of the mucosa lining the middle ear space  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63268" href="/z/d/graphic/63268.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). The infection is most frequently precipitated by impaired function of the Eustachian tube, resulting in the retention and suppuration of retained secretions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63141" href="/z/d/graphic/63141.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). AOM may also be associated with purulent otorrhea if there is a ruptured tympanic membrane. AOM usually responds promptly to antimicrobial therapy.

         Acute otitis media (AOM) occurs much more commonly in children than in adults. The overall incidence of AOM has decreased over the last several decades.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most cases of AOM occur in young children ages 6 to 24 months, with the incidence of AOM declining significantly after age 5 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3
         </a>
         ]. A 2005 global disease burden modeling-based study estimated the annual incidence of AOM as follows: children under age 5 years, 45 to 60 percent; children aged 5 to 14 years, 19 to 22 percent; children and adults aged 15 to 24 years, 3.1 to 3.5 percent; and adults aged 25 to 85 years, 1.5 to 2.3 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of AOM among adults in resource-rich countries is likely less than 1 percent based upon data from this study. In a 2014 to 2018 study of adult outpatient visits to United States veterans administration medical centers, the incidence of AOM and otitis media with effusion (OME) was 2.7 and 1.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In a 2015 to 2018 Netherlands study including patients age ≥15, there was an overall incidence of AOM of 5.3 per 1000 person-years; the incidence declined with age (age 15 to 39, 7.1 per 1000 person-years; age ≥64 years, 2.7 per 1000 person-years) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The incidence of AOM in children in the United States has fallen over the past two decades. In the United States, both outpatient visits and antibiotic prescriptions for AOM in children under age 5 declined by one-third between 1995 and 2006 [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In addition, there was a downward trend in visits for AOM in children under age 7 from 2001 to 2011, and an especially rapid decline in visits for children under age 2 during 2010 to 2011 [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The introduction of routine pneumococcal vaccination in infants may be a contributor to this decline in incidence. The 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in the United States in 2000 and replaced by the 13-valent pneumococcal (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9906" href="/z/d/drug information/9906.html" rel="external">
          PCV13
         </a>
         ) vaccine in 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
         The declining incidence in AOM has also been seen other countries, potentially due to the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine. As an example, in Sweden, following the introduction of general pneumococcal vaccination for infants in 2009, the incidence of AOM declined by 42 percent in children under age 5 and by 21 percent in children ages 5 to 17 [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. (See

         The majority of data on the microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) has been documented by cultures of middle ear fluid obtained by needle aspiration (myringotomy) in children, but the microbiology of AOM in adults is similar to that seen in the pediatric population.

         <em>
          M. catarrhalis

         was responsible for 3 to 14 percent [

          Staphylococcus aureus
         </em>
         are less frequent causes of AOM in general pediatric populations, although S.
         <em>
          aureus
         </em>
         may be a significant pathogen in adults based upon limited studies. Additionally, Group A streptococcus may be an important pathogen in patients with severe AOM requiring hospitalization [

         Eustachian tube dysfunction is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of middle ear infections in both childhood and adulthood  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Eustachian tube dysfunction induces a relative negative pressure in the middle ear space, with the lack of aeration and accumulation of fluid providing an environment conducive to the development of AOM or otitis media with effusion. Anatomic changes in adolescence, with descent of the soft palate muscle sling relative to the Eustachian tube orifice, improves Eustachian tube patency. This anatomic change contributes to the decline in incidence of AOM with age. However, poor tubal function can persist into adulthood, and AOM can still occur at any age due to Eustachian tube dysfunction. (See

         Anything causing external compression of the Eustachian tube, or obstruction of the Eustachian tube or of its outlet, can also predispose to AOM, particularly unilateral AOM. Examples include malignancy (ie, lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma) and post-radiation fibrosis. (See

         The respiratory mucosal membrane that lines the Eustachian tube, middle ear space, and mastoid air cells presents an immunologic defensive barrier, and any abnormality of this barrier may increase the risk of infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         In response to any infection, there is an increase in production of mucus (which contains the potent antibacterial enzyme lysozyme) by the respiratory epithelium [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, respiratory epithelium contains motile cilia, which promote the mobilization of secretions. Ineffective mucociliary clearance due to ciliary dyskinesia may impair the normal function of this important host immunologic defense [

         In adults, an upper respiratory tract infection or exacerbation of seasonal allergic rhinitis often precedes the onset of AOM. In adults, AOM is typically unilateral and is associated with otalgia (ear pain) and decreased or muffled hearing. The pain may be mild, moderate, or severe. If the tympanic membrane has ruptured, the patient may report a sudden relief of pain, possibly accompanied by purulent otorrhea.

         Dysequilibrium may be present but is described infrequently. Conductive hearing loss, which may occur due to the presence of middle ear fluid, is usually transient.

         Examination with a handheld otoscope is essential for an accurate diagnosis of AOM. The addition of pneumatoscopy allows evaluation of tympanic membrane motion and is therefore also recommended for diagnosis. Otomicroscopy, generally available only in otorhinology specialty practices, permits even greater visualization of the tympanic membrane.

         Examination typically demonstrates tympanic membrane bulging, opacification, erythema  (

          picture 3

         ). If there is an associated tympanic membrane rupture, there may be a visible perforation and possibly purulent material in the ear canal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients with suspected AOM may have a significant amount of cerumen partially or completely obstructing the ear canal, preventing adequate evaluation of the tympanic membrane. For these patients, we advise cautious removal of the obstructing material with either gentle curettage or aspiration under direct visualization. When AOM is a concern, removal of cerumen via irrigation should always be avoided because of risk of tympanic membrane rupture. If the obstructing cerumen cannot safely be relieved via curettage or aspiration, referral to otorhinology is appropriate.
        </p>

         The predictive value and accuracy of abnormal otoscope findings has been studied in children but has not been reported for adults with AOM [

OME can result from recent viral infection, barotrauma, or allergy and may precede or follow an episode of AOM. Eustachian tube dysfunction is often a predisposing factor. Rarely, OME is caused by obstruction of the Eustachian tube orifice in the nasopharynx by a mass such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma or other cancer, or as a result of radiation treatment for nasopharyngeal malignancy. Thus, any case of recurrent, unilateral otitis media with effusion warrants nasopharyngoscopy and possibly computed tomography (CT) to rule out obstructive pathology. (See

         OME is often characterized by a temporary conductive hearing loss and a sense of aural fullness. If the effusion becomes chronic, it may be a precursor to tympanic membrane retraction and perforation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Otoscopic findings of OME include visible fluid (often yellowish, but sometimes clear) behind an intact tympanic membrane. For patients with longstanding Eustachian tube dysfunction, the tympanic membrane may also be retracted. A normal tympanic membrane is shown in a photograph  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52626" href="/z/d/graphic/52626.html" rel="external">
          picture 3

         ) compared with a retracted tympanic membrane  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52819" href="/z/d/graphic/52819.html" rel="external">
          picture 5
         </a>
         ). Viscous bubbles may also be seen behind the tympanic membrane, particularly during pneumatic otoscopy. Pneumatic otoscopy reveals reduced mobility of the ear drum when there is fluid in the middle ear. The tympanic membrane may even appear mildly erythematous in OME.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with symptoms of ear fullness associated with hearing loss in whom direct examination of the tympanic membrane is difficult or limited, referral for audiometry and tympanometry is appropriate. In patients with symptoms due to OME, audiometry will reveal a mild to moderate conductive hearing loss, and tympanometry will be abnormal  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73425" href="/z/d/graphic/73425.html" rel="external">

         ). If sensorineural hearing loss is identified on audiometry, patients should be referred to otolaryngology.
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In the majority of cases, OME resolves without treatment within 12 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, the effusion persists and requires additional intervention, such as pressure equalization tubes.

In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians present initial observation as an option for certain children with mild symptoms [

        <p>
         In adults with AOM, however, data about the incidence of viral etiologies or the safety of withholding antimicrobial drugs are limited. Since AOM is unusual in adults, and complications may be significant, it seems prudent to treat all adults patients with antibiotic therapy. (See

         The majority of acute tympanic membrane perforations that occur as a result of AOM will heal spontaneously. When it occurs, the perforation allows drainage of infected fluid, relieving middle ear pressure and permitting the extensively vascularized tympanic membrane to heal more quickly. There are no data in pediatric or adult patients as to whether adding a topical antibiotic in patients with AOM and a ruptured tympanic membrane has benefit over treating with oral antibiotics alone.
        </p>

         In patients with AOM and acute tympanic membrane rupture, some UpToDate authors treat with topical antibiotic ear drops in addition to oral antibiotics, while other authors treat with oral antibiotic alone.

         If a topical antibiotic is used, we choose one without any known ototoxicity (eg, we avoid aminoglycoside containing preparations), and we treat for 7 to 10 days  (

         Other complications following an episode of acute otitis media (AOM) in adults are rare but can occur due to a variety of factors, such as impaired immune status, abnormal anatomy, inadequate antibiotic treatment, or a particularly virulent pathogen. Complications may result from seeding of vascular channels and extension along preformed pathways including the oval window, round window, internal auditory canal, or endolymphatic duct.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mastoiditis and other infectious complications in adults develop in less than 0.5 percent of cases of AOM [
         <a href="#rid48">

         </a>
         ]. Among combined adult and pediatric United States emergency department visits for complications of AOM between 2009 and 2011, the most common diagnoses were acute mastoiditis (0.16 percent), labyrinthitis (0.06 percent), and facial paresis (0.03 percent) [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50

         The mastoid bone (the portion of the petrous temporal bone that lies superior to the middle ear cavity)  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ) contains air cells and is connected by the mastoid antrum to the middle ear. Most cases of AOM are associated with some degree of subclinical mastoiditis (inflammation or infection), although the incidence of clinically significant mastoiditis has been low since the introduction of antibiotics. Prior to antibiotics, acute coalescent mastoiditis complicated approximately 20 percent of cases of AOM, but, following the introduction of antibiotics, the incidence fell to 0.4 percent by 1959 and to 0.24 percent by 1993 [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52
         </a>
         ]. In a United Kingdom study, from 1982 through 2012, the overall incidence of mastoiditis was 5.6 per 10,000 AOM episodes, with a higher rate in adults &gt;20 years compared with patients ≤20 years (11.4 versus 3.7 per 10,000 AOM episodes, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid53">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Mastoiditis is more common in children than adults; when it occurs in older adults, it may be particularly severe [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54,55
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A spectrum of disease is associated with mastoiditis. Mastoid effusion is seen on computed tomography (CT) in all patients with AOM, but in the vast majority of cases it is not clinically significant. Clinically significant suppurative mastoiditis may present with fever, posterior ear pain and/or local erythema over the mastoid bone, edema of the pinna, or a posteriorly and downwardly displaced auricle.
        </p>
        <p>
         In coalescent mastoiditis, the infection occupies the mastoid air spaces, causing destruction of the bony septae that separates the air spaces, and CT demonstrates characteristic loss of the trabecular bone [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         When pus enters the mastoid air cells under pressure, it may lead to the dissolution of surrounding bone, and the infection may then spread to regional structures. Complicated mastoiditis (when infection spreads beyond the mastoid bone) can lead to dangerous complications due to proximity of the mastoid to the posterior cranial fossa, lateral sinuses, facial nerve canal, semicircular canals, and the petrous tip of the temporal bone.
        </p>
        <p>
         If symptoms are present suggesting complicated mastoiditis (including swelling over the mastoid, facial paralysis, vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, or other evidence that the infection has spread locally beyond the mastoid), surgical consultation should be obtained and CT performed. If there is a concern for the development of an intracranial complication (ie, septic lateral sinus thrombosis, intracranial abscess), then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should also be done.
        </p>
        <p>
         Any patient with acute suppurative mastoiditis should be admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics, and surgical consultation should be obtained. When suppurative mastoiditis occurs as a complication of AOM, antibiotics with activity against

         Serous labyrinthitis is a pre-suppurative condition in which the labyrinth undergoes inflammatory changes in association with acute suppurative otitis media. It is not associated with permanent auditory or vestibular dysfunction, and treatment is predominantly medical (treatment of the AOM and symptomatic treatment of the vertigo, nausea, etc), unless persistent granulation tissue or cholesteatoma are present.

         Rarely, purulent (suppurative) labyrinthitis can develop, caused by direct extension of the AOM infection into the inner ear. This presents with more intense vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, vomiting, nausea, and also a clinical presentation of a more acutely ill patient.

         Facial paralysis can occur as a rare complication of AOM through two different mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
         There can be direct spread of the infection from the middle ear (via microdehiscences in the bony canal of the facial nerve, the Fallopian canal) to the nerve itself; as the inflamed nerve swells within this confined channel, a compression injury results in facial paralysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the setting of an infection (more commonly seen in COM with cholesteatoma than in AOM), erosion of the bone overlying the facial nerve can directly compress the facial nerve; this typically occurs in the tympanic or vertical mastoid segment of the nerve. In AOM, however, facial nerve paresis can occur in the absence of any evidence of bony dehiscence in the facial canal. In a retrospective study of 24 adults with AOM complicated by facial nerve palsy, 54 percent had no evidence of bony dehiscence on high-resolution temporal bone CT [

         Hearing loss can occur as a result of both acute and chronic ear infections, although it is more commonly seen in cases of COM. The hearing loss is usually conductive in nature due to either ossicular erosion or tympanic membrane perforation.

        <p>
         Sensorineural hearing loss may rarely occur, particularly in the setting of a new infection in an adult without a prior history of ear infections. In COM, the round window membrane is much thicker, and thus inflammatory material (which may be ototoxic) is much less likely to enter the inner ear. (See

         The petrous apex of the temporal bone also contains air cells and is susceptible to infection, but typically only in the setting of mastoiditis. Due to closely related neural and vascular structures, inflammation and infection of the petrous apex can result in neural compromise. The inflammation may extend into Dorello's canal (containing the sixth cranial nerve and inferior petrosal sinus) and the Gasserian ganglion (sensory ganglion of the trigeminal nerve), causing the triad of symptoms known as Gradenigo syndrome: lateral rectus palsy, retro-orbital pain, and otorrhea. The classic triad is not always present, but the presence of both otorrhea and retro-orbital eye pain should raise the suspicion for petrositis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The acute form typically develops rapidly in a normally pneumatized petrous apex air cell system. Diagnosis is supported by temporal bone CT, demonstrating opacification of the mastoid air cells system and petrous apex, bony erosion within the petrous apex, and enhancement of the cavernous sinus. High-resolution MRI with gadolinium demonstrates a low-intensity signal on T1-weighted images, high-intensity signal on T2-weighted images, with ring enhancement. MRI findings are important in distinguishing petrositis from other lesions of the petrous apex.

        <p>
         Epidural abscesses occur most commonly secondary to erosion of the posterior fossa plate. Less commonly, erosion of the tegmen mastoideum can lead to a middle fossa epidural abscess. Epidural abscesses resulting from acute or chronic ear infections present most commonly as headache that is occasionally relieved by profuse otorrhea. Treatment requires surgical drainage after identification of the abscess on MRI or CT imaging, in addition to intravenous antibiotics. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The presentation of a subdural abscess may closely mirror that of an epidural abscess, although neurologic signs are more likely to accompany abscesses that occur in the subdural space (between the dura and arachnoid meningeal layers). The mechanism underlying the development of a subdural abscess is thought to be bone erosion followed by septic thrombophlebitis. Treatment is the same as for epidural abscess. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103898.html" rel="external">
          "Intracranial epidural abscess"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Brain abscesses that occur in association with an acute or chronic ear infection will typically involve the temporal lobe or cerebellum. Successful treatment requires drainage of the brain abscess, followed by surgical eradication of the mastoid infection and a prolonged course of IV antibiotic therapy. (See

         Otitic hydrocephalus is a rare syndrome of increased intracranial pressure and suppurative otitis media, which occurs in the absence of a brain abscess or meningitis [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63
         </a>
         ]. The pathogenesis seems to involve abnormal cerebrospinal fluid metabolism secondary to inflamed meninges, and the typical case occurs following prolonged otitis media. The most common presenting symptom is headache on the side of the involved ear. Papilledema is noted on examination, and there is evidence of hydrocephalus on imaging (CT or MRI). Appropriate management includes treatment of the ear disease and conventional measures of lowering intracranial pressure. (See

         Septic lateral sinus thrombosis (or sigmoid thrombophlebitis) may occur as a result of AOM in the setting of concomitant acute mastoiditis. The lateral, or sigmoid, sinus runs through the posterior portion of the mastoid cortex, where it eventually forms the jugular bulb and internal jugular vein.
        </p>
        <p>
         Septic lateral sinus thrombosis often presents subacutely, with an earache that persists for several weeks before the onset of the headache. Signs of increased intracranial pressure, lower cranial neuropathies, and Griesinger's sign (postauricular edema due to emissary vein thrombophlebitis) are variable and signify progression of the condition. Sigmoid thrombophlebitis may extend to the jugular vein, with resultant internal jugular vein thrombosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment requires IV antibiotics and, if necessary, drainage of the perisinus abscess via a transmastoid approach with exposure of the sigmoid sinus. Anticoagulation may be indicated. (See

          Definition and overview
         </strong>
         – Acute otitis media (AOM) is an acute, suppurative infectious process marked by the presence of infected middle ear fluid and inflammation of the mucosa lining the middle ear space  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63268" href="/z/d/graphic/63268.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). The infection is most frequently precipitated by impaired function of the Eustachian tube, resulting in the retention and suppuration of retained secretions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63141" href="/z/d/graphic/63141.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). AOM may also be associated with purulent otorrhea if there is a ruptured tympanic membrane. AOM usually responds promptly to antimicrobial therapy. (See
         <a class="local">

          Pathogenesis of AOM in adults
         </strong>
         – Eustachian tube dysfunction, commonly related to seasonal allergic rhinitis or upper respiratory tract infection, is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of middle ear infections in adults. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation and diagnosis
         </strong>
         – AOM is typically associated with the development of unilateral otalgia and decreased hearing. Otoscopy is required for accurate diagnosis; the addition of pneumatic otoscopy, if available, is helpful in providing additional diagnostic information  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef70700" href="/z/d/graphic/70700.html" rel="external">

          picture 2
         </a>
         ). The tympanic membrane in AOM is bulging, opacified, immobile, and often erythematous  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63268" href="/z/d/graphic/63268.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). On physical examination (or audiometry if available), a conductive hearing loss may be demonstrated. (See

          Otitis media with effusion: Presentation and diagnosis
         </strong>
         – An entity that is commonly mistaken for AOM is otitis media with effusion (OME)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138583" href="/z/d/graphic/138583.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). OME is often characterized by hearing loss and a sense aural fullness. Otoscopy reveals the presence of middle ear fluid  (

          picture 4
         </a>
         ) without a bulging tympanic membrane or evidence of active infection. In OME, the tympanic membrane is intact and may or may not be retracted  (

          picture 5

         ), depending on the chronicity of the effusion. (See

         <strong>
          Otitis media with effusion: Management
         </strong>
         – In OME, the majority of effusions will resolve over the course of 12 weeks, and most patients can be observed over this time period. In patients with substantial symptoms, we offer treatment with antihistamines (for OME due to allergic rhinitis), oral decongestants, and/or nasal corticosteroids. Myringotomy with tympanostomy tubes may be considered for persistent symptomatic effusions at 12 weeks and earlier for selected patients with need for immediate pressure equalization (eg, air travel that cannot be deferred). Patients with recurrent, unilateral OME should be referred for full nasopharyngeal evaluation to rule out obstructive pathology. (See

          Antibiotics for adults with AOM: Initial therapy

         – We suggest that adults with AOM be managed with antibiotic treatment rather than "watchful waiting" (

         We suggest

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Amoxicillin-clavulanate is active against the increasingly prevalent otopathogens that produce a beta-lactamase, whereas amoxicillin is not. Resistance to penicillins in
         <em>
          S. pneumoniae

         is by a different mechanism than beta-lactamase production, and AOM due to resista

         can usually be treated by high-dose amoxicillin, including formulations of amoxicillin-clavulanate that contain high-dose amoxicillin.

          Management of ruptured tympanic membrane in AOM
         </strong>
         – The tympanic membrane may rupture as a result of the infection in some patients with AOM. In patients with AOM and acute tympanic membrane rupture, some UpToDate authors treat with topical antibiotic ear drops in addition to oral antibiotics, while other authors treat with oral antibiotics alone. If one does choose to treat, agents containing ototoxic medications (eg, aminoglycosides) should be avoided  (
