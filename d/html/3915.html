         X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP; also called Duncan disease) is a rare disorder that was first identified by Purtillo, et al in the Duncan family, in which 6 of 18 males died of lymphoproliferative disease, including fulminant infectious mononucleosis (FIM) and lymphoma [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) associated protein (
         <em>
          SAP
         </em>
         ) gene [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         XLP is characterized by severe dysregulation of the immune system, often but not always in response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The three most common clinical manifestations are FIM, dysgammaglobulinemia, and lymphoma, usually of B cell origin [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Additional presentations include lymphocytic vasculitis, aplastic anemia, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency was initially considered a form of XLP (XLP type 2 [XLP2]) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. However, after further characterization of the disorder, it appears that XIAP deficiency may be better classified as X-linked familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. (See

         XLP is estimated to affect one to three of every million males [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. However, the disease is probably underreported since males with fatal fulminant infectious mononucleosis (FIM) are not always evaluated for XLP [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. There is no racial or ethnic predilection [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A worldwide XLP registry was established in 1980 as a resource for diagnosis, treatment, and research. By 1995, there were 272 males from 80 families registered [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most females who carry heterozygous mutations in the XLP gene, encoding the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP), are clinically unaffected. Random inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes during embryogenesis in females, termed "lyonization," usually leaves an adequate number of lymphocytes with active wild-type X chromosomes to prevent phenotypic disease. However, unbalanced or skewed X chromosome inactivation can lead to predominant expression of a mutated SAP allele and, therefore, clinical disease [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. In addition, any condition associated with loss of an X chromosome (such as in Turner syndrome) or deletion of the part of the X chromosome containing the SAP gene can, in the presence of a mutation-bearing X chromosome, lead to clinical XLP in a female.

         XLP (MIM #308240) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) associated protein (SAP; also called Src homology 2 domain protein 1A [
         <em>
          SH2D1A
         </em>
         ] or
         <em>
          DSHP
         </em>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ] in approximately 60 percent of cases in many studies [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,7,17,18
         </a>
         ], although other studies have found
         <em>
          SH2D1A
         </em>
         defects in virtually all cases of XLP [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         XLP is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. De novo mutations are rare. There is a broad spectrum of
         <em>
          SAP/SH2D1A
         </em>
         mutations that lead to abnormal or absent SAP protein expression, including deletions or insertions, single nucleotide substitutions, and splice-site abnormalities [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13,17,18
         </a>
         ]. Mutations can cause early stop codons, leading to nonsense mediated decay of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) message and absent SAP protein, abnormally truncated SAP protein with altered function, or destabilized protein due to misfolding or alteration of critical conserved motifs [
         <a href="#rid19">

         An important aspect of genetics concerns the relationship between genetic defects (genotypes) and clinical manifestations (disease phenotypes). There is no consistent correlation between
         <em>
          SH2D1A
         </em>
         genotypes and phenotypes in XLP, as exemplified by the observation of considerable variability in phenotype within families sharing the same genotype [

         The exact mechanisms underlying the clinical features of XLP remain unclear, even though a genetic defect has been identified that causes this syndrome. The clinical manifestations may be related to lack of immune surveillance for or control of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or other unidentified antigenic stimuli or due to ineffective T and natural killer (NK) cell interaction with B cells. There is dysfunction of both cellular immunity (cytotoxic T lymphocyte [CTL] and NK cell dysfunction resulting in decreased cytokine production) and humoral immunity (abnormal immunoglobulin levels and abnormal antibody responses to infections and vaccinations) in XLP. EBV infection is particularly prominent in patients with XLP, perhaps because of the B cell tropism of this virus. However, even though clinical manifestations of XLP are often triggered by EBV infection, most immunologic abnormalities seen in this disorder are not dependent upon the presence of, or prior exposure to, EBV.
        </p>
        <p>
         Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) associated protein (SAP) is expressed in T cells, NK cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, and some B cells. SAP binds to the intracellular domains of most members of the SLAM family of receptors, which are immunoglobulin-like receptors [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. SLAM (CD150) is a costimulatory receptor that triggers T cell activation via a protein tyrosine phosphorylation signal that is dependent upon SAP expression [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,23
         </a>
         ]. SAP assists in the recruitment of the Src-related protein tyrosine kinase, Fyn, to SLAM and activation of Fyn. XLP-associated mutated SAP protein molecules have significantly decreased binding to SLAM peptides and to Fyn [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         SAP also interacts with other members of the SLAM family, including CD84, CD229, CD244 (2B4), NTBA (NK, T, and B cell antigen), and CS1 (CD2 subset 1) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. These cell surface receptors are adhesion molecules that are located in the immunologic synapse regions formed between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and between NK cells and their target cells [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. SAP regulates these cellular interactions, which are required for normal development and function of the immune system [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. In addition, SAP plays a role in the development of T cell populations that have innate immune cell features, such as iNKT cells [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,25-27
         </a>
         ]. iNKT cells are absent in patients with SAP deficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
         Activation of T cells via the SLAM-SAP signaling pathway can alter the profile of cytokines produced. As an example, interleukin (IL) 10 production by CD4+ T cells is defective in patients with XLP [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. These T cells do not provide adequate B cell help, which may contribute to the hypogammaglobulinemia and humoral immunodeficiency seen in patients with XLP. Most immunologic abnormalities are not dependent upon the presence of or prior exposure to EBV. In addition, XLP patients are defective in generating a specific T cell subset, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Thf cells are antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that are predominantly located in close proximity to follicles and germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs and express the chemokine receptor, CXCR5. These CCR5+ cells are important in the formation and maintenance of germinal centers and the establishment of memory B cells and plasma cells [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The primary immune response in normal individuals infected with EBV is characterized by proliferation of CD8+ CTLs and NK cells [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. There are at least three potential mechanisms to explain the abnormal response to EBV infection in patients with XLP:

         <span class="glyph">

         SAP enhances apoptosis in T and B cells [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Apoptosis plays a role in lymphocyte homeostasis and elimination of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaged cells. This important process constrains T cell expansion during antigen-induced immune responses. A decrease in apoptosis due to deficiency of SAP may underlie the intense, unchecked CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity stimulated by acute EBV infection in patients with XLP [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33-35
         </a>
         ]. Defective apoptosis is due in part to abnormal restimulation-induced cell death (RICD), which is a self-regulatory form of apoptosis independent of EBV infection that is directly linked to the SAP/NTBA signaling pathway and which may constitute a therapeutic target [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35-38
         </a>
         ].

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Another explanation for the increased cytotoxic cellular responses to EBV is that SAP-deficient CD8+ CTLs from patients with XLP manifest a failure to lyse autologous EBV-infected B cells [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. The lytic machinery normally polarizes to the area where CTLs contact EBV-infected cells, but this does not occur in SAP-deficient CTLs. Other studies have confirmed the impairment of CD8+ T cell response to EBV-transformed B cells [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ].

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The receptor 2B4 can activate, costimulate, or inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity, depending upon its interactions with other molecules [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,31,41,42
         </a>
         ]. SAP normally inhibits interactions between the 2B4 receptor and negative regulatory molecules. Thus, NK cell activation is inhibited by 2B4 when SAP is absent, leading to reduced NK cell lysis of EBV-infected B cells.

         EBV infection causes a dysregulated and exaggerated immune response in patients with XLP, with excessive proliferation of EBV-infected B cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and macrophages in various tissues, including hematopoietic organs, liver, brain, and heart. Massive infiltration of these cells into lymphoid and other organs, in combination with abnormal cytokine release, can cause extensive parenchymal damage, including hepatic necrosis and bone marrow failure. Thrombocytopenia, anemia, hepatic dysfunction, and meningoencephalitis are common in patients with FIM. Many patients develop fulminant hepatitis and virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS), also referred to as acquired or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87499.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", section on 'Pathophysiology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         FIM and HLH are sometimes listed as separate clinical manifestations of XLP. In the context of EBV infection, FIM and HLH are in essence linked entities and cannot reliably be distinguished from each other. Secondary HLH can occur without the presence of FIM if the offending virus (or infectious trigger in the broader sense) is something other than EBV, such as another herpes family virus. HLH without FIM was observed in approximately 21 percent of EBV-negative patients in one series [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The minority of patients who survive FIM may have fulminant hepatitis upon reexposure to EBV. They usually also have residual immune dysfunction, such as abnormal immunoglobulin levels (increased immunoglobulin A [IgA] or immunoglobulin M [IgM], decreased immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1] or immunoglobulin G3 [IgG3]) and/or impaired antibody responses, as well as defective natural killer (NK) cell function.

         FIM and HLH were the most common presenting manifestations of XLP (approximately 40 percent), with an additional 6 percent developing FIM/HLH at a later date [

         dysgammaglobulinemia was the presenting manifestation in 22 percent, while more than 50 percent demonstrated dysgammaglobulinemia at any given time (enriched in the subpopulation of EBV-negative patients), with a mortality of approximately 5 percent (compared with the previously published mortality of approximately 50 percent) [

         </a>
         ]. This percentage of dysgammaglobulinemia in EBV-negative XLP patients is significantly higher than the one-third of patients originally reported and could be related to increased awareness of dysgammaglobulinemia in the context of XLP, as well as the recognition that disease manifestations in XLP do not depend on EBV infection [

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with dysgammaglobulinemia typically have decreased levels of IgG1 and IgG3, whereas levels of IgA and IgM are elevated, possibly secondary to decreased ability to class-switch from IgM to IgG [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,22,47

          6,44
         </a>

         Some patients have milder clinical features, such as isolated dysgammaglobulinemia, and/or have survived Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. In addition, some patients have exceeded the average life expectancy of those with XLP by several decades. This clinical variability, despite the generally accepted lack of genotype-phenotype relationships, suggests that other factors may modify disease manifestations, severity, and prognosis [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One possible explanation for these findings is somatic reversion, which occurs in other immunodeficiency disorders as well. Somatic reversion is a spontaneous genetic change in a disease-causing mutation at the level of a single lymphoid precursor cell that reverts the gene back to normal. Reverted cells that showed signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) associated protein (SAP) expression and function, indicating a reversion process, were identified in 12 XLP patients from 10 different kindreds [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52
         </a>
         ]. Somatic reversion was found exclusively within CD8+ T cells with an effector memory phenotype. The acquired somatic reversion resulted in wild-type nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The reverted CD8+ T cell populations were maintained in vivo over a period of many years, as measured by persistent SAP expression. These revertant, or spontaneously "gene-corrected," CD8+ T cells showed in vitro cytotoxicity against EBV-infected target cells [

         Patients with XLP demonstrate vigorous cytotoxic cellular responses, predominantly involving polyclonally activated alloreactive cytotoxic CD8 T cells, during acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Those who survive acute EBV infection usually have extensive immune defects. B and T cell numbers are normal to increased, but function is abnormal. IgG is low, and IgM is often increased. Natural killer (NK) cell activity is reduced. Anemia and thrombocytopenia may also be present.

In addition, dysgammaglobulinemia (hypogammaglobulinemia) was also observed in patients with XIAP deficiency. However, the disease course in patients with XIAP deficiency appeared less severe than in XLP, with less frequent neurologic involvement and better prognosis. In addition, there was an association between XIAP deficiency and chronic colitis that was not seen with XLP, and lymphoma was not a feature of XIAP deficiency. (See

The predominant clinical features were dysgammaglobulinemia (47 percent), HLH (37 percent), and lymphoma (28 percent). Just over 50 percent of patients were EBV positive at the time of HCT. Overall survival was approximately 81 percent, with a higher rate seen if a matched family donor was used (92 percent) and if HLH was not the main clinical manifestation of XLP. Survival after HCT was 50 percent in those with HLH, and all of the patients who died exhibited HLH as their main disease manifestation. Overall survival was similar whether traditional myeloablative or nonmyeloablative (reduced-intensity) conditioning was used, although the majority of patients who died received myeloablative conditioning [

         <strong>
          Pathogenesis
         </strong>
         – X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) is a rare disorder characterized by severe dysregulation of the immune system, usually in response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Both cellular and humoral immunity are defective. (See
         <a class="local">

         above.)

         <strong>
          Genetics and classification
         </strong>
         – XLP is caused by mutations in the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) associated protein (SAP) gene in approximately 60 percent of patients. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency was initially designated XLP type 2, but it appears that XIAP deficiency is better classified as X-linked familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Genetics'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – The average age at presentation, usually with EBV infection, is 2.5 years. Most affected persons have no apparent disease prior to presentation. The three most common clinical manifestations are fulminant infectious mononucleosis (FIM), typically complicated by HLH; dysgammaglobulinemia; and lymphoma. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Management of XLP focuses upon three aspects: treatment of disease manifestations, prevention of further sequelae, and curative therapy (hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]). (See
