Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) denotes the selective removal of a patient’s plasma and replacement with another fluid; cytapheresis refers to selective removal of abnormal or excessive numbers of blood cells. This topic review will discuss the complications of therapeutic apheresis. An overview of the terminology used to describe apheresis procedures; the types of indications for which therapeutic apheresis is effective, including American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) therapeutic categories; and practical issues in apheresis techniques are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7941.html" rel="external">"Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology"</a>.)</p><p>An overview to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction is also presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95132.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The basic premise of therapeutic apheresis is that removal of certain pathologic substances or cells (cytapheresis) will reduce organ or tissue damage and may permit treatment or reversal of a pathologic process. To prevent volume depletion during therapeutic plasmapheresis, the volume of plasma removed must be replaced by plasma, colloid, crystalloid, or a volume-appropriate combination of these fluids. Indications for therapeutic apheresis are provided in the American Society of Apheresis guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>Complications may differ based on the type of replacement fluid. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7941.html" rel="external">"Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology", section on 'Replacement fluids'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Donor plasma is preferred in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) because it provides the ADAMTS13 enzyme.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Donor plasma should be avoided if possible if apheresis is being performed to remove a protein or other factor.</p><p></p><p>Common complications are summarized in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138422" href="/z/d/graphic/138422.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>The frequency and types of complications depend on the overall condition of the patient, the number of procedures, replacement fluid, and the approach to venous access. The total frequency of complications in &gt;50,000 procedures (7142 patients) was reported to be 5.8 percent, the most common of which were paresthesias (citrate anticoagulant-associated hypocalcemia) and vascular access issues [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. A review of complications in &gt;15,000 therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) treatments found that adverse reactions were substantially more common with plasma than with albumin replacement (20 versus 1.4 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>In therapeutic cytapheresis, levels of the targeted cells are decreased. When erythrocytapheresis is performed as treatment or prophylaxis for complications of sickle cell disease, red blood cells (RBCs) from donors who test negative for sickle cell trait are used for cellular replacement. Most other types of cytapheresis such as leukapheresis for hyperleukocytosis or platelet apheresis thrombocytosis would not require replacement infusion.</p><p>For therapeutic apheresis in which a citrate-containing solution is used as an anticoagulant, patients may be at risk for citrate-induced hypocalcemia. Metabolic alkalosis or complications related to a vascular catheter may also occur. When blood products such as plasma or RBCs are infused, the risk of citrate-related complications is also higher due to the presence of citrate in additive solutions that are routinely added to blood components at the time of collection. In addition, patients who receive blood products for fluid replacement are at risk of transfusion complications and transfusion-transmitted infections. For TPE, when albumin and/or crystalloid is used as replacement fluid, patients may also be at risk for depletion of coagulation factors or immunoglobulins from a regimen of consecutive daily or frequent procedures.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Any replacement fluid</strong> – A common issue is citrate-induced hypocalcemia due to binding of ionized (free) calcium by citrate that is used as an anticoagulant during the procedure. Symptoms include paresthesias, nausea and vomiting, muscle cramps, chest pain, hypotension, and, in the extreme, tetany or arrhythmias such as QT prolongation. (See <a class="local">'Any replacement fluid'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Non-plasma replacement</strong> <strong>fluids for plasma exchange</strong> – Non-plasma replacement fluids may cause hypokalemia, reduction in coagulation factor and/or immunoglobulins levels, or hypotension if the patient is taking an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. (See <a class="local">'Non-plasma replacement fluids'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Donor plasma or RBC exposure</strong> – Exposure to allogeneic (donor) plasma or RBCs may cause serious complications such as hemolytic transfusion reactions especially if incompatible products are given; severe anaphylactic reactions; transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI); and a potential increase in the risk of exposure to transfusion-transmitted pathogens [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Use of blood products should comply with accreditation standards and regulations [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Donor plasma or red blood cell exposure'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The TPE procedure should be discontinued and symptoms investigated if any change in the patient's status occurs (dyspnea, seizures, chest pain, hypotension not responsive to one or two fluid boluses or other significant symptoms). (See <a class="local">'Evaluation for suspected complications'</a> below.)</p><p>The reported overall incidence of death from TPE is 0.03 to 0.05 percent [<a href="#rid3">3,4,6</a>].

Citrate binds ionized calcium to form soluble <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8829" href="/z/d/drug information/8829.html" rel="external">calcium citrate</a>, lowering the ionized and possibly total serum calcium levels. In patients with normal liver function, citrate is generally metabolized within approximately 1.5 hours. However, because of the length of most therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) or red blood cell (RBC) exchange procedures, symptoms of citrate toxicity frequently occur if not mitigated.</p><p>Early symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral and distal extremity paresthesias or numbness. Severe reactions can include tetany, prolongation of the QT interval, arrhythmias, or hypotension. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/833.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia", section on 'Acute manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Electrocardiographic monitoring and intra-procedural evaluation of ionized calcium levels may be appropriate in patients who are receiving intravenous calcium infusions, become symptomatic, or are at risk of significant citrate sensitivity, including patients with altered mental status or pediatric patients who may not be able to communicate early symptoms of hypocalcemia [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Strategies to reduce citrate-induced hypocalcemia include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Slowing the exchange rate is an appropriate initial approach and may alleviate symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Slow intravenous administration of one 10 mL ampule of 10 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9186" href="/z/d/drug information/9186.html" rel="external">calcium chloride</a> over 15 to 30 minutes, beginning 15 minutes after the start of TPE [<a href="#rid3">3,8</a>]. Calcium infusion can be repeated if the therapy will last substantially longer than an hour.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In one of the authors' experience (AAK), this regimen reduced the incidence of symptomatic hypocalcemia from 9.1 to 1 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The other author (JLF) has observed that pre- and intra-procedural oral calcium supplements can mitigate and/or possibly treat mild hypocalcemia in certain groups such as stable outpatients. Intravenous calcium infusion may be indicated for patients who cannot take oral calcium, or for the occasional patient who develops severe hypocalcemia or has symptoms unresponsive to oral calcium. Administration of 5 to 10 mL of 10 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9190" href="/z/d/drug information/9190.html" rel="external">calcium gluconate</a> intravenously over 10 to 15 minutes ("IV push") is effective in reducing symptoms when oral calcium is not effective; muscle contractions can develop if <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9186" href="/z/d/drug information/9186.html" rel="external">calcium chloride</a> or calcium gluconate is administered too rapidly [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9190" href="/z/d/drug information/9190.html" rel="external">calcium gluconate</a>, administered as a continuous infusion of 10 mL of 10 percent calcium gluconate per liter of non-plasma fluid, has been shown to prevent citrate toxicity [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. One gram of calcium gluconate per liter of non-plasma infusion fluid may alleviate citrate-associated symptoms [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H544867"><span class="h2">Citrate-induced metabolic alkalosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Another complication of citrate administration is the development of metabolic alkalosis in patients with concurrent kidney failure such as anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody disease (Goodpasture disease) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Metabolism of excess citrate generates bicarbonate, the excretion of which is limited by kidney failure. </p><p>Citrate-induced metabolic alkalosis in individuals with kidney insufficiency can be managed by hemodialysis. Patients with kidney failure requiring therapeutic apheresis may require hemodialysis following the procedure to restore acid-base, electrolyte, and fluid balance as needed. Additional information regarding the dialysis procedure is presented in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1927.html" rel="external">"Kidney replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury in adults: Indications, timing, and dialysis dose"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1854.html" rel="external">"Acute hemodialysis prescription"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H545225"><span class="h2">Removal of/reduction in medications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Substantial drug removal by TPE should be anticipated for medications that are highly protein-bound and have a small volume of distribution and consequently are primarily limited to the vascular space; this also applies to therapeutic antibodies. Consequently, administration of these medications should be timed to occur after TPE rather than immediately before the procedure. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8836" href="/z/d/drug information/8836.html" rel="external">eculizumab</a> are generally removed.

Some of these complications may also occur if peripheral veins are used for access.</p><p>Use of peripheral veins may avoid complications associated with central venous catheters, but this approach may not be possible in some cases due to slower blood flow associated with peripheral vein access that increases procedure time and may be uncomfortable for the patient.</p><p>Confirmation of proper placement of the vascular access device is standard practice intended to minimize some of these complications and is also required by Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) and Foundation for Cellular Therapy (FACT) standards [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8180.html" rel="external">"Central venous catheters: Overview of complications and prevention in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H546310"><span class="h1">NON-PLASMA REPLACEMENT FLUIDS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H546317"><span class="h2">Hypokalemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Due to dilutional factors, non-plasma replacement fluids can induce a 25 percent reduction in plasma potassium concentration in the post-apheresis period [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. For individuals at risk of hypokalemia (eg, due to depletion, dilution, or citrate-induced alkalemia), the potassium level should be checked immediately post-procedure and treated if hypokalemia is present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2297.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3646878"><span class="h2">Hypocalcemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infusion of large volumes of albumin may play a role in the development of hypocalcemia. This was demonstrated in a study that randomly assigned 32 patients to receive 10 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10203" href="/z/d/drug information/10203.html" rel="external">pentastarch</a> versus 5 percent albumin during the first half of an apheresis procedure [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The occurrence of hypocalcemia was lower with pentastarch than albumin (hypocalcemic symptoms in 8 versus 33 percent); the likely cause including binding of calcium to the infused albumin.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H546349"><span class="h2">Coagulation factor depletion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) with albumin or other non-plasma replacement fluid produces a predictable decrease in blood coagulation factors that may predispose to bleeding. Immediately after a single plasma volume exchange, the prothrombin time (PT) may increase by 30 percent and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may double; these changes tend to return towards normal within four hours [<a href="#rid8">8,15</a>]. However, more pronounced and longer-lasting changes can be induced when multiple exchanges are performed over a short period, such as three or more treatments per week [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>If a patient is expected to require multiple TPE procedures, a baseline assessment of coagulation parameters should be performed. The PT, aPTT, and/or fibrinogen level should be done prior to initiating TPE; this may be repeated daily or every other day. For patients at risk of bleeding, such as immediately after kidney biopsy for anti-GBM disease, one or more liters of plasma may be substituted as the replacement fluid; the plasma should be administered at the end of the procedure. An alternative to plasma infusion is to allow coagulation parameters or factor levels to return to normal prior to performing procedures such as the removal of a large bore vascular catheter after the last TPE.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H546395"><span class="h2">Immunoglobulin depletion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Repeated TPE with a non-plasma replacement fluid will predictably deplete the patient's immunoglobulins and result in low serum IgG and other immunoglobulin levels. The indication for monitoring serum IgG levels depends on a number of factors including the frequency of exchanges, how many blood volumes are exchanged per procedure, the immune status of the patient, and the patient's ability to produce immunoglobulins.</p><p>Removal of immunoglobulins and complement may lead to an immunodeficient state, leaving the patient susceptible to infection. Reports of patients treated with TPE for glomerulonephritis suggested an increase in opportunistic infections. However, these patients also received immunosuppressive agents and were often granulocytopenic [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In a trial that randomized 86 patients with lupus nephritis to TPE or immunosuppressive therapy, TPE was not associated with a greater risk of infection and patients were not more prone to infection [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>For a patient undergoing aggressive TPE, such as two to three plasma volume replacements per procedure and/or consecutive daily procedures without plasma replacement, a baseline IgG level should be obtained [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. For patients whose IgG level falls below 500 mg/dL and who have a systemic infection, or for whom concerns about infection exist, we (author AAK) use a single infusion of intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG; 100 to 400 mg/kg), although IgG replacement has not been tested in this setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4431.html" rel="external">"Overview of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H546467"><span class="h2">ACE inhibitor-related complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rarely, symptoms resembling anaphylaxis such as flushing, hypotension, abdominal cramping, and other gastrointestinal symptoms, have been reported during TPE in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These symptoms have been observed when albumin was used for replacement fluid and the patient had taken an ACE inhibitor within 24 to 30 hours of TPE [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. In one report of 299 consecutive patients undergoing TPE, these symptoms occurred in all 14 patients receiving an ACE inhibitor versus only 7 percent in those not receiving an ACE inhibitor [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The etiology of these symptoms is unclear; one possibility is increased kinin generation, which has been thought to account for angioedema that can occur with ACE inhibitors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3816.html" rel="external">"Major side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers"</a>.)</p><p>Based on these observations, it has been recommended that ACE inhibitors be withheld for 24 to 48 hours prior to TPE if the patient can tolerate a temporary discontinuation; transitioning to an angiotensin receptor blocker should be considered [<a href="#rid10">10,23</a>].

In cases of anaphylaxis due to anti-IgA, it is necessary to obtain plasma from IgA-deficient donors. This product is usually only available from a registry of rare donors, and it may be difficult to obtain enough plasma to perform multiple procedures.

With continuous flow technology, the extracorporeal volume is usually no more than 15 percent of the patient's intravascular volume; however, instruments that use discontinuous flow technology may have higher extracorporeal volumes.

In more than 50 TPE-associated deaths since 1989, respiratory or cardiac complications were most common [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Cardiac arrhythmias were frequently observed, especially in those receiving plasma. The suspected etiology was reduced ionized calcium concentration, but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been proven.</p><p>Among respiratory deaths, acute respiratory distress and symptoms of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema were observed shortly before death; these patients were also being infused with plasma. Anaphylaxis, vascular complications, hepatitis, sepsis, and thrombosis were other, less common causes of death.

The frequency and types of complications from therapeutic apheresis depend on the overall condition of the patient, the number of plasma exchanges, the type of replacement fluid, and the venous access approach. Common complications are listed in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138422" href="/z/d/graphic/138422.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Adverse reactions are more common when plasma is used as the replacement fluid. (See <a class="local">'Overview of complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypocalcemia </strong>– Citrate causes hypocalcemia by binding ionized calcium. Citrate-induced hypocalcemia can occur with any blood product used in therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and red blood cell (RBC) exchange, and symptoms of citrate toxicity can occur frequently. Potential early symptoms include perioral and distal extremity paresthesias or numbness; severe reactions can include tetany, prolongation of the QT interval, arrhythmias, or hypotension. A variety of strategies exist to reduce this complication. (See <a class="local">'Citrate-induced hypocalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications with non-plasma fluid replacement</strong> – Other complications that can occur with any replacement fluid include metabolic alkalosis, inadvertent removal of or decrease in the concentration of a drug, or complications related to the vascular access catheter. (See <a class="local">'Citrate-induced metabolic alkalosis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Removal of/reduction in medications'</a> above and <a class="local">'Vascular catheter complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications with </strong><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a><strong> replacement</strong> – Non-plasma replacement fluids may cause hypokalemia or depletion of coagulation factors or immunoglobulins. Baseline assessment of the PT, aPTT, and/or fibrinogen level should be done prior to initiating apheresis for patients expected to undergo multiple procedures, and a baseline IgG level should be obtained for those expected to undergo aggressive plasma exchange. (See <a class="local">'Coagulation factor depletion'</a> above and <a class="local">'Immunoglobulin depletion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Flushing, hypotension, abdominal cramping, and other gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported, although rarely, during TPE in patients receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. To reduce this complication, it has been recommended that ACE inhibitors be withheld for 24 to 48 hours prior to TPE if the patient can tolerate short-term interruption. (See <a class="local">'ACE inhibitor-related complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications with plasma or RBC replacement</strong> <strong>–</strong> Exposure to donor plasma or RBCs may cause hemolytic transfusion reactions (if incompatible blood is administered), anaphylactic reactions, allergic reactions (eg, hives), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), exposure to infectious pathogens, or other complications (see <a class="local">'Donor plasma or red blood cell exposure'</a> above).
