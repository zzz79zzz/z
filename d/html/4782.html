It can result from congenital defects in the membrane transport systems of the small intestinal epithelium (primary malabsorption) or, much more commonly, from acquired defects in the epithelial absorptive surface (acquired malabsorption). Maldigestion, which is the impaired digestion of nutrients within the intestinal lumen or at the terminal digestive site of the brush border membrane of mucosal epithelial cells, can also interfere with nutrient absorption since it is the necessary predecessor to many absorptive mechanisms.</p><p>Although malabsorption and maldigestion are pathophysiologically distinct, the processes underlying digestion and absorption are interdependent, so that in clinical practice the term malabsorption has come to denote derangements in either process. This topic will provide an overview of the principles of management of malabsorption. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of malabsorption and the management of specific diseases associated with malabsorption are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4780.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult patient with suspected malabsorption"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4781.html" rel="external">"Overview of nutrient absorption and etiopathogenesis of malabsorption"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4777.html" rel="external">"Management of celiac disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4773.html" rel="external">"Management of short bowel syndrome in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4778.html" rel="external">"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2630817866"><span class="h2">Classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Malabsorption may either be global or selective. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Global malabsorption </strong>– Global malabsorption arises from diseases associated with either widespread mucosal involvement or a reduced absorptive surface. Typically, a broad array of nutrients are not adequately absorbed. An example is celiac sprue, in which impaired absorption of almost all nutrients occurs. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Selective</strong> <strong>malabsorption </strong>– Selective or isolated malabsorption results from diseases that interfere with the absorption of a single nutrient or a limited array of nutrients. An example is pernicious anemia, a disease that leads to defective cobalamin (vitamin B12) absorption.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2487660385"><span class="h1">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3910015392"><span class="h2">Goals of management</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treat the underlying disease – Although a diverse array of pathological conditions may result in global malabsorption, diarrhea, weight loss, and nutritional deficits are common manifestations regardless of the cause. Thus, while the clinical presentation of two patients with malabsorption may be similar, the underlying pathophysiology and appropriate treatment may be very different. Establishing a diagnosis of malabsorption is therefore only a first step since identifying and treating the underlying disease process must follow.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Optimize control of the diarrhea that often accompanies malabsorption.  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identify and treat nutritional deficits, and then monitor for re-occurrence.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Optimize quality of life – Malabsorption, especially when severe and when the pathophysiology of the underlying disease cannot be fully corrected, creates major impositions on one's life due to issues such as long-term dietary constraints, the need for a multi-drug pharmacologic regimen, the need for immediate access to toilets, the social stigma attached to weight loss, etc. The optimal management strategies for the same malabsorptive condition in a jet-setting business executive may be very different than the optimal strategies for a college-aged teen: thus, person-specific factors need to be taken into consideration when designing a management plan.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H145407384"><span class="h2">Antidiarrheals in selected patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In many cases, treating the underlying disease and applying appropriate dietary interventions is sufficient to control diarrhea. However, when such measures are insufficient, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9571" href="/d/drug information/9571.html" rel="external">loperamide</a> or diphenoxylate with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8983" href="/d/drug information/8983.html" rel="external">atropine</a> can be used to prolong transit time and enhance fluid and electrolyte absorption. In general, it is best to begin with loperamide rather than diphenoxylate with atropine because it is largely metabolized on first pass through the liver and, as it does not easily cross the blood-brain barrier, it rarely has central nervous system side-effects. It is also generally less expensive than diphenoxylate with atropine. In patients with severely shortened small bowel or who otherwise have very rapid intestinal transit, using the liquid forms of these drugs is sometimes more effective since it avoids the issue of incomplete tablet dissolution. Deodorized <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9721" href="/d/drug information/9721.html" rel="external">tincture of opium</a> (DTO) is a highly effective anti-diarrheal and is particularly useful in patients with short bowel syndrome or other causes of chronic, severe diarrhea that persists despite loperamide and diphenoxylate with atropine. In a small minority of patients, DTO can produce mild sedation. Further, it does have a very low, but real, addictive potential. However, in reliable patients without a history of drug abuse, it can be quite useful. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4773.html" rel="external">"Management of short bowel syndrome in adults", section on 'Antidiarrheals'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/98342.html" rel="external">"Management of acute chemotherapy-related diarrhea", section on 'Pharmacologic management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2700815636"><span class="h2">Dietary modifications</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4223616925"><span class="h3">General measures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dietary measures are important adjuncts in the effective management of malabsorption. These dietary strategies can help address nutritional deficits and, importantly, can reduce diarrhea, especially in circumstances in which the underlying pathophysiology cannot be entirely corrected. We suggest the following general dietary measures:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoidance of more than one serving a day of caffeine-containing beverages. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with very rapid transit or whose colons are absent or very shortened, full-strength sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices should be avoided as they can markedly increase the volume of diarrhea due to their osmotic load. If consumed, they should be diluted with water in a 1:1 ratio. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sorbitol-containing candies and gums should also be avoided. They can cause diarrhea due to the osmotic effects of this sugar alcohol. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with severe diarrhea resulting in dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities should receive an oral rehydration solution. Commercially-available products vary widely in their formulation, and some are designed more for commercial appeal than for adherence to scientific principles, so a formula that abides by World Health Organization guidelines should be used. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2717.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Fluid repletion'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6129.html" rel="external">"Oral rehydration therapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1932011086"><span class="h3">Specific dietary restriction in selected patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dietary restrictions of specific components of the diet in some diseases leading to malabsorption can result in full restoration of mucosal function and nutritional status. Examples include elimination of a particular carbohydrate in patients with isolated disaccharidase deficiencies, or avoidance of gluten in patients with celiac disease [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2542.html" rel="external">"Lactose intolerance and malabsorption: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4777.html" rel="external">"Management of celiac disease in adults", section on 'Components of the gluten-free diet'</a>.)</p><p>When fat malabsorption cannot be corrected by treatment of the underlying disease, a restriction of dietary fat should be imposed. For an adult, restricting fat to &lt;50 grams per day represents a modest and achievable fat restriction; achieving &lt;40 grams per day is difficult. Restricting fat will reduce diarrhea since malabsorbed fatty acids stimulate a secretory diarrhea when they reach the colon. In patients whose colon is no longer in the fecal stream, this is not a consideration, so fat restriction in this setting does not diminish diarrhea and fluid losses. However, regardless of whether a colon is present or not, malabsorbed fatty acids bind calcium and magnesium, creating a malabsorption of those nutrients that is proportional to the degree of fat malabsorption, thereby exacerbating the metabolic bone disease that often accompanies longstanding malabsorption. This factor alone may therefore dictate a fat restriction in an individual whose colon is not in the fecal stream.</p><p>Medium-chain triglyceride supplements, either as a powder or as an oil, are a useful dietary supplement for those adhering to a fat restriction since the caloric density is the same as those for long-chain triglycerides, thereby compensating for the calories lost due to the dietary restriction. The oil format produces nausea and diarrhea in a minority of individuals.    </p><p>Fructose intolerance is another condition that responds to a specific dietary restriction, albeit a diagnosis that remains somewhat controversial. A fructose breath test has been suggested as an objective means of identifying fructose intolerance, although additional studies are needed to validate the predictive value of this test [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Patients with suspected fructose intolerance should be advised to avoid foods that contain a high net amount of fructose (ie, more fructose than glucose, or more fructose and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9940" href="/d/drug information/9940.html" rel="external">sorbitol</a> than glucose). In particular, they should avoid intake of food or beverages that are sweetened with fructose, crystalline fructose, or high-fructose corn syrup [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Honey should also be avoided since it contains 35 g of fructose and 29 g of glucose per 100 g (3 tablespoons). Fruits with high-fructose concentration include apples, pears, sweet cherries, prunes, and dates. If foods containing fructose are consumed, they should be eaten with meals. Beverages sweetened with high- fructose corn syrup should be limited to 12 ounces. Long-term elimination of high-fructose fruits should only be entertained if there is unequivocal symptomatic improvement with their elimination. Similarly, sucrase-isomaltase deficiency has been reported to be more prevalent than previously thought, often masquerading as irritable bowel syndrome, and responds to a low-sucrose or sucrose-free diet, sometimes with the addition of a low-starch or starch-free diet [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4780.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult patient with suspected malabsorption", section on 'Malabsorption of specific carbohydrates'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H315236955"><span class="h2">Nutrient repletion and supplementation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1026764916"><span class="h3">Fat soluble vitamins</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with significant steatorrhea may require supplementation with special forms of fat-soluble vitamins that have a more water-soluble nature. Examples include the 25-hydroxy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108764" href="/d/drug information/108764.html" rel="external">calcifediol</a>), 1-hydroxy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16467" href="/d/drug information/16467.html" rel="external">alfacalcidol</a>), or 1,25 dihydroxy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9183" href="/d/drug information/9183.html" rel="external">calcitriol</a>) forms of vitamin D. The serum calcium should be monitored for the first few weeks of therapy with these vitamin D analogues since they are more potent than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10150" href="/d/drug information/10150.html" rel="external">vitamin D2</a> or D3, and can more easily produce hypercalcemia. This is especially true of the dihydroxy form. In assessing blood levels of vitamin D in patients on alfacalcidol or calcitriol, it is necessary to check serum 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels rather than the more conventional 25-hydroxyvitamin D, since the 25-hydroxy stage is bypassed with these supplements.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency diminishes intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate, thereby promoting bone de-mineralization. Optimal reduction of bone fracture risk is best achieved when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are maintained at or slightly above the normative range (ie, 30 to 40 ng/mL) among those using vitamins D2, D3, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D as a supplement [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Among those taking the 1-hydroxylated or 1,25-dihydroxy forms of the vitamin, the optimal blood concentrations of vitamin D metabolites are less clear. It would probably be best in the latter situation to aim for a blood level within the normative range for 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5887.html" rel="external">"Vitamin and mineral deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease", section on 'Vitamin D'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with fat malabsorption and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10049" href="/d/drug information/10049.html" rel="external">vitamin E</a> deficiency, a special form of vitamin E (d-alpha-tocopherol glycol 1000 succinate) is preferred as other vitamin E preparations are poorly absorbed. Some fat-soluble vitamins can also be obtained in capsules containing an emulsifying solution (eg, Aquasol A, Aquasol E). However, it is unproven whether these products actually enhance vitamin absorption. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5368.html" rel="external">"Vitamin intake and disease prevention"</a>.)</p><p>Oral supplementation with the daily recommended intake is sometimes sufficient to correct existing nutritional deficiencies, although over the few weeks immediately following the identification of a vitamin or mineral deficiency, more rapid recovery is most readily achieved by supplementation with 5 to 10 times the recommended dietary allowance  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51385" href="/d/graphic/51385.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p>If the underlying etiology of malabsorption can be identified and corrected, patients may not require long-term supplementation. In patients with persistent malabsorption, long-term supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins may be required based on the degree of ongoing malabsorption. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory studies for micronutrient deficiencies'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H764503693"><span class="h3">Other micronutrients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Calcium and magnesium supplementation is often required in patients with fat malabsorption. In patients with fat malabsorption and a colon in continuity with the fecal stream, calcium supplementation also assists in the prevention of nephrolithiasis due to oxalate stones [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4775.html" rel="external">"Chronic complications of the short bowel syndrome in adults", section on 'Nephrolithiasis'</a>.) When calcium supplementation is administered for this purpose, it should be taken with meals, thereby enabling the calcium to bind the oxalate contained in the meal [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Intermittent parenteral repletion of magnesium may be required in some patients since oral magnesium supplements can exacerbate their underlying diarrhea. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/826.html" rel="external">"Treatment of hypocalcemia", section on 'Mildly symptomatic or chronic hypocalcemia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/834.html" rel="external">"Hypomagnesemia: Evaluation and treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Other micronutrients that often require supplementation include iron, folate, vitamin B12, and zinc. Even in the absence of documented micronutrient deficiencies, it is prudent to administer a daily multivitamin/multimineral tablet to patients with chronic malabsorption due to the frequent and insidious evolution of deficiency states. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7148.html" rel="external">"Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults", section on 'Oral iron'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7154.html" rel="external">"Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies", section on 'Treatment of folate deficiency'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7154.html" rel="external">"Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies", section on 'Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2585.html" rel="external">"Overview of dietary trace elements", section on 'Dietary reference intake'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4132803446"><span class="h2">Monitoring</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2238980078"><span class="h3">Bone density</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic malabsorption, and particularly fat malabsorption, is a risk factor for metabolic bone disease and fractures [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Patients with malabsorption require screening for fracture risk with history and physical examination to assess for risk factors and measurement of bone mineral density. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2046.html" rel="external">"Screening for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men", section on 'Fracture risk assessment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2363388746"><span class="h3">Laboratory studies for micronutrient deficiencies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients whose malabsorption cannot be fully corrected require intermittent monitoring for early detection since many vitamin and trace mineral deficiencies evolve insidiously. In chronic fat malabsorption, it is worthwhile to measure all four fat-soluble vitamins, whereas checking vitamin B12 and just one other representative water-soluble vitamin will usually suffice. The assessment of plasma trace mineral (chromium, copper, manganese, molybdenum, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9884" href="/d/drug information/9884.html" rel="external">selenium</a>, and zinc) levels are problematic and they should be interpreted thoughtfully since: 1) the vanishingly low concentrations of these minerals in the blood are difficult to measure accurately, 2) because plasma levels do not necessarily reflect tissue concentrations, and 3) because minor deviations from normative ranges are often not clinically meaningful. Among the trace minerals, zinc is the most commonly observed deficiency among malabsorbers due its high concentrations in gastrointestinal secretions. Consequently, this author routinely monitors zinc in chronic malabsorbers and only checks other trace mineral levels when the clinical scenario so dictates. The frequency of routine monitoring depends on the clinical situation but should not occur any less often than annually. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1293327855"><span class="h1">DIRECTED THERAPY BASED ON THE UNDERLYING ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Specific interventions for malabsorption based on the underlying etiology include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54743" href="/d/graphic/54743.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bile acid malabsorption</strong> – Minor degrees of bile acid re-absorption result in bile acid diarrhea (cholorrhea), which is treated very differently than those with marked degrees of bile acid malabsorption, which results in steatorrhea: this is an important distinction to make. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4781.html" rel="external">"Overview of nutrient absorption and etiopathogenesis of malabsorption", section on 'Causes of fat malabsorption'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In patients in whose bile acid deficiency is marked and therefore plays a role in fat malabsorption (eg, extensive ileal disease or resection, chronic cholestasis, end-stage cirrhosis), therapy with exogenous conjugated bile acids can decrease steatorrhea. Although such preparations are no longer available by prescription, there are some reliable companies that sell desiccated ox and cattle bile over the internet.<strong> </strong>However, natural bile acid preparations often increase the volume of diarrhea due to colonic secretion occurring after bacteria in the colon deconjugate the bile acids. This can occur even though they are decreasing the magnitude of steatorrhea. This is generally not of concern in patients who have undergone a colectomy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. For patients who have a colon in continuity with the fecal stream, however, a synthetic conjugated bile acid that does not undergo bacterial deconjugation (cholylsarcosine) may be beneficial [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Apart from reducing diarrhea, cholylsarcosine reduces urinary oxalate excretion in patients with short bowel syndrome [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Cholylsarcosine is presently not available in the United States.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</strong> – The mainstay of therapy for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth are antibiotics to reduce (rather than eradicate) small intestinal bacteria.

The likelihood and nature of deficiency states are partly determined by the type of surgery that is performed. The most common clinically relevant micronutrient deficiencies after gastric bypass include thiamine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, and copper. Malabsorption of certain drugs such as thyroid replacements may occur, necessitating monitoring and adjustment of dosages [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency </strong>– In patients with chronic pancreatitis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, the mainstay of treatment is a balanced fat intake and administration of exogenous pancreatic enzymes.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.
