         Posterior calf injuries are common and occur in both competitive and recreational athletes as well as active laborers. The major posterior calf muscles include the gastrocnemius, soleus, popliteal, and plantaris muscles. These muscles primarily perform active plantarflexion of the ankle and are typically injured during ballistic movements. Patients with posterior calf injuries present with limping, swelling of the posterior calf, and significant pain at the time of injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review common and important posterior calf injuries, including the mechanisms of injury, diagnosis, and management. Achilles tendon and other leg injuries are discussed separately. (See

          EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Muscle strains of the posterior calf affect both competitive and recreational athletes but occur most often in poorly conditioned male athletes in the fourth to sixth decade of life [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. Calf injuries typically occur during sudden ballistic movements involving the lower extremity, such as sprinting or jumping, in sports or activities where these movements are common, such as tennis, football (soccer), basketball, American football, running up hills, and some types of military training [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,5
         </a>
         ]. The medial head of the gastrocnemius in particular plays a major role in generating power when athletes jump or sprint, and injuries of the medial head are relatively common. Calf muscle strains usually occur when the muscles are not warmed up properly or have fatigued significantly during exercise. Approximately 20 percent of patients report prodromal symptoms including soreness or tightness in their calf muscle prior to the injury [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Competitive male masters runners, defined as older than age 40, are at higher risk for calf injuries. Survey studies from races reveal that calf injury is among the most common injuries for all male runners and disproportionately affects older runners [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a six year study of the Taroko Gorge Marathon found that 34 percent of male recreational runners who sought physical therapy at the end of the race had sustained a calf injury, compared to 28 of women [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Runners with a forefoot strike pattern may be at an increased risk for gastrocnemius injury. Computer simulation studies report that a forefoot strike pattern increases overall work (and thereby injury risk) for the gastrocnemius muscles while decreasing soleus muscle work [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Calf injuries are common among tennis players [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. A case series of medial calf injury in 720 athletes found that 16 percent arose from tennis [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. A large proportion of such injuries occur at the musculotendinous junction of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle or the aponeurosis between the medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. These injuries are often referred to as "tennis leg." For patients diagnosed with tennis leg, only 14 percent of injuries occur at the lateral head of the gastrocnemius [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ], and 1.4 percent involve plantaris rupture [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The frequency of calf injury appears to be increasing in certain sports. As an example, calf injury now ranks as the second most common muscle injury in Australian-rules football [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. In this population, the soleus was affected more often (62 percent) than the gastrocnemius (24 percent), but the location of injury remained consistent with other calf muscle strains, as 84 percent of soleus injuries occurred at the musculotendinous junction. By contrast, a study of United States professional football players reported that 74 percent of calf injuries involved the gastrocnemius and 15 percent the soleus [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While most studies report a preponderance of gastrocnemius injuries, calf injury location likely differs with the demands of a given sport. According to one observational study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, the imaging technique used most often to assess calf injuries, may underdiagnose deeper soleus strains, thereby introducing a measurement bias that exaggerates the number of calf injuries attributed to gastrocnemius strain [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The literature pertaining to risk factors for calf injury is limited. A history of a posterior calf strain is a risk factor for recurrent injury [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,16,17
         </a>
         ]. Among older soccer players, a history of a lumbar entrapment of the fifth lumbar (L5) nerve root has been associated with an increased risk for posterior gastrocnemius strain, and this condition may be a risk factor for other active adults [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review noted that increasing age and previous calf strain are most predictive of future calf injury [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Older age is associated with an increased risk of calf injury in many sports besides running. For elite soccer (football) athletes, the frequency of calf injury increases as players age, starting at age 23 [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While most calf injuries relate to sport, there are case reports of gastrocnemius injuries occurring in older, deconditioned adults at work, including jobs that require frequent loading or sudden stretching of the calf [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Bilateral, medial gastrocnemius ruptures have occurred after prolonged walking in high heels. Other medical factors associated with calf tendon injury include fluoroquinolones, glucocorticoids, chronic kidney disease, and lupus and other diseases affecting connective tissue [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The anatomy of the calf includes several overlapping muscles and tendons  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91466 graphicRef91477 graphicRef91478" href="/z/d/graphic/91466.html" rel="external">

          figure 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. The medial head of the gastrocnemius originates at the posterior surface of the medial femoral condyle, while the lateral head originates at the lateral femoral condyle  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91479" href="/z/d/graphic/91479.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). The two heads of the gastrocnemius have considerable proximal muscle bulk and are separated by an intramuscular septum. The proximal gastrocnemius is thinner, and the superficial fibers form a fascial aponeurosis. The gastrocnemius contains both slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibers. Innervation of the gastrocnemius is from the tibial nerve and primarily the first sacral (S1) nerve root, with some contribution from the fifth lumbar (L5) nerve root.
        </p>
        <p>
         The soleus muscle originates at the mid portion of the proximal posterior tibia, the posterior fibular head, and the proximal third of the fibular shaft  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91480" href="/z/d/graphic/91480.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). This flat and broad muscle extends distally to approximately 10 to 15 cm above the calcaneus, where its fibers narrow into a deep aponeurosis and merge with those of the more superficial gastrocnemius aponeurosis to form the true tendinous portion of the Achilles tendon. Within the proximal soleus, there are intramuscular tendons that separate distinct muscle bundles. According to some anatomists, the soleus and two heads of the gastrocnemius represent a single muscle unit that is sometimes called the triceps surae. Innervation is from the tibial nerve and nerve roots from L4 to S2.
        </p>
        <p>
         The soleus muscle contains primarily slow-twitch muscle fibers. Thus, while the gastrocnemius accounts for most of the power generated by the calf for speed and jumping, the soleus plays a major role in maintaining strength and endurance for prolonged or repeated plantar flexion during activity. The most common accessory muscle in the leg is an accessory soleus muscle (0.7 to 5 percent according to autopsy reports), which can take a variety of forms, interposing between the distal main soleus muscle and the Achilles tendon. On imaging studies, the accessory soleus manifests as increased muscle tissue behind the medial malleolus and extending to the calcaneus [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The plantaris muscle originates at the lateral supracondylar line, which is a small ridge of bone along the posterior half of the lateral femoral condyle, just proximal to the origin of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91481" href="/z/d/graphic/91481.html" rel="external">
          picture 4
         </a>
         ). Some fibers may originate from the oblique popliteal ligament. In most individuals, the small muscle belly extends only 5 to 10 cm distally before becoming a long, thin tendon that travels in a plane between the medial gastrocnemius and the soleus. This tendon inserts along the medial aspect of the Achilles tendon about 5 to 7 cm proximal to the calcaneus, although it sometimes extends to the medial calcaneus [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,25
         </a>
         ]. Some anatomists feel the plantaris is a vestigial muscle with no functional role, while others feel that it provides some assistance during plantar flexion and may weakly assist knee flexion. Innervation is from the tibial nerve and nerve roots from L5 to S2.
        </p>
        <p>
         The popliteal muscle has three origins: the lateral femoral condyle, fibula, and lateral horn of the meniscus. The muscle then travels deep to the lateral collateral ligament off of the lateral femoral condyle and through the popliteal hiatus, inserting onto the posterior aspect of the proximal tibia. The popliteal muscle internally rotates the tibia against the femur and prevents external rotation of the tibia [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A neurovascular bundle, containing the popliteal artery, popliteal vein, and tibial nerve, emerges above the knee close to the hiatus of the adductor magnus muscle and passes into the popliteal space  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77245" href="/z/d/graphic/77245.html" rel="external">
          picture 5
         </a>
         ). The nerve and vessels pass deep through a fibrous arc in the proximal soleus to lie along the posterior surface of the tibia. Branches of the tibial nerve and the popliteal artery supply each of the major muscles and structures of the posterior knee and proximal calf  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132360" href="/z/d/graphic/132360.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132359" href="/z/d/graphic/132359.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). In some individuals, anatomic anomalies or repetitive trauma may result in compression of the vessels in the popliteal space. Of note, the calf has a rich vascular supply, and any significant tissue trauma can lead to prolonged intramuscular bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sural nerve is formed from the branches of the tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve in the posterior calf. The sural nerve provides sensory innervation of the posterior lateral calf and can be injured in conjunction with damage to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle.

         Gastrocnemius injuries consist primarily of sudden muscle tears that are sustained during ballistic movements involving eccentric loading of the muscle [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,27
         </a>
         ]. This typically occurs during a sudden push-off when an athlete initiates a sprint or jump, at which point the ankle rapidly changes from a plantarflexed position to a dorsiflexed position while the knee is fully extended or, in some situations, hyperextended. As an example, gastrocnemius strain occurs commonly in tennis players when they suddenly change directions to return a shot, which is why the term "tennis leg" is often applied to a medial head gastrocnemius injury [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with a gastrocnemius strain typically describe feeling a sudden tearing sensation or pop accompanied by acute pain in the proximal posterior calf that developed while they were running or jumping [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,27
         </a>
         ]. Patients have difficulty bearing weight and prefer to keep their ankle in plantarflexion and walk on their toes without moving the ankle so as to minimize discomfort. There may be intermittent cramping, which is worse with attempts at weightbearing.
        </p>
        <p>
         With severe strains, inspection of the patient's posterior calf often shows significant swelling and ecchymosis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,27
         </a>
         ]. Palpation of the proximal calf reveals significant tenderness, usually over the medial head of the gastrocnemius, and possibly a defect in the muscle belly. Active plantar flexion and passive dorsiflexion of the ankle elicit pain in the calf. The patient is unable to perform a single leg calf raise, but the Thompson squeeze test (performed to rule out Achilles tendon rupture) is negative  (

         Plantaris strains occur primarily with eccentric loading of the plantaris muscle that occurs during forceful dorsiflexion of the ankle while the knee remains in extension [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,28
         </a>
         ]. This movement typically happens when an athlete initiates a rapid change in direction with a forceful push-off, as occurs in basketball with jumping and pivoting or in tennis when lunging to make a shot. Up to 74 percent of athletes with these injuries may have associated findings of Achilles injury [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The examination findings of the patient with a plantaris muscle strain are similar to those of the patient with a gastrocnemius strain, including slight swelling, tenderness, and difficulty weightbearing [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,28,30
         </a>
         ]. However, symptoms are generally less severe (in part because the plantaris plays a relatively minor functional role and has a limited vascular supply that produces less bleeding with injury) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. With a plantaris strain, pain and tenderness are located in the region around the mid-Achilles tendon rather than the proximal calf, and no muscle or tendon defect is palpable. Most patients can dorsiflex and plantarflex their ankle without significant discomfort. The Thompson squeeze test is negative  (

         The plantaris tendon travels in a plane between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and the soleus, inserting on the medial Achilles tendon approximately 5 to 7 cm above the calcaneus. The plantaris tendon can tear partially or completely at any point along its length [

Patients complain of the insidious onset of deep soreness throughout the entire posterior calf. There are no palpable muscle defects. Pain is elicited by flexing the knee and dorsiflexing the ankle simultaneously. Patients with more severe strains have pain with passive testing of the same movements. For those with a suggestive history but unimpressive static examination, performing repetitive heel raises on a step while maintaining the knees in 20 degrees of flexion isolates the soleus muscle and often elicits tightness or pain deep in the calf.

          31

         Pain from popliteal tendinopathy may present as acute or chronic posterolateral knee pain made worse by walking or running downhill [

In addition, the Garrick test may be used to elicit pain from popliteal tendinopathy. In this test, the patient lies supine with their knees and hips flexed to 90 degrees. The test is positive if resisted internal rotation of the knee or passive external rotation of the knee elicits pain at the popliteal tendon. Although a positive Garrick test is suggestive, its accuracy is unknown.

         The popliteal tendon assists other structures in the posterolateral corner in stabilizing the lateral knee.

         Popliteal artery entrapment occurs most often due to a congenital anomaly that causes the medial or lateral gastrocnemius head to shift toward the popliteal artery during knee flexion, thereby compressing the artery [

         <a href="#rid37">
          37-39
         </a>
         ]. The cause appears to be repetitive overuse that gradually causes pathological thickening of vessel walls in the popliteal artery as a response to excessive pressure from the muscle belly. In bicyclists, the injury appears to be associated with repetitive knee flexion during extended rapid pedaling.
        </p>
        <p>
         The patient with popliteal artery entrapment typically complains of pain deep in the calf that develops only after an intense workout involving repeated ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion (eg, cycling, running, marching up and down hills). These symptoms may resemble those of calf claudication. During exercise, the patient may experience paresthesias across the proximal posterior calf, while immediately following exercise, he or she may notice a pale, discolored foot and toes. At all other times, the patient typically has no pain, and the examination at rest is normal. Hypertrophied calf muscles may be noted. (See

         Assessment of distal pulses is a key part of the examination for this condition. Palpate the lower extremity pulses (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis) to determine whether they are diminished at baseline; it is often helpful to compare the affected and unaffected limbs. Then, palpate the pulses while the patient performs active plantarflexion and passive dorsiflexion of the ankle, while the knee remains in extension. One helpful examination technique is to have the patient stand on a step in the examination room and perform heel raises, repeatedly raising and lowering his foot above and below the level of the step, while the clinician palpates the distal pulses. The presence of a decreased pulse during such maneuvers suggests the diagnosis.

         During the examination, the popliteal artery should be palpated for an aneurysm. Popliteal aneurysm is extremely rare in young individuals, although pseudo-aneurysms have been associated with trauma to the popliteal fossa and can be delayed in presentation. Popliteal aneurysm is relatively common in older men, and in an older athlete with a history and symptoms suggesting popliteal artery entrapment, a careful assessment to exclude aneurysm, possibly including ultrasound, is needed [

         Plain radiographs are typically not needed when the diagnosis of a muscle injury is reasonably certain based upon the history and physical examination and no other significant injuries are suspected. When the diagnosis is not certain and other injuries (particularly fractures) are possible, most clinicians obtain plain radiographs of the tibia, fibula, and knee. For patients with pain involving the distal leg and calf, radiographs of the ankle may also be needed. These studies may reveal bony abnormalities and can rule out most fractures and calcific tendinosis.

The examiner can repeat the ultrasound in two to three weeks to assess healing if patient symptoms and function are not progressing as expected.

         Plantaris muscle tears most often occur deep to the intersection of the medial and lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscles in the mid-posterior calf. An ultrasound probe placed in a longitudinal position may reveal a small hypoechoic defect that lies in the plane between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and the soleus. Sometimes, the retracted plantaris tendon can be visualized. A less common location for a plantaris tear is along the medial border of the Achilles tendon, about 5 cm proximal to the calcaneal insertion, where the plantaris tendon merges with the Achilles. These tears appear as a discrete hypoechoic swelling located at the Achilles tendon border and are often better visualized with ultrasound images in the transverse plane [

          22,49
         </a>
         ]. In acute injury, a small focal tear or localized region of hypoechoic change in the muscle typically is found at the area of maximal tenderness in the calf. Chronic soleus strain causes generalized hypoechoic change throughout the muscle. Increased Doppler flow or the presence of neovessels suggests acute inflammation [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Some investigators have found that ultrasound is much less sensitive for soleus injury than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but this may be related to the timing of the scan and the quality of the study [

          50

         Ultrasound can be used to assess a number of other calf injuries. As an example, popliteal tendinopathy can be seen as a tendon with surrounding hypoechoic fluid on a transverse image of the tendon ("bulls-eye" appearance) as it passes through the popliteal groove [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Splits in the tendon may be seen by using a longitudinal probe position at the posterolateral joint line. If the tendon cannot be visualized in the popliteal groove, this suggests that the ruptured tendon is retracted.

         In professional sport, MRI is playing an increasing role as a tool for helping to determine when an athlete can return to play. MRI patterns that suggest a prolonged recovery following calf injury include involvement of multiple muscles, deep tissue injury involving the soleus, large fascial defects, and tears at a musculotendinous junction [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. The area of muscle damage found on MRI can vary with the timing of the scan and does not correlate clearly with the time needed for return to play. One prospective observational study reported that extension of edema on MRI suggests a slower return from soleus injury [
         <a href="#rid15">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In one retrospective study of 100 consecutive athletes with 114 calf muscle tears, MRI findings of connective tissue injury correlated closely with the time required for return to play [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. Athletes were rated from 0 (no connective tissue injury) to 3 (complete disruption). Those with a grade 0 injury returned to play in eight days, grade 1 in 17 days, grade 2 in 25 days, and grade 3 in 48 days. These results suggest that damage to the connective tissue may prove to be highly predictive of time needed for return to play. One limitation of MRI studies is that most focus on elite athletes, and results may not be generalizable to recreational athletes and others.

The remainder of the knee examination is unremarkable. Ultrasound can help to confirm the diagnosis.

         Definitive diagnosis of popliteal artery entrapment requires advanced imaging with magnetic resonance arteriography, computed tomography (CT) arteriography, or standard arteriography. In some hospitals, Doppler ultrasound is used to make the diagnosis. The diagnosis is suggested by a history of claudication-type symptoms brought on by intense exercise requiring repeated dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the ankle, but which improve with rest. During exercise, the patient may experience paresthesias and cold feet or toes. During passive dorsiflexion or active plantarflexion of the ankle (performed with the knee in extension), distal pulses are often diminished [

         Surgery for an isolated posterior calf muscle injury is rarely necessary. Suspicion of an acute compartment syndrome warrants immediate orthopedic consultation. Vascular surgery consultation is needed for popliteal artery entrapment. Sural nerve entrapment may require surgical intervention to remove pressure on the nerve if conservative therapy fails.

          Achilles tendinopathy
         </strong>
         – Patients with noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy present with gradually increasing pain located approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion onto the calcaneus. The pain is usually associated with an increase in exercise or athletic training; the discomfort, often described as a burning sensation, increases with activity and improves with rest. Examination of the prone patient reveals focal tenderness of the tendon 2 to 6 cm from the Achilles insertion with no palpable muscle or tendon defects. The history and the location of pain and tenderness are typically sufficient to distinguish Achilles tendinopathy from calf muscle strains. Imaging with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful in the diagnosis of acute tendinopathy, but neither is as sensitive for chronic tendinopathy (symptoms lasting over three months).

          Achilles tendon tear
         </strong>
         – Acute Achilles tendon rupture typically occurs in middle-aged adults during recreational sports when they suddenly change direction or accelerate (eg, jump, sprint). These patients often feel as if they were hit in the back of the calf and occasionally hear a "pop." Pain ranges from mild to severe. Examination reveals a palpable tendon defect and tenderness at the site of the tear. Most patients with complete tears cannot plantarflex their ankle, but clinicians must be cautious because some patients are able to plantarflex using accessory muscles. The Thompson squeeze test is positive in most complete tears  (

          Chronic exertional compartment syndrome

         – Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) typically presents in young athletes, often runners, who describe gradually increasing pain in a specific region of the leg, often deep within the calf or shin, during exertion. Pain is often bilateral, generally begins within several minutes of starting the inciting activity, and resolves within 10 to 20 minutes of stopping. The pain may be accompanied by paresthesias of the foot and ankle. Examination at rest is often unremarkable in contrast to patients with acute calf muscle strains. CECS is diagnosed definitively by measuring intracompartmental pressures. (See

Distal lower extremity pulses are usually diminished, as is the ankle brachial index. Symptoms and signs may not differ from those of popliteal artery entrapment. Factors that favor the diagnosis of claudication include age over 50, risk factors for cardiovascular disease (particularly a smoking history), and stigmata of cardiovascular disease (eg, hypertension, bruits, diminished pulses in multiple extremities).

         Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) presents with worsening pain and swelling in the posterior calf. Usually, there is no history of activity to suggest acute muscle injury, although there are a few case reports of DVT developing following a calf injury sustained during intense physical activity [

The presence of risk factors for venous thrombosis (eg, recent trauma or surgery, history of prior DVT or cancer, coagulopathy, pregnancy), more generalized swelling than typically occurs with an acute calf muscle strain, and the absence of any specific area of focal tenderness all suggest DVT. DVT is potentially life-threatening, and an appropriate workup must be performed if the diagnosis is suspected. (See

         Swelling following trauma, hypertrophied muscle, ganglions, or other lesions can place pressure on peripheral nerves, causing the symptoms associated with nerve entrapment. The absence of a history of acute injury, or the physical findings associated with injury such as swelling and ecchymosis, helps to distinguish entrapment from gastrocnemius and other calf muscle strains. Rarely, nerve entrapments cause tenderness to palpation, but the pain elicited tends to be neuropathic (eg, sharp, tingling) and associated with distal radiation. The paresthesias and pain that increase with physical activity may improve with rest.

        <p>
         The two nerve entrapments that most commonly cause painful symptoms in the calf involve the sural nerve and the peroneal nerve posterior to the fibular head. In some cases, ultrasound imaging over the nerve's distribution may reveal scar tissue, ganglions, or other anatomic lesions causing the nerve impingement. Further evaluation with a nerve conduction test or diagnostic imaging (eg, ultrasound, MRI) is needed to make the diagnosis and find the location of the entrapment [

         Peroneal nerve entrapments generally result in motor deficits. The more extreme injuries result in foot drop. Milder injuries may cause varying degrees of weakness in dorsiflexion or eversion of the foot. When the entrapments are caused by a peroneal ganglion, patients may feel tightness in the upper lateral calf behind the fibular head. Weakness in dorsiflexion or eversion helps to distinguish the condition from lateral gastrocnemius injury, which primarily affects plantar flexion strength [

        <p>
         Sural nerve entrapment is often caused by thickening of the aponeurosis through which the sural nerve passes or scar tissue from a lateral gastrocnemius injury, either of which creates pressure on the sural nerve. More distal entrapment can be caused by a distal gastrocnemius injury, recurrent ankle sprains, pressure from footwear, fifth metatarsal fractures, or overdeveloped calf muscles, as may be seen in bodybuilders [

If pain is severe, the patient may need a tall walking boot and crutches to assist with ambulation. Heel lifts decrease the stretch of the calf muscles, thereby reducing pain, and may be beneficial initially. The patient should apply ice to the injured area four times per day for 20 minutes at a time until swelling subsides. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication or

         At the initial visit, measure the circumference of the injured calf. This measurement can be used during follow-up visits to assess the resolution of deep swelling. Clinicians facile with ultrasound can image the calf to determine the extent of the injury and the size of any hematoma. Ultrasound can also be used serially to confirm the clinical assessment of healing. Significant calf trauma is a risk factor for acute compartment syndrome and deep vein thrombosis, so patients should be warned about these potential (albeit rare) complications and told to seek medical care immediately if there is any significant increase in their pain or they develop shortness of breath or any other concerning symptom.

         There are few trials and no practice guidelines to inform the treatment of calf injuries. The approach described below is based upon the available evidence and the authors' clinical experience managing such injuries. Imaging is optional in most cases, but the authors prefer to use ultrasound for diagnosis, as described above, and to guide management.

         The initial decision with a gastrocnemius injury is to determine whether it is severe or mild to moderate. A gastrocnemius strain is considered severe if the patient cannot walk (ie, requires crutches) or the injury is associated with marked swelling or severe pain. For severe injuries, our approach to treatment involves a six-week progression of exercises (described below). However, patients progress at different rates depending upon their age, baseline level of fitness, and other characteristics. At each visit, we perform a clinical assessment to determine subsequent treatment. If the patient has not made sufficient progress, we delay the next steps in our treatment protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
         For mild to moderate gastrocnemius injuries and for plantaris and soleus injuries, which are at lower risk for delayed healing and complications, we use an accelerated rehabilitation and treatment approach (described below). At the initial visit for patients with milder calf injuries, we observe the patient's walking gait. If there is no limp with walking and pain is minimal, we have the patient add heel lifts to their shoes and don a calf compression wrap and then see if they can do some light jogging at a slow pace without causing significant pain. If they can, we may also ask them to perform a one-legged heel raise on a step. The ability to do this without significant pain indicates a truly mild injury. For confirmed mild injuries, we use the protocol for milder injuries described below, which often allows a return to moderate training in three to four weeks, rather than the six to eight weeks required with more severe injuries. Plantaris injuries in particular heal relatively quickly in most instances. Complete tears of the plantaris tendon can take up to 14 days to heal, but partial tears typically heal within a few days. Even elite athletes often return to sport in less than two weeks with aggressive physical therapy [
         <a href="#rid65">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As soon as the patient can perform a proper heel raise, we have them begin an eccentric exercise program using the Alfredson exercise protocol, which has been studied primarily for the rehabilitation of Achilles tendinopathy. Subsequent studies of Achilles tendinopathy treatment suggest that patients respond equally well to heavy, slow resistance exercise that emphasizes both concentric and eccentric contraction, but further research is needed to confirm this approach. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/190.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The initial treatment for popliteal tendinopathy is to avoid downhill walking and jogging. If hyperpronation of the foot is noted, orthotics can be used to prevent this contributing factor. A strength program can be implemented to address any weaknesses identified in the quadriceps, hamstrings, hip flexors, or hip abductors [

         Stretching exercises do
         <strong>
          not

         aid healing and should be avoided during rehabilitation; stretching can exacerbate the muscle tears sustained at the time of injury. The use of eccentric strength exercises (eg, Alfredson protocol for Achilles tendinopathy) during the later phases of rehabilitation allows affected muscles to lengthen as effectively as stretching. Patients who have difficulty implementing a home exercise program or who fear reinjury may need additional guidance and encouragement from a physical therapist.

         Any patient with a severe gastrocnemius strain should follow up within one week. A gastrocnemius strain is considered severe if the patient cannot walk (ie, requires crutches), or the injury is associated with marked swelling or severe pain. At the first follow-up visit, the clinician determines if swelling has subsided and can repeat an ultrasound examination to assess the size of the tear and any hematoma. Identification of a significant hematoma on ultrasound indicates a need to continue regular icing and use of a compression sleeve  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93197" href="/z/d/graphic/93197.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ), and to use a more gradual timetable for introducing full weight-bearing and rehabilitation exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional interventions depend upon the patient's symptoms and functional capacity. If possible, the patient should stop using crutches. Once they can walk without a significant limp, the patient should start taking walks three times each day for 10 minutes at a time. If they can perform a heel raise standing on both legs without undue pain, the patient should start performing this exercise regularly, starting with a single set of five to eight repetitions performed with the knees bent, and then repeating this with the knees straight. Gradually, the patient may increase the number of sets and repetitions, assuming these can be performed pain-free, with the ultimate goal of being able to perform three sets of 15 repetitions with the knees straight, and then repeating this with the knees bent. The patient should continue wearing a compression sleeve on the affected calf, using heel lifts, and applying ice four times per day for 20 minutes at a time until swelling subsides.
        </p>
        <p>
         Stretching exercises do not aid healing and should be avoided during rehabilitation; stretching can exacerbate the muscle tears sustained at the time of injury.

         If the patient demonstrates steady improvement in symptoms and function at the three-week follow-up visit, they should begin performing the Alfredson protocol for Achilles tendon injury. This protocol is described in detail separately and summarized in the accompanying table  (

         When the patient is able to perform eccentric heel drops for three sets of 15 repetitions on one leg, he or she may begin easy running every other day on a level surface, not to exceed 15 to 20 minutes per session. Additional aerobic exercise can be done on a bicycle or stationary bicycle. Knowledgeable clinicians can monitor a patient's clinical progress with ultrasound.

         If the patient continues to demonstrate meaningful progress at the six-week follow-up visit, allow them to start running for longer times and distances, but still on a level surface. As a rule of thumb, increases in running volume should not exceed five minutes per session during a given week, and no more than one additional running day should be added each week. As an example, if the patient ran three times for 20 minutes each session during week one, they could increase this to four times for 25 minutes each session during week two.
        </p>
        <p>
         The patient should continue to perform heel raise exercises as per the final stage of the Alfredson protocol. Ultrasound can be used to establish if the injury is fully healed. Be sure to observe the patient's running gait to be sure there is no limp or other sign of discomfort. In most cases, 8 to 12 weeks are required for the patient to return to full sports activity. The patient should continue to use heel lifts and compression sleeves during activity for the first three months after their return. Thereafter, we leave it up to the patient whether they wish to continue using them.

         Patients with popliteal tendinopathy are encouraged to start jogging on a soft flat surface, such as a track, and to avoid hills. Those who have difficulty recovering from popliteal tendinopathy or strain often benefit from physical therapy, in which they perform non-weightbearing and weightbearing exercises [

        <p>
         For milder cases of popliteus tendinopathy, we prescribe a home exercise program featuring modified lunges performed at three different angles. To perform the lunges, the patient starts with the legs spread to shoulders width and the affected leg approximately 18 inches (0.5 m) behind the stance leg. The patient then steps forward on a diagonal approximately 30 degrees toward the affected side five times, followed by stepping directly forward five times, and finally stepping forward across the body toward the unaffected side five times. This total of 15 repetitions (five in each orientation) constitutes one set. At the end of each lunge (ie, forward position), the knee should be flexed approximately 45 degrees; the torso should remain upright throughout the exercise. We ask the patient to perform three sets of this exercise twice daily. When this can be done without difficulty or pain, we have the patient increase the resistance by adding weight to a barbell held on the shoulders. We typically begin with about 20 pounds (approximately 10 kg) and progress to about 60 pounds (approximately 28 kg).

         Complications from a posterior calf muscle injury occur rarely. The most dangerous are acute compartment syndrome and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These are described in detail separately. Rare complications include myositis ossificans and contracture of the knee and ankle secondary to scar tissue [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. More common complications include residual calf atrophy and mild weakness. Some individuals complain of chronic tightness or sharp pain that recurs during exercise. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Compartment syndromes involving the leg are caused by far more severe trauma than is typically sustained by laborers or athletes. DVT risk varies among individual patients. Those who are older and have more of the known risk factors for DVT warrant careful consideration. Several case reports describe DVT developing after a calf injury sustained from distance running and other sports activity [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57-59
         </a>
         ]. Some but not all of these individuals have an unsuspected risk factor (eg, undiagnosed malignancy) that contributes to hypercoagulability [

         Calf muscle injuries typically do not predispose to myositis ossificans, although there are rare case reports [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72

         The large majority of calf muscle injuries heal uneventfully. The healing time for posterior calf muscle injuries not requiring surgery ranges from 3 to 16 weeks. Patients take longer to recover if they have complete tears, more extensive muscle injury, large hematomas, or older age [

          Mechanism of injury
         </strong>
         – Calf muscle and tendon injuries typically occur during sudden ballistic movements involving the lower extremity, such as sprinting or jumping, in sports where these movements are common, such as tennis, football (soccer), basketball, American football, and running on hills. Calf muscle strains usually occur when the muscles are not warmed up properly or have fatigued significantly during exercise. The medial head of the gastrocnemius plays a major role in generating power when athletes jump or sprint, and injuries of the medial head are relatively common. The soleus, popliteal, and plantaris muscles may also be injured. Injuries of the Achilles tendon are discussed separately. (See

          Gastrocnemius injury
         </strong>
         – Gastrocnemius injuries typically occur during a sudden push-off when an athlete initiates a sprint or jump, at which point the ankle rapidly moves from plantarflexed to dorsiflexed. A common example is a tennis player who suddenly changes direction to return a shot. Patients typically describe feeling a sudden tearing sensation or pop accompanied by acute pain in the proximal posterior calf that developed while they were running or jumping. Patients have difficulty bearing weight and prefer to keep their ankle in plantarflexion to minimize discomfort. With severe strains, inspection of the patient's posterior calf often shows significant swelling and ecchymosis. Palpation of the proximal calf reveals significant tenderness, usually over the medial head of the gastrocnemius, and possibly a defect in the muscle belly. Active plantar flexion and passive dorsiflexion of the ankle elicit pain. The patient is unable to perform a single leg calf raise, but the Thompson squeeze test (performed to rule out Achilles tendon rupture) is negative  (

          Plantaris injury
         </strong>
         – The history (sudden ballistic movement involving ankle dorsiflexion) and the examination findings (slight swelling, tenderness, difficulty weightbearing) of plantaris muscle strain are similar to gastrocnemius strain. However, symptoms are generally less severe, and pain and tenderness are located in the region around the mid-Achilles tendon rather than the proximal calf. No muscle or tendon defect is palpable; most patients can dorsiflex and plantarflex their ankle without significant discomfort. (See

          Soleus injury
         </strong>
         – Soleus strains are usually chronic injuries that develop from overuse, primarily in distance runners. Patients complain of the insidious onset of deep soreness throughout the entire posterior calf. There are no palpable muscle defects. Pain is elicited by flexing the knee and dorsiflexing the ankle simultaneously. Patients with more severe strains have pain with passive testing of the same movements. (See

          Popliteal tendinopathy
         </strong>
         – Popliteal tendinopathy is usually an overuse injury caused by downhill running. Pain from popliteal tendinopathy may present as acute or chronic posterolateral knee pain made worse by walking or running downhill. Tenderness can often be elicited by placing the affected leg in a figure-of-four position and palpating the origin of the popliteal tendon just anterior to the lateral femoral condyle or by performing the Garrick test (described in the text).

Common ultrasound findings are described in the text. Advanced imaging is needed to diagnose popliteal artery entrapment. (See
