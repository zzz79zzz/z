Care should be provided by a specialized center capable of intensive management of anticoagulation during pregnancy and delivery. Given the absence of adequate prospective controlled trials and the differing maternal and fetal risks associated with various anticoagulants, the optimum anticoagulant regimen is uncertain [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>].

The risk of developing thromboembolic complications during pregnancy should be balanced against the risk of maternal and fetal complications of anticoagulation during pregnancy and delivery. A woman's individual risk of thromboembolic complications is estimated based upon the type of anticoagulant used during pregnancy, the number, type, size, and site of the mechanical valve, and other factors, such as previous thromboembolic complications. Pregnant women with mechanical valves should be fully informed about the importance of therapeutic anticoagulation throughout pregnancy and the maternal and fetal risks associated with each anticoagulant regimen. The patient's values and preferences inform decision making in this setting. The patient should participate in and agree with decisions about the treatment regimen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113664.html" rel="external">"Management of risks of prosthetic valves during pregnancy", section on 'Prosthetic valve thrombosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111633.html" rel="external">"Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, and obstruction: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Our approach to anticoagulation in this setting is in broad agreement with recommendations in the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) valvular heart disease guideline [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].

Of note, there is variation in clinical practice in this setting, with some clinicians administering low-dose aspirin only during periods of heparin anticoagulation (LMWH or UFH). Recommendations for low-dose aspirin use (in addition to anticoagulation) for pregnant women with prosthetic valves have varied, given limited evidence on its use in this setting. The 2020 ACC/AHA valve guidelines note that low-dose aspirin can be continued in pregnant patients with mechanical valves if needed for other indications [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In contrast, the 2018 ESC guidelines for management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy do not recommend the addition of low-dose aspirin to anticoagulation (with VKA or heparin) in patients with mechanical valves, citing the potential risk of hemorrhage [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

A plan for anticoagulation in labor/peripartum should be agreed to by obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and hematologists and documented clearly. The risks of valve thrombosis and obstetric hemorrhage as well as the desire to use regional anesthesia need to be balanced and the patient fully informed of the rationale for the individualized plan.
