The leg is the most frequently affected site in the lower extremity requiring fasciotomy [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Although less common, acute compartment syndrome can occur in the thigh, buttock, and foot [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>]. In addition, patients who suffer from chronic compartment lower extremity syndromes may also benefit from fasciotomy.</p><p>For acute compartment syndrome, failure to recognize and decompress the muscular compartments in a timely fashion can compromise the extremity or the patient's life. The indications for and techniques of lower extremity fasciotomy for emergent fasciotomy of the leg, thigh, buttock, and foot will be reviewed here. Alternative techniques for chronic compartment syndromes are briefly discussed. Patient management following fasciotomy, including wound care, is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15660.html" rel="external">"Patient management following extremity fasciotomy"</a>.)</p><p>The clinical evaluation and diagnostic criteria for acute compartment syndrome and chronic exertional compartment syndrome are discussed in separate reviews.

These etiologies are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116596.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology, classification, and causes of acute extremity compartment syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4771231"><span class="h2">Acute compartment syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fasciotomy is indicated for clinical evidence of acute compartment syndrome (impending or established) that may be supported by objective evidence of elevated compartment pressure in some cases  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114715" href="/z/d/graphic/114715.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The pathophysiology and classification of acute extremity compartment syndrome, as well as clinical features and diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome, including measurement of compartment pressure, are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/358.html" rel="external">"Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116596.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology, classification, and causes of acute extremity compartment syndrome", section on 'Classification'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1913587738"><span class="h3">Impending</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With impending compartment syndrome, symptoms may not be classic and compartment pressure may not meet criteria for acute compartment syndrome, but there is a high probability of a compartment syndrome evolving over time. Fasciotomy is performed earlier in the course in this population based on the clinical judgment that a compartment is highly likely to develop. Fasciotomy should be performed immediately upon worsening of the symptoms among those in whom careful monitoring has been elected. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2567209045"><span class="h3">Established</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For early established acute compartment syndrome, the following indicate the need for fasciotomy [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obvious clinical diagnosis of acute lower extremity acute compartment syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated compartment pressure: &gt;30 mmHg or 30 mmHg below diastolic blood pressure. Using the diastolic blood pressure as a reference point for compartment pressures may provide increased diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of established acute compartment syndrome. A compartment less than 30 mmHg below diastolic blood pressure is an indication for fasciotomy [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. As an example, for a patient with a systemic blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, a compartment pressure exceeding 40 mmHg is indicative of an established acute compartment syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/358.html" rel="external">"Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities"</a>.). </p><p></p><p>Patients with late established acute compartment syndrome are not likely to have any functional benefit from fasciotomy. Some surgeons regard cases with late diagnosis or missed diagnosis as an absolute contraindication to fasciotomy based on a perceived increased risk of postoperative infection. In some cases, however, late intervention may serve a purpose by debriding necrotic tissue and preventing the contracture of the joints. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3494669488"><span class="h3">Prevention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In many patients without the above indications for fasciotomy, progression will not occur and fasciotomy will not be needed. Ideally, careful clinical assessment and compartment pressure monitoring will indicate progression and the need for fasciotomy in the patient at risk for but without impending or established compartment syndrome. However, monitoring for a compartment syndrome is resource intensive and requires skilled clinicians in a monitored or intensive care setting. Nursing staff should not be relied upon to recognize acute compartment syndrome. Moreover, when a compartment syndrome is diagnosed, it can take some time to get a patient into an open, staffed operating room in many centers. Thus, in selected cases it may be better to perform a "prophylactic" fasciotomy if there is a high risk of progression to acute compartment syndrome, rather than taking the risk of delayed diagnosis or surgical delay once acute compartment syndrome has become established. Whether complications are reduced or outcomes are improved for prophylactic fasciotomy compared with waiting until a compartment syndrome is definitively diagnosed is debated. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes'</a> below.) </p><p>Prophylactic fasciotomy should be considered prior to the development of elevated compartment pressure in patients undergoing certain vascular or orthopedic procedures in which a significant increase in extremity swelling, especially muscle swelling, is probable. Prophylactic fasciotomy is most often performed as an adjunct to another operation when there is no ability to examine the patient (since the patient is under general anesthesia), and for those at high risk for developing acute compartment syndrome in the postoperative period. In such cases, prophylactic fasciotomy should be performed in conjunction with the index operation, which prevents the need to return to the operating room. The techniques for prophylactic fasciotomy are the same as for emergent fasciotomy. (See <a class="local">'Open fasciotomy'</a> below.)</p><p>The need to perform prophylactic fasciotomy is not always easily defined in vascular patients because of potential problems with subsequent wound healing, or in orthopedic patients with hardware-related issues. </p><p>For vascular procedures, prophylactic fasciotomy may be indicated for patients when [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ischemic time is prolonged (eg, prolonged clamp time), but the severity of ischemia is probably a more important factor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute arterial occlusion is sudden in onset and collateral flow is not sufficient (eg, thromboembolism).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Combined arterial and venous injuries are present as seen in traumatic injuries.</p><p></p><p>For orthopedic procedures, prophylactic fasciotomy may be indicated for patients with [<a href="#rid14">14-17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comminuted fractures</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tibial fractures, especially those involving the diaphysis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fractures associated with arterial injury</p><p></p><p>The timely recognition of a postoperative acute compartment syndrome is predicated on the ability to perform serial examinations on a responsive, neurologically intact patient. Thus, prophylactic fasciotomy may be more appropriate in patients at risk for compartment syndrome but for whom a reliable clinical examination (altered mental status, neurologic deficit) cannot be performed. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4771359"><span class="h2">Chronic exertional compartment syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with chronic compartment syndromes (chronic anterior compartment syndrome, chronic exertional compartment syndrome) who fail conservative management or are unable to curtail their athletic activities may benefit from fasciotomy. The clinical features and compartment pressure criteria for the diagnosis of chronic compartment syndromes are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13859.html" rel="external">"Chronic exertional compartment syndrome", section on 'Clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13859.html" rel="external">"Chronic exertional compartment syndrome", section on 'Compartment pressure measurement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H428236833"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fasciotomy is contraindicated when the extremity is nonviable either due to multiple injuries or due to severe tissue ischemia. The duration of ischemia is often unknown and is unreliable for judging the degree of ischemia. Waxing and waning perfusion/hypoperfusion may have a worse prognosis compared with sudden complete hypoperfusion. Grade III extremity ischemia (irreversible) is generally a contraindication to revascularization and is clinically evident as a cold extremity with muscle rigor, complete neurologic deficit, and no audible Doppler signals. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8213.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia", section on 'Clinical presentations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15150.html" rel="external">"Severe lower extremity injury in the adult patient", section on 'Predicting limb loss'</a>.)</p><p>Crush injuries involving large muscle groups (eg, buttock, thigh) may be prone to life-threatening complications from reperfusion [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The magnitude of the reperfusion insult may be so severe that sudden cardiac arrest can occur as a consequence. To avoid this outcome, some authors have advocated primary amputation if profound ischemia is present for greater than 10 hours in a patient with limited collaterals. The rationale for this seemingly radical approach is based upon the potential for life-threatening complications, coupled with a low potential for functional recovery after prolonged, profound ischemia [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15660.html" rel="external">"Patient management following extremity fasciotomy", section on 'Ischemia-reperfusion'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15150.html" rel="external">"Severe lower extremity injury in the adult patient"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16956073"><span class="h1">COMPARTMENT ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The relationship of compartment anatomy to clinical symptoms is discussed elsewhere.

The medial and lateral plantar neurovascular bundles run along the longitudinal axis of the foot, and care must be taken not to inadvertently cause injury.

However, at times, a critically ill patient may be too unstable for transportation. Under these circumstances, fasciotomy can be undertaken in the intensive care unit with local anesthesia and conscious sedation as tolerated. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Instrumentation – In most cases, the only instruments required to perform a fasciotomy are a scalpel for the skin incision, electrocautery for the skin incision and hemostasis, and scissors for the fasciotomy. The type of scissors depends upon the anatomic location. For lower leg fasciotomy, a pair of large, blunt-tipped scissors (eg, Cooley or Metzenbaum) is ideal. Releasing compartments in the foot requires greater precision and a finer pair of scissors (eg, Jameson, Iris). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prophylactic antibiotics – Prior to fasciotomy, we recommend antibiotic prophylaxis to cover skin organisms, ideally one hour prior to the incision  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87206" href="/z/d/graphic/87206.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4044.html" rel="external">"Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One trial evaluated the use of antibiotics in 100 patients prior to leg fasciotomy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single preoperative dose of 200 mg <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9267" href="/z/d/drug information/9267.html" rel="external">ciprofloxacin</a> or no antibiotics [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The incidence of wound infection was significantly reduced in the group that received antibiotic prophylaxis (2.2 versus 12.9 percent). Prophylactic antibiotics are especially important since the risk of wound infection may be as high as 17 percent with patients who have trauma or burns at the highest risk of fasciotomy wound infection [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antithrombotic therapy – Fasciotomy can be performed safely in the face of antithrombotic therapy, although meticulous attention to technique and hemostasis are needed to minimize perioperative bleeding. Antiplatelet agents pose no contraindication to fasciotomy and may be beneficial in limiting thrombosis of the microcirculation. Among patients with vascular etiologies for acute compartment syndrome who are anticoagulated, it is preferable to continue therapy.

The available evidence comes from case series and retrospective reviews. It is our preference to manage acute compartment syndrome aggressively with techniques that include the use of generous skin incisions that are left open, generous fascial incisions, and opening any compartment affected by or at risk for developing compartment syndrome. Although it is tempting to limit the number of compartments to those with obviously elevated pressure, we advise fasciotomy on any muscle compartment within the zone of maximal ischemia or injury. One potential exception to this guideline relates to fasciotomy of the thigh, which is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Thigh fasciotomy'</a> below.) </p><p>The length of the lower extremity skin incisions for emergent fasciotomy has been the focus of considerable debate. Some surgeons use minimal skin incisions with more extensive fascial incisions when profound muscle swelling is not anticipated. However, this approach places the patient at risk for recurrent compartment syndrome. The degree of muscle swelling following reperfusion is due to many factors and may not be predictable at the time of surgery. Peak muscle edema following decompressive fasciotomy may not be fully evident for many hours after surgery. </p><p>One retrospective study observed that 12 percent of lower extremity fasciotomies performed with minimal incisions required reoperation to achieve complete decompression of the compartments [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Decreased compliance of the overlying stretched skin can maintain elevated compartment pressures. In a study of eight trauma patients, compartment pressures were measured while performing four-compartment leg fasciotomy [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The initial 8 cm skin incision reduced compartment pressure from an average of 48 to 25 mmHg. However, one third of the compartments treated had residually elevated pressures. Extension of the incisions to achieve an average 16 cm incision length resulted in a reduction of the compartment pressures to an average level of 13 mmHg [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1057132363"><span class="h3">Ischemia-reperfusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As each muscle compartment is opened, discoloration of the muscle, which may be focal or complete, confirms the presence of significant ischemia.

Metabolic acidosis from liberation of lactate may produce myocardial depression and hypotension, which is usually transient, but more persistent acidosis can occur. Release of potassium from necrotic and injured muscle may lead to significant hyperkalemia, which requires urgent treatment. In the operating room, it is prudent to forewarn the anesthesia team of the expected severity and timing of reperfusion, so that the patient is monitored and treated appropriately. Preemptive volume resuscitation and intravenous calcium may blunt the deleterious effects of acid and potassium, respectively, which are liberated during reperfusion. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3733412310"><span class="h3">Wound care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following fasciotomy, the skin is left open and the wounds are dressed with moist <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> gauze and wrapped with a loose bandage to maintain the dressings in place.

Both double-incision and single-incision techniques for leg fasciotomy have been described [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. There are no randomized trials to support one approach over the other, and retrospective studies have found no significant differences in overall outcomes between these two techniques. The double-incision fasciotomy is preferred by most surgeons due to its simplicity and improved exposure [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H284706545"><span class="h3">Double-incision fasciotomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The two-incision four-compartment fasciotomy uses medial and lateral longitudinal incisions that should be at least 12 to 20 cm in length. </p><p>The lateral incision of the double-incision fasciotomy is centered between the fibular shaft and the crest of the tibia  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80994" href="/z/d/graphic/80994.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). In this location, the incision overlies the intermuscular septum between the anterior and lateral compartments. In normal-weight patients, this septum is palpable as a subtle indentation approximately 4 to 5 cm lateral to the tibia. After the lateral incision has been made, skin and subcutaneous flaps are developed medially and laterally to expose the fascia of the intermuscular septum and the fascia of the anterior and lateral compartments  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70951" href="/z/d/graphic/70951.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). The intermuscular septum must be identified to ensure that both the anterior and lateral compartments are decompressed. The anterior compartment fascia is incised (electrocautery or scalpel). The fascial incisions are extended proximally and distally using scissors (eg, Metzenbaum, Cooley), taking care to sufficiently elevate the posterior blade of the scissors off the muscle to avoid cutting muscle-associated nerves. Once the anterior compartment is decompressed, the procedure is performed on the lateral compartment. Extension of the anterior or lateral fascial incisions too proximally can injure the common peroneal nerve or its superficial and deep branches. Termination of the proximal extent of the fasciotomy at a point 4 to 5 cm distal to the fibular head minimizes the risk of a nerve injury. </p><p>The medial incision of the double-incision fasciotomy is placed 1 to 2 cm medial to the tibial margin in a position similar to that used to expose the infrageniculate popliteal artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80994" href="/z/d/graphic/80994.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). The distal extent of the medial incision should be based on the extent of muscle swelling. In cases in which there is profound swelling, the incision should extend at least two thirds of the distance to the medial malleolus. The saphenous vein and nerve should be identified and retracted to avoid injury. Failure to identify the vein and nerve is a frequent cause of injury to these structures. The superficial posterior compartment is decompressed by incising the gastrocnemius fascia in a longitudinal direction from proximal to distal  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70951" href="/z/d/graphic/70951.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>).

The disadvantage of this approach is the difficulty visualizing the deep posterior compartment and, therefore, an increased risk of injury to the peroneal artery and nerve. Most surgeons find the double-incision technique simpler, more expeditious, and a safer method to decompress the leg. (See <a class="local">'Double-incision fasciotomy'</a> above.)</p><p>The single-incision technique uses a generous lateral leg incision 1 cm anterior to the fibula and parallel to it, extending from just inferior to the head of the fibula to 3 to 4 cm proximal to the lateral malleolus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80994" href="/z/d/graphic/80994.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>).

Both subcutaneous fasciotomy and fasciectomy have been used to open these compartments. Rather than opening all compartments, only those compartments with symptoms are treated. In most cases, symptoms affect the anterior and lateral compartments, and thus, treatment is targeted to these compartments. In a systematic review, two-compartment fasciotomy was equally effective compared with four-compartment fasciotomy for relieving symptoms [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. </p><p>In addition, minimally invasive techniques may be appropriate [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>]. Endoscopic-assisted compartment release has been advocated especially in young athletes with CECS. In addition to being less invasive compared with open fasciotomy, the superficial peroneal nerve can be directly seen and injury to it avoided (see <a class="local">'Neurovascular injury'</a> below). A small retrospective case series reported superior patient satisfaction with the endoscopic-assisted fasciotomy compared with open fasciotomy [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. </p><p>The techniques are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fasciotomy</strong> – Subcutaneous fasciotomy of the anterior and lateral compartments is performed using two skin incisions overlying the anterolateral lower leg  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59617" href="/z/d/graphic/59617.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>) [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. These incisions are oriented strategically at the proximal and distal ends of the planned fasciotomies in the anterior and lateral compartments.

Complications associated with the technical aspects of lower extremity fasciotomy are discussed below. Other associated complications are discussed elsewhere.

In one study, recurrent compartment syndrome due to incomplete fasciotomy was reported in 13 percent of patients undergoing leg fasciotomy [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Generous skin and fascial openings (12 to 20 cm) are needed to fully decompress the leg [<a href="#rid32">32-34</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Open fasciotomy'</a> above.)</p><p>Incomplete fasciotomy may result from two distinct technical errors. Either a compartment is inadequately decompressed, or it was not opened because the operating surgeon elected to forego fasciotomy of certain compartments based upon a perception that these compartments were at low risk for developing a compartment syndrome. As an example, a decision to perform a fasciotomy on the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg may be based upon elevated compartment pressures, but the posterior compartments are spared due to lower pressure measurements. The danger of this approach lies in an inability to predict the evolution of muscle swelling and therefore compartment pressures in the compartments that have not been decompressed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15660.html" rel="external">"Patient management following extremity fasciotomy", section on 'Ischemia-reperfusion'</a>.)</p><p>In other cases, the failure to decompress a muscle compartment may be unintentional. As an example, two parallel fasciotomies may have been performed within the same compartment, such as the anterior compartment of the lower leg, rather than in adjacent anterior and lateral compartments as intended. This technical error typically occurs because the intermuscular septum between the anterior and lateral compartments had not been identified at the time of the initial fasciotomy. With leg fasciotomies, one study found that the anterior and deep posterior compartments were the most likely to be unopened [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16956529"><span class="h2">Neurovascular injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Injuries to arteries and nerves due to technical issues are specific to the fasciotomy site.

The techniques described above can minimize the risk of peroneal nerve injury during fasciotomy. Namely, the lateral skin incision is best extended the full length of the fascial incisions, so the nerve underlying the fascia can be seen and protected. When the fasciotomy is performed beneath intact skin ("blindly"), the fascial incisions for the anterior and lateral compartments should be terminated 6 to 8 cm inferior to the fibular head, to avoid the peroneal nerve.

Failure to recognize acute compartment syndrome and decompress the muscle compartments in a timely fashion can compromise the extremity or lead to life-threatening complications. In the lower extremity, the leg is the site most commonly in need of fasciotomy, but the thigh, buttock, or foot can also be affected. Patients who suffer from chronic compartment syndromes may also benefit from fasciotomy. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Knowledge of lower extremity compartment anatomy and anatomic variation is important to ensure a complete fasciotomy and decrease the potential for neurovascular complications. In general, fasciotomy is accomplished by making a skin incision overlying a muscle compartment or group of compartments. The skin is reflected to expose the fascia of the compartment, and an incision is made in the fascia and extended longitudinally to fully open the fascia proximally and distally. (See <a class="local">'Compartment anatomy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Open fasciotomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We recommend prophylactic antibiotics prior to lower extremity fasciotomy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Although there is only one trial in this specific population, the incidence of surgical site infection is reduced with antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures that involve similar incisions. (See <a class="local">'Preparation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest an aggressive fasciotomy technique to treat lower extremity acute compartment syndrome that includes generous (12 to 20 cm) incisions with complete opening of the skin rather than minimal skin incisions (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The use of minimal incisions is associated with recurrent compartment syndrome, which requires a return to the operating room and worsens extremity outcomes. (See <a class="local">'Open fasciotomy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Incomplete fasciotomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest opening each of the four compartments of the leg when performing leg fasciotomy for acute compartment syndrome rather than selective compartment decompression (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Either a one- or two-incision technique can be used provided each of the four compartments is adequately decompressed at the completion of the procedure. (See <a class="local">'Leg fasciotomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest opening all compartments of the buttock or foot if the clinical presentation suggests an acute compartment syndrome of these anatomic sites (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). In contrast, thigh fasciotomy often requires only a single lateral incision to open the anterior and posterior compartment. Medial thigh fasciotomy may not be needed but should be performed if compartment pressures are elevated. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest not routinely performing prophylactic fasciotomy in anticipation of compartment syndrome (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Compartment pressures should be carefully monitored in patients at risk. However, patients undergoing certain orthopedic or vascular surgical procedures in which significant increases in extremity swelling are anticipated may benefit from prophylactic fasciotomy. (See <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fasciotomy is an effective treatment for patients with chronic compartment syndrome. The techniques used to decompress the compartments are similar to those used for acute compartment syndrome, although compartments are selectively decompressed and minimally invasive techniques can be used. (See <a class="local">'Alternative fasciotomy techniques for CECS'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Following surgical decompression, fasciotomy wounds are left open, dressed with moist saline-soaked gauze, and lightly wrapped to maintain the dressings in place. Skin closure is delayed to allow frequent wound inspection and interval muscle debridement, as needed. (See <a class="local">'Wound care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complications related to fasciotomy for acute compartment syndrome are most commonly a direct result of tissue ischemia caused by the increased compartment pressure. A delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute compartment syndrome significantly increases morbidity and mortality following fasciotomy. (See <a class="local">'Technical complications'</a> above and <a class="local">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Technical complications, including incomplete fasciotomy necessitating a return to the operating room, nerve injury, and muscle devascularization, can be minimized with meticulous surgical techniques. (See <a class="local">'Technical complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Velmahos GC, Theodorou D, Demetriades D, et al.
