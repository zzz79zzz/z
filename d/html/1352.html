         Individuals with cancer are at risk for thrombotic complications due to a hypercoagulable state. The spectrum of hemostatic abnormalities ranges from abnormal coagulation tests in the absence of clinical manifestations, to massive or fatal thromboembolism. Thrombosis may precede the diagnosis of malignancy by months, or it may only occur during treatment or hospitalization. Individuals with cancer may also have a higher risk of bleeding with anticoagulation, making decisions about the use of prophylactic anticoagulants more challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
         Here we discuss the risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which typically presents as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), in adults with cancer, as well as the primary prevention of VTE in these individuals. The following are discussed in detail separately:

         VTE is a common complication of malignancy. In most cases, thromboembolic events occur in the setting of a clinically evident malignancy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. However, some patients who present with VTE are only found to have a malignancy at the time the VTE occurs or months later. Despite the high frequency of VTE in individuals with cancer, it is important to remember that most individuals with cancer do not develop VTE.

         </span>
         Clinically apparent VTE occurs in as many as 10 percent of patients with cancer [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7
         </a>
         ]. Autopsy series have described even higher rates of thrombosis for certain tumor types. One study, for example, found evidence of thrombosis in 30 percent of patients who died of pancreatic cancer; the incidence was over 50 percent in those with tumors in the body or tail of the pancreas [
         <a href="#rid8">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The tumor type, location, stage, and time since diagnosis influence VTE risk, along with patient comorbidities and certain cancer therapies [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-16
         </a>
         ]. Our approach to estimating VTE risk distinguishes between individuals who are hospitalized or outpatient. Within those groups, risk is affected by the following factors:

         <strong>
          Tumor-specific factors
         </strong>
         – Tumor cells can express procoagulant activity that induces thrombin generation; in addition, the patient's non-cancerous tissues may express procoagulant activity in response to the tumor. Blood-borne tissue factor in microparticles may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hypercoagulable state accompanying cancer. (See

          factors
         </strong>
         – Some tumors increase VTE risk by externally compressing or directly invading large vessels. As examples, renal cell carcinoma infiltrates the inferior vena cava in 5 to 9 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]; hepatocellular carcinoma can compress or invade the hepatic vein; and large mediastinal tumors or bulky axillary lymphadenopathy can compress upper extremity veins, leading to thrombosis. Large abdominal/pelvic tumors can compress major veins leading to deep venous thrombosis in the legs [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19

         <strong>
          Patient-specific factors
         </strong>
         – VTE risk is increased in patients with prior VTE, advanced age, obesity, inherited thrombophilia, and non-O blood group [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,20-32
         </a>
         ]. Additional studies of individuals with cancer have confirmed a higher incidence of VTE in those with abnormal coagulation studies, including elevated D-dimer levels, peak thrombin generation, prothrombin fragment 1+2, tissue factor, and fibrinogen [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33-36
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, smoking does not appear to significantly increase risk. (See

          Therapy-associated factors
         </strong>
         – Some chemotherapy agents and high-risk surgeries (eg, large intraabdominal or pelvic procedures) increase VTE risk. (See

         The overall risk of VTE per patient is greater in inpatients, but the vast majority of VTE events occur in outpatients (around 80 percent) because most patients with cancer are treated in the outpatient setting [
         <a href="#rid37">

         An estimate of the magnitude of VTE risk in inpatients with cancer was obtained from a review of the records of eight million individuals in the United States over age 65 (patients receiving Medicare) who were admitted to a hospital between 1988 and 1990 [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Compared with those who did not have a malignancy, patients with a diagnosis of malignancy had a greater incidence of VTE during the initial hospitalization (0.60 versus 0.57 percent, a statistically significant difference). In this study, the malignancies with the highest rates of VTE were cancers of the ovary, brain, pancreas, and lymphoma [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Malignancies associated with the greatest absolute number of episodes of VTE were cancers of the lung, colon, and prostate, due to the relatively high frequency of these cancers in the population.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a Danish cohort of 57,591 individuals hospitalized with cancer, the incidence rates of VTE were highest in individuals with cancer of the pancreas, brain, liver, multiple myeloma, and any form of advanced-stage cancer (incidence rates: 41, 18, 20, 23, and 28, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Some cancer surgeries, especially large intraabdominal or pelvic procedures, are associated with a higher risk of VTE than other types of surgery (eg, mastectomy). This was demonstrated in a review of 43,808 cancer surgeries from a surgical database, which found that the risk of VTE was highest in patients undergoing esophagectomy, followed by cystectomy, pancreatectomy, gastrectomy, colectomy, lung cancer surgery, and hysterectomy [

         In this study, one-third of the VTE events occurred after hospital discharge, and 30-day mortality was more than sixfold higher in patients with VTE than in those without VTE (8.0 versus 1.2 percent, respectively). The high rates of VTE after hospital discharge and high VTE-associated mortality support a longer duration of postoperative anticoagulation in patients with cancer than that used for individuals without cancer.

         VTE is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in individuals with cancer in a variety of settings (eg, unresectable tumor, curative resection) [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43-46
         </a>
         ]. Causality has not been demonstrated, however; and VTE may be a marker rather than an independent risk factor for early mortality. High-quality data to support an improvement in mortality with anticoagulation are lacking. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Effects on survival'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         VTE-related deaths are especially common in those with exocrine pancreatic cancer. A systematic literature review of patients with pancreatic cancer reported VTE incidences from 5 to 36 percent, representing a 50-fold increase over the general population [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. One of the studies reported on 1915 patients with pancreatic cancer treated with chemotherapy, in which 690 (36 percent) developed a VTE [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Development of VTE, especially within 1.5 months of diagnosis, conferred a greater likelihood of death (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.5).
        </p>
        <p>
         Cancer-associated VTE is associated with a higher mortality than VTE in the population without cancer. This was shown in a review of eight million patients admitted to the hospital for VTE [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

         ]. Those with concurrent malignancy had a 94 percent probability of death within six months, whereas those without cancer had a 29 percent probability of dying within the same time period.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, arterial thrombosis can account for a substantial number of deaths in individuals undergoing chemotherapy. A review of 4466 ambulatory patients with cancer who were receiving chemotherapy reported that thrombosis was one of the three most common causes of death [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. The majority of the deaths related to thromboembolic disease were due to arterial thrombosis (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) rather than venous thromboembolism. Of the 141 deaths that occurred during chemotherapy administration (3.2 percent), the three leading causes of death were cancer progression (71 percent), infection (9 percent), and thromboembolic disease (9 percent total, 5.6 percent arterial, 3.5 percent venous).

         The decision to use anticoagulation for primary prevention takes into account the risk of VTE as well as the risk of bleeding from anticoagulants, costs of medication, and mode of administration, which may negatively impact quality of life (eg, need for injections). Patients are generally stratified according to whether they are inpatients hospitalized for an acute medical illness or surgery, or ambulatory outpatients. Individuals with cancer represent a particularly high-risk group in all of these settings. However, the benefit of prophylactic anticoagulation is unclear in many subsets of patients [

         As a general rule, we use short-term anticoagulation during periods of high risk (eg, hospitalization for acute medical illness, those with reduced mobility, and/or following major surgery), similar to patients without cancer. We do not use anticoagulation for individuals admitted for minor procedures or chemotherapy administration. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin,

         All individuals should have risk assessment for VTE and education regarding VTE risk. For ambulatory outpatients, anticoagulation has been reserved for those who have had a prior VTE and those with high-risk features. Two randomized trials evaluated the role of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

         A number of studies have evaluated the use of statins to decrease the risk of VTE in healthy adults, individuals with atherosclerosis, and others with mixed results. The effect of statins on reduction of VTE risk in patients with cancer was evaluated in a retrospective, case-control study of 740 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of a solid tumor followed for an average of 10.2 months (range: 2 to 41 months) [
         <a href="#rid51">

         The efficacy of thromboprophylaxis in the subset of hospitalized medical patients with cancer was evaluated in a systematic review of randomized trials that compared anticoagulation (LMW heparin or

          49

         ]. For the 307 patients in these trials with cancer, there was not a significantly reduced risk of VTE, and the pooled relative risk with anticoagulation was 0.91 (95% CI 0.21-4.0). However, this was a relatively small cohort in a subset analysis. It is possible that hospitalized patients with active cancer require higher anticoagulant doses with these agents than non-cancer patients to provide a similar reduction in VTE rates.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal duration of thromboprophylaxis was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 3655 patients with cancer (active or in the past) participating in one of four randomized trials (EXCLAIM, MAGELLAN, APEX, and MARINER) that compared extended-duration versus standard-duration thromboprophylaxis during hospitalization [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. Pooled analysis revealed that extended prophylaxis did not provide a statistically significant reduction in VTE risk relative to standard-duration thromboprophylaxis (odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.61-1.18). The rate of clinically relevant bleeding was twofold higher in the extended duration group (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.33-3.35); clinically relevant bleeding was defined as major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding based on International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. The increase in clinically relevant bleeding was mainly driven by data from MAGELLAN participants. A limitation of this meta-analysis was that the majority of patients in the trials had a history of cancer; the number with active cancer was relatively small.

         Hospitalized cancer patients without immobility may also benefit from pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis based on their increased VTE risk due to malignancy alone, if there is no active bleeding or contraindications to anticoagulant use. Individual patient bleeding and thromboembolic risks may be helpful in determining the appropriateness of anticoagulation in this setting.

         We generally use standard-duration thromboprophylaxis, unless there are extenuating circumstances (eg, individual with active cancer who has a prior history of VTE and low risk of bleeding; such an individual might receive full therapeutic-dose, rather than prophylactic-dose, anticoagulation).

         For patients with cancer who are hospitalized with an acute medical illness and require thromboprophylaxis, we suggest LMW heparin rather than a DOAC due to the lower risk of bleeding with LMW heparin. This lower risk has been demonstrated in large randomized trials such as MAGELLAN (

         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. As noted above, a meta-analysis of trials comparing LMW heparin versus placebo in patients with cancer found a trend towards increased risk of major bleeding that did not reach statistical significance (relative risk 1.30, 95% CI 0.94-1.79) [
         <a href="#rid62">

         The optimal duration of postoperative anticoagulation in patients with cancer is unknown, but it is likely to be longer than that for patients without cancer.

          33,34,40,75-81

        <p>
         For outpatients with cancer who are not receiving chemotherapy, risk assessment is individualized based on factors such as prior VTE and comorbidities that could increase risk (high body mass index [BMI], immobility).
        </p>
        <p>
         The Khorana score is calculated by assigning points for clinical parameters available for most patients (ie, site of primary tumor, hematologic parameters, and body mass index) (

          table 3

         ). It was derived in a cohort of 2701 patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy and validated in an independent cohort of 1365 patients [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. Patients were stratified into three risk groups to predict the development of VTE. The cumulative incidence of VTE at 2.5 months ranged from 0.3 percent to 6.7 percent in patients with the fewest and most risk factors, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most studies of the Khorana score evaluate the performance of the score over six months of observation, which often corresponds with the duration of chemotherapy. Evidence for the predictive value of the score in various cancer populations includes the following:

         The score was evaluated in a meta-analysis that determined VTE risk in nearly 35,000 ambulatory cancer patients who were followed for six months; most were retrospective analyses that included a number of tumor types [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82
         </a>
         ]. The majority of patients had a Khorana score of 1 or 2 (64 percent); the score was 0 in 19 percent and 3 or greater in 17 percent. Six-month VTE risk correlated with the score: those with a score of 0 had a risk of 5 percent; those with a score of 1 or 2 had a risk of 6.6 percent; and those with a score of 3 or greater had a risk of 11 percent. Because most of the patients had a score of 1 or 2, this group accounted for most of the events. The VTE risk for individuals with a score of 2 or greater (the criterion used in the AVERT and CASSINI trials (see
         <a class="local">
          'Evidence from clinical trials'

         Evidence from randomized trials has demonstrated that anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors or LMW heparin can reduce VTE risk in outpatients (see
         <a class="local">
          'Evidence from clinical trials'
         </a>
         below). At the same time, anticoagulation likely increases the risk of bleeding. Thus, the decision to use prophylactic anticoagulation is generally individualized according to the specific thrombotic and bleeding risks for the individual patient, along with the relative values placed on avoiding thrombosis and avoiding bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Until the trials with direct factor Xa inhibitors were available, guidelines published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and an international consensus group did not recommend routine VTE prophylaxis in ambulatory patients with cancer, except for those at very high risk of VTE (eg, multiple myeloma receiving

          'Evidence from clinical trials'

         below), updated guidelines from 2019 state that anticoagulation (

         Other considerations include the associated risks and burdens of continuing anticoagulation when the optimal duration is not well established  (

        <p>
         For most individuals at relatively low risk of VTE (eg, Khorana score &lt;2 in those receiving chemotherapy or negative history of VTE), we suggest not using anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis; however, secondary prophylaxis may be considered for selected patients such as those with a prior history of a major venous thromboembolic event if they are not chronically maintained on anticoagulation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are most likely to suggest anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in individuals at especially high VTE risk, as they are likely to have a greater absolute risk reduction. Examples include the following:

         – Two trials published in 2019 addressed the use of a direct factor Xa inhibitor in patients with a Khorana score ≥2 who were receiving chemotherapy. As noted above, the Khorana score assigns 2 points for pancreatic and gastric cancers; 1 point for several other high-risk tumors; and 1 point each for high white blood cell count, high platelet count, high body mass index, and low hemoglobin  (

          90

Compared with placebo, apixaban resulted in a 6 percent absolute risk reduction in VTE (from 10.2 percent with placebo to 4.2 percent with apixaban in a modified intention-to-treat analysis [number needed to treat 17]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.26-0.65; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.20-0.76). VTE events included one fatal pulmonary embolism in the placebo group. Apixaban was also associated with an increase in major bleeding (3.5 percent, versus 1.8 percent with placebo [number needed to harm 59]; absolute difference, 1.7 percent; HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.01-3.95). Most of the bleeding events were gastrointestinal, urinary, or gynecologic, and there was no fatal bleeding. However, the major bleed rate was not significantly higher during the treatment period (2.1 percent with apixaban and 1.1 percent with placebo, respectively [HR 1.89, 95% CI 0.39-9.24, number needed to harm 100]). Approximately one-fourth to one-fifth of patients in both arms were receiving an anti-platelet agent and one-fourth had gynecologic tumors. There were no other major treatment-related adverse events. Mortality was 12 percent with apixaban and 10 percent with placebo; most deaths were associated with cancer progression.

Compared with placebo, rivaroxaban resulted in a 2.8 percent absolute risk reduction in VTE (from 8.8 percent with placebo to 6 percent with rivaroxaban; HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.40-1.09) in the intention-to-treat analysis. Many of the thrombotic events, however, occurred when patients were off anticoagulation. In the pre-specified intervention period analysis, VTE occurred in 2.6 percent in the rivaroxaban group and 6.4 percent in the placebo group (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.80). Arterial thromboembolism occurred in 1.7 percent of placebo-treated patients and 1 percent of rivaroxaban-treated patients. Rivaroxaban was associated with an increase in major bleeding that did not reach statistical significance (2.0 percent, versus 1 percent with placebo; HR 1.96, 95% CI 0.59-6.49) and a reduction in mortality that barely reached significance (29.5 versus 23.1 percent; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.97). There was one fatal bleeding event in the rivaroxaban group.

         Taken together, data from these trials are consistent with the expected baseline risks of VTE and bleeding in this population and suggest that the absolute difference in VTE risk between the anticoagulant and placebo groups was 4 to 6 percentage points; the number needed to treat in the intention-to-treat analysis was 24; and the number needed to harm with major bleeding was 77 [
         <a href="#rid92">
          92

         ]. An editorialist noted some potential concerns with extrapolating these data to the general population, such as that the score does not take into account the specific chemotherapy regimen, most common types of cancer (colorectal, breast, prostate) were underrepresented in these trials, and the proportion of patients who completed the entire anticoagulant regimen was low, leading to significant equipoise regarding the implications for practice [
         <a href="#rid92">
          92

          VTE prophylaxis in outpatients

         – Evidence regarding the role of anticoagulation for primary prevention of VTE in outpatients with cancer is evolving. Anticoagulation has consistently been demonstrated to reduce VTE risk in randomized trials, with the absolute risk reduction dependent on the baseline risk of VTE. Bleeding risk is increased by anticoagulation. Thus, the decision to use prophylactic anticoagulation is individualized according to the patient's baseline risks of thrombosis and bleeding and the relative value they place on avoiding these risks. VTE risk assessment can be quantified using the Khorana score (

         However, individuals with a higher baseline risk (eg, Khorana score ≥3, or Khorana score ≥2 with a high value placed on avoiding VTE) may reasonably choose anticoagulation, using either a direct factor Xa inhibitor such as
