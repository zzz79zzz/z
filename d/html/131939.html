The role of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI; also known as transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is established, and in 2019, the number of TAVIs exceeded SAVRs in the US for the first time [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A multidisciplinary team approach is recommended in approaching patients with symptomatic AS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83110.html" rel="external">"Choice of intervention for severe calcific aortic stenosis"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review antithrombotic therapy post-TAVI. Indications for AVR, choice of aortic valve intervention (TAVI versus SAVR), TAVI periprocedural care (including anticoagulation during the procedure), medical therapy for symptomatic AS, and percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty are discussed separately.

If intermediate-term DAPT is chosen, it is continued for the first six months (for the SAPIEN valve) or for the first three months (for the Evolut R/PRO/PRO-PLUS valve).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients post-TAVI with an indication for subtherapeutic anticoagulation (eg, low-dose heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis) and no concurrent indication for DAPT, we suggest SAPT rather than DAPT.</p><p></p><p>The SAPT approach is based upon evidence that post-TAVI DAPT increases bleeding risk without improving clinical outcomes compared with SAPT. Support for this approach comes from a randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing TAVI without a concurrent indication for anticoagulation at the time of the procedure [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This trial found lower bleeding risk and similar stroke risk at one year with SAPT compared with DAPT for the three months following the procedure. A bleeding event occurred less frequently in the 331 patients receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> alone compared with the 334 patients receiving aspirin plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> (15.1 versus 26.6 percent; risk ratio [RR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.42-0.77). The frequency of stroke was similar in the two groups (5.1 versus 5.7 percent; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50-1.82). A secondary composite 1 event (composite of death from cardiovascular causes, non–procedure-related bleeding, stroke, or myocardial infarction) occurred less frequently in patients receiving aspirin alone compared with those receiving aspirin plus clopidogrel (23.0 versus 31.1 percent; 95% CI for superiority 0.57-0.95). A secondary composite 2 event (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, ischemic stroke, or myocardial infarction) occurred at similar rates in the two groups (9.7 versus 9.9 percent; 95% CI for superiority 0.62-1.55). The risk of subclinical valve thrombosis was not assessed. Oral anticoagulation was started during the trial (most commonly for AF) in 13.3 percent of the aspirin-alone group and 9.6 percent in the aspirin-clopidogrel group.</p><p>Outcomes post-TAVI with SAPT versus DAPT were also compared in a network meta-analysis including three earlier randomized controlled trials and 10 observational studies with a total of 20,548 post-TAVI patients [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. SAPT was associated with lower rates of major and/or life-threatening bleeding compared with other antithrombotic regimens (hazard ratio [HR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.46-0.77 compared with DAPT). Mortality and stroke rates were similar with DAPT and SAPT. However, this analysis included limited adjustment for differences in risk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4183447047"><span class="h2">With concurrent indication for dual antiplatelet therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If there is a concurrent indication for DAPT (eg, recent coronary artery stenting) but no concurrent indication for anticoagulation, the duration of DAPT is dictated by the concurrent indication. After this period, we suggest daily SAPT (generally <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> 75 to 100 mg daily; if aspirin is contraindicated, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> 75 mg daily is an alternative) for life rather than anticoagulation. This approach is based upon protocols in randomized trials comparing TAVI with other therapy and is reflected in major society guidelines [<a href="#rid3">3,6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83110.html" rel="external">"Choice of intervention for severe calcific aortic stenosis", section on 'Outcomes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1401181693"><span class="h2">Uncertain role of anticoagulation (without a concurrent indication)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients post-TAVI who lack a concurrent indication for anticoagulation, the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation are uncertain and are under investigation. A possible role for anticoagulation is being studied given concern about the risk of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis post-TAVI with standard antiplatelet therapy and some observational data suggesting that the risk of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis is reduced with anticoagulation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110074.html" rel="external">"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Complications", section on 'Valve thrombosis'</a>.)</p><p>The 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) valvular disease guideline suggested that for patients post-TAVI who lack an established indication for anticoagulation and who have a low risk of bleeding, treatment with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) to achieve an international normalized ratio of 2.5 for three months or more may be reasonable [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]; however, the limited available evidence is not sufficient to support routine VKA use in this setting.</p><p>Limited data are available on the effects of anticoagulation in patients post-TAVI with no concurrent indication for anticoagulation. An analysis of data of 4832 patients undergoing bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (3889 TAVI and 943 SAVR) in the pooled cohort of the PARTNER 2 randomized trial and nonrandomized registries found that discharge without anticoagulant therapy was associated with a higher frequency of a &gt;10 mmHg increase in mean transvalvular gradient from 30 days to one year compared with discharge with an anticoagulant (2.3 versus 1.1 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. There were similar rates of prosthetic valve dysfunction without and with anticoagulation (1.3 and 1.70 percent). There was no independent association between post-TAVI anticoagulation and death or rehospitalization. Anticoagulation post-TAVI was associated with greater minor bleeding (8.5 versus 5.0 percent; adjusted HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.13-2.61).</p><p>Patients post-TAVI should not be routinely treated with the combination of a direct oral anticoagulant plus antiplatelet agent in the absence of a concurrent indication for anticoagulation, given adverse outcomes with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">rivaroxaban</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> use in the GALILEO trial [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], although this antithrombotic regimen reduced subclinical prosthetic valve abnormalities in an imaging substudy [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In the GALILEO trial, 1644 patients without an established indication for oral anticoagulation after TAVI were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban 10 mg daily (with aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily for the first three months) or aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily (with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> 75 mg daily for the first three months).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The trial was stopped early, at a median follow-up of 17 months, because of safety concerns. In the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">rivaroxaban</a> group, there were higher rates of death or first thromboembolic event (105 versus 78 patients; 9.8 versus 7.2 per 100 person-years; HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01-1.81) and all-cause mortality (64 versus 38 deaths; 5.8 versus 3.4 per 100 person-years; HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.13-2.53) compared with the antiplatelet-only group. Major bleeding was more frequent in the rivaroxaban group (2.8 versus 1.4 person-years; HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.09-3.76), but rates of life-threatening or disabling bleeding were similar in the two groups (1.6 versus 1.5 person-years; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.55-2.06).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 231 patient substudy of this trial, four-dimensional computed tomography was performed at a mean of 90 days after randomization [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

There were few clinical events in the imaging substudy, so the relation between subclinical leaflet abnormalities and clinical events could not be assessed.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1823459599"><span class="h1">WITH CONCURRENT INDICATION FOR THERAPEUTIC ANTICOAGULATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The optimal post-TAVI antithrombotic regimen for patients with a concurrent indication for therapeutic anticoagulation (eg, AF with risk factors favoring anticoagulation) has not been established, and clinical practice varies [<a href="#rid3">3,6,10-12</a>]. Given the limited available evidence, we base antithrombotic therapy in this setting on whether there is a concurrent indication for antiplatelet therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef128310" href="/d/graphic/128310.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), as discussed in the following sections.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2866930573"><span class="h2">Anticoagulation without antiplatelet therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For a patient post-TAVI with a concurrent indication for therapeutic anticoagulation (eg, AF with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score ≥2 in males or ≥3 in females) and no concurrent indication for antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation is prescribed and no additional antithrombotic therapy for TAVI is required [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1">The selection of anticoagulant (vitamin K antagonist [VKA] or direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]) is based upon the indication for anticoagulation and other clinical factors.

This approach is supported by the following studies:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>An open-label trial randomly assigned 1426 post-TAVI patients (mean age 82 years) with AF to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="99275" href="/d/drug information/99275.html" rel="external">edoxaban</a> or VKA with median follow-up of approximately 1.5 years [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

Major, life-threatening, or disabling bleeding was less frequent in the oral anticoagulant only group (8.9 versus 16.7 percent; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29-0.99). Most bleeding occurred in the first month and was minor. Rates of ischemic stroke were similar in the two groups, but were based upon few events (8 events or 5.1 percent in the oral anticoagulant only group and 9 events or 5.8 percent in the oral anticoagulant plus clopidogrel group). There was one hemorrhagic stroke in the oral anticoagulant only group and none in the oral anticoagulant plus clopidogrel group. Mortality rates were similar in the two groups (13.4 versus 15.4 percent; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.51-1.50).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A potential clinical benefit of antiplatelet therapy in reducing the risk of stroke in patients post-TAVI with AF was suggested by an analysis of data from the PARTNER 2 trial and associated registries [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In an adjusted analysis of data on 1621 patients with prior AF and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score ≥2, antiplatelet therapy (for at least 6 months or until an endpoint event) with or without anticoagulation was associated with reduced rate of stroke at two years compared with no antithrombotic therapy (HR for anticoagulant plus antiplatelet therapy 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.87; HR for antiplatelet therapy alone 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.65), while anticoagulation alone was not (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.31-1.21). In this adjusted analysis, the risk of death or stroke was lower with antiplatelet therapy with or without anticoagulation, as well as with anticoagulation alone, compared with no antithrombotic therapy. Indications for antiplatelet therapy in the study subjects were not provided.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1194039358"><span class="h2">Avoid triple antithrombotic therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We generally avoid triple antithrombotic therapy (DAPT plus anticoagulation) post-TAVI. The above cited network meta-analysis evaluating antithrombotic therapy post-TAVI found that triple antithrombotic therapy was associated with a higher mortality rate than each of the other antithrombotic regimens (including anticoagulation plus single antiplatelet therapy) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Although this network meta-analysis has several limitations, this finding is consistent with indirect evidence of adverse effects of triple antithrombotic therapy from studies of patients with AF and acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention.

SAPT generally consists of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> 75 to 100 mg daily; if aspirin is contraindicated, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> 75 mg daily is an alternative. In the available clinical trials, the risk of stroke appears to be similar with SAPT and DAPT, but SAPT is associated with lower bleeding risk. (See <a class="local">'Without concurrent indication for dual antiplatelet therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">A reasonable alternative for patients with no indication for anticoagulation is to use DAPT in the intermediate term (during the initial three to six months depending upon valve type) followed by lifelong SAPT, which is the approach used in the pivotal TAVI trials. If intermediate-term DAPT is chosen, it is continued for the first six months (for the SAPIEN valve) or for the first three months (for the Evolut R/PRO/PRO-PLUS valve).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If there is a concurrent indication for DAPT (eg, recent coronary artery stenting), the selection of agents and duration of DAPT is dictated by the concurrent indication. After this period, we suggest daily SAPT for life rather than anticoagulation (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'With concurrent indication for dual antiplatelet therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients post-TAVI without a concurrent indication for therapeutic anticoagulation should not be routinely treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) plus antiplatelet agent, given adverse outcomes observed in a randomized trial.

The selection of anticoagulant (vitamin K antagonist [VKA] or DOAC) is generally based upon the indication for anticoagulation and other clinical factors. For example, a DOAC is generally preferred for patients with AF with risk factors favoring anticoagulation, as discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'With concurrent indication for therapeutic anticoagulation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1031.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants", section on 'Approach to anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If there is a concurrent indication for antiplatelet therapy, the patient is treated with anticoagulant plus antiplatelet therapy.
