Historically, water and electrolyte requirements were initially directly derived from the caloric energy expenditures of hospitalized, normally healthy children on bed rest who were receiving intravenous (IV) fluids [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These data form the basis of IV maintenance fluid therapy in children that has undergone modifications based on clinical experience and observation and encompass these components:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Water</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Electrolytes</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cations – Typically sodium and potassium</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anions – Usually chloride; occasionally bicarbonate, acetate, and lactate</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dextrose</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29969977"><span class="h2">Water</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29970397"><span class="h3">Normal physiologic needs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Homeostatic control for water depends on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release, the kidney's ability to regulate urinary water losses via its response to ADH, and water intake based on thirst (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2307.html" rel="external">"General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)", section on 'Regulation of water and sodium balance'</a>). These regulatory mechanisms allow for variability in the daily water intake in healthy children without adverse effect.</p><p>Under normal physiologic conditions, combined daily insensible and sensible losses equal approximately 100 mL for every 100 kcal/kg of energy expended. This includes the minimal daily obligate urine volume of 25 mL for every 100 kcal of energy expenditure necessary to excrete the solutes generated by dietary intake and cell metabolism  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121670" href="/z/d/graphic/121670.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Daily caloric expenditure for healthy children varies directly with body weight, with the rate changing over several broad weight ranges.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight &lt;10 kg – 100 kcal/kg</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight &gt;10 kg to 20 kg – 1000 kcal for first 10 kg of body weight plus 50 kcal/kg for any increment of weight above 10 kg</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight &gt;20 kg to 80 kg – 1500 kcal for first 20 kg of body weight plus 20 kcal/kg for any increment of weight above 20 kg</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight &gt;80 kg – 2700 kcal/day with adjustments made as clinically pertinent for either increased or decreased caloric needs to meet metabolic demands</p><p></p><p>Daily water needs replace insensible water losses from the respiratory tract and skin and sensible water losses in urine and stool output [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Daily insensible losses (loss that is not perceived by the individual and cannot be usually measured) account for approximately 45 mL per 100 kcal of energy expended. In patients greater than 10 kg, the insensible needs are also often calculated based on body surface area at a rate of approximately 300 to 400 mL/m<sup>2</sup> per day. The insensible losses can be further delineated into skin or respiratory losses:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Skin losses, due to evaporation from convection and conduction, account for two-thirds of the insensible losses (30 mL per 100 kcal). Infants and small children have a proportionally greater body surface area per unit of body weight than larger children and adults, resulting in a relatively higher insensible skin loss of water.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Respiratory losses due to the warming and humidification of inspired air account for one-third of insensible losses (15 mL per 100 kcal).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Daily sensible water losses (losses that are perceived by the senses and can be measured) account for approximately 55 mL per 100 kcal of energy expenditure. Since water loss from stool is negligible in healthy children, sensible water loss is primarily due to the daily urinary water losses required to excrete the solute load generated from typical dietary intake and cellular metabolism. This estimate is based on a few assumptions:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A normal and age-appropriate dietary solute load and urine that is isosmotic to plasma (approximately 290 mosmol/L).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Normal urinary concentrating mechanisms in terms of both ADH release from the pituitary and kidney response to ADH availability. Thus, maximal stimulation of ADH release accompanied by a maximal kidney concentrating response (urine osmolality of 1200 to 1400 mosmol/L) are required to excrete the daily solute load in a minimal daily obligate urine volume. Patients with a diminished ability to concentrate urine due to low release or kidney response to ADH require a larger urine volume for excretion of daily solute load. Inadequate ADH release or kidney responsiveness to ADH may result in dehydration and hypernatremia, and inappropriate (excessive) release of ADH results in free water retention and hyponatremia.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h3">Methods for calculation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The two methods that are routinely used to prescribe parenteral fluid therapy assume that approximately 100 mL of exogenous water is needed to replace insensible and sensible losses for every 100 kcal/kg of energy expended. Both methods take into account the relationship between caloric expenditure and total body weight based on three broad weight ranges, as noted above. These calculations also assume urinary losses are isosmotic to plasma and that there is no ongoing aberrant physiologic process such as inappropriate ADH release (see <a class="local">'Changes in normal maintenance needs'</a> below). Since the normal kidney can both concentrate and dilute the urine, healthy children generally tolerate fluid volumes below or above these calculated values, but these calculations serve as a starting point to prescribe maintenance fluid volume.</p><p>One method calculates a total daily volume of water, and the other provides fluid needs based on an hourly rate.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Method 1</strong> – Maintenance fluid needed on an hourly basis (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/121761.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Weight 3 to ≤10 kg – 4 mL/kg per hour</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Weight &gt;10 kg to ≤20 kg – 40 mL/hour for first 10 kg of body weight plus 2 mL/kg per hour for any increment of weight over 10 kg</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Weight &gt;20 kg to ≤80 kg – 60 mL/hour for first 20 kg of body weight plus 1 mL/kg per hour for any increment of weight over 20 kg, to a maximum of 100 mL/hour (up to a maximum of 2400 mL daily)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Method 2</strong> – Maintenance fluid volume for a 24-hour period (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13425.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Weight &gt;3 to ≤10 kg – 100 mL/kg</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Weight &gt;10 kg to ≤20 kg – 1000 mL for first 10 kg of body weight plus 50 mL/kg for any increment of weight over 10 kg</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Weight &gt;20 kg to ≤80 kg – 1500 mL plus 20 mL/kg for every kg over 20 (up to a maximum of 2400 mL daily)</p><p></p><p>At body weights &gt;65 kg, water requirements do not show the same incremental increase as with lower weights. As a result, for individuals with a body weight &gt;65 kg, total maintenance water needs are generally capped at 2400 mL daily for each method. Infants weighing &lt;3 kg may require lower or higher maintenance fluids, depending on their gestational and chronologic age and other medical conditions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5065.html" rel="external">"Fluid and electrolyte therapy in newborns"</a>.)</p><p>The total daily volume of water prescribed by the hourly format is a bit lower than the daily format, but the difference is almost always of no clinical significance. For example, the maintenance water needs for a 12-kg child are calculated using both methods as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Utilizing the hourly method, the maintenance needs would be 44 mL per hour or 1056 mL for 24 hours (40 mL/hour for the first 10 kg of body weight, plus 4 mL/hour for the next 2 kg [2 mL/kg per hour for each kg of body weight between 10 and 20 kg]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Utilizing the 24-hour method, the maintenance needs would be slightly higher at 1100 mL for 24 hours (1000 mL for the first 10 kg, plus 100 mL for the next 2 kg [50 mL/kg per day for each kg of body weight between 10 and 20 kg]).</p><p></p><p>In children who are hospitalized or who are postoperative, the risk for inappropriate (excessive) ADH release is high. As a result, a routine calculation of maintenance water volumes in hospitalized or postoperative children may predispose to hyponatremia if water or sodium replacement is not adjusted. (See <a class="local">'Alterations of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29970093"><span class="h2">Electrolytes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children, the daily sodium, chloride, and potassium requirements can be related to daily water needs as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sodium and chloride – 2 to 3 mEq/100 mL of water per day</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Potassium – 1 to 2 mEq/100 mL of water per day</p><p></p><p>Urinary electrolyte losses account for the majority of maintenance electrolyte needs, with fewer electrolyte losses normally accompanying the typical insensible water losses in sweat and stool. As is the case with water balance, maintenance electrolyte intake may vary from day to day, depending on clinical circumstance. For example, sodium and potassium intake may need to be reduced in patients with oliguric kidney failure to prevent volume expansion and hyperkalemia; conversely, their intake may need to be increased in patients with diarrhea or burns to prevent volume depletion and hypokalemia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H254791451"><span class="h2">Dextrose</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dextrose is generally added to maintenance fluids, especially if the child is likely to be fasting for a lengthy period of time or if there are clinical concerns for hypoglycemia. This is particularly pertinent with smaller and younger children who have higher relative glucose requirements compared with older children. Under normal circumstances, 5 to 10 percent dextrose solution administered at a maintenance rate is safe as this amount of dextrose is taken up rapidly by cells and metabolized. Therefore, dextrose remains only for a short time in the intravascular space and is not a relevant factor when considering tonicity of IV fluid, especially when compared with sodium. As a result, in this topic, references to isotonic fluid only apply to the sodium content even if the fluid contains dextrose.</p><p>Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who are receiving IV hydration with dextrose-containing fluids should have frequent blood glucose monitoring. Management of patients with type 1 diabetes in the settings of acute illness, medical procedures, or diabetic ketoacidosis is discussed in greater detail separately.

However, the normal physiologic osmotic release and response to ADH may be impaired in a variety of clinical settings, particularly in children who are hospitalized  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104673" href="/z/d/graphic/104673.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

The goal of IV maintenance fluid therapy is to preserve water and electrolyte balance in the euvolemic patient and to avoid hypoglycemia by providing sufficient glucose (dextrose). In our practice, the general principles outlined in the following sections are used when prescribing maintenance IV fluid therapy for children. These principles are in agreement with the practice guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the 2018 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical practice guidelines [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4073977157"><span class="h2">Composition of initial fluid</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2000222892"><span class="h3">Isotonic solutions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most pediatric patients, the preferred initial fluid is an isotonic solution (normal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/z/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="108442" href="/z/d/drug information/108442.html" rel="external">lactated Ringer</a>'s solution), consistent with clinical practice guidelines published by the AAP [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This represents a shift away from the historical use of hypotonic solutions [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. This change is based on the increasing awareness and evidence demonstrating the increased risk of hyponatremia with the use of hypotonic solution because hospitalized children are commonly at risk for inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release, resulting in free water retention  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104673" href="/z/d/graphic/104673.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,6-13</a>].

Despite the observation that many hospitalized children have transient inappropriate ADH release, assessment for inappropriate ADH release is not typically performed. As a result, the traditional approach of fluid restriction is usually not initiated and appears not to be needed to maintain serum sodium levels in most children with acute illnesses or postoperative children who are expected to fully recover in a timely manner [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Nevertheless, ongoing assessment is needed to determine whether the rate of therapy requires modification as discussed below.</p><p>In determining a child's full daily volume, all sources of fluid intake need to be considered, including parenteral medications and blood products and oral intake for children who are able to eat and drink. In these settings, the volume and rate of IV fluid administration must be adjusted to account for these alternate sources of fluids.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3609996040"><span class="h2">Alterations of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial assumptions of the appropriateness of initial fluid therapy need to be confirmed as clinical conditions may alter water loss  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72500" href="/z/d/graphic/72500.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

Increases in serum sodium represent decreases in total body water and a need to replace water losses, whereas decreases in serum sodium represent water retention and a need for fluid restriction. Serum sodium is typically obtained initially and between 6 to 12 hours after the initiation of IV fluid therapy [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The frequency of subsequent measurements depends on whether there are ongoing changes in fluid therapy based on unanticipated changes to water losses, and the severity of illness. For patients who are critically ill with ongoing changes, serial sodium may be obtained as frequently as every four to six hours. In contrast, serum sodium may be obtained daily for patients who are stable on IV fluid therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To maintain euvolemia, this net difference reflects the volume of insensible fluid loss resulting in no change in fluid balance (neutral net fluid balance) and no change in weight.
