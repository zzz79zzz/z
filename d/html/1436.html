         Dyspnea, or breathing discomfort, is a common symptom that afflicts millions of patients with pulmonary disease and may be the primary manifestation of lung disease, myocardial ischemia or dysfunction, anemia, neuromuscular disorders, obesity, or deconditioning. Examination of the language of dyspnea suggests that this symptom represents a number of qualitatively distinct sensations, and that the words utilized by patients to describe their breathing discomfort may provide insight into the underlying pathophysiology of the disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The key elements in the evaluation of the patient with dyspnea will be reviewed here. The basic physiology of dyspnea, the evaluation of acute dyspnea, and dyspnea in pregnancy are discussed separately. (See

         A consensus statement of the American Thoracic Society defines dyspnea in the following way [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ]:
        </p>
        <p>
         "Dyspnea is a term used to characterize a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that is comprised of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity. The experience derives from interactions among multiple physiological, psychological, social, and environmental factors, and may induce secondary physiological and behavioral responses."
        </p>
        <p>
         Dyspnea is considered acute when it develops over hours to days and chronic when it occurs for more than four to eight weeks. Some patients present with acute worsening of chronic breathlessness that may be caused by a new problem or a worsening of the underlying disease (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure).

         Most patients with breathing discomfort can be categorized into one of two groups: respiratory system dyspnea or cardiovascular system dyspnea. Respiratory system dyspnea includes discomfort related to disorders of the central controller, the ventilatory pump, and the gas exchanger  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118505" href="/z/d/graphic/118505.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), while cardiovascular system dyspnea includes cardiac diseases (eg, acute ischemia, systolic dysfunction, valvular disorders, pericardial diseases), as well as anemia and deconditioning; the latter two lead to dyspnea via altered delivery and/or utilization of oxygen  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69322" href="/z/d/graphic/69322.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). More than one process may be active in a given patient, and the basic physiology of dyspnea does not always adhere to this structure; for example, stimulation of pulmonary receptors can result from interstitial inflammation (respiratory system) or interstitial edema (cardiovascular system). Nevertheless, this construct offers an organized approach to the patient with dyspnea of unclear etiology. (See

         The respiratory system is designed to move air by bulk transport from the atmosphere to the alveoli, where oxygen uptake into the blood and elimination of carbon dioxide occurs by diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Carbon dioxide is then removed from the lungs by bulk transport to the atmosphere. Several components must be functioning smoothly for this process to occur; derangements in any of these elements can lead to dyspnea.

         <strong>
          Controller
         </strong>
         – The "respiratory controller" determines the rate and depth of breathing via efferent signals sent to the ventilatory muscles. Factors that stimulate the respiratory centers in the brainstem lead to increased ventilation and breathing discomfort in a variety of settings; these often are secondary to derangements in other parts of the system, such as hypoxia or hypercapnia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatching in the gas exchanger, or stimulation of pulmonary receptors as occurs with interstitial inflammation or edema. In addition, drugs such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         (at a toxic dose) or

          progesterone
         </a>
         and conditions such as pregnancy or diabetic ketoacidosis can produce dyspnea through central effects independent of problems in the ventilatory pump or gas exchanger. Typically, dyspnea associated with stimulation of the respiratory controller is described as a sensation of "air hunger" or an "urge or need to breathe" [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         To some degree, the breathing pattern may also reflect what are presumed to be attempts by the controller to reduce breathing discomfort. Thus, patients with severe airflow obstruction generally adapt a relatively slow, deep breathing pattern to minimize the pleural pressures needed to overcome airways resistance to generate adequate flow. Alternatively, patients with interstitial fibrosis or kyphoscoliosis and reduced lung or chest wall compliance have a characteristic rapid, shallow breathing pattern which minimizes the work needed to expand the thorax.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When the respiratory controller is stimulated (eg, by exercise), airflow obstruction may heighten the sensation of air hunger. The increase in respiratory rate during exercise in the setting of expiratory flow limitation can lead to exercise-induced air-trapping, a process known as dynamic hyperinflation. Dynamic hyperinflation is associated with a reduced inspiratory reserve and increased dyspnea. For those in whom hyperinflation is substantial, such that inspiratory capacity at rest or during exercise is limited by total lung capacity, dyspnea is further exacerbated, and patients may also complain of an inability to get a deep breath. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1459.html" rel="external">
          "Dynamic hyperinflation in patients with COPD"

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with restrictive lung disease, the adoption of breathing patterns with either an increase or decrease in tidal volume from their average resting tidal volume results in increased dyspnea [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Breathing with a rapid, shallow pattern, the patient experiences an increase in the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (since anatomic dead space is relatively fixed), which leads to a need for greater total ventilation (hence, the increase in respiratory rate); this adds to respiratory work-load and may contribute to the development of hypercapnia. In contrast, an increase in tidal volume requires a significant increase in respiratory work due to the stiffness of the lung. Since most patients with restrictive lung disease tend to use a rapid, shallow breathing pattern, we conclude that this pattern, relative to alternatives, must produce less dyspnea.

         <strong>
          Ventilatory pump
         </strong>
         – The "ventilatory pump" comprises the ventilatory muscles, the peripheral nerves which transmit signals to them from the controller, the bones of the chest wall which help frame the thorax and to which the respiratory muscles are connected, the pleura which transforms movement of the chest wall to negative pressure inside the thorax, and the airways that serve as a conduit for the flow of gas from the atmosphere to the alveoli and back again. The most common derangements of the ventilatory pump result in a sense of increased "work of breathing" [
         <a href="#rid6">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Neuromuscular weakness (eg, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome) leads to a condition in which the patient must exert near maximal inspiratory effort to produce a normal negative pleural pressure [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Patients with reduced compliance of the chest wall (eg, kyphoscoliosis) or lungs (eg, interstitial fibrosis) must perform more work than normal to move air into the lungs. Obstructive lung disease is associated with increased resistance to flow and, in patients with significant hyperinflation, reduced compliance as breathing occurs on the stiff portion of the pressure-volume curve of the respiratory system. When hyperinflation results in an end-inspiratory volume that approximates total lung capacity, patients often complain of an inability to get a deeper satisfying breath [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. A sensation of chest tightness may also be present in patients in whom acute bronchoconstriction is the cause of airflow obstruction [

         <strong>
          Gas exchanger
         </strong>
         – The "gas exchanger" consists of the alveoli and the pulmonary capillaries across which oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse. Most of the common cardiopulmonary disorders leading to dyspnea are associated with some derangement of the gas exchanger due either to destruction of the diffusing membrane (eg, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis) or the addition of fluid or inflammatory material into the lungs such that ventilation to alveoli is reduced regionally. To a lesser degree, the distance for diffusion may also contribute in these conditions or in the greatly dilated pulmonary capillaries seen in some patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome. Diseases affecting the gas exchanger are typically characterized by hypoxemia, either at rest or with exercise, and by chronic hypercapnia in more severe cases. These gas exchange abnormalities stimulate the respiratory centers in the brainstem and lead to a sensation of "air hunger" or an increased urge to breathe.

         The cardiovascular system is designed to move oxygenated blood from the lungs to metabolically active tissues, and then transport carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. For this system to work optimally and avert breathing discomfort, one must have a pump that functions without generating high pulmonary capillary pressures. There must also be sufficient hemoglobin to carry oxygen and appropriate enzymes to utilize oxygen in the tissues.

          Heart failure
         </strong>
         – Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle(s) to fill with or eject blood. Symptoms of heart failure fall into two major classes: those due to a reduction in cardiac output (fatigue, weakness, and dyspnea on exertion) and those due to increased pulmonary or systemic venous pressure and fluid accumulation (dyspnea at rest and exertion, edema, hepatic congestion, and ascites). When heart failure causes an increase in pulmonary venous pressure, it can lead to dyspnea either by producing hypoxemia or by stimulating pulmonary vascular and/or interstitial receptors (eg, unmyelinated J-receptors, also called C-fibers). Causes of heart failure include ventricular systolic dysfunction, ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and valvular disease. Cardiac tamponade may also lead to dyspnea by increasing pulmonary vascular pressures. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1427.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients with low cardiac output, oxygen delivery to the tissues is reduced, which may lead to changes in tissue metabolism with associated accumulation of products of anaerobic energy generation leading to stimulation of metabo- or ergoreceptors [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15

         <strong>
          Anemia
         </strong>
         – Anemia can severely impair oxygen delivery because the bulk of oxygen carried in the blood is hemoglobin-bound (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7072.html" rel="external">
          "Structure and function of normal hemoglobins"
         </a>
         ). Nevertheless, the exact mechanism by which anemia produces dyspnea is not known. As described above for low cardiac output heart failure, the inability to sustain aerobic metabolism may lead to stimulation of "ergoreceptors" [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. Anemia also leads to increased cardiac output, which may necessitate elevated left ventricular volume and pulmonary vascular pressures. However, the quality of dyspnea is usually quite different in these two clinical situations.

         <strong>
          Deconditioning
         </strong>
         – Individuals usually complain of respiratory discomfort when they engage in vigorous physical activity, even in the presence of a normal cardiovascular and respiratory system and normal hematocrit. More fit individuals experience less discomfort for any given workload; cardiovascular fitness is determined by the ability of the heart to increase maximal cardiac output and by the ability of the peripheral muscles to utilize oxygen efficiently for aerobic metabolism.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In contrast, a sedentary existence reduces fitness and leads to dyspnea, often with seemingly trivial tasks. It is common for patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease to assume a sedentary lifestyle in an effort to avoid breathing discomfort. However, the end result over a span of months to years is that the individual becomes progressively deconditioned (ie, reduced maximal cardiac output, reduced capillary density in the muscles, and reduced mitochondrial capacity to sustain aerobic metabolism) and ultimately may be limited more by poor cardiovascular fitness than by the underlying disease [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Dyspnea due to deconditioning is typically described as "heavy breathing" or a sense of "breathing more" [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ], and with careful questioning, one can determine that the patient is actually limited by fatigue or leg discomfort rather than breathing discomfort. A pathologic variant of this phenomenon has been reported in a subset of patients with post-COVID-19 infections and persistent dyspnea. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing has demonstrated reduced oxygen consumption suggesting muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ability to utilize oxygen to support aerobic metabolism [
         <a href="#rid17">

         While clinical history is often insufficient to make a secure diagnosis, it provides guidance in narrowing the diagnostic possibilities and selecting diagnostic tests. In one study of 85 patients presenting to a pulmonary unit with a complaint of chronic dyspnea, the initial impression of the etiology of dyspnea based upon the patient history alone was correct in 66 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid19">

         The temporal pattern of breathlessness and association with certain triggers can provide important clues. Breathing discomfort arising over the course of minutes to hours is due to a relatively limited number of conditions  (

          table 2

         ). These entities typically have associated symptoms and signs that provide clues to the appropriate diagnosis, eg, substernal chest pain with cardiac ischemia; fever, cough, and sputum with respiratory infections; urticaria with anaphylaxis; and wheezing with acute bronchospasm. However, dyspnea may be the sole complaint. In these cases, attention to historical information and a review of this limited differential diagnosis are important. The approach to acute dyspnea is described separately. (See

          Exertional, positional, and nocturnal dyspnea
         </strong>
         – Chronic exertional dyspnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) are both associated with heart failure, although nocturnal dyspnea is more specific to heart failure. Asthma is also associated with exertional and nocturnal dyspnea, but unlike PND does not usually improve with sitting or standing.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Orthopnea, the development of or worsening of dyspnea in the supine position, is also associated with heart failure and increased pulmonary capillary pressure due to the increased venous return to the heart in this position. Central obesity, however, with a large protuberant abdomen, may also lead to orthopnea; increased intra-abdominal pressure associated with large abdominal girth impairs movement of the diaphragm during inhalation; in addition, intrapleural pressure increases, which may lead to narrowing or closure of small airways at the bases of the lungs, and can worsen gas exchange and hypoxemia. Finally, patients with inspiratory muscle weakness may also complain of orthopnea due to the increased work of breathing associated with moving the diaphragm against high intra-abdominal pressure.

         <strong>
          Intermittent dyspnea
         </strong>
         – Intermittent dyspnea associated with cold air or animal dander exposure suggests asthma; work-related dyspnea may suggest occupational asthma; and dyspnea following upper respiratory infections may be due to asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition to asthma, intermittent symptoms that resolve completely between episodes can be seen with recurrent aspiration; recurrent pulmonary emboli and heart failure can also wax and wane, but generally are characterized by a baseline level of dysfunction. The presence of specific, reproducible inciting events such as exercise or cold air exposure is common with airways hyperreactivity.

          Rapidity of symptom onset and progression
         </strong>
         – The rapidity with which symptoms develop during exercise can also provide useful diagnostic information. For example, patients who develop shortness of breath and wheezing after walking 50 to 100 feet often have acute elevations in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (usually due to cardiac diastolic dysfunction) or pulmonary hypertension. In contrast, symptoms of exercise-induced asthma usually are precipitated by more intense activity, beginning three minutes into exercise, peaking within 10 to 15 minutes, and resolving by 60 minutes.

As examples, asymmetric lower extremity edema might suggest venous thromboembolic disease; Raynaud phenomenon is seen in a number of rheumatic diseases that are associated with interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hypertension; and symmetric swelling of the metacarpophalangeal joints may be a clue to rheumatoid lung disease.

         The absence of cigarette smoking argues strongly against a diagnosis of COPD, unless the patient has a history of tuberculosis or use of biomass cooking fuels.

         For patients with chronic dyspnea, the severity of dyspnea and rate of worsening are important determinants of the pace and location of diagnostic testing [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         ]. The optimal sequence of diagnostic testing for chronic dyspnea has not been determined. We typically follow an algorithm that utilizes three tiers of testing: initial testing  (

         ). Within each tier, we select tests based on the patient’s clinical features, results of prior tests, and likelihood of a diagnostic result. One study found that the most informative tests for adults (age 45 to 84) with dyspnea and no known cardiopulmonary disease were the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV

         After reviewing the clinical findings for indicators that are suggestive of the pathophysiology consistent with one or two of the above five most common processes, the narrowed differential diagnosis is used to select tests that focus on these possibilities. As an example, if the patient is age 20 to 40 and has a clinical picture of allergic rhinitis and intermittent dyspnea, the initial testing might be limited to spirometry pre and post bronchodilator. Similarly, a 70-year-old patient with known coronary artery disease, peripheral edema, and no smoking history might be evaluated for heart failure with an electrocardiogram, a serum NT-proBNP, and echocardiogram before considering spirometry.

         /FVC ratio is normal or high), restrictive disease is suggested. When intrathoracic airflow limitation is noted or when a diagnosis of asthma is suspected, postbronchodilator spirometry determines whether there is reversibility of airflow limitation. Typically, airflow limitation is reversible in asthma, although a large component of airways edema and inflammation may need a course of inhaled or oral glucocorticoid therapy to achieve complete reversibility. Patients with a clinical suspicion of asthma and reversible airflow limitation on spirometry would be managed with a trial of specific therapy for asthma. Patients with a smoking history longer than 20 years and irreversible airflow limitation on spirometry are usually managed with a presumptive diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, other causes of irreversible airflow limitation (eg, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis, central airway obstruction) should be considered if the patient does not respond to empiric therapy for asthma or COPD.

         The chest radiograph may identify a pleural effusion, kyphoscoliosis, cardiomegaly, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary vascular redistribution, as potential causes of dyspnea. A pleural effusion will need a directed evaluation as to the cause (eg, benign asbestos effusion, malignancy, trapped lung, rheumatoid effusion, infection, heart failure), usually including thoracentesis. Kyphoscoliosis identified on chest radiograph (and physical examination) is typically evaluated with full pulmonary function tests and, if moderate to severe restriction is noted, an arterial blood gas to determine the presence of hypercapnia. Interstitial lung disease is often evaluated further with measurement of lung volumes and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and by CT scan of the lungs to help characterize the underlying process. Heart failure suggested by the NT-pro BNP and chest radiograph will need further evaluation with an echocardiogram to determine the cause. The evaluation of these processes is discussed separately.

          Reduced forced vital capacity (FVC)
         </strong>
         – If a decrease in the FVC is noted on spirometry, but without airflow limitation, the next step is to determine the cause of the decrease in FVC. The possibility of an underlying "restrictive" abnormality is assessed with measurement of lung volumes, looking for a similar decrease in total lung capacity and functional residual capacity. A restrictive pattern may be caused by interstitial lung disease, pleural disease (eg, trapped lung), chest wall disease (eg, kyphoscoliosis), or ventilatory muscle weakness (eg, diffuse or due to diaphragmatic paralysis). Respiratory muscle weakness can be evaluated further with maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures at the mouth, maximal voluntary ventilation in one minute, and supine spirometry that is compared with sitting spirometry results.

         ) is typically obtained in patients with recurrent, episodic dyspnea suggestive of asthma who have normal or near normal spirometry. A trial of therapy for asthma is an alternative, but bronchoprovocation is preferred to enable a precise determination of asthma. Studies have shown that up to 30 percent of patients with a clinical diagnosis of asthma do not have airway reactivity on formal testing [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50,51

         If a flow-volume loop was not obtained during the initial spirometry, we use that test to evaluate the upper airway for obstruction, particularly variable upper airway obstruction that may not be apparent on expiratory spirometry. However, pulmonary function testing is relatively insensitive for upper airway obstruction, so direct visualization of the upper airway following bronchoprovocation or exercise challenge may be necessary.

         – A diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is helpful in the evaluation of dyspnea, particularly in the identification of interstitial lung disease (suggested by reduced lung volumes), emphysema or bronchiolitis (suggested by an obstructive pattern), and pulmonary vascular disease. Pulmonary vascular disease (eg, pulmonary hypertension, chronic thromboembolic disease, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease) is suggested by the combination of normal spirometry and lung volumes, but abnormal gas transfer manifest by a decrease in DLCO and pulse oxygen saturation on exertion (eg, ≥5 percent).

The differential diagnosis includes COPD, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary vascular disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, intrapulmonary or intracardiac shunt, and heart failure. Thus, such patients typically need high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and a transthoracic echocardiogram, possibly with a bubble study.

          Reduced lung volumes and obesity

In a population study (NHANES III), subjects in the highest quintile of body mass index (BMI), had the lowest risk for significant airflow obstruction, so obesity by itself is less commonly a cause of classical airflow obstruction [

         – Suspected interstitial lung disease is evaluated by HRCT, and central masses and suspected large airway obstruction (eg, tumor) are best evaluated by CT with contrast and direct visualization.

         – For patients with suspected thromboembolic disease based on risk factors, lower extremity edema, or a low DLCO with normal lung volumes, a computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is usually the next step unless the patient has a contraindication to intravenous contrast.

         – If LV ejection fraction and end-diastolic volume are normal, echocardiography can identify features of diastolic dysfunction (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [HF-PEF]), such as LV hypertrophy (LVH), concentric remodeling, and left atrial enlargement. Additional Doppler features of diastolic dysfunction include elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and impaired ventricular relaxation (eg, early/late [E/A] filling &lt;1). Combined clinical and echocardiographic features can frequently rule-in or rule-out the diagnosis of HF-PEF as a cause of unexplained dyspnea. (See

         When elevated pulmonary artery pressures are suggested by Doppler echocardiography and are supported by an elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and oxygen desaturation on exertion, the next step in the evaluation of suspected pulmonary hypertension is pulmonary artery catheterization to confirm an elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP &gt;20 mmHg at rest) and exclude diastolic dysfunction (unlikely with pulmonary artery wedge pressure [PAWP] &lt;15 mmHg).

         For patients who have dyspnea that is persistent and unexplained by the results of the above studies, additional testing may be warranted. At this point it may be reasonable for the patient to engage in a conditioning program for two to three months to see whether dyspnea improves before proceeding with more invasive testing. For patients in whom deconditioning is not believed to be contributing to symptoms, proceeding directly to additional testing is reasonable.

         A cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) can be helpful when the etiology of a patient's dyspnea remains unclear after the evaluation described above or when dyspnea seems out of proportion to the severity of the patient's known cardiac or pulmonary disease [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,61,62
         </a>
         ]. A CPET can assess the workload that the patient can achieve, the degree of dyspnea experienced (eg, Borg or other visual scale), the peak oxygen uptake, cardiac output (calculated from carbon dioxide production and oxygen uptake), and relationship of minute ventilation to carbon dioxide production.

         A CPET may be helpful in providing support for the presence of deconditioning or in detecting a low threshold for respiratory discomfort. Patients with a low threshold for respiratory discomfort typically terminate the test at mild workloads because of dyspnea but have no evidence of cardiopulmonary abnormality. In patients with both pulmonary and cardiac disease, either of which could cause the patient to have dyspnea limiting their exercise capacity, CPET may assist in the determination of the actual cause of the limitation.

         Occasional patients with chronic dyspnea will go through a complete evaluation without identification of a cause. Others may have near normal testing, such that a slight decrease in peak oxygen uptake, anaerobic threshold, and peak heart rate are thought to be most consistent with deconditioning or obesity. While individuals with obesity frequently report dyspnea [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ], in a given individual it can be difficult to know how much dyspnea is attributable to obesity. For patients who report dyspnea but have normal or near normal testing, we explain the reassuring nature of testing in detail, advise a conditioning program, and ask the patient to return in 6 to 12 months for re-evaluation. The re-evaluation is important due to the infrequent situation in which a treatable cause of dyspnea is missed initially but becomes apparent on subsequent testing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dyspnea due to obesity per se is commonly associated with a sense of increased effort to breathe or work of breathing, likely due to the weight of the chest wall [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. Hypoxemia, either at rest or with exertion, may be caused by ventilation/perfusion mismatching at the bases of the lungs, a consequence of narrowing of airways in these regions due to the increased pleural pressure resulting from the weight of the chest wall.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other chest symptoms (eg, heartburn) and psychological factors can lead to the perception of dyspnea, as described below. Use of a Borg scale during cardiopulmonary exercise testing will sometimes identify dyspnea associated with a low work load and normal cardiorespiratory function  (

         The global rating that a patient gives for dyspnea may reflect both sensory and emotional (ie, affective) elements. In a study of laboratory-induced dyspnea, air hunger was associated with greater unpleasantness for a given level of sensory intensity than was the sense of respiratory work or effort [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. The context in which a sensation occurs may alter the affective component of the intensity and needs to be considered when assessing the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         For a given physiologic derangement that may cause dyspnea, perceptual responses vary widely among individuals. Anxiety, anger, pain, and depression may be associated with dyspnea intensity out of proportion to the physiologic impairment [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68-71
         </a>
         ]. Increased ventilation associated with anxiety, anger, or pain may push an individual with a limited pulmonary reserve at baseline closer to his or her ventilatory limits and increase the perceived respiratory discomfort for any given activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the extent that dyspnea occurs unexpectedly or cannot be quickly relieved, it may give rise to a range of emotional reactions, which can then lead to further physiological derangements (eg, tachypnea, hyperinflation). For any given gas exchange or mechanical problem with the cardiopulmonary system, the emotional or affective response may contribute to the intensity or discomfort of the sensation [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]; questionnaires have been developed that incorporate both qualitative and affective descriptors [

         Patients with hyperventilation syndrome typically experience a sensation of air hunger or an inability to take a deep breath in the absence of cardiopulmonary disease. These individuals may have panic and/or anxiety disorders, and on examination are often observed to breathe with very large tidal volumes despite the complaint that they cannot take a deep enough breath.

          Definitions
         </strong>
         – Dyspnea is a term used to characterize a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that comprises qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity. Dyspnea is considered acute when it develops over hours to days and chronic when it has been present for more than four to eight weeks. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definition of dyspnea'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Dyspnea can be the first manifestation of a variety of cardiopulmonary disorders. It is not uncommon for a patient to have more than one problem contributing to breathing discomfort. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathophysiology'

         <strong>
          Clinical assessment
         </strong>
         – The history and physical examination lead to accurate diagnoses in patients with dyspnea in approximately two-thirds of cases. Important components of the history include the characteristics of dyspnea (ie, timing, severity, and triggers), exposures that may contribute to the lung disease (eg, allergens, cold air, occupational agents, cigarette smoke), and interventions or medications that reduce dyspnea. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical assessment'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The patient’s description of breathing discomfort can help narrow down diagnostic possibilities. In addition, the presence of more than one type of breathing discomfort can lead to recognition that more than one disease process is contributing to dyspnea. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Descriptors of breathing discomfort'

          Acute dyspnea
         </strong>
         – Breathing discomfort arising over the course of minutes to hours (acute dyspnea) generally requires prompt evaluation and treatment. The evaluation of acute dyspnea is described separately. (See

          Common causes of chronic dyspnea
         </strong>
         – Among the many causes of chronic dyspnea  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104817" href="/z/d/graphic/104817.html" rel="external">
          table 7
         </a>
         ), the most common are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, cardiomyopathy, and obesity/deconditioning. In addition, deconditioning is often a contributing factor in patients with chronic lung disease. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial testing in chronic dyspnea'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Step-wise approach to chronic dyspnea
         </strong>
         – When evaluating chronic dyspnea, we follow a step-wise diagnostic approach of initial testing  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104818" href="/z/d/graphic/104818.html" rel="external">
          table 8
         </a>
         ), follow-up testing  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104821 graphicRef111477 graphicRef111478" href="/z/d/graphic/104821.html" rel="external">
          table 9A-C
         </a>
         ), and advanced testing  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104824" href="/z/d/graphic/104824.html" rel="external">
          table 10
         </a>
         ), starting with the tests that are the least invasive and most likely to yield a diagnosis. Within each tier, the individual tests are selected based on the patient’s clinical features, results of prior tests, and response to therapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial testing in chronic dyspnea'
         </a>
         above.)

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         <strong>
          Initial tests
         </strong>
         – The initial tests are selected based on a review of the clinical findings for patterns suggestive of one or two of the above five most common causes of dyspnea  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104818" href="/z/d/graphic/104818.html" rel="external">
          table 8
         </a>
         ). When asthma or COPD is suspected, the initial testing might be limited to spirometry pre and post bronchodilator, while an older patient with coronary artery disease and peripheral edema should be evaluated for heart failure before considering spirometry. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial testing in chronic dyspnea'

         </span>
         <strong>
          Follow-up tests
         </strong>
         – Follow-up testing in the evaluation of dyspnea should clarify abnormalities that were noted on initial testing, but were not diagnostic  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104821" href="/z/d/graphic/104821.html" rel="external">
          table 9A

          table 9B

         and

          table 9C
         </a>
         ). In addition, some patients with normal results on initial testing, but persistent symptoms, require further evaluation. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) is generally reserved for patients in whom there is a suspicion of interstitial lung disease, occult emphysema, or chronic thromboembolic disease. Echocardiography is useful for evaluating suspected left ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Follow-up testing in chronic dyspnea'
         </a>

         </span>
         <strong>
          Advanced testing
         </strong>
         – Advanced testing includes procedures such as right heart catheterization, stress echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), and invasive CPET  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104824" href="/z/d/graphic/104824.html" rel="external">
          table 10
         </a>
         ). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a useful study in patients in whom the cause of their breathing discomfort remains elusive after standard testing, in patients in whom deconditioning is a serious consideration, and in patients who appear to have breathing discomfort out of proportion to their physiologic derangements.
