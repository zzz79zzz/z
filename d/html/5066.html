         Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a parenchymal lung disorder characterized by pulmonary edema resulting from delayed resorption and clearance of fetal alveolar fluid. It is the most common cause of respiratory distress in late preterm and term infants and is generally a benign, self-limited condition.

         The normal process of clearing fetal alveolar fluid begins before term birth and continues through labor and after delivery. From the onset of labor to the delivery of the term newborn, approximately 100 mL of fetal lung liquid is cleared [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         During late gestation, in response to increased concentrations of catecholamines and other hormones, the mature lung epithelium switches from actively secreting chloride and liquid into the air spaces to actively reabsorbing sodium and liquid (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57746" href="/z/d/graphic/57746.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Increased oxygen tension at birth increases gene expression of the epithelial sodium channel leading to the enhanced sodium and water absorption [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In immature lungs, reduced gene expression of this channel contributes to the inability to switch from fluid secretion to absorption. However, glucocorticoids can upregulate gene expression resulting in active absorption through sodium channels [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Passive resorption of liquid also occurs after birth because of differences among the oncotic pressure of air spaces, interstitium, and blood vessels. The majority of water transport across the apical membrane is thought to occur through aquaporin 5 (AQP5) water channels [
         <a href="#rid4">

         TTN is a parenchymal lung disorder characterized by pulmonary edema resulting from delayed resorption and clearance of fetal alveolar fluid. In TTN, delayed resorption of fetal lung fluid fills the air spaces and moves into the interstitium, where it pools in perivascular tissues and interlobar fissures.
        </p>
        <p>
         The excess lung water in TTN results in decreased pulmonary compliance. Tachypnea develops to compensate for the increased work of breathing associated with reduced compliance. In addition, accumulation of fluid in the peribronchiolar lymphatics and interstitium promotes partial collapse of the bronchioles with subsequent air trapping. Continued perfusion of poorly ventilated alveoli leads to hypoxemia, and alveolar edema reduces ventilation, sometimes resulting in hypercapnia. Eventually fluid is cleared by lymphatic drainage or absorbed into small blood vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
         The underlying mechanism leading to delayed absorption of alveolar fluid in neonates with TTN is unknown.

         Decreased surfactant function has been proposed as contributing to the pathophysiology of TTN. In one small study of term infants delivered via elective cesarean delivery, patients with TTN compared with age-matched controls were more likely to have lower surfactant function as determined by gastric aspirate measurement of lamellar body count and stable microbubble test [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

         </span>
         Reduced nitric oxide (NO) has also been proposed as a contributing cause. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous NO synthase inhibitor. Increased ADMA concentration may reduce NO synthesis, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance associated with fetal lung fluid retention and resulting in prolonged duration of tachypnea. In one small study, ADMA levels were elevated in newborns with TTN compared with healthy newborns [

         TTN is the most common cause of respiratory distress in term and late-preterm infants, with an estimated incidence of 4.0 to 5.7 per 1000 term births [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,7-9
         </a>

          Cesarean delivery
         </strong>
         – Cesarean delivery is associated with a higher risk of TTN than vaginal delivery, thought to be due to reduced alveolar fluid clearance. (See

         In a single center review of 29,669 consecutive deliveries from 1992 to 1999, TTN occurred in more infants after cesarean deliveries (n = 4301) than after vaginal delivery (n = 21,017, 3.5 versus 1.1 percent, odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% CI 2.6-3.9) [

         – TTN occurs two to three times more often in infants of mothers with diabetes mellitus. The mechanism may be related to decreased fluid clearance in the fetal lung, although cesarean delivery, which is more frequently performed in pregnancies of diabetic mothers, is likely a contributing factor.

         The onset of TTN is usually between the time of birth and two hours after delivery. Tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 60 breaths per minute) is the most prominent feature. Infants with more serious disease will have cyanosis and increased work of breathing, manifested by nasal flaring, mild intercostal and subcostal retractions, and expiratory grunting. The anterior-posterior diameter of the chest may be increased.

        <p>
         Breath sounds in affected infants typically are clear, without rales or rhonchi. Infants with mild to moderate TTN are symptomatic for 12 to 24 hours, but signs may persist as long as 72 hours in severe cases. Infants rarely require a supplemental oxygen concentration greater than 40 percent to achieve adequate oxygenation. Affected infants also rarely require additional respiratory support (ie, noninvasive continuous positive pressure or mechanical ventilation). (See

         TTN is a benign disorder, and pathologic conditions that also present with respiratory distress must be excluded. Other common causes of respiratory distress in the newborn include infections (eg, sepsis, pneumonia) and noninfectious causes (eg, respiratory distress syndrome [RDS], congenital heart disease) (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Typically, infants with TTN do not have persistent respiratory distress beyond 24 to 48 hours, require high oxygen concentration (greater than 60 percent) supplementation or additional respiratory support (eg, mechanical ventilation). These clinical features and chest radiographic findings typically differentiate TTN from the following more serious conditions:

         <strong>
          Congenital cardiac disease
         </strong>
         – The presence and degree of respiratory distress varies based on the underlying cardiac lesion. In some cases, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and feeding difficulties occur due to pulmonary edema from a rapid increase in pulmonary blood flow, which will persist. Other infants with mild to moderate pulmonary overcirculation frequently have tachypnea without significant increased work of breathing at rest but become distressed during feeding. TTN is distinguished from congenital heart disease by physical findings (eg, heart murmur, abnormal precordial activity), chest radiography, pre- and postductal pulse oximetry, and echocardiography.

         In our center, supplemental oxygen is provided by hood or nasal cannula. Newborns are monitored with pulse oximetry and oxygen therapy is adjusted to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp02) between 90 and 95 percent. Infants with TTN rarely require a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &gt;0.4. If the required FiO2 exceeds 0.4 or the infant has increased work of breathing and/or significant tachypnea, we provide nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) to improve the work of breathing. However, it is unusual for infants with TTN to require this level of respiratory support. Thus, the clinician should consider other causes of respiratory distress (sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome) if the newborn requires escalating support. (See
         <a class="local">

         nCPAP versus supplemental oxygen without positive pressure – In a trial of 64 neonates with TTN randomized to nCPAP or supplemental oxygen without positive pressure, nCPAP reduced the duration of tachypnea (9 versus 30 hours) and there was a nonsignificant trend towards reduced hospital length of stay (3.3 versus 4.1 days) [
         <a href="#rid20">

         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         There are no available clinical trial data on the use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in this setting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the paucity of data, we continue to use nCPAP for infants with severe and persistent TTN based on clinical experience and indirect evidence from other conditions of the benefit of positive pressure support. We prefer nCPAP to NIPPV as the latter requires a ventilator for administration, which increases the cost and complexity of use. HFNC can also provide positive pressure support but we do not use this modality because the delivered concentration of oxygen and pressure to the infant is highly variable and difficult to monitor.

For late preterm and term infants, restricted fluid therapy is ≤65/mL/kg per day. For preterm infants (GA&lt;34 weeks), fluid therapy is restricted to ≤80 mL/kg per day. (See

In the three trials (n = 242 infants) that reported rates of mechanical ventilation, few infants in either group required this intervention (five infants [4 percent] in the restricted fluid group versus seven [6 percent] in the standard fluid group). Similarly, in the two trials that reported use of noninvasive ventilation (ie, nCPAP), the small number of events precludes drawing any conclusion (four infants [5 percent] in the restricted fluid group versus 10 [13 percent] in the standard fluid).

          Pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a parenchymal lung disorder characterized by pulmonary edema resulting from delayed resorption and clearance of fetal alveolar fluid. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathophysiology'

         <strong>
          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – TTN is the most common cause of respiratory distress immediately after delivery in late preterm and term infants with an estimated incidence of 4 to 6 per 1000 term births. Reported risk factors include prematurity, birth by cesarean delivery without labor, and maternal diabetes and obesity. (See

         <strong>
          Presentation
         </strong>
         – The typical presentation of TTN is onset of tachypnea (respiratory rate &gt;60 breaths per minute) within two hours after delivery in late preterm and term infants. Infants may also be cyanotic and have increased work of breathing (ie, nasal flaring, intercostal and subcostal retractions, and expiratory grunting). Breath sounds generally are clear, without rales or rhonchi. TTN is typically a benign condition and symptoms generally resolve after 12 to 24 hours, but may persist as long as 72 hours in severe cases. (See

          Diagnosis

          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – TTN is a diagnosis of exclusion and it needs to be distinguished from more serious causes of neonatal respiratory distress including pneumonia, congenital cardiac disease, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and sepsis (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56457" href="/z/d/graphic/56457.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). These disorders are differentiated from TTN by their clinical features (persistent and more serious respiratory disease) and chest radiographic findings. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'

          Management

          Nutrition
         </strong>
         – Most affecting infants are able to feed by mouth. However, for infants with marked tachypnea (respiratory rate &gt;60 breaths per minute), oral feeding is avoided and nutrition is provided either by orogastric feeds or intravenous nutrition.

         Oxygen supplementation is provided by hood or nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation between 90 and 95 percent. (See

         For newborns who require a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &gt;0.4 and/or have significant work of breathing (ie, nasal flaring, intercostal and subcostal retractions, and expiratory grunting), we suggest nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) rather than ongoing oxygen therapy alone (

          Grade 2C

          Fluid restriction

         using diuretic therapy for the treatment of TTN (
