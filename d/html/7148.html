         More than one-quarter of the world's population is anemic, with approximately one-half of the burden from iron deficiency. The prevention and treatment of iron deficiency is a major public health goal, especially in females, children, and individuals in low-income countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         Challenges in the treatment of iron deficiency include finding and addressing the underlying cause and the selection of an iron replacement product that meets the needs of the patient.

        <p>
         This topic review discusses the management of iron deficiency anemia in adults. The causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency in adults are presented separately. (See

         Regardless of the presence of symptoms, all patients with iron deficiency anemia and most with iron deficiency without anemia should be treated [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ]. The rationale is that there is risk for further organ damage/ischemia and progression of anemia unless the underlying cause of the deficiency is addressed and adequate iron stores are replenished. An exception is when iron depletion is used therapeutically (eg, porphyria cutanea tarda, polycythemia vera). (See

         Similar symptoms, especially fatigue and exercise intolerance, can also be present in individuals who are iron deficient but not anemic. These symptoms and their pathophysiology are discussed in detail separately. (See

         When treatment is indicated, the usual approach is repletion of iron. Blood transfusion should

         be used as treatment for iron deficiency unless the individual has severe anemia with hemodynamic instability. (See

         Some individuals with reduced or absent iron stores who have not yet developed anemia may have symptoms such as fatigue or reduced exercise tolerance.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to therapy is individualized according to etiology and severity of iron deficiency. We replace iron stores in most patients who have iron deficiency without anemia, with the rationale that this treatment is likely to improve symptoms, and failure to treat is likely eventually to result in anemia. These patients are often referred to the hematologist after iron studies reveal iron deficiency as part of screening laboratory tests performed to evaluate fatigue or unexplained microcytosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit of iron replacement for iron deficiency-associated fatigue without anemia has been demonstrated in several small trials and observational studies:

         A trial randomly assigned 90 non-anemic premenopausal females with fatigue, serum ferritin ≤50 ng/mL, and hemoglobin ≥12.0 g/dL to receive a cumulative dose of 800 mg of intravenous (IV) iron or placebo over two weeks [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Six weeks after treatment initiation, fatigue was improved in the IV iron arm (decrease of 1.1 versus 0.7 on a 10-point scale, from a baseline of 4.5 in both groups). The effect was more pronounced in those with a baseline serum ferritin ≤15 ng/mL. Benefits of iron supplementation persisted at 12 weeks. Adverse events were greater in the IV iron group (21 versus 9 percent), but none were considered serious. As expected, the IV iron group had increased ferritin (mean increase, 98 ng/mL) and the placebo group did not. Observational studies have also reported improvement in symptoms in non-anemic premenopausal females with low ferritin who were treated with IV iron [
         <a href="#rid3">

         Three trials, which randomly assigned groups of nonanemic females with low ferritin to oral iron supplementation (typically 80 mg of elemental iron daily) versus placebo or a high-iron diet, all reported improvement in fatigue with oral iron [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. The trial that used dietary iron as a comparator also found improvement with dietary iron, but mean increases in ferritin were greater in the supplement group [

         Additional trials in runners and blood donors have demonstrated that iron repletion can improve athletic performance, sleep disturbance, and fingernail breakage [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These data are supportive of the above recommendation that iron should be repleted in those with iron deficiency without anemia. The importance of finding the source of blood loss or iron loss also applies in these individuals. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Source of deficiency/blood loss'

        </p>
        <p>
         Routine iron administration to individuals without iron deficiency is not advised. Rarely, some experts will treat a patient who has symptoms compatible with iron deficiency (pagophagia [ice craving] or restless legs syndrome) without overt laboratory evidence of reduced iron stores if all other interventions have been exhausted.

         Treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia involves more than simply replacing iron. In
         <strong>
          all patients
         </strong>
         , the cause of iron deficiency must be identified and addressed. This is especially true for males and non-menstruating females, in whom new onset iron deficiency is strongly suggestive of blood loss from an occult gastrointestinal malignancy or other bleeding lesion.

          Dietary deficiency

         – Infants and young children may not receive adequate dietary iron if they are exclusively given cow’s milk, breast milk, or formula that is not supplemented with iron. For adults in resource-rich countries, dietary iron deficiency is exceedingly rare because of iron availability in many meats (as heme iron) and vegetables (as non-heme iron), along with routine supplementation of grains with iron.

          Pregnancy
         </strong>
         – Pregnancy results in increased iron requirements for fetal/placental development and to increase maternal red blood cell mass.

         – Normal menstruation generally does not lead to iron deficiency in most individuals unless associated with an iron-restricted diet, such as in a vegan who does not take an iron supplement. However, dietary intake may be insufficient to compensate for menstrual blood loss in some individuals. (See

          Adults without an obvious source of blood loss
         </strong>
         – Adults without an obvious source of blood loss must be evaluated for occult gastrointestinal malignancy unless there is a clear reason not to do so. This is especially true for individuals &gt;50 years of age, females who are not menstruating, and those at increased risk of colorectal or other gastrointestinal cancers based on family history or other risk factors. The approach to endoscopy will vary with patient characteristics and practice patterns by the gastroenterology consultant. Many perform upper and lower endoscopy on all patients, with capsule endoscopy if those procedures are uninformative. An evaluation is not complete until a site of blood loss is found or until negative upper and lower endoscopy and capsule endoscopy results are found. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2606.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         The likelihood of a gastrointestinal source of bleeding such as colorectal cancer depends on the individual's age, other risk factors, and when (if ever) their most recent screening was performed. In a series of 142 adults referred to a single hospital system for iron deficiency anemia, nine (6.3 percent) had colorectal cancer [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         <em>
          Helicobacter pylori
         </em>
         (24 percent), and benign colon lesions such as hemorrhoids. There was one diagnosis of esophageal cancer. Only seven did not have a source identified. Those with a diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis have an increased incidence of gastric cancer requiring regular screening.

          Prevention
         </strong>
         – A normal healthy diet has sufficient iron to meet normal requirements. However, menstruating females require approximately 18 mg of iron daily (more with pregnancies and lactation), and the average daily intake of 13 to 14 mg may be insufficient to compensate losses [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         We have a low threshold for administering iron intravenously in older adults. In circumstances where intravenous iron may not be an immediate option (patient preference for a trial of oral therapy, third-party payor issues) oral iron may be used with the recognition that intravenous iron may ultimately be required if oral iron is poorly tolerated or ineffective.

         Oral iron should be administered no more frequently than once daily, and every-other-day therapy may be equivalent and likely more effective than once-daily dosing (see

         Lower doses of oral iron may be effective and at the same time cause less gastrointestinal toxicity. In a randomized trial in 90 hospitalized patients &gt;80 years of age who had iron deficiency anemia, daily doses of 15, 50, or 150 mg of elemental iron for two months were equally effective in raising hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations, while adverse side effects were significantly less common at the lower iron doses [

         Gastric bypass and other gastric surgeries, such as partial resection for ulcer disease or gastrectomy for gastric cancer, increase the risk of iron deficiency, as well as numerous other vitamin and mineral deficiencies. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanism is mainly due to the removal or bypass of intestinal tissues needed for nutrient absorption, particularly the duodenum, the richest source of ferroportin. For patients who have undergone gastric resection, reduced gastric acid production further contributes. In the stomach, iron is normally conjugated to compounds (amino acids, sugars,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9776" href="/z/d/drug information/9776.html" rel="external">
          vitamin C

         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Gastrectomy may also be associated with perioperative blood loss.
        </p>
        <p>
         We prefer IV rather than oral iron for most patients who have undergone gastric resection, Roux-en-Y, biliopancreatic diversion, or similar procedures, as it ensures adequate delivery and avoids gastrointestinal toxicities, which may be especially burdensome in these patients. Some patients, especially those having undergone minimally invasive procedures such as gastric banding, may tolerate oral iron. However, multiple gastrointestinal perturbations are often present, and IV iron may simplify care. For those for whom IV iron is not available, additional strategies for improving absorption and tolerability may be required. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Strategies to improve tolerability'

         We also prefer IV rather than oral iron for most patients who have anemia following gastrectomy for similar reasons. The efficacy of IV iron was demonstrated in a trial that randomly assigned 454 patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer and had anemia (hemoglobin from 7 to 10 g/dL) within the week after the surgery to receive IV iron (

There were no serious adverse events (mild to moderate urticaria and injection site reactions in 10 percent), and quality of life was similar between the two groups.

         Perioperative iron administration has been demonstrated to reduce the degree of anemia and in some cases to reduce transfusions in a variety of other types of surgery.

Although the manuscript did not define the transfusion protocol, and the transfusion rate was 30 percent, (twice the expected rate for abdominal surgery) there were no differences in the frequency of transfusion and/or death, or in the length of hospital stay, complication rate, or quality of life. Approximately one-fifth of participants were taking oral iron already, suggesting that iron deficiency may have been at least partially corrected, and at least one-fourth of participants did not have iron deficiency based on preoperative iron studies. The study was not powered to determine whether iron-deficient patients have a lower transfusion rate after preoperative IV iron; however, the results suggest that administration of IV iron to all anemic individuals does not necessarily reduce transfusion rates.

         IV iron is the current standard in dialysis-associated chronic kidney disease (CKD).

         Effective therapies for cancer-associated anemia include treatment of the malignancy, blood transfusion, and ESAs. For individuals with cancer who have iron deficiency and are receiving an ESA, we generally use IV iron due to its greater synergy with ESAs compared with oral iron [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,41

         Iron deficiency is not a problem during early stages of myeloproliferative syndromes, and iron should not be repleted in individuals undergoing therapeutic phlebotomy as a means of controlling polycythemia. An exception may be an individual with symptoms related to iron deficiency such as severe restless legs syndrome, pagophagia or pica, which may be treated with judicious use of oral (or sometimes IV) iron.

        <p>
         In contrast to the polycythemia, which characterizes early stages of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), individuals can develop iron deficiency anemia later in the course of an MPN. This is especially common in individuals with longstanding polycythemia vera (PV), who are likely to have been treated with multiple phlebotomies, as well as individuals with primary myelofibrosis. In these circumstances, the replacement of iron is prudent. In addition to iron deficiency, individuals with MPNs may also have a source of bleeding, which should be investigated, and/or concomitant deficiencies of vitamin B12 or folate, which should be addressed [

         The choice between oral and intravenous (IV) iron depends on a number of factors including the acuity of the anemia, costs and availability of different iron replacement products, as well as the ability of the patient to tolerate oral iron preparations  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106070" href="/z/d/graphic/106070.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Most patients are treated with oral iron because it is generally effective, readily available, inexpensive, and safe. However, up to 70 percent of patients for whom oral iron is prescribed (especially

         We generally treat patients with uncomplicated iron deficiency anemia with oral iron due to the ease of administration, as illustrated in the treatment algorithm  (

         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. There are several settings in which oral iron may be ineffective and/or poorly tolerated, and the safety of IV iron formulations is much improved over that seen historically with products such as high molecular weight

         (HMW ID), which was associated with anaphylaxis and shock, including fatal events, and which has been removed from the market. The availability of IV iron formulations with improved toxicity profiles has lowered the threshold at which many patients would consider switching from an oral to an IV preparation.

         We do not use enteric-coated or sustained-release capsules, which are poorly absorbed due to iron released too far distally in the intestinal tract; in some cases, the intact tablets are excreted in stool [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Iron absorption from the gut mucosal cells occurs via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), a protein localized to the duodenum and upper jejunum. Once in the cell, ferroportin transports the iron across the cell to the blood where it is bound by transferrin. We also do not use preparations such as the heme iron polypeptide ProFerrin, as these have not been evaluated clinically and their cost is greater.
        </p>

         Cost may also be a factor in the choice or oral iron preparation; there can be substantial cost differences among different preparations [

          Dosing schedule

         – There are two dosing schedules, with only marginal differences in efficacy; we believe clinicians and patients should choose the schedule that best suits them:

         Daily dosing (one dose per day). May be preferable for those who find it easier to remember taking a daily dose. In theory may provide overall more iron absorption due to the overall greater amount of iron per time period.

         Every other day dosing (one dose every other day or on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). May be preferable for those who wish to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. In theory may provide better absorption due to effects on hepcidin, as discussed in the supporting evidence for the dosing schedule.

         Intriguing findings from a 2015 study of the response of 54 iron-deficient females to daily oral iron suggested that giving multiple doses per day could cause a paradoxical decrease in iron absorption [

         ]. These individuals with depleted iron stores (ferritin ≤20 ng/mL) but without anemia were given various doses of oral iron that contained a traceable isotope to track absorption. Iron absorption was best when dosing was restricted to lower doses and less frequent administration (40 to 80 mg of iron no more than once a day). Higher or more frequent doses of iron raised circulating hepcidin levels and
         <strong>

Methodologic concerns included the patient population (some of the participants had ferritin &gt;200 ng/mL, suggesting microcytic anemia was due to thalassemia or anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation rather than to iron deficiency) and the relatively small response overall, suggesting concomitant causes of anemia that remained untreated, reduced adherence, or reduced absorption. Large prospective studies limiting eligibility to those with absolute iron deficiency are needed before any conclusions can be drawn.

         For many populations, another option is switching to IV iron. Use of IV iron eliminates all of the gastrointestinal side effects of iron, which are due to direct effects of iron on the intestinal mucosa. If the patient switches to IV iron, oral iron should be discontinued. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         IV iron may be cost effective in many of these settings. However, the vast majority of iron deficient patients worldwide will not have access to IV iron due to lack of infrastructure for its administration. Additionally, some for whom IV iron is appropriate may wish to avoid the potential risks of adverse reactions, including infusion reactions and potential anaphylaxis, shock, and death, although this risk is exceedingly low.
        </p>
        <p>
         For individuals who do have access to IV iron, administration may reduce the use of blood transfusion, which in turn avoids transfusion-associated risks. This was demonstrated in a 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis of trials that randomly assigned patients to IV iron versus oral iron or no iron [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. The administration of IV iron arm was associated with a lower frequency of blood transfusions (risk ratio [RR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.88). The meta-analysis included trials in a number of conditions, including chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, surgery, and pregnancy, among others (see
         <a class="local">
          'Patient populations'
         </a>
         above). Additional randomized trials published subsequently, such as a 2016 trial in 252 pregnant individuals, have also found that compared with oral iron, IV iron has similar efficacy in improving hemoglobin level and fewer adverse events, including markedly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72

         ]. (See

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Administration of IV iron should only be considered by those adequately conversant with the requirements for test dose, infusion rates, maximum allowed doses, need (if any) for premedication, and familiarity with minor infusion reactions. We avoid IV iron in patients with active infections, as many infectious agents thrive on iron, although evidence addressing this issue is lacking.

          Cost

         – The relative costs of IV iron products may vary depending on local institutional purchasing agreements. In the United States, LMW ID is relatively inexpensive (typically, less than one-third the price of

         – The choice of product may also be influenced by the frequency of office visits. As examples, patients undergoing dialysis or chemotherapy may have frequent office visits during which frequent low doses of FG or IS can be administered. In contrast, patients for whom frequent visits are not otherwise necessary may prefer products that can be administered in one or two visits, such as FCM,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9044" href="/z/d/drug information/9044.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with a history of a reaction to an IV product, many experts would switch to a different IV iron product. We have successfully used different IV products in patients with serious infusion reactions to one product. This is especially true for patients who have received HMW ID, which was associated with more frequent adverse events and is no longer in use.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our practice, we often use LMW ID because we treat nondialysis patients who often are seen for a single visit. We also use FCM and

         The dose of iron administered depends on whether the goal is to treat anemia or to fully replace iron stores. Generally, the dose is calculated based on body weight, current hemoglobin level, and amount of elemental iron per milliliter of the iron product. A sample calculation is provided in the figure  (

         ), and product information contains lookup tables based on patient weight and hemoglobin levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         In practice, there is no evidence that total doses above 1000 mg of elemental iron are clinically useful. This is supported by the results of the FIRM trial, in which a dose of 1020 mg of

         We often give a fixed dose of approximately 1000 mg, which is generally sufficient to treat anemia (typical red blood cell iron deficit between 500 and 1000 mg) and provide additional storage iron without causing iron overload. Whether this dose can be administered as a single (total dose) infusion or requires multiple infusions depends on the specific product.

         – LMW ID can be given as multiple doses of 2 mL (equivalent to 100 mg elemental iron, based on a concentration of 50 mg elemental iron per mL). Whereas this is the approved method, we generally do not use this dosing paradigm due to the multiple visits required and IV line insertions without added benefit of safety or efficacy [

          87

         ]. This may be given gradually over at least 30 seconds; we prefer to administer the test dose over five minutes while observing the patient. If no symptoms occur during the first 5 to 10 minutes, it is extremely unlikely that an infusion reaction will occur. After the test dose, we administer the remainder of a 1000 mg dose over the balance of one hour. Emerging data suggest that a test dose may not be necessary [

          Use considerations
         </strong>
         – Due to the risk of hypophosphatemia, we do not use FCM in individuals at risk of (or with) hypophosphatemia. This includes individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, bariatric surgery, excess alcohol, trauma or sepsis, diabetes, and impaired oral intake. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/830.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Some experts have suggested minimizing the use of FCM altogether due to this risk [

         <strong>
          Dosing
         </strong>
         – FCM can be given as a single dose of up to 1000 mg of elemental iron (20 mL of a solution of 50 mg elemental iron/mL). European product labeling specifies a maximum single dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight. Product labeling in the United States specifies a maximum single dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Doses of FCM may be given over a 15-minute infusion. In the United States, vial sizes of 750 mg and 1000 mg are approved for administration over 15 minutes [
         <a href="#rid107">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         As with all formulations, we start slowly, observe for signs of allergy or infusion reaction, and if not seen, administer the balance over 15 minutes. If appropriate, a second dose of 750 mg can be given on a different day. The United States package insert recommends a seven-day interval between 750 mg doses. However, this practice is not followed in most European countries, and there is no clinical evidence supporting it.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The mechanism of hypophosphatemia appears to involve increased urinary phosphate excretion caused by an increase in serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), a result of decreased degradation after administration of FCM. The mechanism remains undefined. Reduced levels of circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D occur with alterations in the parathyroid hormone (PTH) axis [

         IV iron has the potential to cause allergic reactions, including potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis. However, we believe these serious allergic reactions are exceedingly rare and vastly overestimated [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. We also believe the frequency of serious adverse events is comparable among products, based on published studies and our experience [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73,76
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast to serious allergic reactions, IV iron may be associated with non-allergic infusion reactions including self-limiting urticaria, palpitations, dizziness, and neck and back spasm; generally, these occur in &lt;1 percent of individuals and do not progress to more serious reactions [
         <a href="#rid94">
          94
         </a>
         ]. The non-allergic reaction consisting of flushing of the face and myalgias of the chest and back has been termed the Fishbane reaction [
         <a href="#rid137">
          137,138
         </a>
         ]. The mechanism remains unknown but may be due to activation of complement, referred to as complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (CARPA), by the labile free iron, leading to symptoms such as flushing, myalgias of the chest or flank, or sensations of fullness in the throat [
         <a href="#rid139">
          139-141
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Similar to allergic reactions, higher rates of non-allergic reactions were seen with high molecular weight (HMW)

          iron dextran
         </a>
         , which is no longer used. Trials involving IV iron product comparisons generally have shown similar rates of these infusion reactions between products. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choice of IV formulation'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, patients with a history of inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) commonly experience a flare of their arthritis during IV iron infusion, which is usually well-controlled with glucocorticoid premedication and/or a brief course of glucocorticoids (three to four days) following the infusion (see
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment or allergic and infusion reactions'
         </a>
         below). The cause of these exacerbations of inflammatory arthritis is incompletely understood but may involve effects of oxidant stress [
         <a href="#rid142">
          142
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Many clinicians are reluctant to use IV iron due to experience in the era before modern products were available, when allergic reactions (including severe reactions) were more common, as well as misunderstanding of the distinction between rate-related infusion reactions and true allergic reactions, which may have been challenging to distinguish when first encountered [

         <a href="#rid81">
          81
         </a>
         ]. In a typical scenario, myalgias, including chest and back discomfort, may be mistakenly ascribed to anaphylaxis, prompting administration of antihistamines and/or

         Further support for the impression that these infusion reactions are not allergic comes from our experience, in which we have measured serum tryptase levels at the time of the reaction, and have found these levels not to be elevated [

         There are no immediately available clinical parameters that can unequivocally distinguish between an infusion reaction (non-allergic, often rate-related) and an allergic/anaphylactic reaction, and the vast majority of publications have been unable to definitively distinguish between these reactions. In most cases, treatment may be the same, involving stopping the drug with close observation for minor reactions and aggressive interventions for life-threatening reactions (see
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment or allergic and infusion reactions'
         </a>
         below). While it is prudent to take all reactions seriously, we believe most reactions are due to infusional symptoms (rather than a true allergy) and should be managed as such.

         We believe these studies may have incorrectly estimated the frequency of serious reactions, since the criteria for anaphylaxis were based on medical coding data, spontaneous reporting, or surrogate measures that did not allow the investigators to determine whether administration of an antihistamine and wheezing preceded or followed iron administration (whether it was responsible for symptoms or occurred in response to a clinically validated hypersensitivity reaction) [
         <a href="#rid147">

         Bacteria and certain other infectious organisms require iron as a growth factor, and patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and iron overload are known to be at increased risk for certain serious bacterial infections [

        </p>
        <p>
         We believe the risk of infection with IV iron administration is negligible, and, if the risk is increased, it is counterbalanced by the benefits of correcting iron deficiency. Meta-analyses have found either no or a small increased risk of infection with IV versus oral iron or no iron (RRs from 1.17 to 1.33, with most lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals very close to 1) [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71,117,156

         <a href="#rid157">
          157
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, there does not appear to be a dose-response association between iron and infectious risk, and rates of mortality and other serious adverse events were not increased with IV iron treatment. While there may be value in informing patients about a possible increased risk of infection, this information should be balanced with information on the risks of not correcting iron deficiency.
        </p>

         Additional trials and observational studies in specific patient populations have not demonstrated increased infectious risks [

         Monitoring of patients receiving iron replacement depends on the severity of anemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients receiving oral iron, we often re-evaluate the patient two weeks after starting. We check the hemoglobin and reticulocyte count and review tolerability of the oral iron. In individuals with anemia, the hemoglobin should rise by at least 1 g/dL [
         <a href="#rid165">
          165
         </a>
         ]. For IV iron, we generally see patients four to eight weeks after the iron has been administered. We do not obtain repeat iron parameters for at least four weeks because IV iron interferes with most assays of iron status [
         <a href="#rid166">
          166
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If an individual has ongoing loss of iron (from chronic bleeding), management should focus on treating the bleeding rather than attempting to compensate for bleeding by providing chronic iron therapy. However, there may be instances when ongoing blood loss cannot be fully treated (eg, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, abnormal uterine bleeding), and these individuals may require frequent visits to establish an effective iron dose and teach the patient how to monitor ongoing blood loss. If these individuals tolerate oral iron, it is reasonable to take one tablet every other day or twice weekly; however, if there is a condition in which oral iron is ineffective or harmful (after gastric bypass surgery; in inflammatory bowel disease) or prior intolerance, we do not use maintenance oral iron. (See

         Iron is generally given until levels of ferritin and transferrin saturation normalize. Some individuals may require higher-than-average iron stores, such as a person with gastrointestinal telangiectasias who has frequent gastrointestinal bleeding. When ferritin and transferrin saturation are discordant, we place greater emphasis on the transferrin saturation (TSAT). Ferritin is an acute phase reactant and may be chronically elevated in individuals with concomitant inflammatory processes even when iron stores are low. Another option for monitoring that is under study is the reticulocyte hemoglobin (CHr) [
         <a href="#rid167">
          167
         </a>
         ]; this may also facilitate monitoring the response to treatment and assessment of the need for additional iron therapy. (See

         Total body iron stores in adults are generally in the range of 5 mg/kg in adult females and 10 mg/kg in adult males. Thus, correction of anemia plus repletion of iron stores may require up to a gram or more of elemental iron. (See

         For those who are taking the iron supplement and do not have an obvious explanation for lack of an increase in hemoglobin level and iron stores, it may be prudent to screen for celiac disease, autoimmune gastritis, and/or
         <em>
          H. pylori
         </em>
         infection, all of which have been implicated in reduced oral iron absorption. It has been reported that over one-half of patients with unexplained iron deficiency anemia are infected with
         <em>
          H. pylori

         , and patients with
         <em>

         infection have a pooled odds ratio of iron deficiency of 2.8 compared with uninfected individuals [

          168
         </a>
         ]. In a series of 150 patients with unexplained iron deficiency anemia, there were eight newly diagnosed cases of adult celiac disease (5 percent); 40 cases (27 percent) of autoimmune gastritis, 22 of which were associated with previously undetected vitamin B12 deficiency (27 and 15 percent, respectively); and 77 cases of
         <em>
          H. pylori
         </em>
         infection, 29 of which had
         <em>
          H. pylori
         </em>
         as the sole abnormality detected (55 and 19 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid169">

         -positive patients who had successful
         <em>

         eradication followed by administration of oral iron, 19 (73 percent) had a response, with mean increase in hemoglobin from 9.4 mg/dL to 13.5 mg/dL.
        </p>
        <p>
         Celiac disease in particular has additional management implications if present. (See

         Other individuals may have additional diagnoses, either initially misdiagnosed as iron deficiency, concomitant with iron deficiency, or rarely, developing during treatment of iron deficiency. Examples include nutrient deficiencies (vitamin B12, folate, copper), bone marrow abnormalities (myelodysplastic syndrome), inherited anemias (thalassemia, enzyme defects), hypothyroidism, other genetic conditions that affect iron balance such as iron-resistant iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), and disorders associated with chronic inflammation. Investigation for these (indications and appropriate testing) is discussed in separate topic reviews. The specific sequence and extent of testing for causes of lack of response is guided by the patient’s family history, medical history, and physical examination. (See

          Whom to treat
         </strong>
         – Regardless of the presence of symptoms, all patients with iron deficiency anemia and most patients with iron deficiency without anemia should be treated. The cause of iron deficiency also must be identified and addressed, especially in adults with new onset iron deficiency. A healthy diet provides sufficient iron for physiologic needs but cannot correct iron deficiency. (See

          Role of RBC transfusion

         – Patients with severe, severely symptomatic (eg, with symptoms of myocardial ischemia), or life-threatening anemia should be treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion  (

          Oral versus IV iron
         </strong>
         – Some conditions may affect iron dosing and/or the route of administration (oral versus intravenous [IV])  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106070" href="/z/d/graphic/106070.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). We generally treat patients who have uncomplicated iron deficiency anemia with oral iron due to the ease of administration, as illustrated in the algorithm  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131023" href="/z/d/graphic/131023.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). However, the availability of IV iron formulations with improved toxicity profiles has lowered the threshold at which many patients would prefer an IV preparation. We often use IV iron when treating pregnant individuals and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, gastric surgery, or chronic kidney disease. (See

          Dose and formulation (oral iron)
         </strong>
         – For the most part, all oral iron preparations are equally effective  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106069" href="/z/d/graphic/106069.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). Individuals treated with oral iron can choose between taking one tablet every other day (or on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) or one tablet per day. Efficacy between these two schedules appears similar; gastrointestinal side effects are more common with daily dosing. Strategies to improve tolerability are listed above. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Dose and formulation (IV iron)
         </strong>
         – There are a number of settings in which IV may be preferable to oral administration, including ongoing blood loss, physiologic or anatomic abnormality that interferes with oral absorption or iron homeostasis, and intolerable gastrointestinal side effects of oral iron. A number of IV iron formulations are available  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106130" href="/z/d/graphic/106130.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ); their dosing and administration are described above. (See

         <strong>
          Adverse effects of oral iron
         </strong>
         – Gastrointestinal side effects are extremely common with oral iron administration. Strategies to reduce these effects include reducing the frequency to every other day if not done already, dietary modifications, and switching to a liquid formulation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Side effects (oral iron)'

         <strong>
          Adverse effects of IV iron
         </strong>
         – Many clinicians are reluctant to use IV iron due to concerns about anaphylaxis. We believe true allergic reactions are exceedingly rare and vastly overestimated, largely due to experience with older products such as high molecular weight
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8574" href="/z/d/drug information/8574.html" rel="external">
          iron dextran
         </a>
         (HMW ID), which is no longer used, and the practice of aggressively treating non-allergic infusion reactions with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9369" href="/z/d/drug information/9369.html" rel="external">
          diphenhydramine
         </a>
         and other therapies that convert the reaction to a more serious event. We do not use routine premedication prior to IV iron and we avoid diphenhydramine. For individuals with asthma, inflammatory rheumatic conditions, or multiple drug allergies, we generally limit premedication to a glucocorticoid alone. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Allergic and infusion reactions'

         <strong>
          Expected response
         </strong>
         – Effective treatment of iron deficiency results in resolution of symptoms, a modest reticulocytosis (peaking in 7 to 10 days), and normalization of the hemoglobin level in six to eight weeks. Causes for a lack of response include nonadherence to oral iron, ongoing blood loss, and incorrect initial diagnosis or the presence of additional diagnoses  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56310" href="/z/d/graphic/56310.html" rel="external">
          table 10
         </a>
         ). Some of these additional diagnoses, such as celiac disease, may be especially important to evaluate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Response to iron supplementation'
         </a>
