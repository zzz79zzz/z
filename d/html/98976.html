         Shock is a life-threatening condition of circulatory failure that most commonly presents with hypotension. It can also be heralded by other vital sign changes or the presence of elevated serum lactate levels. The effects of shock are initially reversible but can rapidly become irreversible, resulting in multi-organ failure (MOF) and death. Thus, when a patient presents with undifferentiated hypotension and/or is suspected of having shock, it is important that the clinician rapidly identify the etiology so that appropriate interventions and therapy can be administered to correct the cause of shock and prevent MOF and death [

         This topic reviews the clinical presentation as well as the initial diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the adult patient with hypotension and suspected shock of unknown etiology (ie, undifferentiated shock). The definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock are discussed separately. (See

         Shock is defined as a state of cellular and tissue hypoxia due to reduced oxygen delivery and/or increased oxygen consumption or inadequate oxygen utilization. This most commonly occurs when there is circulatory failure manifest as hypotension (ie, reduced tissue perfusion). "Undifferentiated shock" refers to the situation where shock is recognized, but the cause is unclear.

         While patients often have a combination of more than one form of shock (multifactorial shock), four classes of shock are recognized  (

         The typical clinical features that raise the suspicion for shock include the following:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         <strong>
          Hypotension
         </strong>
         – Hypotension occurs in the majority of patients with shock. Hypotension may be absolute (eg, systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg; mean arterial pressure &lt;65 mmHg), relative (eg, a drop in systolic blood pressure &gt;40 mmHg), orthostatic (&gt;20 mmHg fall in systolic pressure or &gt;10 mmHg fall in diastolic pressure with standing), or profound (eg, vasopressor-dependent).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Importantly, patients in the early stages of shock can be normotensive or hypertensive, such that hypotension does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         have to be present for the diagnosis. Conversely, not every patient who has hypotension has shock (eg, chronic hypotension, autonomic dysfunction, vasovagal syncope, peripheral vascular disease).

         </span>
         <strong>
          Tachycardia
         </strong>
         – Tachycardia is an early compensatory mechanism in patients with shock. It can be isolated or occur in association with hypotension. Importantly, compared with older patients, younger patients develop severe and persistent tachycardia before becoming hypotensive late in the course of shock, a compensatory feature that frequently deflects attention away from the possibility of the presence of shock in this population. Given the frequency of beta-blocker use, awareness of concurrent medications is important to incorporate into the clinical assessment of suspected shock.

         <strong>
          Tachypnea
         </strong>
         – Tachypnea is an early compensatory mechanism in patients with shock and metabolic acidosis specifically. While elevations in respiratory rate are common amongst hospitalized patients [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ], it is a useful tool to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration, as evidenced by its incorporation into the quick Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>

         <strong>
          Oliguria
         </strong>
         – Oliguria in shock can be due to shunting of renal blood flow to other vital organs, direct injury to the kidney (eg, aminoglycoside toxicity), or due to intravascular volume depletion (eg, from vomiting, diarrhea, or hemorrhage).
        </p>

         <strong>
          Mental status changes
         </strong>
         – Altered sensorium in shock is usually due to poor perfusion or metabolic encephalopathy. It is a continuum that begins with agitation, progresses to confusion or delirium, and ends in obtundation or coma.
        </p>

         </span>
         <strong>
          Cool skin
         </strong>
         – Cool, clammy skin is due to compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction that redirects blood centrally, to maintain vital organ perfusion (ie, coronary, cerebral, and splanchnic flow). A cyanotic, mottled appearance is a late and worrisome feature of shock. However, the appearance of cool, clammy or cyanotic skin may also be due to, or exacerbated by, ischemia from underlying peripheral arterial vascular disease. Importantly, warm, hyperemic skin does not ensure the absence of shock because such an appearance may be present in patients with early distributive shock (prior to the onset of compensatory vasoconstriction) or terminal shock (due to failure of compensatory vasoconstriction).

         <strong>
          Metabolic acidosis
         </strong>
         – In general, the demonstration of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis should always raise the clinical suspicion for the presence of shock. Importantly, the presence of a metabolic acidosis in states of shock is not specific and can also be due to acute kidney injury or toxin ingestion. (See

         <strong>
          Hyperlactatemia
         </strong>
         – Either in conjunction with metabolic acidosis or not, the presence of an elevated serum lactate level has been associated with adverse outcomes, including the development of shock [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>

         The initial approach to patients with undifferentiated hypotension/shock is shown in the algorithms  (

          algorithm 1A-B
         </a>
         ). When feasible, a multidisciplinary, team-based approach is preferred because it allows the simultaneous evaluation and administration of therapy to patients with hypotension and shock. In brief:

         The airway should be stabilized, optimal oxygenation and ventilation assured, and adequate intravenous access secured so that patients can be immediately treated with intravenous fluids to restore adequate tissue perfusion. Importantly, resuscitative efforts, particularly intravenous fluids, should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be delayed for a detailed clinical assessment, nor should clinicians be conservative in terms of fluid resuscitation to patients with heart failure or kidney injury as a rule. Related to the latter point, liberal fluid resuscitation appeared to be life-saving in septic patients with intermediate serum lactate levels, a benefit derived amongst these traditionally underresuscitated sepsis subgroups [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         The first priorities are to stabilize the airway and breathing with oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation, when necessary. Intravenous access should be secured so that patients can be immediately treated with intravenous fluids to restore adequate tissue perfusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with respiratory distress and/or marked hemodynamic instability are typically intubated. The exception is those with suspected tension pneumothorax, where the prompt drainage of air from the pleural space may quickly reverse shock and avoid intubation (mechanical ventilation can worsen tension and precipitate cardiac arrest). Rapid sequence intubation is the preferred approach; agents that worsen hypotension should be avoided. (See

         Peripheral venous access (14 to 18 gauge catheters) or intraosseous access is sufficient for the initial evaluation and management of many patients with undifferentiated shock and hypotension. However, central venous access should be obtained in those in whom peripheral access cannot be obtained, in those who need infusions of large volumes of fluids and/or blood products or multiple intravenous infusions, or in those who are expected to need prolonged infusions of vasopressors. Central venous access may also be useful in patients who require frequent blood draws for laboratory studies and for hemodynamic monitoring (eg, central venous pressure, central venous oxyhemoglobin saturation).

         Patients with milder forms of shock/hypotension or critically ill patients who have been stabilized should undergo a thorough diagnostic evaluation while resuscitation continues. Sufficient time is typically available in such patients to obtain laboratory studies and definitive imaging so that a diagnosis can be made and appropriate therapy administered. However, the evaluation remains time-sensitive, as patients in this category are at risk of becoming hemodynamically unstable, such that a rapid redirection of the diagnostic and therapeutic strategy may be necessary.

Patients on mechanical ventilation may also have a sudden elevation in plateau pressures. Patients strongly suspected to have a tension pneumothorax do not require a chest radiograph and should have an emergent tube thoracostomy (24 or 28 Fr, 36 Fr for trauma; fifth intercostal space, midaxillary line) or needle decompression using a 14 to 16 gauge intravenous catheter (second or third intercostal space, midclavicular line) followed by immediate tube thoracostomy; tube thoracostomy is indicated should decompression fail.

         Ultrasound guidance is preferable for both diagnosis and tube placement.

For those on mechanical ventilation, positive pressure ventilation should be reduced. Radiographic confirmation of reexpansion should be performed after drainage (eg, ultrasonography, chest radiography). (See

         Pericardial tamponade should be suspected in patients with dyspnea, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, distant heart sounds, pulsus paradoxus, and known risk factors (eg, trauma, bleeding diathesis, known pericardial effusion, recent thoracic or pericardial procedure). The demonstration of an anechoic stripe and tamponade physiology on point-of-care (POC) ultrasonography or bedside echocardiography is preferred before pericardiocentesis. Ultrasonography also guides needle or catheter placement and examines the response to drainage of fluid from the pericardial sac. In rare cases, an emergency thoracotomy may be performed in those who are unresponsive to catheter drainage or in those who develop a cardiac arrest during resuscitation. (See

         A high clinical suspicion for the presence of shock is critical for diagnosis. An initial efficient and targeted history from prehospital or hospital providers, the patient, their relatives, and/or the medical record should provide ample information on a patient's risk for shock, as well as the potential etiology  (

         Lactate has been best studied in patients with sepsis where elevated levels &gt;2 mmol/L, and in particular those &gt;4 mmol/L are associated with increased mortality independent of organ dysfunction or hypotension.

         Although a leukocytosis may suggest septic shock, it is not specific for the diagnosis and may simply indicate a stress response. A low white blood cell count and especially a bandemia are more worrisome for sepsis in the setting of undifferentiated shock. As an example, in one observational study of 145 patients admitted to the intensive care unit with undifferentiated shock, infection was significantly more common among those with a band count greater than 10 percent than among those with a lower band count (odds ratio [OR] 8.7, 95% CI 3.4-22.4) [

          Coagulation studies and D-dimer level
         </strong>
         – Elevations in the prothrombin time or international normalized ratio as well as activated partial thromboplastin time may suggest a cause for underlying hemorrhagic shock but are also frequently elevated in patients with sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to nonspecific activation of the coagulation cascade, and liver disease. Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (elevated fibrin split products and D-dimer level with low fibrinogen level) can also be found in patients with severe shock. Elevated D-dimer levels are not specific for the diagnosis of PE but, when normal, can significantly reduce the probability of PE. A normal D-dimer level also significantly reduces the likelihood of aortic dissection [

Alternatively, a VBG may be obtained in any patient presenting with unstable blood pressure and concern for shock. The advantage of a VBG is that it can be obtained when the initial labs are drawn and will rapidly provide extensive data on the patient's pH, CO

         Hypoxemia can be due to obstructive shock from pulmonary embolism, cardiogenic shock from myocardial infarction, septic shock from pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting from shock. Compensatory hypocapnia can be seen in those with a metabolic acidosis. Hypercapnia may occur in patients with encephalopathy, brain injury, or increased dead space ventilation in patients with severe ARDS. Metabolic acidosis may be due to hyperlactatemia, acute kidney injury, or toxin ingestion. Additionally, a respiratory acidosis may occur in those obtunded from end-stage shock. (See

         Additional laboratory tests include those directed at specific etiologies or sequelae of shock. As examples, a toxicology screen may be useful in those suspected of having shock from drug intoxication, a type and crossmatch should be obtained in those with hemorrhage, and an amylase and lipase should be obtained in those with suspected pancreatitis. Urinalysis and gram stain of material from sites of possible infection (eg, blood, sputum, urine, wounds) or known organisms from prior cultures (eg,
         <em>
          Pseudomonas
         </em>
         in urine, clostridium difficile in stool) may provide a supportive clue to a possible source of sepsis. Tryptase and histamine levels are useful in those with suspected anaphylaxis. Urine electrolytes (sodium and creatine) should be obtained in those with hypovolemia. A peripheral smear may be useful in those suspected of having malaria, and fibrinogen levels and fibrin degradation products may be useful in those thought to have disseminated intravascular coagulation. A cortisol level or corticotrophin stimulation test may be helpful in those suspected to have an adrenal crisis, and thyroid function tests may identify those with suspected myxedema coma. (See

         – A portable chest radiograph is typically performed in most patients with suspected shock to detect common causes (eg, pneumonia) or complications of shock (eg, ARDS). A chest radiograph may be clear in hypovolemic shock or obstructive shock from PE. Alternatively, it may demonstrate a pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or widened mediastinum to support an etiology for septic shock, obstructive shock, cardiogenic shock, or aortic dissection, respectively. Chest radiography may also reveal free air under the diaphragm to suggest viscus perforation, which should prompt emergent surgical consultation and additional testing, usually CT of the abdomen and pelvis if the patient is stable, or immediate laparotomy if the patient is unstable.

         Should POC ultrasonography be nondiagnostic or unavailable, definitive imaging modalities should be used when feasible, of which comprehensive echocardiography is the most useful. Similarly, in the event of successful resuscitation from shock, follow-up testing with standard imaging is also prudent to confirm the diagnosis that was obtained by rapid bedside ultrasound.

         Advantages and disadvantages of POC ultrasonography in patients with undifferentiated shock include the following:

         <strong>
          Advantages
         </strong>
         – POC ultrasonography is portable, inexpensive, and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Its major advantage is the
         <strong>
          rapid
         </strong>
         examination of multiple organs, particularly the heart, to narrow the differential diagnosis and identify a potential etiology for shock. This feature is particularly valuable for patients in whom routine imaging is unsafe. Observational studies report that empiric diagnoses can be obtained within minutes when compared with standard imaging modalities. As an example, several studies have shown ultrasonography is more sensitive than portable chest radiography for the detection of pneumothorax, with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 86 to 100 and 92 to 100 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20-23
         </a>
         ]. The same studies also show reduced time spent obtaining imaging with ultrasonography (2 to 3 versus 20 to 30 minutes). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14888.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Additional advantages include the targeted application of lifesaving therapies (eg, pericardial drainage, chest tube insertion, thrombolytic therapy, peritoneal drainage, or lavage), and the safe performance of vascular access procedures (eg, central venous catheter insertion). Serial imaging can also follow the therapeutic response to interventions (eg, improved ventricle contractility following pericardiocentesis) and detect procedural complications (eg, ventricle perforation following pacemaker placement, pneumothorax following central venous catheter placement).

          Disadvantages
         </strong>
         – When compared with definitive imaging modalities performed by specialty-trained providers, the major disadvantage of POC ultrasonography is its limited sensitivity for many of the etiologies associated with shock. Limited sensitivity may be partially explained by the lack of standards regarding the training, performance, and indications for bedside ultrasonography.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         As an example, while POC ultrasonography is sensitive and specific for the detection of pericardial effusions [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>
         ], comprehensive echocardiography with additional views may be required for definitive diagnosis of tamponade, particularly when effusions are complex, loculated, or small. Additionally, regional wall motion abnormalities, valvular dysfunction, ventricular septal wall perforation, ruptured aortic aneurysms, and aortic dissection cannot be readily detected using limited bedside views. A meta-analysis of nine studies that compared FoCUS-assisted clinical assessment with clinical assessment alone reported that while FoCUS examination of the left ventricle and mitral valve was more sensitive than clinical assessment alone (84 versus 43 percent), its specificity was similar (89 versus 81 percent) [

         Most of the data that support the use of POC ultrasonography in patients with undifferentiated shock are extrapolated from patients with traumatic shock (see

         ). However, data from one randomized trial and several small observational studies have been published in patients with undifferentiated shock or hypotension. In general, these data demonstrate the identification of imaging abnormalities that narrow the differential diagnosis, confirm a clinically suspected diagnosis, prompt a change in management, and/or detect a complication from a therapeutic procedure rather than demonstrate a conclusive improvement in survival [

         Pulmonary arterial catheterization (PAC) has never been shown to improve patient-centered outcomes, such that the routine insertion of Swan-Ganz catheters has fallen out of favor [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38-40
         </a>
         ]. However, when the diagnosis or the type of shock remains undetermined or mixed, hemodynamic measurements obtained by PAC can be helpful  (

        </p>
        <p>
         The major hemodynamic indices measured on PAC are cardiac output (ie, cardiac index), systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (ie, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), right atrial pressure, and mixed venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (SvO
         <sub>
          2

         Because shock can be present when patients are hypotensive, hypertensive, or normotensive, the precise threshold that warrants hemodynamic support is unknown. In general, those with suspected shock who are hypotensive and/or have clinical or laboratory evidence of hypoperfusion (eg, change in mental status, clammy skin, diminished urine output, elevated lactate) should receive hemodynamic support with intravenous fluids (IVFs), followed by vasopressors, should IVFs fail to restore adequate tissue perfusion; the exception is hypovolemic shock where more fluids is preferred. While the optimal end-organ perfusion pressure is unclear, in general, we suggest maintaining the mean arterial pressure between 65 to 70 mmHg, since higher targets (eg, &gt;70 mmHg) do not appear to be associated with a mortality benefit and may be associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias [

         IVFs are first-line agents in the treatment of patients with undifferentiated hypotension and shock. We prefer to administer IVFs in well-defined boluses (eg, 500 to 1000 mL) over discrete time intervals (eg, over 15 to 30 minutes) using pressure bags in a manner that can be repeated until blood pressure and tissue perfusion are acceptable, pulmonary edema or intraabdominal hypertension ensues, or fluid fails to augment perfusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         The total volume infused is determined by the etiology of shock. As an example, patients with obstructive shock from pulmonary embolism or cardiogenic shock from LV myocardial infarction usually require small volumes of IVF (500 to 1000 mL), while those with RV infarction or sepsis often need 2 to 5 L, and those with hemorrhagic shock frequently require volumes &gt;3 to 5 L (often inclusive of blood products). The administration of diuretic therapy should be avoided in hypotensive patients with pulmonary edema until the need for hemodynamic support has been weaned.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal choice of fluid is unknown. However, extrapolating from patients with septic shock, most patients are treated with crystalloids (eg, Ringer's lactate or normal

         Vasopressors are frequently required in the treatment of patients with suspected/undifferentiated shock to restore adequate tissue perfusion. Importantly, the use of vasopressors in patients with hemorrhagic or hypovolemic shock may be harmful, such that vasopressors should only be used as an additional form of hemodynamic support when aggressive resuscitation has failed to restore adequate tissue perfusion, or as a last resort for patients in extremis.

         Vasopressor support should be titrated according to the response (ie, indices of tissue perfusion including blood pressure, urine output, mental status, and skin color) and limiting side effects (eg, tachycardia). In general, mean arterial pressure goals are targeted to 65 mmHg or greater, recognizing the importance of individualizing care. While targeting higher mean arterial pressures resulted in increased arrhythmia in patients with chronic hypertension, this complication was offset by reduced need for renal replacement therapy [

         A diagnosis of shock is based upon a constellation of clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic features. Most patients have hypotension and/or clinical signs of tissue hypoperfusion (eg, cold, clammy, mottled skin; oliguria [&lt;0.5 mL/kg/hour]; altered mental status) and hyperlactatemia (&gt;1.5 mmol/L). Noninvasive imaging and/or hemodynamic indices of low cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and/or mixed venous oxyhemoglobin saturation are not diagnostic but help to classify shock into one or more of the four main classes (distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99516" href="/z/d/graphic/99516.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, the diagnosis is dependent upon the clinical suspicion for shock. Shock should always be suspected in those with hypotension and hyperlactatemia, particularly in those with risk factors for specific forms of shock. Additionally, it should be suspected in those who present with normal blood pressure who have signs of compensatory tachycardia and/or peripheral vasoconstriction. (See

          Etiologic manifestations

         – Distinguishing the etiologies of cardiogenic shock depends upon the cause. Patients with cardiogenic shock from myocardial infarction (MI) may have crushing substernal chest pain, acute dyspnea with elevated cardiac isoenzymes, and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings of MI. Cardiogenic shock from arrhythmias may be sudden in onset with palpitations or syncope and may be evident on telemetry or ECG. A ruptured valve or septal defect may present with the manifestations of acute pulmonary edema and a new murmur in the setting of a recent MI. Patients with myocarditis may present with pleuritic chest pain and a pericardial rub.

          General clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Patients with obstructive shock usually have hypotension associated with distended neck veins but usually without the clinical signs of fluid overload or reduced preload. The exceptions are patients with subacute cardiac tamponade who often have evidence of fluid overload on examination. On bedside ultrasonography or echocardiography, an effusion with a small right and left ventricle and a dilated IVC may be seen in patients with pericardial tamponade; a dilated right ventricle and small left ventricle may be seen in patients with PE or pneumothorax.

         Importantly, many forms of shock coexist. As an example, hypovolemia may induce or coexist with cardiogenic shock and may result in discordant clinical, biochemical, imaging, and hemodynamic features (eg, low ejection fraction with dry mucous membranes and a collapsible IVC). In such cases, following the response to empiric therapies targeted at the suspected causes of shock may allow the clinician to determine which form of shock is predominant.

         Every attempt should be made to treat the underlying cause of shock. In some cases the etiology is clear (eg, hemorrhagic shock from a gunshot wound to the abdomen), but in other cases the etiology is less obvious (eg, obstructive shock from massive pulmonary embolism).

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Shock is defined as a state of cellular and tissue hypoxia due to reduced oxygen delivery and/or increased oxygen consumption or inadequate oxygen utilization. There are four classes of shock; distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and obstructive. The term “undifferentiated shock” refers to that where the state of shock is recognized but the cause is unknown. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1594.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – The clinical manifestations of undifferentiated shock vary according to the etiology and stage of presentation. Features that are highly suspicious for shock include hypotension; oliguria; abnormal mental status; tachypnea; cool, clammy skin; and metabolic acidosis (usually hyperlactatemia). Most clinical features are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of shock and are primarily used to narrow the differential diagnosis so that empiric therapies can be administered in a timely fashion.

         <strong>
          Emergency management
         </strong>
         – In patients with undifferentiated hypotension or shock, the airway and breathing should be stabilized with oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation, when necessary. Intravenous access should be secured so that patients can be immediately treated with intravenous fluids (IVF) to restore adequate tissue perfusion. Resuscitative efforts should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be delayed for diagnostic evaluation or for central venous catheterization  (

          Risk stratification
         </strong>
         – In patients with undifferentiated hypotension or shock, the clinician should stratify the patient according to the severity of shock and the need for immediate or early intervention so that empiric lifesaving therapies can be administered promptly. Such therapies include intramuscular

         (anaphylaxis), pericardiocentesis (pericardial tamponade), chest tube insertion (tension pneumothorax), surgical intervention (hemorrhagic shock, valve rupture, aortic dissection), cardioversion or pacemaker placement (life-threatening arrhythmias), intravenous antibiotics (sepsis), revascularization procedures (myocardial infarction), systemic thrombolysis (massive pulmonary embolism), and intravenous glucocorticoids (adrenal crisis).

         <strong>
          Clinical evaluation
         </strong>
         – Clinicians should take a thorough history and assess sensorium, mucous membranes, lips and tongue, neck veins, lungs, heart, and abdomen, as well as skin and joints. Bedside telemetry and/or electrocardiography should also be performed.

         <strong>
          Laboratory studies
         </strong>
         – Basic laboratory tests should be performed, including serum lactate level, renal and liver function tests, troponin-I or -T level and/or creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes, brain natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, complete blood count and differential, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer level, and blood gas analysis.

         <strong>
          Imaging
         </strong>
         – Portable chest radiography should be performed in most patients with undifferentiated shock. Point-of-care ultrasonography is typically used in patients in whom the diagnosis remains unclear after clinical assessment, in those in whom definitive imaging is unsafe, and to guide resuscitative efforts. Additional imaging modalities are targeted at discovering the etiology of shock (eg, CT of the chest).

         <strong>
          Hemodynamic support
         </strong>
         – Hemodynamic measurements obtained by pulmonary artery catheter can be helpful when the diagnosis or the type of shock remains undetermined  (

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         Patients with suspected shock should receive hemodynamic support with IVF (usually crystalloids in well-defined boluses of 500 to 1000 mL over discrete intervals using pressure bags), followed by vasopressors  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99963" href="/z/d/graphic/99963.html" rel="external">
          table 11
         </a>
         ), should IVF fail to restore adequate tissue perfusion. However, in patients with hypovolemic shock, we prefer to continue to administer fluids. While the optimal end-organ perfusion pressure is unclear, in general, we suggest maintaining the mean arterial pressure greater than 65 to 70 mmHg since higher targets may be associated with harm.

          Diagnosis

         – A diagnosis of shock is based upon a constellation of clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic features. Using data derived from the diagnostic evaluation, shock can typically be classified and the etiology narrowed to a few possibilities. (See
