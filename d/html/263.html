         Cricothyrotomy (also called cricothyroidotomy) is an infrequent procedure that involves placement of a tube through an incision in the cricothyroid membrane to establish an airway for oxygenation and ventilation. It is potentially life-saving in the patient with a "can't intubate, can't oxygenate" (CICO) situation during advanced airway management after non-surgical airway techniques have failed or as a primary technique when other non-surgical options are not felt to be appropriate. Conditions associated with a difficult airway that commonly necessitate cricothyrotomy include trauma (eg, facial fractures, traumatic airway obstruction), large amounts of blood or vomitus in the airway, trismus, obstructing lesions (eg, tumor, polyp), upper airway occlusion (foreign body, edema, anaphylaxis), failed orotracheal intubation, and congenital deformities [

         In a "can't intubate, can't oxygenate" (CICO) failed airway scenario, quickly establishing an airway is crucial since anoxic encephalopathy or death can occur within minutes of cerebral hypoxia.

          Role of extraglottic airway devices
         </strong>
         – Placing an extraglottic airway device (eg, laryngeal mask airway) should be attempted as a rescue maneuver or as a bridge to provide ventilation while preparations are made to perform a cricothyrotomy. If oxygenation cannot be maintained, the cricothyrotomy procedure should not be delayed further. (See

         <strong>
         </strong>
         Complete neuromuscular blockade (with appropriate sedation) increases the likelihood of successful tracheal intubation, face mask ventilation, and extraglottic airway ventilation and thus facilitates management of a failed airway situation. (See

          Fundamental considerations

         <strong>
          Will a cricothyrotomy effectively bypass the airway obstruction?
         </strong>
         As an example, if the obstruction is in the trachea distal to the cricothyroid membrane, performing a cricothyrotomy may not be effective. A surgical airway below the level of obstruction (eg, tracheotomy) may be the only way to establish oxygenation and ventilation.

         </span>
         <strong>
          Will the patient's anterior neck anatomy make the procedure particularly difficult or time consuming?
         </strong>
         A mnemonic for difficult cricothyrotomy is presented in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67468" href="/z/d/graphic/67468.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Which cricothyrotomy technique is to be used?
         </strong>
         The technique with which the operator is familiar and will work in all patients should be used. A CICO scenario is not the appropriate time to be making decisions on which technique to employ given the high-pressure nature of this procedure. Any delays in successfully performing a cricothyrotomy increase the risk of worse outcomes from hypoxemia. As such, the clinician should learn and be intimately familiar with a single cricothyrotomy technique that they have practiced ahead of time. Other considerations include the following:

         </span>
         We prefer the scalpel-finger-bougie technique for the default method since it is relatively simple, highly effective, and only requires equipment that is typically readily available in airway management situations. (See
         <a class="local">

         The rapid four-step technique can be performed quickly and with fewer steps but requires favorable anatomy in which the cricothyroid membrane can be easily and reliably identified. A tracheal hook is also required, which may not be readily available. (See
         <a class="local">

         The traditional open surgical technique involves more steps and requires equipment that may not be readily available such as a tracheal dilator (Trousseau dilator) and a tracheal hook. (See

         Commercially available cricothyrotomy kits typically use a Seldinger technique with a guidewire (eg, Cook Melker kit) or a prefabricated percutaneous device (eg, Quicktrach II). These conveniently contain all essential equipment but evidence regarding performance is limited. (See

         – The age at which a cricothyrotomy can safely be performed is not well established, and recommendations vary from 5 to 12 years old. Age is not the only consideration, and others include the child's size and physical maturity, state of health, external landmarks of the neck (eg, nonpalpable cricothyroid membrane), clinical findings, and presence of trauma. In general, the preferred surgical airway technique in a young child is transtracheal oxygenation with a large bore angiocatheter or a tracheotomy since the cricothyroid membrane is not well developed in children.

         Proper performance of a cricothyrotomy depends on understanding the relevant anatomy and the ability to identify the cricothyroid membrane (CTM), which is a relatively superficial anterior neck structure. Cricothyrotomy is guided by palpation rather than direct visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
         The boundaries of the CTM are the thyroid cartilage superiorly, the cricoid cartilage inferiorly, and the articulation of the inferior edge of the thyroid cartilage and the superior edge of the cricoid ring laterally, which forms a rigid circular opening  (

          Hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage

         ]. The vocal cords are within and protected by the thyroid cartilage. The hyoid bone lies cephalad to the thyroid cartilage. The hyoid bone can be mistaken for the thyroid prominence in patients without a prominent thyroid cartilage. Incisions in the thyrohyoid space are fraught with potential complications, such as damage to the vocal cords (since the incision and tube will be cephalad to them) or placing the tube too far posteriorly into the retropharyngeal space or esophagus.

         Even though point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can help identify the cricothyroid membrane (CTM), once a "can't intubate, can't oxygenate" (CICO) situation is encountered, it is too late to use ultrasound as this will waste critical time. In a patient with a high-risk airway, identifying the CTM with ultrasound before a CICO situation develops is a reasonable approach. We prefer the longitudinal string-of-pearls (SOP) technique, but the transverse thyroid-air-cricoid-air (TACA) can also be used [

With either technique, mark the CTM with the patient positioned how the cricothyrotomy will be performed (ie, head in extension unless concern for cervical spine injury) since the larynx is fairly mobile and can shift considerably with movement of the head and neck or change in angle of the head of the bed [

         ), in contrast to the typical tracheostomy tray, which may contain dozens of instruments. If not using a commercial cricothyrotomy kit (eg, Cook Melker kit, Quicktrach II), which contain all essential equipment, only a few instruments are required depending on which technique is performed:

         Cuffed tracheostomy tube – A number 4 Shiley tracheostomy tube (inner diameter of 5 mm and outer diameter of 9.4 mm) is preferred for most adults, as larger ones may be difficult to pass through the CTM. A standard tracheostomy tube kit often includes a tube with an inner cannula as well as a solid obturator  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef127992" href="/z/d/graphic/127992.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         The outer diameter of the tube determines whether the tube will fit properly. There is significant product variability depending on the manufacturer and type of tracheostomy tube. A smaller diameter tube increases difficulty ventilating and is more easily obstructed by secretions.

         Modified tracheal tube – If a tracheostomy tube is not available, use a standard tracheal tube. We suggest using a size 6.0 tracheal tube. The proximal portion of the tube can be cut off just before the point of entry of the pilot balloon tubing. This helps shorten the length of the tube to minimize the risk of endobronchial placement or accidental dislodgement. After the tube is cut, the 15 mm adapter must be removed from top part of the tube and placed onto the remaining shorter tube.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Eventually, the tracheal tube can be exchanged for a tracheostomy tube over a bougie. This should be deferred until the patient is stabilized and appropriate help is available since the airway can be lost during the exchange. The design of the tracheostomy tube makes it more secure and less likely to move in the airway.

         Position the patient supine on the stretcher, which can be in reverse Trendelenburg to raise the larynx above the level of the stomach and minimize the risk of passive regurgitation and aspiration. In the absence of a known or suspected cervical spine injury, the head should be extended to help maximize neck exposure. In a trauma patient with potential or known cervical spine injury, the patient's head should be in the neutral position, and efforts should be made to limit cervical spine movement.

         While assembling the equipment for the procedure, ask an assistant to administer high-flow oxygen, preferably by placing an extraglottic airway device (eg, laryngeal mask airway) or via bag-valve mask. Positive-pressure ventilation should be briefly paused once the CTM is incised to avoid blowing a mist of blood into the face of the proceduralist. (See

          PREFERRED TECHNIQUE: SCALPEL-FINGER-BOUGIE

        <p>
         In a patient who requires emergency cricothyrotomy, we suggest the scalpel-finger-bougie technique (also called the "bougie-assisted cricothyrotomy"). This technique is relatively simple, effective, and only requires readily available equipment  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef127051" href="/z/d/graphic/127051.html" rel="external">

         ]. Case reports and observational studies (including a surgical airway data-gathering application for smartphones) suggest a high success rate [

         The scalpel-finger-bougie technique is performed as follows:

          Step 1: Immobilize the larynx and palpate the cricothyroid membrane
         </strong>
         <strong>
          (CTM)
         </strong>
         – Stand at the patient's right side if you are right-handed, or at the patient's left side if you are left-handed. Immobilize the larynx with the nondominant hand and use the dominant hand to make the incision and pass the tube.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The procedure is largely tactile, so proper finger position is essential. Place the thumb and long finger of the non-dominant hand on either side of the thyroid cartilage to immobilize the larynx  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef127052" href="/z/d/graphic/127052.html" rel="external">
          picture 4
         </a>
         ). Palpate the laryngeal prominence at the midline of the cephalad rim of the thyroid cartilage with the index finger and then move caudally 1 to 2 cm until a small depression inferior to the thyroid cartilage is encountered. This is the CTM. Palpate the cricoid cartilage, which is at the inferior border of the CTM. Maintain manual control and immobilization of the larynx throughout the procedure to preserve the anatomic relationships.

          Step 2: Incise the skin vertically, repalpate the CTM, then incise the CTM horizontally
         </strong>
         – Make a generous 5 to 10 cm vertical incision in the skin overlying the CTM  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef127055" href="/z/d/graphic/127055.html" rel="external">
          picture 5
         </a>
         ). The midline skin incision avoids vascular structures located laterally. Additionally, the vertically orientated incision allows for easy extension superiorly or inferiorly should the initial location provide inadequate access to the CTM.
        </p>
        <p>

         <strong>
          Step 3: Insert the bougie through the incision into the trachea
         </strong>
         – Withdraw the scalpel and immediately insert an index finger through the horizontal incision, dilate the opening in the CTM, and then use the volar pad of the index finger to direct the bougie caudally down the trachea  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef141989" href="/z/d/graphic/141989.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). Alternatively, do not remove the scalpel, but rather use it as a stent to open the incision and insert the bougie through the opening next to the scalpel directing it caudally down the trachea  (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Confirmation of tracheal placement is suggested by feeling "tracheal clicks" as the bougie passes over each tracheal ring, or by encountering resistance if the bougie reaches the carina or bronchus. Do not intentionally advance the bougie until resistance is felt, as excessive force may perforate the mainstem bronchus. Since emergency cricothyrotomy is performed rarely and during crisis situations, the clinician may not appreciate the "tracheal clicks."

         <strong>
          Step 4: Pass the tracheal tube over the bougie into the trachea
         </strong>
         – Pass a 6.0 mm tracheal tube over the bougie and advance it into the trachea while maintaining control of the bougie with the other hand  (

          picture 10
         </a>
         ). Advance the tube about 6 to 8 cm, which would place it mid trachea in most adults (mean distance from the vocal cords to the carina is about 13 cm). Do not advance the tracheal tube too far, as it can easily pass into the right mainstem bronchus.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If a 6.0 mm tube will not fit through the CTM (due to variable size in adults), either copiously lubricate the bougie and pass a 5.5 mm tube, remove the bougie and pass a smaller tube (eg, 5.0 mm) directly through the incision into the trachea, or pass a pediatric bougie (if readily available) into the trachea and pass the smaller tube over the pediatric bougie. Most standard tracheal tubes 5.0 mm and smaller will not fit on a standard adult 15 French bougie, but a well lubricated 5.5 mm tube will pass over a 15 French relatively easily.

The scalpel is angled caudad to avoid injuring the vocal cords, which are located only 0.5 to 2 cm cephalad to the CTM and are only partially protected by the thyroid cartilage [

Overcome the resistance from the thyroid cartilage as it retracts downward and the cricoid cartilage as it retracts upward against the dilator.

         We do not prefer commercially available percutaneous trocar-type devices. These consist of a catheter over a large-bore needle and are designed to be rapidly inserted as a single unit without the need for a surgical incision. Some versions (eg, Quicktrach II) include a protective blocker on the needle intended to reduce the risk of perforating the posterior airway. Clinicians who choose to use one of these prefabricated devices should be familiar with the equipment and technique and practice the procedure in a non-clinical setting on a routine basis. A step-by-step discussion of each individual device is beyond the scope of this topic.

         Studies suggest that clinicians can perform cricothyrotomy reasonably quickly using the traditional open technique, but that the rapid four-step technique or the scalpel-finger-bougie technique may be faster. However, evidence is limited by lack of clinical trials, which are difficult to perform since this is an infrequent, unplanned, and time-dependent procedure. Available studies consist mostly of cadaver and animal models and report disparate findings. The time to completion and ease of performing cricothyrotomy ultimately depend upon the technique, patient, setting, and the training and experience of the clinician.

The development of massive subcutaneous air suggests the creation of a false tract from passage of the tube into an extratracheal location. This can occur if the tube was directed into the pre-tracheal or para-tracheal space by deflecting off the laryngeal cartilages after passed through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Ideally, placement into a false passage should be recognized quickly by lack of appropriate capnography or capnometry before significant subcutaneous air develops.

          Cricoid cartilage injuries from tracheal hook
         </strong>
         – Limited evidence suggests that the rapid four-step technique is associated with more complications, specifically cricoid cartilage injuries, compared with other techniques. The cricoid cartilage, instead of the thyroid cartilage, is lifted during the rapid four-step technique. The tracheal hook is placed under the anterior portion, which is the weakest and thinnest part of the cricoid cartilage and the most vulnerable to injury [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In one cadaver study, the rapid four-step technique caused more major complications (eg, complete transection of the cricoid cartilage, posterior tracheal or esophageal perforation; 9 versus 3 percent) but had the same overall rate of complications (38 percent) compared with the traditional open technique [
         <a href="#rid43">

         Use flexible connector tubing to attach the tracheal tube to the ventilator or bag valve device to avoid traction on the tracheal tube. Apply a dry tracheostomy dressing over the incision. Obtain a portable radiograph chest radiograph to check tube position. It is reasonable to prophylactically administer an antibiotic with skin and oropharyngeal flora coverage (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8745" href="/z/d/drug information/8745.html" rel="external">
          ampicillin-sulbactam
         </a>
         ). Ensure the patient has adequate sedation and analgesia and appropriate ventilator settings. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Ensure that the tracheal tube does not become accidentally dislodged since finding the cricothyroid membrane and replacing the tube is not a simple procedure. An assistant should be assigned to stabilize the tube during any patient transfers. Suction the tracheal tube every two to three hours and also as needed for airway clearance. After-procedure care is similar to postoperative care for tracheostomy tubes. (See

         </span>
         Clinicians responsible for airway management must be facile with at least one cricothyrotomy technique, thus skill acquisition and maintenance are vital. Because cricothyrotomy is a rarely performed but potentially life-saving procedure of last resort, we suggest that emergency clinicians review the anatomy and practice with the equipment needed for cricothyrotomy on a regular basis (eg, every three to six months) to maintain skill competency. Practice can be obtained with low fidelity airway models. A systematic review found that general procedural skill retention declines after 3 months and continues to decline after 6 and 12 months [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. A study of skill retention in medical students following a simulation-based cricothyrotomy training found that skills decayed as early as by one month and that by six months, none of the participants had a passing performance [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We also suggest that clinicians maintain familiarity with the surface anatomy by regularly palpating the structures of the anterior neck when examining patients. Identifying the cricothyroid membrane requires regular practice and lack of familiarity can make it difficult to find quickly, particularly during an airway emergency. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Surface anatomy of the anterior airway'

         above.)
        </p>

         Cricothyrotomy is infrequently performed, and rates vary among different providers and settings. The National Emergency Airway Registry (NEAR) study found that, of the 17,583 adult intubations performed in emergency departments over a 10-year period, 0.14 percent (about 25 patients) received a primary surgical airway and 0.31 percent (about 55 patients) received a rescue surgical airway [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63

         ]. An emergency medical services-based study reported that, of the 57,209 patients requiring advanced airway management in the prehospital setting, 0.5 percent (286 patients) underwent cricothyrotomy [

          General considerations for patient selection
         </strong>
         – Cricothyrotomy is indicated when a failed airway has occurred and a "can’t intubate, can’t oxygenate" (CICO) situation develops. Occasionally, a cricothyrotomy is performed as a primary technique when other techniques are felt unlikely to be successful or too risky. Placing an extraglottic airway device (eg, laryngeal mask airway) may be attempted as a rescue maneuver or as a bridge to provide ventilation while making preparations for cricothyrotomy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General considerations in failed airway scenario'

         <strong>
          Contraindications
         </strong>
         – There are no absolute contraindications to emergency cricothyrotomy in adults, but it should not be performed in children &lt;10 years old. Relative contraindications include complete transection of the trachea and laryngotracheal disruption with retraction of the distal trachea into the mediastinum. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Contraindications and precautions'

         <strong>
          Anatomy
         </strong>
         – The boundaries of the cricothyroid membrane (CTM) are the thyroid cartilage superiorly, the cricoid cartilage inferiorly, and the articulation of the inferior edge of the thyroid cartilage and the superior edge of the cricoid ring laterally, which forms a rigid circular opening  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82088" href="/z/d/graphic/82088.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Emergency cricothyrotomy is guided by palpation rather than direct visualization because following the initial incision, the surgical field is usually too bloody to see the relevant anatomy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical anatomy'

          Preferred technique
         </strong>
         – In a patient who requires emergency cricothyrotomy, we suggest the scalpel-finger-bougie technique (also called the "bougie-assisted cricothyrotomy") (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). This technique has a high success rate, a minimal number of steps, can be rapidly executed, and will work in all adult patients (including those with impalpable anatomy). It requires equipment that is rapidly and always available, including a scalpel, tracheal tube introducer ("bougie"), and tracheal tube  (

         – In addition to not accessing the airway, other early complications include laceration of the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, or tracheal rings; perforation of the posterior trachea; unintentional tracheostomy; and passage of the tube into an extratracheal location (subcutaneous air that develops with ventilation is a warning). Bleeding occurs early, is usually not severe, and can be controlled by packing the site with gauze. (See
