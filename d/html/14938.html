         Embolism to the upper extremities refers to the transit of material from a location outside the extremity into and lodging within one of the upper extremity arteries. The material may arise from any of a variety of sources and cause a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from no clinically appreciable downstream effects to acute and profound ischemia with the potential for amputation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of embolism to the upper extremities is reviewed. Embolism affecting the lower extremity is reviewed separately. (See

         Perfusion to the upper extremity originates with the subclavian artery, branching off the innominate artery on the right and directly off the aortic arch on the left. Variations exist but occur infrequently (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54048" href="/z/d/graphic/54048.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Several branches arise from the proximal subclavian artery, including the vertebral artery, internal mammary artery, costocervical artery, and thyrocervical trunk. These branches supply the shoulder and ipsilateral chest wall (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138521" href="/z/d/graphic/138521.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). As the subclavian artery passes over the first rib and behind the anterior scalene muscle, it becomes the axillary artery. The first part of the axillary artery, before it passes behind the pectoralis minor muscle, provides an inferiorly oriented superior thoracic artery. The second part of the axillary artery gives off the thoracoacromial artery and the lateral thoracic artery as it courses posterior to the pectoralis minor. The third part of the axillary artery, distal to the pectoralis minor muscle, provides three branches, including the subscapular artery and anterior and posterior circumflex humoral arteries.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thereafter, the axillary artery transitions into the brachial artery, which first gives off the profunda brachii, superior and inferior ulnar collateral arteries, and finally divides into its terminal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries. Throughout the upper extremity, from subclavian to palmar arch, a collateral network provides redundancy of blood flow (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66933 graphicRef127885 graphicRef121609" href="/z/d/graphic/66933.html" rel="external">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Anatomic anomalies exist, including aberrations in the bony anatomy, which can affect the risk of embolization. As the subclavian artery arises from the thorax and enters the thoracic outlet, it crosses over the first rib. In less than 1 percent of the population, a cervical rib is present (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50430" href="/z/d/graphic/50430.html" rel="external">

         ), originating from the seventh cervical vertebrae. When present, it is sometimes long enough to fuse to the first rib [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. These occasional bony anomalies are associated with arterial thoracic outlet syndrome and have bearing on the risk of embolization. In the presence of these anatomic aberrations, the rich collateral circulation to the upper extremity can mitigate the ischemic consequences of embolic phenomenon.

In the general population, the incidence of PFO is approximately 0.2 percent, with only a small minority ever experiencing thromboembolic complications as a result [

         Among non-native arterial sources, surgically placed conduits proximal to or within the upper extremities can bear thrombus that can dislodge into the circulation of the upper extremities. Clot and atherosclerotic debris in the proximal anastomosis of an axillary-to-femoral bypass, in carotid-to-subclavian bypass, or within a thrombosed arteriovenous (AV) fistula or AV graft can contain embolic material for distal embolization (

         In the presence of a congenital or acquired bony abnormality of the thoracic outlet, in particular a cervical rib or clavicular fracture, anatomic aberrations of the subclavian artery can form. Consequences of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) can include subclavian artery dilation and aneurysm, stenosis, and ulceration of the subclavian artery, all of which have the potential for thromboembolic complications to the upper extremities. Less frequently, retrograde thromboembolism can occur via the vertebral artery, leading to posterior stroke [

         Another entity known as vascular quadrilateral space syndrome is associated with upper extremity embolism. This syndrome has been observed in individuals who regularly perform repeated overhead motions, as with some patients who develop TOS. In contrast to arterial TOS, repetitive vascular trauma associated with quadrilateral space syndrome leads to aneurysmal degeneration or dissection of the circumflex humeral branch of the axillary artery, creating potential for distal embolization [

         Given the frequency with which a cardiac etiology is implicated as the source of embolism, any history of cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or valvular pathology should be noted [

         A complete examination of the patient, with a focus on the cardiovascular system, should be performed. The symptomatic extremity may demonstrate a cool, pale arm. Distal arterial Doppler signals will typically be absent in the acutely ischemic arm, with preservation of the venous Doppler signals until the ischemic state has progressed to the point of irreversibility. A sensorimotor exam facilitates classification of acute ischemia (

         Because the patient must be initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation, baseline coagulation studies should be obtained. In addition to prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and INR, a fibrinogen level will be necessary if thrombolytic therapy will be used.

         The decision to pursue vascular imaging is based upon the level of suspicion regarding the diagnosis of arterial embolism and the need for information to guide preprocedure planning. Multiple imaging modalities exist, each with individual merits and drawbacks. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography is typically the preferred means of initial imaging (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef135083" href="/z/d/graphic/135083.html" rel="external">
          image 2

        </p>
        <p>
         CT angiography can be completed quickly, which is a significant benefit in patients with acute limb ischemia. Although the upper extremity arterial circulation can generally be seen with the CT angiography, its sensitivity for the distal arterial branches may be diminished. This is of particular concern when the transit of contrast is impeded by the presence of embolus or chronic atherosclerotic plaque. Notwithstanding the need for a large contrast bolus with its potential nephrotoxic effects, CT angiography can provide a detailed roadmap for surgical planning, localizing the sites of embolic fragments, presence of coexisting atherosclerotic disease, targets for possible bypass, and any coexisting pathology that may have been the source of emboli [
         <a href="#rid45">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Duplex ultrasound has been used in the context of suspected arterial thromboembolism to image the arterial segments of greatest concern, most often when the risk of large-dose contrast administration is prohibitive. While duplex ultrasound negates the need for contrast, it may not be as readily available as CT angiography, requires a longer time to obtain images of adequate quality, and is largely operator dependent. Ultrasonography has the benefit of demonstrating dynamic flow characteristics and can provide a better sense of the distal arterial circulation, even in the presence of proximal embolic or atherosclerotic disease [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography is generally not the optimal study in suspected arterial embolism to the upper extremity and is not typically selected as the initial imaging modality. In the setting of acute limb ischemia, MR angiography may require a prohibitively long time to complete. While it negates the need for iodinated contrast as used for CT angiography, the administration of gadolinium as a contrast agent has the associated risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with renal disease [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46

        <p>
         Although not typically used as the first means of imaging, digital subtraction angiography is frequently used for intraoperative imaging when angiography is needed to guide therapeutic maneuvers. Contrast administration is necessary but can be given in small volumes while focusing on localized arterial segments, providing a focal assessment of flow dynamics and the pattern of disease from various angles.

         However, open surgical exposure is not without morbidity, including pain, the risk of damage to surrounding neurovascular structures, and the risk of subsequent thrombosis due to manipulation during the procedure despite best efforts to maintain patency.
        </p>
        <p>
         Endovascular techniques are being used with increasing frequency. However, the delayed clearance of thrombotic material such as during catheter-directed thrombolysis can be prohibitive in acutely ill patients, particularly in those with multiple comorbidities, and in those with an immediately threatened upper extremity. The majority of endovascular interventions are performed using percutaneous access, commonly achieved at the femoral vessels in the groin. Options for percutaneous access are limited if vascular patency is poor or atherosclerotic disease burden is extensive throughout the femoral, iliac, aortic, and subclavian vessels. Endovascular procedures can be easily performed under local anesthesia, which is an advantage particularly in a patient with significant physiologic derangements. Risks associated with endovascular intervention include vessel injury such as dissection and perforation, potential nephrotoxicity related to contrast administration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Often, open surgical and endovascular approaches (ie, hybrid procedure) can be used in the same operative setting, providing complementary information and therapeutic maneuvers. Still, the surgeon needs to weigh the risks and benefits of each approach prior to committing a patient to one therapeutic modality or another.

         After revascularization, reperfusion of the upper extremity may result in significant swelling. This is of particular concern when the limb has remained ischemic for a prolonged time [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Upon revascularization, various inflammatory processes ensue. These include activation of immune-mediated cells, release of oxygen-free radicals, and overwhelming of innate mechanisms that control antioxidants, metabolize carbon dioxide, and limit endothelial damage.
        </p>
        <p>
         Compartment syndrome will ultimately develop if these inflammatory processes continue, causing swelling of the surrounding tissues within their fascial compartments. If unabated, the swelling can cause muscular compromise, cessation of venous outflow, and ultimately cessation of arterial inflow. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/358.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, with ischemia of prolonged duration, compartment release after revascularization by means of prophylactic fasciotomies should be strongly considered. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In the upper extremity, if fasciotomies are not performed in the index setting, the volar, dorsal, and hand compartments should be monitored closely for compartment syndrome and the need for fasciotomy.

         When clinical evaluation has deemed the upper extremity to be irreversibly ischemic, attempts at revascularization have the potential to cause severe metabolic disturbances with associated cardiovascular and hemodynamic consequences. Exam findings concerning for irreversibility of ischemia include a mottled arm without pulses or sensation and muscle rigor (

         Surgical embolectomy, thrombolysis, and transcatheter embolectomy are tools that are used with varying frequency to clear embolic debris from the upper extremity. Open embolectomy is the most common means of restoring perfusion to the upper extremity but is frequently combined with endovascular techniques in a hybrid approach to provide best outcomes.

         Open thromboembolectomy has historically been the standard approach to upper extremity revascularization for acute limb ischemia of embolic origin.

         When embolic debris has lodged in the upper extremity arteries distal to the axillary artery, the most advantageous site of exposure for access in anticipation of a mechanical thromboembolectomy is at the brachial bifurcation. At this site, the surgeon can easily direct a Fogarty balloon catheter into the brachial artery and its branches. The placement of a three-centimeter transverse skin incision overlying the brachial bifurcation can be facilitated by identification of bony landmarks in close proximity to the bifurcation on preoperative cross-sectional imaging or by performing a duplex ultrasound of the extremity while the patient is on the operating room table. Use of imaging to assist with placement of the initial incision is helpful, as deviations from normal brachial artery bifurcation patterns occur in approximately 30 percent [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Thereafter, dissection is carried out onto the neurovascular structures, opening the brachial sheath. The brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries are isolated and controlled.
        </p>

         If not previously given, a bolus of heparin should be administered to a goal activated clotting time greater than 250 (may vary depending on institutional calibration).
        </p>
        <p>
         Creation of a transverse arteriotomy in the anterior brachial artery allows for primary closure after completion of the embolectomy. However, in the presence of significant disease in the brachial artery, a longitudinal incision can be made with later closure using patch angioplasty to reduce the risk of flow-limiting stenosis. Passage of a #3 Fogarty balloon catheter up the brachial artery and a #2 Fogarty catheter down each forearm branch vessel will allow extraction of embolic material. Caution is advised because the balloon catheter can cause intimal trauma and dissection when pushed or pulled against resistance. It is important not to overinflate the balloon. Therefore, any resistance must be appreciated and responded to as the catheter passes intraluminally. At least two passages of the catheter should be performed with no intraluminal thromboembolic debris extracted and adequate backbleeding from the vessel obtained in order to have confidence in the success of treatment. Once balloon catheters are passed in each direction with return of brisk backbleeding, the arteriotomy is closed, and the distal pulses are reevaluated. If adequate backbleeding is not appreciated, a thrombolytic agent (eg, tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase) can be used to directly clear any residual thrombus [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48

         Areas of chronic disease may necessitate balloon angioplasty, stenting, or open intervention. If flow terminates prematurely and cannot be otherwise restored to the end arteries, radial or ulnar cutdown may be necessary to remove resistant thrombus. Alternatively, a bypass with or without patch angioplasty may become necessary to adequately revascularize the extremity. Such situations are uncommon given the relative rarity of atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease affecting the upper extremity.

         Embolic debris lodged at sites proximal or distal to the brachial artery can still be accessed and extracted through an arteriotomy adjacent the brachial bifurcation using appropriate length and caliber Fogarty embolectomy catheters. However, when complete clearance of debris is unable to be performed through this site, alternative or additional incisions can be made overlying the area of concern.

        <p>
         Furthermore, if an obvious source of embolic material is identified pre- or intraoperatively (eg, thrombus from occluded bypass graft), therapeutic maneuvers such as surgical ligation or removal of a thrombosed bypass graft should be anticipated to minimize the risk of further embolization from this site. The etiology of embolism is not frequently identified in the preoperative setting, and any surgically treatable etiology is often treated in a staged fashion.

         Catheter-directed thrombolysis has not been used as often as open embolectomy for revascularization of the upper extremity, although it represents an acceptable alternative for patients with very early stages of ischemia (

         ]. The thrombolytic agent must infuse through the intraluminal catheter for 24 to 48 hours to have the greatest effect in clot clearance, which is much longer compared with open brachial thromboembolectomy. Thus, this is appropriate only for patients with a viable or marginally threatened extremity. Techniques for thrombolysis are reviewed separately. (See

         Depending on the embolic source, placement of a sheath and thrombolysis catheter in the thoracic aorta may contribute more risk than benefit. Wire manipulation in the presence of an aortic atheroma may cause further embolism. In addition, retraction of the lysis catheter and sheath from its original position embedded in the thromboembolic site in the upper extremity poses the risk of intracranial bleeding from flow of the thrombolytic agent into the intracranial circulation. Nevertheless, catheter-directed thrombolysis remains an alternative for patients whose exam does not demonstrate an immediately threatened limb and whose arterial circulation proximal to the extremity has a very limited amount of atherosclerotic disease.

         Transcatheter embolectomy does not require pharmacologic thrombolytic agents or a prolonged duration of intraluminal device positioning. This reduces some of the risks inherent to pharmacologic thrombolysis while avoiding the potential morbidity of open surgery. This approach is used with increasing frequency and can be easily combined with other endovascular tools to provide clearance of embolic debris and correction of underlying disease to revascularize the upper extremity.

         Transcatheter embolectomy still requires passage of an intraluminal device in or adjacent the aortic arch, with its implicit risk of further embolization in the presence of aortic atheroma (cerebral, extremity). Vascular access is obtained percutaneously using ultrasound guidance, typically at the common femoral artery, and a wire and aspiration device are passed to the affected upper extremity. A suction effect is created just proximal to the site of embolic obstruction.

          Etiologies

         – Cardiac etiologies account for the majority of emboli traveling to the upper extremity. Other proximal arterial sources, iatrogenic etiologies, and hypercoagulability may predispose to embolism in the absence of a cardiac source. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has arisen as a potential provoking cause of arterial thromboembolism. (See

         </strong>
         – For upper extremity embolism, we suggest open thromboembolectomy, rather than percutaneous methods for revascularization (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Open thromboembolectomy can be quickly performed typically using an incision overlying the brachial artery bifurcation. Passage of embolectomy catheters proximal and distal effectively removes thrombus and debris. Catheter-directed thrombolysis and transcatheter embolectomy are alternative methods that require additional time that can be prohibitive for patients with a threatened upper extremity (

         ). (See

         <strong>
          Fasciotomy
         </strong>
         – Prophylactic fasciotomies may be indicated to prevent the development of compartment syndrome depending on the duration of ischemia and progress of symptoms prior to revascularization. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Reperfusion and potential need for fasciotomy'

         <strong>
          Preventing future embolic events
         </strong>
         – After upper extremity revascularization, identification of the origin of embolic debris with further imaging and laboratory evaluation should be completed with subsequent staged intervention, when indicated, to mitigate the risk of future embolic events. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prevention of future embolic events'
