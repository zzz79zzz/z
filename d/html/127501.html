         At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

          INFECTION PREVENTION IN THE HEALTH CARE SETTING

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         Infection prevention interventions to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 include universal source control (eg, covering the nose and mouth to contain respiratory secretions), early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with COVID-19, hand hygiene, and environmental disinfection. Discussions of screening and universal use of masks are presented elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130296.html" rel="external">
          "COVID-19: General approach to infection prevention in the health care setting", section on 'Screening prior to and upon entry into the health care facility'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Limiting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. In an early report of COVID-19 in 138 patients from China, it was estimated that 43 percent acquired infection in the hospital setting [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In Washington State, suboptimal use of infection prevention procedures contributed to the spread of infection to 81 residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors in one long-term care facility [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the exact risk of acquiring COVID-19 in the health care setting remains unclear. As an example, while some reports have found a higher proportion of COVID-19 cases among health care personnel (HCP) in patient-facing roles [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ], others have found that infection rates among HCP often appear to parallel those of the general population [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-10
         </a>
         ]. In a serologic survey of 10,275 HCP, factors most strongly associated with seropositivity were contact with a person with known or suspected COVID-19 outside the workplace (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.6), being of a Black population (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.6), and the incidence of COVID-19 in the community (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.2) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. In this study, HCP who cared for patients with COVID-19 and those who worked in areas where aerosol-generating procedures were routinely done were not more likely to be seropositive, but these estimates were imprecise.

         This section will review the infection prevention precautions that should be used when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Type of room'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Type of PPE'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Transporting patients outside the room'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The same infection prevention policies and precautions should be used for HCP and patients who have received multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccines [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported in fully vaccinated HCP, and there are higher rates of breakthrough infections with certain variants (eg, Omicron), which have become the dominant variants in many countries at various points during the pandemic. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">
          "COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Risk of reinfection'

          "COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Variants of concern'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, the approach to infection prevention should be the same for those with prior COVID-19. Although the risk of reinfection within the first three months after having COVID-19 is low, cases of probable reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 during this time frame have been reported, particularly with the Omicron variant. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">
          "COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Risk of reinfection'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In areas of ongoing transmission, enhanced infection prevention precautions (eg, respirators for aerosol-generating procedures, eye protection [eg, face shields] in addition to universal masking) should be used when caring for all patients, regardless of the individual suspicion for COVID-19. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130296.html" rel="external">
          "COVID-19: General approach to infection prevention in the health care setting", section on 'Precautions for those NOT suspected of having COVID-19'

         Patients should be placed in a well-ventilated single-occupancy room with a closed door and dedicated bathroom [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. When this is not possible, patients with confirmed COVID-19 can be housed together; for patients who are antigen positive, the diagnosis should be confirmed with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         An airborne infection isolation room (AII; ie, a single-patient, direct out-exhausted air, &gt;6 to 12 air exchanges per hour, negative-pressure room) should be prioritized for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. When AII rooms aren't available, HEPA filters can be used for aerosol generating procedures. Additional information on AII rooms and what to do when these are not available is found below. (See
         <a class="local">

         All HCP who enter the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Standard PPE for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 includes the use of a gown, gloves, ideally a respirator (minimally, a medical mask), and eye or face protection:

         <strong>
          Gown and gloves
         </strong>
         – Isolation gowns and nonsterile gloves should be put on upon entry into the patient room or area. Caregivers should perform hand hygiene after removing and before putting on gloves.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Some institutions require double gloving for HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to reduce the risk of skin contamination when doffing. However, we do not endorse this approach since there are insufficient data to support the routine use of double gloving. Although experimental data suggest double gloving may reduce skin contamination with viral particles [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ], it remains unclear whether this further reduces transmission. In addition, the practice may have unintended consequences if guidelines are not followed strictly. As an example, in one report, the practice of double gloving on a COVID-19 unit was implicated in an outbreak of
         <em>
          Candida auris
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid14">

         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         On dedicated COVID-19 units, gowns do not need to be routinely changed between patients unless the gown is soiled or the patient requires additional contact precautions (eg, for a drug-resistant organism), in which case a new gown should be used. However, gowns and gloves should not be worn into common spaces (eg, workstations).

          Respirator or medical mask

         – A medical mask or respirator should be used when caring for a person with COVID-19. In the health care setting, available data support the benefit of using respiratory protection when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 [

         We also suggest the use of respirators when providing routine care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 as there is evidence that airborne transmission may occur, especially high-velocity, small-particle aerosols generated by coughing and sneezing with particles that remain airborne for longer and travel farther than usual respiratory droplets.

         However, data supporting the use of respirators for routine care of persons with COVID-19 are conflicting [

          17,18,20-22

         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18

         ]. By contrast, other studies seem to suggest no advantage of respirators over masks for routine care, although the quality of this evidence is poor and the benefit of wearing a respirator versus a mask varies by subgroup. As an example, in a multicenter prospective cohort of 3259 HCP, the use of a respirator was not significantly associated with a decreased risk for SARS-CoV-2-infection after adjusting for baseline characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and risk behavior (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.0); however, in a subgroup analysis, respirator use was protective among those with frequent (&gt;20 patients) COVID-19 exposures (aHR 0.7 for positive swab, 95% CI 0.5-0.8) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, in a randomized trial conducted in four different countries (Canada, Israel, Pakistan, Egypt) comparing medical masks to respirators in 1009 HCP who cared for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the overall percent of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases was similar between the two groups (10.46 versus 9.27 percent; hazard ratio, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.69]), but in Canada the use of a medical mask versus a respirator was associated with an increased risk of developing COVID-19 (HR, 2.83 [CI, 0.75 to 10.72]) [

          Considerations when selecting a respirator
         </strong>
         – When a respirator is used, most HCP use disposable N95 respirators. However, those who have beards or who cannot be medically cleared or fit tested for N95 use should wear a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), which comes in various models and styles and offers a high level of protection. Respirators with an exhalation valve or vent should not be used since they do not provide source control; however, if there are shortages of PPE and this type of respirator is used, a medical mask should be placed on top of it for source control. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130296.html" rel="external">

         There are no data to suggest a medical mask worn over an N95 provides additional respiratory protection for the HCP, but this practice may allow for extended use of PPE in some settings. Detailed discussions of universal masking and extended use and reuse of masks and respirators are presented elsewhere. (See

          Eye or face protection
         </strong>
         – For eye or face protection, goggles or a face shield that covers the front and sides of the face should be used in conjunction with a respirator or medical mask, as discussed above; glasses are
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         sufficient. However, if a PAPR is used, additional eye protection is not needed.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, we prefer that HCP wear a full-face shield, rather than goggles or a surgical mask with an attached eye shield, whenever possible. A full-face shield provides eye protection and a double layer of protection for the nose and mouth. It also prevents contamination of the respirator or mask. Full-face shields may be reused as long as they can be adequately cleaned with an approved disinfectant. (See

         Some institutions also require hair and shoe covers for providers when caring for patients with COVID-19 outside of the operating room setting (eg, on a dedicated COVID-19 ward or intensive care unit). However, we feel there are insufficient data to recommend these practices for routine care. As an example, reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be widely distributed on surfaces, such as floors, particularly in the intensive care unit, and can be found on shoes after intubation [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31

         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. This can result in indirect (secondary) transmission. In a Cochrane review that evaluated methods to increase compliance with donning and doffing of PPE, several interventions appeared to have some benefit in preventing contamination, including the use of CDC protocols and face-to-face training [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Some institutions have trained PPE observers to provide additional safety during PPE donning and doffing; however, it is unclear whether the presence of trained PPE observers on COVID-19 wards reduces HCP infections related to indirect transmission events.

         Although data are limited, available evidence generally supports these PPE recommendations [

In a meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), use of medical masks or respirators (aOR 0.15) and eye protection (aOR 0.22) were each associated with a reduced risk of infection [

         Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a medical mask if being transported out of the room (eg, for studies that cannot be performed in the room). If a portable tent system with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration is used to transport patients with COVID-19, the patient does not need to wear a mask, but HCP transporting the patient should wear PPE in case of a failure of the powered HEPA filtration. HCP who are transporting patients should wear an N95 or higher level respirator and eye protection.

         However, there are poor consensus and poor quality of scientific evidence as to what constitutes an aerosol-generating procedure and the level of risk posed by such procedures. Out of an abundance of caution, some society guidelines have categorized other types of procedures (eg, certain laparoscopic procedures) as aerosol-generating procedures that could increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission [

          Aerosol-generating treatments
         </strong>
         – Aerosol-generating treatments typically include nebulized medications, thus inhaled medications should be administered by metered-dose inhaler when feasible, rather than through a nebulizer, to avoid the risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 through nebulization.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         If avoiding aerosol-generating procedures or use of a nebulizer is not possible, appropriate PPE for HCP includes use of N95 or other respirators (eg, a PAPR) that offer a higher level of protection [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12,26,44,45
         </a>
         ]. Other precautions include eye protection (eg, a face shield that covers the front and sides of the face or goggles), gloves, and a gown. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Type of PPE'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Aerosol-generating procedures should take place in an AII whenever possible. These are single-patient rooms at negative pressure relative to the surrounding areas, direct out-exhausted air, and with a minimum of six air changes per hour (12 air changes per hour are recommended for new construction or renovation). When an AII room is not available, a portable HEPA unit can be placed in the room (ideally between the patient and the door), although it does not compensate for the absence of negative air flow. In one institution, a negative-pressure canopy was used for patients receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), high-flow nasal cannula, and noninvasive ventilation [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46

         After an aerosol-generating procedure, HCP and other personnel (eg, environmental services, maintenance) should not enter the room without appropriate PPE (eg, gown, gloves, respirator, eye protection) until sufficient time has passed to allow for removal of infectious particles. The rate of removal depends upon the number of air exchanges per hour, as described on the

Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen collection is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure that warrants an airborne infection isolation room.
        </p>
        <p>
         When collecting a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen in a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the CDC recommends that HCP in the room wear an N95 or higher level respirator (or medical mask if a respirator is not available), eye protection (eg, face shield or goggles), gloves, and a gown [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. As noted above, the CDC suggests using a respirator rather than a medical mask when caring for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. However, when supplies are limited, respirators should be prioritized for aerosol-generating procedures. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General approach'

         Drive-up testing centers have proliferated as a standard setting in which to conduct testing for SARS-CoV-2. They offer the advantage of high throughput and minimal contact with symptomatic individuals, as patients remain in their cars and undergo sample collection by staff who are wearing PPE.

         Extended or limited reuse of PPE is reasonable in certain situations. As an example, some hospitals encourage users to disinfect, store, and reuse face shields unless they become visibly soiled or no longer fit. When a face shield is used for repeated encounters with different patients, the provider should not touch or remove the face shield between patient encounters. The provider should perform hand hygiene before removing the face shield, and the face shield should be disinfected with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2Fabout-list-n-disinfectants-coronavirus-covid-19-0&amp;token=8KhzsUBmyJaFua%2BRwgQvXEVGJYAWmrwJL21KCF%2B%2FxUMcO15TSj%2Fo87JVsj2SooQ1H3OMDsOPe%2BLJtKZT74Q2PxvAfUA58xtjjy8RiLTQ69Y%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=127501" target="_blank">

         </a>
         and stored in a clean container.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, the same medical mask can be used for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients (assuming it is not visibly damaged or soiled) but should be changed between use on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and patients without COVID-19 [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. When a mask is used for repeated encounters, the provider should not touch or remove the mask between patient encounters, since the outside surface is presumably contaminated. If the provider does touch the mask, they must immediately perform hand hygiene. The CDC suggests that masks can be used for 8 to 12 hours [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ], whereas the WHO states medical masks can be used for up to six hours when caring for a cohort of patients with COVID-19 [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Extended use and reuse of N95 respirators have also been implemented in many hospital settings. An N95 respirator should be doffed and discarded or stored after use on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and a clean mask or respirator should be donned before care of patients without COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
         If an N95 is stored and reused, the CDC states reuse of N95 respirators should be limited to no more than five uses (ie, five donnings) per device by the same HCP, unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. There is some concern that respirators may not provide sufficient protection with repeated use. In one study of 68 HCP, approximately one-third failed a fit test that was performed using respirators worn for various durations; duckbill masks were more likely to fail compared with dome-shaped masks (71 versus 28 percent) [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. However, the impact of these findings on transmission is unknown. There are no data to suggest a medical mask worn over an N95 provides additional respiratory protection, and the WHO discourages this practice [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although extended use and limited reuse of PPE have been adopted in many health care settings, the WHO expresses concern about the potential for transmission of drug-resistant pathogens from reuse of PPE, including respirators and face masks [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. In one report, extended use and reuse of PPE was likely associated with a nosocomial outbreak of a multidrug-resistant organism during the COVID-19 pandemic [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         To help reduce the risk of transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends a medical mask or face shield be worn over an N95 during aerosol-generating procedures to minimize contamination of N95s [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. The use of a full-face shield also prevents HCP from having to change their mask or respirator after caring for patients who require contact or droplet precautions for other pathogens. On COVID-19 wards, where gowns are often used to care for several patients, gowns should be changed if a patient requires contact or droplet precautions for other drug-resistant organisms.

No residual H1N1 infectivity was found. The optimal time and temperature to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 are uncertain; several studies observed inactivation of SARS-CoV after 30 to 60 minutes at 60°C/140°F [

        <p>
         Many hospitals have implemented enhanced environmental cleaning and disinfection protocols for rooms used by patients with known or suspected COVID-19 and for areas used by HCP caring for such patients to prevent secondary transmission from fomites. As an example, adjunctive disinfection methods, such as UV light and hydrogen peroxide vapor, are used in some facilities to disinfect the rooms that have housed or been used for aerosol-generating procedures on patients with COVID-19. The use of upper-room germicidal UV (GUV) fixtures has also been proposed [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]; these fixtures contain bulbs that produce UV-C irradiance that has higher energy than normal sunlight. Although GUV fixtures have been used to reduce airborne transmission of pathogens such as tuberculosis [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75,76
         </a>
         ], the clinical utility of GUV for reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. There are also safety concerns, since GUV light fixtures can produce sunburn-like skin reactions and eye damage as well as generate ozone if strict safety measures are not utilized in their installation and maintenance [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Environmental services workers who are cleaning and disinfecting areas potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 should be trained to conduct the cleaning and disinfection in appropriate PPE. The specific approach to PPE depends upon the institution. In general, environmental services workers can use droplet and contact precautions, plus eye protection (surgical mask, face shield or goggles, gown, and gloves) when cleaning and disinfecting areas used by HCP who are caring for patients with COVID-19. Workers should also be fit tested and trained to wear N95 respirators and face shields (or PAPRs) for cleaning and disinfecting patient rooms that are or have been occupied by persons with known or suspected COVID-19 or have been used for aerosol-generating procedures on patients with COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
         The role of environmental disinfection was illustrated in a study from Singapore, in which viral RNA was detected on nearly all surfaces tested (handles, light switches, bed and handrails, interior doors and windows, toilet bowl, sink basin) in the airborne infection isolation room of a patient with symptomatic mild COVID-19 prior to routine cleaning [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78
         </a>
         ]. Viral RNA was not detected on similar surfaces in the rooms of two other symptomatic patients following routine cleaning (with sodium dichloroisocyanurate). Of note, viral RNA detection does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus. The role of environmental contamination in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is discussed elsewhere. (See

         Nontest-based and test-based strategies can be used to inform when infection prevention precautions should be discontinued in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,93
         </a>
         ]. Nontest-based strategies allow for discontinuation of precautions based on improvement in symptoms and/or specific time intervals, whereas test-based strategies typically require two negative tests for SARS-CoV-2 on sequential respiratory specimens. The choice depends upon the patient population, the severity of disease, and the risk of severe infection in close contacts should transmission occur. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Immunocompromised patients with confirmed infection'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If hospitalized patients are ready to be discharged home prior to meeting criteria for discontinuation of precautions, they can be sent home with instructions to self-isolate until they meet criteria. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Symptom- and time-based strategies'

         Once infection prevention precautions/home isolation are discontinued, patients should continue to follow public health recommendations for wearing masks. (See

         The approach to discontinuing isolation in the health care setting differs from that in the general community. Hospitalized patients include certain groups (eg, older or highly immunocompromised patients) who are at increased risk for severe disease, and guidelines used in the community recommending shorter periods of isolation, but with masking at all times when around others, may not be feasible and could put patients and staff at increased risk of infection.

         ). Available evidence suggests that transmission most likely occurs during the early stage of infection and that isolation of infectious virus more than 10 days after illness onset is rare in immunocompetent patients who have improved after nonsevere infection [
         <a href="#rid93">

         Some institutions have modified these guidelines to simplify the decision-making process. As an example, at Duke University, infection control precautions for COVID-19 are discontinued 10 days after the first positive test in immunocompetent patients with nonsevere disease (regardless of when symptoms occur); although this approach may extend the duration of isolation, it avoids confusion about defining the exact date of symptom onset.

         Negative results of a viral assay for SARS-CoV-2 from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥48 hours apart (total of two negative specimens). In the United States, this should be a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use-authorized test.

         Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic also require negative results of a viral assay from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥48 hours apart (total of two negative specimens).

        <p>
         The CDC states an antigen or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT; eg, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) can be used for a test-based strategy [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ]. However, we prefer NAATs when testing is performed in health care settings since it is more sensitive than antigen testing and, as a result, may further reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to other patients who may be at high risk for severe disease should they develop COVID-19. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">
          "COVID-19: Diagnosis", section on 'NAAT (including RT-PCR)'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no clear guidance as to when repeat testing should be performed. The timing depends in part upon why a test-based strategy is being used. However, if the first test is positive, we wait 72 hours before obtaining a second test. Once the first test is negative, the second test should be obtained 48 hours later. Additional information on the use of test-based strategies in immunocompromised patients is discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Immunocompromised patients with confirmed infection'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         When a test-based strategy is used, some patients may have persistently positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 for weeks to months after resolution of symptoms. This can pose unresolved questions in the health care setting since concerns that the patient could still be infectious may result in continued infection prevention precautions and possible further delay of important elective procedures or tests. In addition, prolonged isolation may have several negative consequences, including increased resource utilization (eg, PPE, tests, bed space on COVID-19 wards), decreased visits from providers to conserve PPE, prolonged visitor restrictions, and negative psychological effects [
         <a href="#rid97">
          97
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no standardized approach for patients who persistently test positive, since viral culture, the gold standard for determining infectivity, is not routinely available. However, available data suggest that prolonged viral RNA shedding after symptom resolution is not clearly associated with prolonged infectiousness in immunocompetent patients with mild to moderate disease. This is why symptom- and time-based approaches for discontinuing precautions are typically recommended for these patients, as described above. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">
          "COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectiousness'

         <a class="local">
          'Symptom- and time-based strategies'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If a test-based strategy was used and the person continues to test positive, some clinicians have used the cycle threshold (Ct) to help assess infectivity; the higher the Ct, the fewer the RNA copies. However, the Ct should generally not be used to determine when a person can be released from isolation [
         <a href="#rid98">
          98
         </a>
         ]; Ct values are not standardized across RT-PCR platforms, Ct values can be affected by factors other than viral load (how the specimen was collected and stored), and no clinical studies have validated use of Ct to guide management. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">
          "COVID-19: Diagnosis", section on 'Cycle threshold'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There has also been some interest in whether development of antibody correlates with disease activity, but similar to the Ct, there are insufficient data to use this information to guide clinical decisions. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">

         The duration of mask wearing and continued precautions after the initial home isolation period can be determined with a time- or test-based approach. Although a time-based approach is reasonable for most patients, we favor a test-based approach for those who live or work with individuals at high risk for severe disease (particularly immunocompromised individuals) in settings where masks are not required (eg, nonhealth care settings). Those who are unable to reliably mask in the community should continue home isolation for a full 10 days or until the test based criteria are met.

         A negative antigen test is a reasonable marker for a low risk of infectiousness. In a report of 40 patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19, none of the patients with a negative rapid antigen test at day six had culturable virus; in contrast, virus could be cultured in approximately a third of those with a positive antigen test [

          100

An antigen test was more likely to be positive after five than after nine days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.39; 95% CI 3.39-12.03) and was more likely to be positive in those with symptomatic infection (aOR 9.63; 95% CI 6.03-15.37). By contrast, the antigen test was less likely to be positive in those with previous infection (aOR 0.30; 95% CI 0.19-0.46), those who received a primary COVID-19 vaccination series (aOR 0.60; 95% CI 0.39-0.93), and those who had both previous infection and received a primary COVID-19 vaccination series (aOR 0.17; 95% CI 0.09-0.33).

          Test based strategies
         </strong>
         – A test-based strategy is often helpful to guide the duration of isolation in patients who are moderately/severely immunocompromised since it can account for the range of timing in which immunocompromised patients can bring the virus under control. In the United States, this approach is favored by the CDC [
         <a href="#rid93">

          'Test-based strategies'
         </a>
         above). In the community setting, a test-based strategy using two negative antigen tests 48 hours apart is the most feasible. If a patient has persistently positive tests beyond 30 days, additional testing may be warranted (eg, genomic sequencing or viral culture, cycle threshold). Such patients should be managed in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

         In some patients, initial testing is negative but there is still suspicion for COVID-19. In this setting, a second test should be performed and infection prevention precautions should be continued pending the result. False-negative NAATs (eg, RT-PCR) from upper respiratory specimens with positive tests from lower respiratory specimens have been well documented. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         When two tests are negative, precautions for COVID-19 can often be discontinued; however, if concern for COVID-19 remains high (eg, a patient with consistent clinical symptoms and an exposure to a person with known or suspected COVID-19) and there is no alternative diagnosis, infection prevention precautions should be continued at least until criteria for discontinuation of precautions using a symptom-based strategy are met  (

         In some cases, testing for COVID-19 may not be accessible, particularly for individuals who have a compatible but mild illness that does not warrant hospitalization. In areas where community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is widespread, these patients are often treated presumptively for COVID-19 (eg, home isolation, supportive care), and the decision to discontinue transmission-based precautions should be made using the symptom-based strategy described above.

          General approach
         </strong>
         – Limiting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. This includes universal source control (eg, covering the nose and mouth to contain respiratory secretions), early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with COVID-19, and environmental disinfection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130296.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Precautions in the health care setting
         </strong>
         – Person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur via respiratory droplets as well as by smaller particles that remain airborne for longer and travel farther than usual respiratory droplets. Thus, the following infection prevention precautions should be used when caring for those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (see
         <a class="local">
          'General approach'
         </a>
         above):
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Patients should be placed in a well-ventilated single-occupancy room with a closed door and dedicated bathroom; however, when this is not possible, patients with confirmed COVID-19 can be housed together. An airborne infection isolation room (ie, a single-patient negative-pressure room, direct out-exhausted air, &gt;6 to 12 air exchanges) should be prioritized for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Type of room'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

          •
         </span>
         All health care personnel (HCP) who enter the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear PPE to reduce the risk of exposure. This includes the use of a gown, gloves, a respirator or medical mask, and eye or face protection. A respirator (eg, N95 or higher level of protection) should be used for all aerosol-generating procedures. We also suggest a respirator rather than a medical mask when providing routine care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). When PPE is severely limited, medical masks are an alternative for nonaerosol-generating procedures. Cautious extended or limited reuse of PPE can also be implemented in select situations. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Type of PPE'

         The same infection prevention policies and precautions should be used for staff and patients, regardless of vaccination status. (See

         <strong>
          Home isolation
         </strong>
         – Outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (including those awaiting test results) who do not require hospitalization should stay at home and separate themselves from other people and animals in the household. Other strategies to help prevent transmission within the household include the use of masks and the cleaning of shared/frequently touched surfaces. (See

         <strong>
          Environmental disinfection
         </strong>
         – To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, environmental infection prevention procedures should be implemented in both health care and home settings. When disinfection is required, products approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for emerging viral pathogens should be used; a list of EPA-registered products can be found

         <strong>
          Discontinuing precautions
         </strong>
         – Test and nontest based strategies can be used to inform how and when infection prevention precautions should be discontinued in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; the specific criteria depend upon the severity of disease, the clinical setting (eg, community or health care setting), and the presence of certain underlying conditions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127962" href="/z/d/graphic/127962.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>

          algorithm 1

         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Discontinuation of precautions'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If patients are ready to be discharged home prior to meeting criteria for discontinuation of precautions, they can be sent home with instructions to self-isolate until criteria are met. Once infection prevention precautions/home isolation are discontinued, patients should still continue to follow public health recommendations for wearing masks in public settings. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Discontinuation of precautions'
