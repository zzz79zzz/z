         Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a form of extracorporeal circulation in which the patient's blood is diverted from the heart and lungs and rerouted outside of the body during cardiac surgery. The normal physiologic functions of the heart and lungs (including circulation of blood, oxygenation, and ventilation) are temporarily taken over by the CPB machine.

        <p>
         This topic will discuss perioperative management of cardiac surgery with CPB in patients with cold agglutinin disease. Other aspects of routine CPB are discussed separately:

         Cold agglutinin disease is a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which autoantibodies of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) class cause agglutination of red blood cells (RBCs) at cooler temperatures. These agglutinated RBCs can obstruct capillaries and can lead to ischemia. The antibodies also fix complement, which can produce intravascular hemolysis, with severe anemia and other complications.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diagnosis of cold agglutinin disease involves documenting hemolysis with a positive direct Coombs test for complement C3d (usually negative for IgG) and determining the thermal amplitude of the cold agglutinin. A typical cold agglutinin titer is ≥64 at 4°C. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7084.html" rel="external">
          "Cold agglutinin disease", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients present for cardiac surgery with known cold agglutinin disease. Routine preoperative screening to detect cold agglutinins before cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is not supported by evidence [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. However, the presence of cold agglutinins has been discovered when RBC agglutination and/or acute intravascular hemolysis occurs after exposure to cold temperatures in settings such as CPB in patients with circulating cold agglutinins but no overt symptomatic disease [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Although rare, cases of catastrophic hemolysis and organ failure have been described during cardiac surgery with hypothermic CPB [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Thus, it is necessary to institute measures to reduce hemolysis once agglutination is discovered. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Cold agglutination discovered during CPB'
         </a>

         Intravascular complement-mediated hemolysis can cause life-threatening anemia and complications of intravascular free heme. Any surgery can increase the chance of complement-mediated hemolysis due to the increased risk of complement activation.

         In most cases, cold agglutinin disease is known or suspected based on a clinical history of unexplained hemolysis or cold-induced symptoms. In some cases, aggregation of red blood cells (RBCs) is noted in the patient’s preoperative blood samples in the clinical laboratory or the blood bank. In such cases, the properties of the cold agglutinin should be evaluated with adequate time to form an appropriate preoperative plan before elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

          Plasmapheresis to remove the cold agglutinins
         </strong>
         – Cold agglutinins are almost always IgM, which is retained intravascularly due to its large size (IgM is a pentamer) and effectively removed by plasmapheresis (also called therapeutic plasma exchange [TPE]). Albumin is used as the replacement fluid. (See

         If surgery cannot be accomplished with normothermic conditions in a patient who has circulating cold agglutinins, we recommend plasmapheresis prior to surgery to reduce the amount of circulating cold agglutinin. While some circulating cold agglutinins may remain after plasmapheresis, the risk of adverse consequences is likely to be reduced. This strategy applies to individuals who require deep hypothermia with elective circulatory arrest (DHCA) [

         During cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the patient's blood should be kept at a temperature above the thermal amplitude of the autoantibody (the temperature below which the cold-reactive autoantibody binds to its antigen). Strategies include:

         All intravenous fluids are administered through a warmer, particularly red blood cells (RBCs) and plasma, which are stored at cold temperatures. Notably, if the thermal amplitude of the cold agglutinin is higher than room temperature, then blood in the recirculation line must be recirculated during periods when the CPB pump is off to avoid stagnation of this extracorporeal whole blood at room temperature.

         Despite theoretical concerns regarding agglutination, use of cell saver technology is not contraindicated. Since plasma proteins and antibodies are routinely washed away, and a 40 micron filter is used during reinfusion, administration of any aggregates is unlikely. Furthermore, using a blood warmer during reinfusion mitigates risk. (See

         Control of blood temperature is achieved using the heat exchanger in the CPB circuit. If the thermal amplitude of the cold agglutinin is near body temperature, the heat exchanger should be used to maintain body temperature above the thermal amplitude during CPB.

         Cold agglutinin disease is an autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which IgM autoantibodies agglutinate red blood cells (RBCs) at cooler temperatures and fix complement, which can produce intravascular hemolysis at cold temperatures used for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Although some individuals have asymptomatic circulating cold agglutinins that become clinically significant during hypothermic CPB (

         Close consultation with the hematologist or transfusion medicine expert and the surgeon is necessary to determine the status of cold agglutinin disease, the thermal amplitude of the autoantibody, urgency of the surgical procedure, whether hypothermia will be necessary, and planning for administration of complement blockade and possibly plasmapheresis. The figure summarizes our approach (
