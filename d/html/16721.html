Among the different histologic types of adenocarcinomas, grade 1 and 2 endometrioid uterine cancers have a more favorable prognosis and typically present at an early stage. Other histologic types of uterine adenocarcinoma (eg, serous, clear cell) are associated with a poorer prognosis.</p><p>The 2023 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system is presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141918" href="/d/graphic/141918.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141963" href="/d/graphic/141963.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). In addition to stage, other pathologic factors are used to assign risk of recurrence into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories.</p><p>Women with high-risk endometrial cancer have a relatively poor prognosis following hysterectomy alone. Therefore, adjuvant treatment is often administered, although the benefit of any therapy following surgery on overall survival in most situations is unclear. This review will focus on treatment of high-risk endometrial cancer.</p><p>Evidence to support the optimal approach to adjuvant treatment for high-risk endometrial cancer is not robust. When evidence is weak, many patterns of care develop at different centers. Institutional tumor boards may be useful in guiding difficult treatment decisions. In this topic, we will review our approach, noting situations in which UpToDate contributors vary in their practice.</p><p>An overview of endometrial cancer including clinical features and an approach to diagnosis, the approach to adjuvant treatment, and treatment of low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer is discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16917.html" rel="external">"Overview of resectable endometrial carcinoma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16924.html" rel="external">"Endometrial carcinoma: Clinical features, diagnosis, prognosis, and screening"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16741.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant treatment of intermediate-risk endometrial cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3223.html" rel="external">"Treatment of low-risk endometrial cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3186.html" rel="external">"Management of locoregional recurrence of endometrial cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H125239170"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF HIGH RISK</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients are classified as having high-risk endometrial cancer if they have any of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serous adenocarcinoma (any stage)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clear cell adenocarcinoma (any stage)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade 3 deeply invasive endometrioid carcinoma</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis suggests that a subset of grade 3 endometrioid cancers are biologically similar to serous carcinomas, although not all grade 3 lesions are high risk. For example, <em>POLE</em>-mutated cancers may be grade 3, but they appear to have a low risk for recurrence even in the absence of adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the <em>POLE</em>-mutated subgroup has not been well-defined using conventional clinicopathologic factors [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Some newer protocols include the use of genomic testing in early-stage disease. We include grade 3 deeply invasive endometrioid carcinoma as a high-risk lesion per its classification as such in clinical trials.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pathologic stages III/IV disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141918" href="/d/graphic/141918.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), any histology</p><p></p><p>The evidence to support our definition of high risk is reviewed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H181148975"><span class="h2">Uterine serous or clear cell carcinoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Compared with endometrioid adenocarcinomas, uterine serous and clear cell carcinomas are biologically very different and are more aggressive histologic types [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This was demonstrated in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results study of cases diagnosed from 1998 to 2001 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The five-year survival rate stratified by histologic type was 45, 65, and 91 percent for serous, clear cell, and endometrioid adenocarcinomas, respectively. More contemporary studies suggest that clear cell carcinoma is a heterogeneous group of tumors with varying outcomes [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3423659112"><span class="h2">Deeply invasive grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outcomes among patients with endometrioid cancers appear to differ based on grade. Specifically, patients with deeply invasive (T1b or greater) grade 3 cancers have a poor prognosis. On the Postoperative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma (PORTEC)-1 trial, patients with deeply invasive grade 3 tumors (no nodal assessment required, so some patients would have been understaged) were assigned to whole-pelvic radiation therapy, which yielded a five-year overall survival of 58 percent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H181148990"><span class="h2">Stage III/IV disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Compared with women with stage I or II endometrial cancers, patients with stage III and IV endometrial cancer have a worse prognosis.

A discussion on the approach to women with high-intermediate-risk endometrial cancer is covered separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16741.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant treatment of intermediate-risk endometrial cancer", section on 'High-intermediate-risk disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H176023614"><span class="h1">TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For resectable disease, surgery is the mainstay of endometrial cancer therapy. Given the clinical heterogeneity of the disease and the lack of high-quality data to help guide recommendations, there is no uniform approach to the adjuvant treatment of women with high-risk endometrial cancer. For women with surgically and pathologically defined high-risk endometrial cancer, we take into account whether disease is confined to the uterus (stage I/II) or whether disease extends outside of the uterus (stage III or IV)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141918" href="/d/graphic/141918.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) as well as other high-risk features  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143089" href="/d/graphic/143089.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Too few patients with clear cell endometrial cancer are included in most trials for definitive conclusions about the treatment of this histologic subtype.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1557579361"><span class="h2">Overview</span></p><p>For women with high-risk, early-stage (stage I or II) disease, our approach is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Women with clear cell or serous-histology cancers that are stage IA without myometrial invasion may be observed. However, alternatively, adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) may be offered, depending on patient and provider preferences. (See <a class="local">'Noninvasive stage IA disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Women with clear cell or serous-histology cancers that are stage IA with myometrial invasion, stage IB, or stage II; or with grade 3 endometrioid cancers that are stage IB or II and may be treated with pelvic radiation therapy (RT) alone <strong>or </strong>with chemotherapy, with or without VBT. (See <a class="local">'Invasive stage IA, IB, or II disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>For women with locally advanced or advanced disease (stage III or IV), our approach is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Women with stage III or IV disease who have undergone resection are treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, often with the addition of VBT for high-risk features for local recurrence. (See <a class="local">'Stage III disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Women with unresectable stage III or IV disease are treated with chemotherapy. The role of pelvic RT in these women must be individualized based on burden of disease (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3186.html" rel="external">"Management of locoregional recurrence of endometrial cancer"</a>). In recent years there has been an increased use of surgery after chemotherapy for disease that is initially unresectable (neoadjuvant chemotherapy). No randomized trials have tested this approach but it appears to be associated with lower toxicity than primary surgery for stage IVb disease [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4029818264"><span class="h2">Early-stage disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with early-stage disease may be considered high risk on the basis of serous or clear cell histology or high-grade, deeply invasive endometrioid histology.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3468217519"><span class="h3">Noninvasive stage IA disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to patients with high-risk stage IA disease without myometrial invasion is to offer observation or VBT given that in noninvasive serous tumors there can be up to a 10 percent risk of vaginal cuff recurrences.</p><p>A review of cases of stage IA polyp- or endometrium-limited endometrial cancers of clear cell, serous, or mixed histology who received a variety of adjuvant therapies showed a three-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 94.9 percent and no impact of adjuvant treatment on overall survival (OS) or PFS [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Patients in this study received adjuvant chemotherapy with or without RT (intravaginal or pelvic), RT (intravaginal or pelvic) alone, or no adjuvant treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4261919167"><span class="h3">Invasive stage IA, IB, or II disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women with stage IA disease with myometrial invasion, stage IB or II grade 3 endometrioid, or serous carcinoma may be treated with pelvic RT alone <strong>or </strong>with chemotherapy, with or without VBT. Given similar efficacy but improved tolerability with pelvic RT, some UpToDate contributors prefer pelvic RT. However, others prefer chemotherapy plus VBT, noting that much of the toxicity associated with the latter is asymptomatic hematologic toxicity. If chemotherapy is administered in this setting, we typically administer six, rather than fewer, cycles; other clinicians may administer up to eight cycles.</p><p>The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-249 trial reported that VBT with three cycles of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a>/<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> chemotherapy had efficacy similar to pelvic RT, but greater acute toxicity. In this trial, 601 women with high-intermediate-risk or high-risk, early-stage (I and II) endometrial cancer were randomly assigned to VBT followed by three cycles of paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy or to pelvic RT alone (using either three-dimensional conformal RT or intensity-modulated RT) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Eligibility criteria are described in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121337" href="/d/graphic/121337.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Patients receiving pelvic RT versus those receiving VBT followed by chemotherapy had comparable 36-month recurrence-free survival (RFS, both 82 percent) and 36-month OS (88 versus 91 percent). At a median follow-up of 53 months, the five-year RFS and OS were also comparable between the two arms (RFS hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 90% CI 0.69-1.23; OS HR 1.04, 90% CI 0.71-1.52) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Compared with those treated with pelvic RT, women treated with VBT plus chemotherapy had more nodal recurrences (to the pelvic and/or para-aortic nodes, 9 versus 4 percent at 5 years) and experienced more serious adverse events (64 versus 11 percent), including a higher rate of neurotoxicity. However, late toxicity was comparable across groups (12 and 13 percent) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Patients receiving pelvic RT, but not VBT and chemotherapy, reported that fatigue recovered to pretreatment levels at 11 weeks [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Based on these results, pelvic RT appears to be less toxic and equally effective as three cycles of chemotherapy plus VBT. Whether results of treatment would differ if six cycles were used instead is unanswered. Furthermore, this trial was not powered to analyze outcomes among those with clear cell or serous cell carcinoma separately.</p><p>In the Postoperative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma (PORTEC-3) trial, discussed in further detail below, chemoradiation and pelvic RT were compared among patients with high-risk, stage I disease (grade 3 with deep myometrial invasion and/or lymphovascular invasion); stage II or III disease; as well as tumors with serous or clear cell histology [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. For the subset of patients with stage I/II disease (all histologies combined), differences in outcomes were slight and not statistically significant (five-year OS, 84 versus 82 percent; 95% CI 0.5-1.4). However, chemoradiation improved outcomes in the overall trial population compared with pelvic RT, and these results are discussed in detail below, along with subset analysis of those with stage III disease. (See <a class="local">'Stage III disease'</a> below.)</p><p>We await the results of the ongoing ENGOT-EN2-DGCG trial, which randomly assigns women with stage I clear cell, serous, or grade 3 tumors with surgically negative nodes to chemotherapy with six cycles of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a>/<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> or no prescribed adjuvant therapy. Use of VBT is optional in either arm; no pelvic RT is used.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2916814326"><span class="h2">Stage III disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most women with stage III (or resectable stage IV) endometrial cancer, we suggest adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without VBT, rather than whole-pelvic RT. When administering chemotherapy, we typically administer six, rather than fewer, cycles; other clinicians may administer up to eight cycles. For women who undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, we sometimes also offer VBT to help control local recurrence (eg, for those with deep invasion or bulky lymphadenopathy). For patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy for whatever reason, we utilize whole-pelvic RT. Additionally, data are limited for those with clear cell carcinoma, and while most UpToDate experts do not alter their usual approach, others offer RT [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] with or without chemotherapy for this histology.</p><p>In the PORTEC-3 trial, women with high-risk endometrial cancer experienced a PFS and OS benefit when treated with chemoradiation (followed by systemic chemotherapy) rather than with pelvic RT alone.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The PORTEC-3 trial enrolled 660 women with high-risk, stage I disease (grade 3 with deep myometrial invasion and/or lymphovascular invasion); stage II or III disease; or tumors with serous or clear cell histology [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to chemoradiation (two cycles of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> with pelvic RT, followed by four cycles of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a>) or to pelvic RT alone. At a median follow-up of 73 months, five-year OS was 81 percent with chemoradiation versus 76 percent compared with RT alone (adjusted HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·51-0·97), and five-year failure-free survival was 77 versus 69 percent (HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·52-0·94) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].
