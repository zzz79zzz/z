Most of these genital infections are caused by herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), but herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) also produces a clinically similar disease, and the incidence of HSV-1 genital disease is increasing. Antiviral therapy can shorten the duration of symptoms and signs in primary infection, which, when untreated, can be associated with significant morbidity. Clinical recurrences are also common and can be treated episodically or prevented with continual antiviral suppression.</p><p>This topic review addresses the treatment of first and repeated episodes of genital herpes simplex infection. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital HSV infection and issues related to pregnancy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8340.html" rel="external">"Genital herpes simplex virus infection and pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1133143608"><span class="h1">TREATMENT OF FIRST EPISODE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3783360815"><span class="h2">Primary versus nonprimary infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a first episode of genital HSV can have primary or nonprimary clinical infection. The approach to treatment of primary and nonprimary genital HSV infection is typically the same. </p><p>Primary and nonprimary infection are defined as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An HSV outbreak is defined as "primary" if the patient was HSV seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 before the episode of genital lesions. The primary episode of genital HSV infection can be associated with a multitude of constitutional symptoms and signs, such as fever, malaise, and headache. In addition to painful genital lesions, dysuria can be severe. Symptoms may last two to four weeks if left untreated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A nonprimary first episode of infection typically refers to HSV-2 infection in a person with pre-existing HSV-1 immunity [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The signs and symptoms of nonprimary infection tend to be less severe than primary infection. The impact of pre-existing HSV-2 immunity on HSV-1 genital infection is less clear; however, genital HSV-1 acquisition appears rare after HSV-2 infection [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Nonprimary infection'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>A detailed discussion of the treatment of patients who have a first episode of genital HSV is found below. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Regimen selection and duration'</a> below and <a class="local">'Consideration in complicated infection'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H660749300"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, all patients experiencing a first episode of genital HSV should be treated with antiviral therapy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Newly acquired genital HSV infection can cause a prolonged clinical illness with severe genital ulcerations even if the symptoms are mild at first. The one exception may be patients with nonprimary infection who present only with mild symptoms (eg, dysuria, sacral tingling) after several days. </p><p>Ideally, antiviral therapy should be started as soon as possible after lesion appearance and within 72 hours; many of the studies that evaluated the efficacy of antiviral therapy initiated treatment within this time period. However, antiviral therapy should still be offered if a patient presents with the ongoing development of new lesions and/or significant pain after this time frame. Regimen selection is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Regimen selection and duration'</a> below and <a class="local">'Consideration in complicated infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Compared with untreated disease, oral antiviral therapy decreases the duration and severity of disease by days to weeks (particularly among those with primary infection) with minimal adverse drug effects [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. However, treating the first episode of genital HSV does <strong>not</strong> eradicate latent virus [<a href="#rid1">1,6,7</a>]. Thus, all patients are at risk for recurrence and may require additional antiviral therapy. (See <a class="local">'Treatment of recurrent infection'</a> below.)</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">Acyclovir</a> (200 mg orally [PO] 5 times daily for 10 days) was compared with placebo in a randomized trial of 150 patients with a first episode of genital HSV [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In the 119 patients with primary infection, acyclovir reduced the median duration of time to healing of lesions (12 versus 16 days), as well as the duration of local pain (five versus seven days), constitutional symptoms (three versus six days), and viral shedding (two versus nine days). However, in those with nonprimary infection, oral acyclovir only shortened the median duration of viral shedding and had no significant effect on the duration of lesions or symptoms. In a similar trial that included 48 patients with a first episode of genital herpes (including six with nonprimary infection), acyclovir reduced pain, length of time to healing, and duration of viral shedding [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In addition, antiviral therapy reduced the occurrence of new lesions 48 hours after treatment was initiated (4 versus 44 percent). </p><p>Antiviral therapy may also decrease the risk of complicated primary infection (eg, urinary retention). In a randomized study of 31 patients with a first episode of genital herpes and extensive genital lesions or systemic symptoms, patients received intravenous (IV) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> or placebo for five days [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. None of the patients who received IV acyclovir developed extragenital lesions or urinary retention requiring catheterization, compared with 4 of the 16 patients in the placebo group. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Extragenital complications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1660430597"><span class="h2">Regimen selection and duration</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3454190788"><span class="h3">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with a first episode of genital HSV can be treated with oral therapy. IV <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> is typically reserved for the management of complicated infection (eg, central nervous system and disseminated disease). Topical therapy is of marginal benefit and should not be used [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Consideration in complicated infection'</a> below and <a class="local">'Role of topical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The 2021 United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend any of the following oral treatment options (doses based on normal renal function) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">Acyclovir</a>: 400 mg three times daily</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8435" href="/d/drug information/8435.html" rel="external">Famciclovir</a>: 250 mg three times daily</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">Valacyclovir</a>: 1000 mg twice daily</p><p></p><p>Therapy should be administered for 7 to 10 days. However, on occasion, a patient may continue to have new lesions even after completing a 10-day course. When this happens, we typically extend the course by five to seven days. </p><p>All three agents appear to have similar efficacy for the treatment of a first episode of genital herpes, and the margins of safety and tolerability are excellent [<a href="#rid3">3,9-14</a>]. We generally administer <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">valacyclovir</a> since it is dosed less frequently than the others, although oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> may be preferred in certain settings as it can be less expensive. </p><p>The efficacies of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">valacyclovir</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> were compared in a multicenter randomized trial of 643 adults with a first episode of genital herpes, in which patients received 10 days of acyclovir (200 mg PO five times daily) or valacyclovir (1000 mg PO twice daily) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. There were no significant differences between the regimens in time to healing, duration of pain, time to clearance of all symptoms, and duration of viral shedding.</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8435" href="/d/drug information/8435.html" rel="external">Famciclovir</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> also have comparable efficacy for the treatment of a first episode of genital HSV. In three separate double-blind, controlled studies, which were conducted in a total of 951 patients (of whom one-third had primary HSV), several different dosing regimens of famciclovir (125, 250, 500, 750 mg) were compared with acyclovir for either 5 or 10 days [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In these trials, famciclovir was given three times daily, and acyclovir was given five times daily. Duration of shedding, median time to lesion healing, and time to resolution of symptoms were comparable among the famciclovir and acyclovir arms, except in the 10-day study, in which the 125 mg famciclovir arm was not as effective as the other doses.</p><p>No studies have directly compared <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">valacyclovir</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8435" href="/d/drug information/8435.html" rel="external">famciclovir</a> for the first episode of genital HSV infection.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4260388102"><span class="h3">Consideration in complicated infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Parenteral therapy should be initiated in patients with genital herpes infection accompanied by more severe clinical manifestations [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].

As an example, in patients with sacral nerve involvement and urinary retention, IV acyclovir (5 to 10 mg/kg every eight hours) is administered for several days until clinical improvement is documented; the patient can then be transitioned to oral antiviral therapy to complete at least 10 days of therapy. However, longer courses of IV therapy are required for treatment of other conditions (eg, encephalitis) and may also be required for immunocompromised patients who have a more severe and protracted course. </p><p>More detailed information about <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> dosing can be found in the Lexicomp drug information monograph for IV acyclovir included within UpToDate, as well as in specific topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8278.html" rel="external">"Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8332.html" rel="external">"Acyclovir: An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1296.html" rel="external">"Aseptic meningitis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3818823955"><span class="h2">Adjunctive therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients with a first episode of genital HSV experience moderate to severe local pain in the affected genital or sacral areas. Analgesics may be required in severe primary episodes with multiple painful lesions. Sitz baths are often helpful for women with severe dysuria secondary to multiple ulcerations.</p><p>Some women who have difficulty urinating may have developed urinary retention secondary to sacral nerve root involvement. In this clinical setting, either intermittent or indwelling bladder catheterization may also be required, usually for several days but occasionally extending beyond one week. Administration of pain medications prior to catheter insertion helps to decrease discomfort associated with the catheterization. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1227187962"><span class="h1">TREATMENT OF RECURRENT INFECTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1474713698"><span class="h2">Risk of recurrence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Genital HSV infection often leads to frequent clinical recurrences, although the risk of genital recurrence is lower in those infected with HSV-1 versus HSV-2 [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Recurrences can occur even in those who were treated during their initial infection since treatment does not eradicate latent virus, which can subsequently reactivate [<a href="#rid1">1,6,7</a>]. Over time, recurrences due to either viral type generally decrease in number and severity, although there is substantial variability in the clinical course from patient to patient [<a href="#rid6">6,17</a>].</p><p>In the absence of suppressive antiviral therapy, the median recurrence rate after the first episode of HSV-2 infection is about four recurrences per year, with about 40 percent of patients having at least 6 recurrences and 20 percent having more than 10 recurrences in the first year [<a href="#rid1">1,17</a>]. By contrast, recurrences of HSV-1 occur approximately once per year. </p><p>With recurrent infection, the clinical manifestations of the lesions can also vary. Lesions can be asymptomatic, few in number, or atypical in appearance, especially in women (eg, fissures or vulvar irritation). In addition, the mean duration of lesions and duration of viral shedding appear shorter than those seen with the first episode (10 versus 19 days for duration of lesion and 2 versus 9 days for viral shedding) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Recurrent infection'</a>.)</p><p>These concepts were well illustrated in an observational cohort study of 664 immunocompetent patients with genital HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection who were followed for a minimum of 14 months; 306 had newly acquired infection [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Among patients with newly acquired genital herpes, the median rate of recurrence in the first year in patients with HSV-1 versus HSV-2 infection was one versus five per year, respectively. Second year rates were lower in both groups. Patients infected with HSV-2 who were followed for more than four years had a decreased recurrence rate over time, although about one-fourth of patients experienced an increase in recurrences at the five-year follow-up, highlighting the variability in disease course in those infected with HSV-2.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2406877143"><span class="h2">Treatment options</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Oral antiviral therapy is often administered to patients with recurrent genital infection to reduce the severity of symptoms, decrease the risk of recurrences, and/or reduce the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner. However, some patients may prefer not to take antiviral therapy, such as those with infrequent episodes and/or minimal symptoms, and especially those who are not sexually active. Similar to those with a first episode of genital HSV, there is no role for topical therapy. (See <a class="local">'Role of topical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>For those who choose treatment, options include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Episodic therapy</strong> – Episodic therapy involves self-administered antiviral therapy for individual outbreaks as they arise. Patients start therapy at the very first sign of prodromal symptoms (eg, tingling, paresthesias, pruritus), which may occur prior to onset of discrete lesions. Episodic therapy modestly shortens the time to crusting and healing of lesions and also decreases the duration of viral shedding compared with placebo [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Episodic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic suppressive therapy</strong> – This strategy involves administration of daily antiviral therapy and may be most appropriate for those with very frequent/severe recurrences and/or those who wish to reduce the risk of transmission to their HSV-uninfected sexual partner. Chronic suppressive antiviral therapy reduces the risk of HSV reactivation and decreases (but may not eliminate) shedding in patients with frequent recurrences [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Suppressive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>There are limited data on the optimal treatment strategy, and patient preference should be strongly factored into this decision. Although there may be some advantages to chronic suppressive therapy compared with episodic therapy (increasing the time to recurrence, reducing number of days with active disease), disadvantages include the need to take a daily pill. In addition, clinicians and patients alike need to be aware that viral shedding can occur despite complete absence of symptoms. A discussion of how to choose a treatment strategy is found below. (See <a class="local">'Choosing a treatment strategy'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical benefits of suppressive versus episodic therapy were compared in a placebo-controlled trial of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> in 156 patients with frequent recurrences (ie, more than six per year) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In this trial, suppressive therapy with acyclovir (400 mg twice daily) was superior to episodic therapy (acyclovir 200 mg five times daily for five days) and placebo in increasing the median time to recurrence (250, 28, and 23 days, respectively) and reducing the median number of days per month with active disease (0.32, 4.18, and 4.72 days, respectively). </p><p>Quality of life measures also appear to be superior with chronic suppressive therapy [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. This was demonstrated in a multicenter, open-label, randomized, crossover study evaluating the role of episodic therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">valacyclovir</a> (500 mg twice daily for five days) versus suppressive therapy (500 mg of valacyclovir once daily) in 225 patients who experienced a mean of approximately six recurrences per year [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In this study, the probability of developing a recurrence was 78 percent lower in patients assigned to the suppressive therapy arm compared with those in the episodic therapy arm, and no serious drug toxicity was reported over the 48-week period of the study. Of the 202 patients who completed the 48-week study, patient preference strongly favored suppressive versus episodic therapy (72 versus 28 percent). Treatment satisfaction (as measured by a disease-specific validated questionnaire) was based on various factors, such as perceived drug effectiveness, convenience, and lifestyle effects.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H121509388"><span class="h2">Choosing a treatment strategy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients, our approach to determining a treatment strategy is based on the frequency of disease, the severity of symptoms, and the patient's level of concern about transmitting HSV to an uninfected partner. Special considerations in patients with HIV and those undergoing hematopoietic or solid organ transplant are presented elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Special considerations in patients with HIV'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16533.html" rel="external">"Prevention of viral infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients", section on 'Herpes simplex virus'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1408.html" rel="external">"Prophylaxis of infections in solid organ transplantation", section on 'Herpes simplex and varicella-zoster'</a>.)</p><p>Our general approach is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest suppressive therapy for those with severe or frequent (≥6 recurrent episodes per year) recurrences. Although no study has explicitly examined the benefits of antiviral therapy based upon the frequency of recurrences, the randomized study described above found that suppressive therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> was superior to episodic therapy in patients with more than six recurrences per year [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We also suggest suppressive therapy for immunocompetent patients who want to reduce the risk of HSV transmission to an uninfected sexual partner, regardless of symptom severity. In a large randomized trial of 1484 immunocompetent, heterosexual, discordant couples, suppressive therapy led to a significant reduction in overall acquisition of genital HSV-2 infection in the uninfected partner (1.9 versus 3.6 percent, hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.27-0.99) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].

Patients with mild symptoms may choose no treatment at all.</p><p></p><p>However, the ultimate approach to treatment must be determined on a case-by-case basis, since patient preference should be strongly factored into this decision. As an example, compared with suppressive therapy, episodic therapy is not dependent on medication adherence to a daily regimen and may be less expensive [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Patients may also be concerned about the risk of toxicity with the use of suppressive therapy. Although studies of chronic suppressive therapy have not demonstrated a significant risk of these adverse outcomes, only a few studies have followed patients for ≥1 year [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. </p><p>Psychological aspects of recurrent genital HSV can also impact the approach to treatment of recurrent infection. In some patients who experience considerable anxiety or distress about their diagnosis, chronic suppressive therapy may be preferable, even in those with less frequent outbreaks. It is important to openly address these patient concerns and to offer counseling regarding the natural history of disease and transmission risk. </p><p>A potential concern with episodic or suppressive antiviral therapy is the emergence of clinical infection with acyclovir-resistant HSV-2. However, in immunocompetent patients, this risk is relatively rare [<a href="#rid29">29-35</a>]. In two large series, the rate was 0.18 and 0.32 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>].

Compared with placebo, acyclovir was associated with more rapid healing of lesions (four versus six days) and decreased duration of viral shedding (25 versus 59 hours). Acyclovir therapy was also associated with a higher proportion of aborted clinical HSV episodes (ie, those lesions never progressing past a papule). Similar efficacy has been reported with 800 mg three times daily for two days, 200 mg five times daily for five days, or 800 mg twice daily for five days [<a href="#rid19">19,37</a>].

There was no difference with respect to lesion healing among the famciclovir dosage arms.

(See <a class="local">'Treatment options'</a> above and <a class="local">'Choosing a treatment strategy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Suppressive therapy</strong> – In general, we suggest chronic suppressive therapy (eg, daily <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">valacyclovir</a>) for the following groups (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>) (see <a class="local">'Suppressive therapy'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Those with severe or frequent (eg, six or more per year) recurrences</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Immunocompetent patients who want to reduce the risk of HSV transmission to an uninfected sexual partner</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Episodic therapy</strong> – Patients with less severe or frequent recurrences and those who are not sexually active may reasonably prefer episodic therapy (antiviral therapy for individual outbreaks started at the very first sign of prodromal symptoms) or no therapy at all. (See <a class="local">'Episodic therapy'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>No role for topical therapy</strong> – There is no role for topical antiviral therapy in the treatment of genital herpes since topical therapy is only of marginal benefit, and there does not appear to be any advantage of adding topical therapy to oral agents.
