         Stiff-person syndrome (SPS, formerly called stiff-man syndrome) is an uncommon disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasm involving the axial muscles, resulting in severely impaired ambulation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. It is caused by increased muscle activity due to decreased inhibition of the central nervous system (CNS) that results from the blockade of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), an enzyme critical for maintaining inhibitory pathways. The subsequent decline in the levels of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) in the CNS causes a loss of neural inhibition [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. SPS is often associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), which may be a reflection of shared pathogenetic features, as well as other autoimmune disorders. It may rarely occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome.

         Classic SPS and its major variants, partial SPS and paraneoplastic SPS, are reviewed here. Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) and other paraneoplastic disorders of the nervous system are discussed in detail separately. (See

         Several observations suggest an autoimmune component to the pathogenesis of stiff-person syndrome (SPS, formerly called stiff-man syndrome), including an association with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and other autoimmune disorders, and the presence of autoantibodies targeting proteins associated with gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-related neural pathways. It is thought that impairment of GABAergic pathways by autoantibodies and a reduction of brain GABA can lead to the clinical manifestations of stiffness, spasms, and phobias [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Autoimmunity'

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         An autoimmune process was originally postulated to underlie SPS, as the disorder often occurs in conjunction with any one of a variety of autoimmune diseases, particularly T1DM; other associated conditions include thyroiditis, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,5-8
         </a>
         ]. An association between anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies and SPS has also been noted [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. These antibodies were found to target GABAergic neurons and their nerve terminals. The dominant antigen recognized by these antibodies is the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].

         The pathogenic role of the anti-GAD antibodies in SPS remains to be defined. GAD is an intracellular enzyme and is not readily accessible to binding by antibodies, although transfer experiments in mice, using serum obtained from affected patients, resulted in recipients becoming stiff. However, in SPS the titer of anti-GAD antibodies does not always correlate with disease activity, and about 30 percent of patients are antibody-negative.

         Other antibodies that have been identified in patients with SPS include:

         Oligoclonal bands (OCB) targeting different GAD epitopes are frequently encountered in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with SPS. These OCBs have a higher frequency and intensity in the CSF, estimated to be 10-fold higher in the central nervous system (CNS) than in peripheral tissues [
         <a href="#rid13">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether T cells have an important role in the pathogenesis of SPS remains uncertain. In one study, several GAD-specific T-cell clones that were isolated from the CSF of patients with SPS and intrathecal anti-GAD immunoglobulin G (IgG) were shown to produce Th2 cytokines that could support an antigen-driven collaboration between T and B cells, thus leading to sustained intrathecal production of oligoclonal anti-GAD IgG antibodies [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Further support for T-cell involvement was found in an experimental model in which mice possessing a monoclonal GAD65-specific CD4(+) T-cell population, even in the absence of B cells, developed a severe encephalomyelitis-like response [
         <a href="#rid10">

         T1DM is observed in about 30 percent of patients with SPS, but only 0.01 percent of patients with T1DM have SPS. Anti-GAD65 antibodies are also found in T1DM, being present in up to 80 percent of patients and in first-degree relatives, where they serve as a marker for the disease and as a risk predictor. They are often found in low titers in the serum of patients before the onset of diabetes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1800.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus"

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a significant difference between T1DM and SPS in the epitope specificity of the anti-GAD antibodies in these two conditions [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. In T1DM the antibodies are thought to recognize conformational epitopes, while the antibodies in SPS mostly recognize linear and denatured epitopes especially in the amino terminal region of the GAD65 molecule [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Since SPS appears to be an autoimmune disorder with links to type 1 diabetes, it is not surprising that the inheritance of certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, particularly those implicated in type 1 diabetes, may be associated with increased risk of developing SPS. In one study, significantly more patients with SPS (13 of 18) than controls (18 of 48) carried the DQB1*0201 allele (72 versus 38 percent) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. In addition, other DQB1 alleles rarely found in type I diabetes (such as *0602 and sequence-related *06 alleles) were found to have similar prevalence in patients with SPS and controls, with a lower proportion of such patients also having T1DM, suggesting that unlike DQB1*0201, the *06 alleles may be associated with a reduced prevalence of diabetes in patients with SPS.

         Classic SPS – These patients present with truncal stiffness, generalized rigidity, and frequent muscle spasms, resulting in an awkward, wide-based gait. The majority of patients with SPS (70 to 80 percent) present in this fashion.

         Partial SPS – The most common form of partial SPS is stiff-limb syndrome, in which patients have marked difficulty with ambulation due to stiffness and lack of mobility affecting one limb, generally a leg. Other localized forms may include abdominal or chest wall muscle involvement, causing severe painful spasms or ocular symptoms [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         Paraneoplastic SPS variant – These patients are clinically indistinguishable from patients with classic SPS. Though they are usually glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody-negative, antibodies targeting specific proteins such as amphiphysin have been detected. This is an extremely rare form, but this diagnosis should always be considered in patients who are GAD antibody-negative. It is seen in less than 2 percent of patients with SPS. (See

         In its classical form, SPS is characterized by excessive muscle rigidity of the lumbar, trunk, and proximal limb muscles that is caused by sustained muscular contractions occurring in agonist and antagonist muscles. The clinical hallmark of SPS is an extreme degree of muscle stiffness and rigidity. The persistent nature of these symptoms may lead to fixed spinal deformities such as a pronounced lumbar or cervical lordosis; this is thought to be due to the simultaneous contraction of opposing paraspinal muscle groups.
        </p>
        <p>
         The onset of stiffness and rigidity in the axial muscles, either lumbar or cervical, is insidious and generally progresses slowly over time to involve proximal limb muscles. Patients walk with a wide-based and unsteady stance ("Frankenstein's gait") with a tendency to fall in a fashion similar to a log tumbling down. They are at high risk for fracture [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. As patients lose their ability to walk safely, they may develop a heightened sense of fear and anxiety and agoraphobia. As truncal flexibility is lost, ambulation slows considerably; the patient may eventually require assistive devices to walk. Activities of daily living, such as getting into or out of bed, arising from a chair, or dressing, are severely limited; some patients become bedridden.
        </p>
        <p>
         Superimposed episodic muscle spasm precipitated by sudden movement, noise, or emotional upset is a sensitive and specific feature of SPS, known as the startle reflex [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Spasms usually begin in the axial muscles and may spread to the extremities. They are painful and can generate sufficient force to fracture bone. The muscle spasm is generally easily visualized; the affected area has a tight, rock-hard appearance and a unique, board-like feel [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Palpation may provoke even more intense spasm.
        </p>
        <p>
         The head retraction reflex (HRR) is a vestigial withdrawal reflex of the face and is suppressed in healthy subjects. In one study, 17 of 28 SPS patients demonstrated a positive HRR, suggesting that the presence of this finding in the setting of a patient with unexplained stiffness and spasms might help to avoid the otherwise frequent misdiagnosis of a psychogenic motor disturbance [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Paroxysmal autonomic dysfunction, characterized by transient hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, pupillary dilatation, and arterial hypertension, has been described and may result in sudden death [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Some of these deaths have been attributed to respiratory problems, including sudden apnea with cyanosis, tachypnea, and respiratory arrest; these difficulties may result from diaphragmatic spasm, impaired respiratory function, and severe respiratory muscle rigidity [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ]. Esophageal dysmotility and swallowing difficulties may lead to aspiration [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Other than the abnormal gait and hyperreflexia, the motor and sensory nerve examinations are usually normal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Though cognition is normal, specific phobia is a frequent non-motor symptom of SPS. In one study, 19 of 44 patients (44.2 percent) developed task-specific phobia, that is, fear and avoidance of situations difficult to master owing to the motor symptoms of SPS (such as crossing streets) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Anxiousness may further exacerbate muscle stiffness or may trigger spasms; and anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behavior may lead to a misdiagnosis of a phobic disorder [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31
         </a>
         ]. The progressive clinical deterioration contributes to the development of depression in many patients [

         Dyspnea is often present in patients with SPS. A prospective study of 17 patients with SPS observed that dyspnea was common and occurs at rest, with exertion, and disturbs sleep [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Pulmonary function studies identified a restrictive lung physiology and correlation between pulmonary function variables. The findings support the hypothesis that thoracic cage constriction by rigidity and/or spasm of the muscles of the trunk causes or contributes to the sensation of dyspnea.

         Partial SPS is characterized by the stiff-limb syndrome, in which one extremity, usually a lower limb (termed stiff-leg syndrome [SLS]), is affected, and the trunk is generally spared [

          35

          36,37
         </a>

         Patients with the paraneoplastic form of SPS may present clinically with classical features of SPS; however, unlike the majority of patients with classic SPS, those with the paraneoplastic form are usually anti-GAD antibody-negative and often present with concurrent features of an underlying neoplasm, such as anorexia, weight loss, or a suspicious mass. Less than 1 to 2 percent of patients with SPS have paraneoplastic SPS. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Malignancies associated with SPS include breast and lung cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. Some patients with SPS and solid tumors have antibodies that target amphiphysin, a 128-kd protein concentrated in nerve terminals, where a pool of both GAD and amphiphysin is associated with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,39,40
         </a>
         ]. Passive transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from an affected patient with anti-amphiphysin antibodies has reproduced clinical features of SPS in rats, further supporting a role for autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of this disorder [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Ultrastructural analysis of spinal cord presynaptic tissue performed after in vivo intrathecal passive transfer of affinity-purified human anti-amphiphysin autoantibodies in rats demonstrated an autoantibody-induced structural disorganization in GABAergic (gamma amino butyric acid) synapses, with profound changes in presynaptic vesicle pools, activation of alternative endocytic pathways, and potentially compensatory rearrangement of proteins involved in endocytosis [
         <a href="#rid42">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Malignant disease was less common in patients with anti-GAD antibodies in a series of 99 patients with classic SPS or an SPS variant [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Among 79 GAD65 antibody-positive patients, three (4 percent) had carcinoma (thyroid, renal cell, and colon); all of these patients had classic SPS, and cancer was found in two of them after the onset of neurological symptoms. Among 20 GAD65 antibody-negative patients, five (25 percent) had cancer. Three of these patients had amphiphysin antibody-positivity and breast carcinoma, and two (one with classic SPS and one with partial SPS) had non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one retrospective study, patients with high titers of GAD antibodies who did not demonstrate the classical clinical features of SPS were at greater risk for having a paraneoplastic syndrome. The cancer risk increased with age, male sex, and presence of concomitant antibodies against neuronal cell-surface antigens [

         SPS is not associated with any abnormalities in most routine laboratory studies; muscle enzymes are sometimes mildly elevated. A variety of autoantibodies may be present, particularly anti-GAD antibodies, which are present in a majority of patients. Cerebral spinal fluid studies (CSF) frequently exhibit oligoclonal banding.

          General laboratory studies
         </strong>
         – In the absence of another diagnosis, patients with all forms of SPS have normal complete blood counts and markers of inflammation such as serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The serum creatine kinase and aldolase levels are normal or only slightly elevated; values that are greater than twice the upper limit of normal suggest the possibility of another diagnosis. Other clinical chemistry values are typically normal. Given the propensity for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in SPS, some patients may have an elevated glycosylated hemoglobin level.

          Anti-GAD antibodies

         – Antibodies reacting to GAD, mainly the 65 kDa isoform, are found in high titers (&gt;1000 units/mL) in 60 to 80 percent of patients with classic SPS and are frequently present in the CSF, resulting in oligoclonal banding. Patients with SPS have anti-GAD antibodies recognizing discontinuous segments of the middle and C-terminal part of GAD65, which represents epitopes influenced by molecular conformation [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In one study, anti-GAD65 antibodies from patients with SPS were shown to be directed against a linear epitope in the N-terminal segment, especially within the first 100 amino acids of the protein, which was not recognized by the antibodies in the serum of patients with T1DM [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50

        <p>
         The stimulus-induced truncal myoclonus was not observed in normal subjects or in patients with other disorders causing increased muscle tone. It consisted of a sequence of one to three synchronous myoclonic bursts, lasting 60 to 70 milliseconds after median nerve stimulation, which was followed by a tonic decrescendo activity. The recruitment order of muscles along the neuraxis in this response suggested that it was generated in the spinal cord and was conveyed peripherally via propriospinal tracts. This motor response may serve not only as a diagnostic tool but also may explain some aspects of the pathophysiology of both spasms and stiffness in SPS.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with SPS, unexpected noises often trigger violent muscle jerks resulting in falls. The pattern of EMG-onset latency in these patients suggests that the audiogenic muscle jerks in SPS originate in the acoustic startle response [

         Routine laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, chemistry profile, thyroid function, glycosylate hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C) level, creatine kinase, and C-reactive protein (CRP) to help exclude other conditions that may mimic some of the stiffness features described in patients with SPS.

         When present, anti-GAD antibodies support the diagnosis; however, these antibodies may be absent in up to one-third of patients. In addition, in patients with characteristic clinical findings, anti-GAD antibodies, and a positive response to

          diazepam
         </a>
         , the diagnosis can be made without an EMG, although such electrodiagnostic studies and a clinical response to diazepam can provide additional support for the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis has been established, additional testing is performed to identify or exclude associated conditions. (See

         Muscle hardening to a board-like sensation is probably the most specific clinical observation that establishes the diagnosis. In addition, most clinicians rely upon the response to oral

          diazepam
         </a>
         . Patients with SPS will generally note improvement with titrated doses of a benzodiazepine (eg, diazepam [5 to 20 mg taken orally two to four times per day]). Many patients will require high doses to note improvement. (See
         <a class="local">

         In patients with partial SPS, the symptoms are limited to the affected area, typically a single extremity, but otherwise the diagnostic criteria are the same as for most SPS patients. The diagnosis of partial SPS may be more challenging. Focal spinal cord lesions that may impair neurologic function in a limb or intraarticular mechanical derangement (eg, hip, knee, or ankle) that restricts motion across a major joint should be excluded in such patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of paraneoplastic SPS can be challenging as well, and a high index of suspicion is required. Patients may present with features of occult malignancy and laboratory tests may provide additional clues. Since GAD antibody positivity is typically not seen in patients with paraneoplastic SPS, any patient who is GAD antibody-negative should be carefully evaluated for occult malignancy.

AS may be distinguished from SPS by features of the medical history and physical examination characteristic of AS, but not SPS, including improvement following hot showers, physical activity, or the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors. In addition, lab abnormalities including a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) and imaging features of sacroiliitis or spondylitis may be observed in AS but are not features of SPS.

         Benzodiazepines are generally considered the optimal initial therapy for patients with SPS. For initial symptomatic treatment in patients with SPS, we suggest a benzodiazepine (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9345" href="/z/d/drug information/9345.html" rel="external">
          diazepam
         </a>
         20 to 80 mg/day in three or four divided oral doses or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9284" href="/z/d/drug information/9284.html" rel="external">
          clonazepam
         </a>
         1 to 3 mg orally two to four times daily). For example, diazepam can be started at an initial dose of 5 mg four times daily (taken orally) with a gradual upward titration of the drug over the course of several weeks to achieve a dose that is adequate to control the stiffness symptoms and allow for better mobility. This dose of diazepam can reach levels as high as 30 mg four times daily. By dividing the dose, patients may experience more sustained control of their symptoms. If diazepam is not well-tolerated, one can use clonazepam, beginning at a dose of 1 to 3 mg four times daily that can be titrated upwards to a maximum of 6 to 8 mg four times daily. Daily doses of diazepam needed to control the disease can be as high as 100 to 200 mg/day in some patients. We generally start with 5 mg two to three times daily and gradually increase the dose as tolerated and as required for therapeutic effect over several weeks. The dose response should be evident within a few weeks of starting the benzodiazepine and adjusted accordingly. If no improvement is noted with high doses such as 60 mg per day, the drug should be stopped and replaced with shorter-acting drugs such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9726" href="/z/d/drug information/9726.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         There are no randomized trials to guide the choice of initial drug, but the observation in case reports and case series that

          7,35,61,62
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in one series sustained improvement was reported in most patients treated with a benzodiazepine, usually diazepam (median dose 40 mg daily in anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD] antibody seropositive classic SPS, and 17.5 mg daily in seropositive partial SPS) [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35

We either switch to baclofen, a GABA-modulating drug, as monotherapy or add baclofen to the benzodiazepine, depending upon whether the patient has had some benefit from the dose of benzodiazepine that is tolerated. A response to baclofen is typically noted within a few weeks. Caution must be exercised when using these drugs in combination in order to avoid the commonest side effect which is sedation.

Blinded self-assessment rating of the overall stiffness for individual patients revealed improvement in four patients in each group.

         Glucocorticoids were used in the past, but we avoid their use in SPS because of the observations that long-term, high-dose therapy, with the resultant associated adverse effects of such therapy, is often required for patients to experience clinical improvement.

         </span>
         The prognosis for patients with stiff-person syndrome (SPS, formerly called stiff-man syndrome) is guarded. Patients with more limited disease may continue to function normally for extended periods of time [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, a functional decline is generally noted in most patients. Gait decline is inevitable for many patients. For those with partial SPS/stiff-limb syndrome, there may be significant loss of function that begins immediately. Thus, prompt initiation of treatment in an effort to maintain or improve functional status should be the goal for all patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         A long-term follow-up of 57 patients with SPS demonstrated disease progression leading to physical disability; 46 patients (80 percent) lost the ability to walk independently despite treatment with symptomatic medications [
         <a href="#rid83">
          83
         </a>
         ]. Over time, the number of stiff areas increased, consistent with worsening functional status and quality of life. High-titer anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies were present in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with elevated intrathecal GAD-specific IgG synthesis, but they did not correlate with clinical severity or progression.
        </p>
        <p>
         With an effective combination of therapies, many patients can maintain reasonable levels of activity, though over time the majority of patients become disabled. When patients begin to lose function, a careful review of their medication regimen may identify therapeutic opportunities. For example, titration of benzodiazepines may require careful dosing adjustments; in our experience, most patients require taking their first dose upon arising, followed by three additional doses spaced at intervals throughout the rest of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients who are left untreated, many will lose mobility due to the effects of persistent muscle spasm causing irreversible large joint contractures, especially at the hip, knee, ankle, and shoulder. Once these have developed, they are extremely difficult to overcome with drug therapy. In selected patients, surgical procedures, such as a Z-plasty procedure at the ankle joint, may partially correct a plantar flexion deformity at the ankle joint which, by itself, can severely limit ambulation.

         Stiff-person syndrome (SPS, formerly called stiff-man syndrome) is an uncommon disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasm involving the axial muscles, resulting in severely impaired ambulation. SPS is often associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and, less often, with thyroiditis, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia. Antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the majority of patients with SPS target GABAergic (gamma amino butyric acid) neurons and their nerve terminals. The dominant antigen recognized by these antibodies is glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). (See

         Patients with SPS have been subdivided into three categories, which include classic SPS in 70 to 80 percent of patients with SPS, with truncal stiffness, generalized rigidity, and frequent muscle spasms, resulting in an awkward, wide-based gait; partial SPS in 10 to 15 percent, most often presenting as a stiff-limb syndrome in which patients have marked difficulty with ambulation due to stiffness and lack of mobility affecting one limb, generally a leg, although other localized forms may occur; and other more uncommon forms, including a paraneoplastic SPS variant and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM).

         Most patients present between the ages of 20 and 50, and women are affected two to three times more often than men. Signs and symptoms which are characteristic include a prodrome of stiffness and rigidity in axial muscles, slow progression of stiffness resulting in impairment of ambulation, fixed deformity of the spine and pronounced lordosis, and the presence of superimposed episodic spasms that are precipitated by sudden movement, noise, or emotional upset. Patients exhibit normal findings on motor and sensory nerve examinations, other than the abnormal gait and hyperreflexia, and exhibit normal intellect. (See

         Paroxysmal autonomic dysfunction has been described and may result in sudden death, possibly related to sudden apnea and respiratory arrest from diaphragmatic spasm, impaired respiratory function, and severe respiratory muscle rigidity. Esophageal dysmotility and swallowing difficulties may lead to aspiration. Specific phobias may occur, and anxiety may further exacerbate muscle stiffness or may trigger spasms. Anxiety and avoidance behavior may lead to a misdiagnosis of a phobic disorder. (See

         The pain and stiffness described in SPS may mimic other conditions, including musculoskeletal and neurologic disorders. These include axial spondyloarthritis (AS), Parkinson disease (PD), tetanus, axial dystonia, psychogenic movement disorder, hyperekplexia, and focal limb or joint disorders. (See

         Post-diagnostic testing includes routine cancer screening tests appropriate for age; a complete blood count and differential white blood cell count; routine blood chemistries, including testing of renal function, liver chemistries, creatine kinase (or aldolase); C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); and thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and hemoglobin A1C (glycated hemoglobin). There should be a high level of suspicion for type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disease. (See

         Treatment of SPS is directed at the control of symptoms to improve mobility and function  (

          algorithm 1

         ). For initial symptomatic treatment in patients with SPS we recommend a benzodiazepine (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9345" href="/z/d/drug information/9345.html" rel="external">
          diazepam

         20 to 80 mg/day in three or four divided oral doses or

          clonazepam

          baclofen

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Daily doses of diazepam needed to control the disease can be as high as 100 to 200 mg/day in some patients. We generally start with 5 mg two to three times daily and gradually increase the dose as tolerated and as required for therapeutic effect over several weeks. (See
         <a class="local">

         In patients with an unsatisfactory response or intolerance of escalating doses of benzodiazepines, we suggest

          baclofen

We either switch to baclofen, a GABA-modulating drug, as monotherapy or add baclofen to the benzodiazepine, depending upon whether the patient has had some benefit from the dose of benzodiazepine that is tolerated.
