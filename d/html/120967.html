         Chronic pain is among the most frequent reasons for seeking medical attention in the United States, and opioids have been commonly prescribed to treat chronic pain. In the context of the ongoing opioid epidemic, with heightened awareness of the risks of long-term opioid therapy (LOT), and the 2016 publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for prescribing opioids in primary care [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], opioid prescribing has declined [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. However, prescription opioids continue to contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality in the United States, and there is strong societal interest in further reducing prescription opioid use [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Retrospective data suggest that tapering among patients on stable higher-dose opioid therapy (≥50 milligram

         equivalents [MME]) steadily increased from 12.7 percent in 2008 to 52.6 percent between 2017 and 2019 [

         </span>
         In 2022, the CDC published updated guidelines for prescribing opioids for pain [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. These updated guidelines noted a decrease in potentially high-risk prescribing [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. However, they underlined some of the unintended consequences of the 2016 guidelines, including laws, regulations, and policies that inadvertently resulted in harm to patients through multiple mechanisms, including forced opioid tapering at high daily opioid doses [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to opioid tapering is generally consistent with the 2022 CDC guidelines.

         Consistent with the 2022 CDC guidelines, we consider opioid tapering for any patient, at any daily dose, for whom the benefits of opioid therapy no longer outweigh the risks of continued use  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128515" href="/z/d/graphic/128515.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). This includes patients for whom the functional goals of opioid therapy are not met, those who develop intolerable side effects, and patients with signs of opioid use disorder (OUD). Tapering and discontinuation should also proceed in patients whose painful condition resolves.

         We
         <strong>
          consider
         </strong>
         tapering for patients with non-cancer pain who take more than 50 MME per day, as these doses may be associated with increased risk of mortality [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. In one retrospective study of over 150,000 patients in the Veterans Administration health system who received opioids for pain, the risk of overdose death was approximately 4 times higher at daily doses of 50 to &lt;100 MME per day, and approximately 7 times higher at daily doses &gt;100 MME, compared with 1 to 20 MME per day [
         <a href="#rid9">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We communicate these very real concerns to our patients in a compassionate and nonthreatening way as a component of motivational interviewing. However, the 50 MME threshold should not be viewed as a strict limit, and we avoid abrupt discontinuation or rapid forced taper in patients taking &gt;50 MME per day unless risks to the patient (ie, due to risk of overdose) or community (ie, due to diversion) is at risk. The CDC guidelines do not recommend a specific daily

        <p>
         Benefits of opioids at higher doses may in specific circumstances outweigh risks for selected patients with persistent severe chronic non-cancer pain despite adherence to nondrug and nonopioid therapies (including compliance with primary disease modifying therapies). However, there is debate among pain management experts about how to best approach and risk stratify patients who are on opioid doses &gt;50 MME. The decision to exceed 50 MME per day should be more the exception than the rule. (See

         Patients using long-term opioid treatment (LOT) should be routinely monitored not only for pain control, but also for progress toward functional goals and endpoints [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. These functional goals (ie, goals meaningful to the individual patient) should be explicitly stated in the treatment agreement signed at the beginning of therapy. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Available data suggest that pain is usually improved or unchanged after opioid tapering. (See

         <a href="#rid3">
          3,12
         </a>
         ]. These side effects may be encountered when increasing doses of opioids or with ongoing therapy, even when the dose is stable. Patients may be unaware or deny some of the side effects, and having a family member or friend who can report their observations can be very helpful.

          —
         </span>
         All patients should sign a treatment agreement prior to starting opioid therapy. This agreement is a key component of the decision to prescribe LOT. Setting patient expectations and monitoring for compliance during treatment are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93598.html" rel="external">
          "Use of opioids in the management of chronic non-cancer pain", section on 'Setting patient responsibilities, expectations, and treatment goals'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         We typically treat nonadherence to the opioid treatment agreement (eg, opioid misuse, use of illicit substances, diversion, or obtaining opioids from multiple providers) as an indication for opioid tapering and possibly discontinuation, or referral for treatment if OUD is suspected [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Diversion represents a special situation in which
         <em>
          abrupt discontinuation of prescribing may be considered
         </em>
         . If it is determined that the patient has not been taking opioids, and instead has been diverting the entire prescription, tapering is not required prior to discontinuation of prescriptions. Objective evidence of diversion is often difficult to obtain, particularly for patients who divert only part of their opioids. Diversion may be suspected if urine testing shows lack of appropriate metabolites of the prescribed opioid, but interpretation of urine results may be complicated. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/118689.html" rel="external">
          "Urine drug testing for patients with chronic pain", section on 'Unexpected results'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Prescribing clinicians should carefully document all plans and details for tapering. If there is evidence that the larger community may be harmed and there is clear evidence of diversion, institutional risk management and legal authorities should be alerted.

         Patients who are diagnosed with OUD or substance use disorder (SUD) during opioid therapy require specialty consultation for tapering, discontinuation, or alternative therapy. (See

         Not infrequently, patients themselves will initiate the discussion and request opioid tapering. In a survey of approximately 1200 patients taking high dose opioids (≥50 MME per day) for chronic non-cancer pain, half agreed or strongly agreed that they would like to taper or stop taking opioids [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Many patients request an opioid taper after concerns raised by family, friends, or clinicians, as well as knowledge or experience of adverse effects, or media coverage related to opioids. In a small study involving focus groups of patients in different stages of opioid tapering, patients reported a number of motivations, including a desire to take fewer medicines, the recognition that their lives revolved around opioids, known adverse effects of opioids, side effects, and the stigma associated with taking these medications [
         <a href="#rid15">

         Before initiating an opioid taper, the patient should be assessed for conditions that can reduce the likelihood of successful taper, including opioid use disorder (OUD), mental health disorders (eg, anxiety, depression), psychological inflexibility, high pain scores, and use of opioids for functional self-medication. Treatment for these conditions should be optimized before attempting a taper. (See

         <a href="#rid17">
          17

          Opioid use disorder (OUD)
         </strong>
         – Patients who have SUD or OUD are unlikely to be able to taper or discontinue opioids without involvement of addiction medicine specialists. OUD should be considered in patients who report craving for opioids, compulsive use, continued use despite adverse consequences, and use that is out of control (eg, overuse or misuse). Collateral information from family members may be helpful in this regard. Patients should be screened for OUD prior to opioid taper, and this should be considered as a complicating comorbidity in patients who are unable to taper successfully. (See

         Opioid tapering is more likely to be successful when patients are motivated and adhere to the tapering plan [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Opioid tapering is difficult for patients, who are often fearful of increased pain and opioid withdrawal symptoms during the taper. Moreover, neurobiologic changes in the chronic pain state are complex and opioids may have effects different from their expected analgesic properties (eg, upregulation of opioid receptors, mood alterations) that may increase the difficulty with tapering [
         <a href="#rid20">

         Initiating taper is often the most difficult aspect of the tapering process and is the subject of substantial debate among pain management experts. Our approach is consistent with the recommendations from international experts [

          21

         equivalents [MME]) should not be viewed as a mandatory target used as justification to discontinue opioid prescription abruptly, or to taper rapidly without providing adequate and compassionate support to the patient. We make efforts to avoid rapid forced tapering of outpatients to a lower dose or off opioids unless patient safety (eg, patients who have overdosed or those with OUD) or community safety (ie, evidence of diversion) is at risk.

         Rapid forced tapering can lead to increased distress, drop out from treatment, patients seeking other sources of opioids, and can be a threat to the doctor patient relationship [

         We recognize that taper initiation often requires significant motivation on the part of the clinician. Although any taper may feel, "forced," to the patient, it may be initiated appropriately so long as it is employed in the context of a longitudinal provider-patient relationship with adequate patient support, a patient-centered approach, close follow-up, and periodic review of progress toward functional and risk management (eg, risk for overdose of adverse outcome) goals.

         There will continue to be tension between proponents of high-dose long-term opioid therapy (LOT) for so-called, "legacy patients," and supporters of opioid tapering. Our approach has been to carefully consider the mortality risks of LOT at doses ≥50 MME. We weight these risks heavily (beneficence and non-maleficence) against patient wishes to remain on high-dose LOT (patient autonomy).

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Prior to initiating an opioid taper, the clinician and patient should agree on the goals of the taper (eg, dose reduction or discontinuation) and the markers of success. In collaboration with the patient, we plan to taper all patients who take &gt;50 MME per day, but individualize the dosing as tapering proceeds. These goals are based on the relationship between long-term opioid dose and mortality risk. (See

         Determining the therapeutic endpoint for patients undergoing opioid tapering may be challenging. Ideally, patients would be tapered off opioids entirely and managed with a combination of nonopioid medications and adjunctive therapies, but this is often difficult, and in some cases, not possible.

         If ineffective analgesia is the reason for tapering, analgesia may improve with a decrease in dose, opioid rotation, or discontinuation. Inadequate analgesia may be the result of opioid-induced hyperalgesia. (See

         In some cases, the discussion and agreement with the patient can include the option to continue opioids at a lower dose, in a different or potentially safer formulation such as

Motivational interviewing aims to help patients establish personal plans for change by understanding discrepancies between their own behaviors and values.

         Complementary and integrative therapies (eg, acupuncture, massage therapy) may be used as part of an opioid-sparing strategy for chronic pain, and may be helpful during opioid tapering. A 2019 meta-analysis of 60 randomized trials that evaluated the use of mind-body therapies for chronic pain found that mind-body therapies resulted in moderate improvements in pain and small reductions in opioid doses [
         <a href="#rid26">

         ]. While it is beyond the usual skill set of the primary care clinician to guide the patient through comprehensive mind body interventions, some of these tools can be used in consultation with patients who use opioids (eg, to help patients reappraise their experiences and pain). A manual for specific mindfulness therapies for patients with chronic pain and opioid dependence has been published [

         We typically base the initial rate of taper on the duration of the patient's opioid use, planning slower taper for patients who have been using opioids for longer periods of time, modified for individual patient preferences and clinical circumstances. This approach is consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines [

         ]. Opioid tapering may take months to years depending on the patient's opioid dose. We avoid going backwards (ie, increasing opioid doses) during a taper as this creates unclear messaging to the patient and it is rare that increasing the opioid dose can be done without encountering the same issues that prompted the taper initially.

In these patients, we discuss the target discontinuation date with the patient and typically prescribe approximately 50 percent fewer pills than the existing prescription, with the plan for the patient to self-taper by taking fewer pills for each dose over time [

         During the taper, the rate of opioid dose reduction may need to be modified based on patient response. In some cases, the rate of taper must be slowed to adapt to patient tolerance, primarily related to opioid withdrawal symptoms. A retrospective review of data from 2017 to 2019 found that many opioid tapers may exceed the CDC/HHS recommended maximum rate of 10 percent per week [

          Increased pain or distress

         For patients who complain of increased pain, the exact nature of the symptom should be discussed. Patients may experience new pain (eg, due to muscle tension) for which opioids are not the appropriate therapy. Thus, a new nonopioid therapy may be helpful, and the process may break the conditioned belief that pain should be treated with opioids. In our experience, and based on the literature [
         <a href="#rid19">

         The CDC opioid guidelines recommended reducing the daily dose by 10 percent per week as a starting point, and state that a slower taper of 10 percent per month might be better tolerated, particularly for patients who had taken opioids for years [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         We typically continue the patient's existing opioid during a taper, rather than changing to another opioid formulation for the purpose of tapering. We therefore employ an empiric regimen of reducing doses, as follows:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For a patient who takes a combination of both long-acting and short-acting opioids, we will typically allow the patient to choose which medication to taper first. If there is no preference, we typically taper the long-acting medication first until it is discontinued, followed by the short-acting medication.
        </p>

         Patients should be monitored for symptoms of opioid withdrawal during a taper (eg, sweating, diarrhea, intestinal cramps, nausea, anxiety, myalgia, and irritability). Acute withdrawal typically occurs at two to three half-lives of the medication after each dose reduction (ie, approximately 5 to 10 hours for immediate-release formulations, and 10 to 15 hours for extended-release formulations). Withdrawal symptoms tend to resolve over 5 to 10 days, but may take longer for opioids with longer half-lives. There is also a secondary abstinence syndrome that may persist for several months following acute withdrawal and can include severe mood disturbance [
         <a href="#rid34">

         For patients who do develop withdrawal symptoms, we typically start by slowing or pausing the taper to allow physiologic adjustment to the new dose. If the taper is paused, once withdrawal symptoms subside we restart the taper at a slower rate than was initially used.

         Opioid withdrawal may also be accompanied by transient withdrawal hyperalgesia (increased pain sensation). Patients should be reassured that withdrawal hyperalgesia and increased pain are usually transitory. Moreover, in the long term, tapering of opioids often results in reduced pain. (See

         We follow patients during opioid taper with monthly clinic visits or more frequently, if needed. At each visit, we solicit the patient's overall impression of their progress with the taper, document physical function, inquire about withdrawal symptoms, and monitor for conditions that may require further supportive measures (eg, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation). Similar to any chronic pain follow-up visit, we assess pain severity and impact, and efficacy of nonopioid pain management strategies. The Pain Tracker is a useful tool for systematically following patients with validated measures. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116196.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         We encourage any new techniques that appear to be helpful for pain management. At each visit, we re-emphasize the overarching goal of the taper which includes reduced risk of mortality and morbidity, as well as the indication for which the taper was initiated. We empathetically communicate that opioid tapering takes strength, skills, and courage, and that this is a time of intense change.
        </p>
        <p>
         Maintaining the patient-provider relationship, providing encouragement and support, offering nonopioid options as well as treatments for associated symptoms (sleep, mood, etc), and encouraging self-care are all key elements for the success of the taper.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do not routinely use a scoring system for withdrawal, though some clinicians do. Validated scales such as the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) may be used during opioid taper, and can help distinguish anxiety from opioid withdrawal [

         Some categories of patients are likely to require either a slower opioid taper or supportive strategies to tolerate the taper and increase the likelihood of success. Patient characteristics that may increase the risks of drop out of a tapering program, unsuccessful taper, or relapse after opioid discontinuation, include a long history of opioid use, high pain scores prior to taper, female sex, older age, anxiety over possible withdrawal, and psychiatric disorders [

         The primary risk of opioid tapering is opioid withdrawal, usually with too rapid tapering (see
         <a class="local">
          'Minimize opioid withdrawal'
         </a>
         above). Other serious risks of opioid tapering include opioid overdose and suicide. Such adverse outcomes further underline the importance of providing support and alternative pain management strategies to patients who taper, who are at high risk of hopelessness and helplessness.
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of studies have found an association between stopping long-term opioid use and increased risks of overdose, suicide, and self-harm, though these are retrospective studies and other factors may have contributed to the outcomes [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39-43

         ]. In one example, a database study of approximately 1,400,000 patients in the Veterans Administration health system who chronically used opioids, the risks of death by overdose and suicide were higher in patients who stopped opioid treatment, with the risk increasing the longer the patient had used opioids [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. A retrospective study of administrative claims data from 2008 to 2017 in commercially insured and Medicare Advantage populations found an increased relative risk for emergency department visits or hospital admission for both drug overdose or withdrawal and mental health crisis among patients with dose tapers greater than 15 percent over two months [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44

Conclusions are limited by lack of data on the reason for tapering (eg, aberrant behavior or monitoring data) and the high prevalence of potentially complicating risk factors (eg, drug use disorder [14 percent], concurrent benzodiazepine prescription [30 percent] and baseline diagnosis of either depression or anxiety [54 percent]).

         Patients on long-term opioid treatment (LOT) commonly develop tolerance to these medications. During opioid taper, tolerance can be lost very rapidly (ie, in as little as seven days [

We counsel patients about tolerance and the possibility of increased sensitivity to opioids as these medications are tapered, including potential overdose even if they go back to their previously normal dose of opioid. We offer

         We closely monitor patients and ask about thoughts of self-harm during opioid taper.

Consistent with the updated 2022 CDC guidelines, we recommend behavioral support prior to tapering in selected patients with a significant psychiatric co-morbidity [

         There has been concern that tapering and discontinuation of opioids may lead patients to seek illicitly obtained prescription opioids or engage in use of illicit intravenous opioids such as heroin. Data on this phenomenon is difficult by its very nature to collect and is still emerging, but in general the risk appears to be low in patients who are not otherwise at high risk for opioid misuse or opioid use disorder, and who are tapered appropriately slowly. Nonetheless, expert opinion still warns that patients who are tapered too quickly from opioids may turn to illicit opioids to treat withdrawal. This is a complex topic; the risk of illicit opioid use is multifactorial and related to multiple patient characteristics and risk factors (eg, underlying, undiagnosed OUD) as well as opioid dose.

        <p>
         Patients at high risk of misuse require early identification via routine screening prior to prescribing opioids. We refer high risk patients to addiction medicine specialists for management of opioid tapering and consideration for medication assisted therapy. (See
         <a class="local">

         In a large retrospective, case-control study of more than 22,000 undifferentiated patients prescribed opioid therapy within an integrated health delivery system, new heroin use was associated with increased odds of having had opioids discontinued [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Of patients therapy whose opioids were discontinued, 74 (0.3 percent) patients used heroin after starting opioid therapy, and 28 (38 percent) of those patients started heroin use after opioid discontinuation. The odds of having had opioids discontinued was approximately twice as high in patients who used heroin than in control patients who did not use heroin (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.27-3.78). It is unclear to what extent this association was causative due to the retrospective nature of the study, other patient risk factors for opioid misuse, and the long interval (mean 12.9 months) between opioid discontinuation and onset of heroin use.

         In a retrospective cohort study of 598 patients who were prescribed opioids for chronic pain, patients discontinued from prescribed opioids subsequently used heroin (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.25–1.97) and non-prescribed opioids (AOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.45–2.11) more frequently than participants who had no change in their prescribed opioid dose [

This was a complex, retrospective modeling study that estimated the subsequent rate of heroin and non-prescribed opioid use in each group. Conclusions from this study are limited by the small number of patients in important groups and the indirect modeling technique used.

         </strong>
         The definition of successful opioid tapering depends on the indications for tapering, and the goals that were set at the beginning of the process. We define ongoing success as continued progress toward those goals. For patients who experience difficulty with tapering, the measures of success may include addition of therapies that will facilitate opioid tapering at a future time. In patients who are unable to taper, we reassess for opioid use disorder (OUD) and consider referral to addiction psychiatry whenever screening identifies significant risk [

          Indications
         </strong>
         – We consider opioid tapering for any patient for whom the benefits of opioid therapy no longer outweigh the risks of continued use  (

         tapering to a lower dose or discontinuing opioid therapy for patients who take &gt;50 milligram

         equivalents (MME) of opioid per day, since higher doses of opioids are associated with increased risk of mortality. The 50 MME per day threshold should not be viewed as a strict cut off for tapering. (See

          Preparation for taper
         </strong>
         – In preparation for opioid tapering, we screen for conditions that may reduce the likelihood of a successful taper and optimize those conditions before attempting to taper. Such conditions include mental health disorders, central sensitization pain, sleep disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Screen for complicating conditions'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Whenever possible, the patient should be engaged in the opioid tapering process, and the decision to taper should be made collaboratively. We avoid forced or mandatory tapering unless safety is an issue, establish individualized goals for tapering, and use motivational interviewing principles when communicating with patients  (

          Taper slowly
         </strong>
         – A primary goal for the opioid tapering strategy is to avoid or minimize symptoms of opioid withdrawal, primarily by reducing the opioid dose slowly. For most patients we base the initial rate of taper on the duration of the patient's opioid use, planning slower taper for patients who have been using opioids for longer periods of time, as follows, modified as necessary based on the patient response to tapering: (See

          Managing opioid withdrawal symptoms
         </strong>
         – We do not prophylactically administer medication to prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. If necessary, our first line treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms is

          Monitoring during tapering
         </strong>
         – We follow patients with monthly clinic visits during opioid taper, or more frequently if needed, to assess taper progress and withdrawal symptoms, pain severity and impact, and efficacy of nonopioid pain management. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring during an opioid taper'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A primary risk of opioid tapering is opioid withdrawal. Other serious risks include opioid overdose, suicide, and use of illicit opioids. (See
         <a class="local">

         Pain may increase temporarily at the start of an opioid taper, but pain is often improved or unchanged after taper is complete. (See

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         For patients who are unable to make progress on tapering despite what seems to be an appropriately slow taper and adjunctive therapies, we reassess for OUD, and if necessary, refer the patient for addiction medicine evaluation and management. For patients who continue opioid therapy,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/z/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">
