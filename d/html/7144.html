The frequency of pain episodes is likely to be underestimated because these episodes are managed at home, especially as individuals with SCD grow older and learn how to manage pain on their own.</p><p>Our approach to the acute management of painful episodes in children and adults with SCD is discussed here. Prevention of pain and treatment of chronic pain are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126298.html" rel="external">"Disease-modifying therapies to prevent pain and other complications of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p>Separate topic reviews also discuss other aspects of SCD care including evaluation for complications that present with pain, mechanisms of vaso-occlusive pain, and other aspects of the management of sickle cell disease:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation for complications that present with pain</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110699.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of acute pain in sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pain mechanisms</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7135.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General management</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General management (children)</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14519.html" rel="external">"Sickle cell disease in infancy and childhood: Routine health care maintenance and anticipatory guidance"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute chest syndrome</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16353.html" rel="external">"Acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease (adults and children)"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bone and joint complications</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5919.html" rel="external">"Acute and chronic bone complications of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Investigational therapies</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110324.html" rel="external">"Investigational therapies for sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2710730"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF THE ROLE OF PROVIDER ATTITUDES ON EFFECTIVE TREATMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3843409866"><span class="h2">Provider misperceptions that interfere with the assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several studies have demonstrated that negative health care provider attitudes interfere significantly with adequate assessment of pain and in turn may lead to insufficient treatment [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>Examples include not believing the patient's self-report of pain or assuming the patient is drug-seeking because they know which pain medications work best for them. These assumptions can interfere with accurate pain assessment by disrupting trust between the individual in pain, family members, and health care providers [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Clinical assessment of pain'</a> below.)</p><p>As discussed below, the rate of opioid misuse in individuals with SCD is lower than in other chronic pain conditions and lower than in the general population. (See <a class="local">'Opioid side effects'</a> below.)</p><p>Stigmatizing or biased language used in the medical record may adversely affect the assessment (and hence the treatment) of pain. In a 2018 trial, 413 physicians in training (medical students or residents in internal medicine or emergency medicine) were randomly presented with one of two hypothetical medical record notes that differed only in the terminology used to describe pain, and they were then asked to choose from four options for pain control [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Examples of the language used in the notes included the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neutral language</strong> – Physician note: "He has about 8 to 10 pain crises per year, for which he typically requires opioid pain medication in the ED… On physical exam, <em>he is in obvious distress</em>." Where the authors of the study used the term "crisis," we would say "acute pain episodes."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nurse note: "<em>He is not tolerating the oxygen mask</em> and <em>still has 10/10 pain</em>…His girlfriend is <em>by his side</em> but will need to go home soon."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Biased language</strong> – Physician note: "He is <em>narcotic dependent and in our ED frequently</em>. At home he reportedly takes 100 mg OxyContin BID and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9729" href="/d/drug information/9729.html" rel="external">oxycodone</a> 5 mg for breakthrough pain… On physical exam, he <em>appears to be</em> in distress."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nurse note: "<em>He refuses to wear his oxygen mask</em> and <em>is insisting</em> that his pain is 'still a 10'…His girlfriend is <em>lying on the bed with shoes on </em>and requests a bus token to go home."</p><p></p><p>Compared with those who received the note that used neutral language, those who read the note that used biased language selected less aggressive pain-control options for the patient (pain treatment score 5.3 versus 4.7, p&lt;0.001) and had more negative attitudes towards the patient (score on the positive attitudes towards sickle cell patients scale [PASS] 25.1 versus 20.3, p&lt;0.001). More negative attitudes also correlated with more years of training.</p><p>The scope of misconceptions about SCD-associated pain among practicing clinicians is illustrated in the following examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 2005 survey study, 86 percent of physicians in teaching hospitals did not believe that self-report is the most reliable indicator of pain among individuals with SCD [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 1997 survey of emergency department physicians and hematologists, 50 and 23 percent, respectively, believed that individuals with SCD were addicted to opioids [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 2001 survey of 77 nurses who treat individuals with SCD, 63 percent believed that addiction develops frequently; this belief was especially prevalent in nurses with less clinical experience and less education [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Thirty percent of respondents were reluctant to provide high-dose opioids, many believing they were not indicated for SCD pain. Additional barriers to adequate pain management identified by the survey included insufficient time to provide psychologic support, a narrow range of available analgesics, physicians' reluctance to prescribe opioids, and a belief that individuals with SCD are drug addicts.</p><p></p><p>These misconceptions about opioid abuse in individuals with SCD must be addressed on the clinical service to deliver optimal care. Short educational videos are available to facilitate understanding of sickle cell pain and the influence of provider attitudes on care [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. In a 2010 trial that randomly assigned 276 clinicians (nurses, house staff, attending physicians) to view or not view these videos and then take a survey of their attitudes about sickle cell pain, simply viewing the videos reduced negative attitudes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>As discussed below, there is no combination of clinical and laboratory findings that can be used to determine that an individual is or is not in pain; the gold standard for pain assessment is the patient's (or family's) report. A placebo should never be administered to "test" the amount of pain as it undermines the patient/physician relationship and lengthens the duration of pain. (See <a class="local">'Clinical assessment of pain'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3641208447"><span class="h2">Terms and language we avoid</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We specifically avoid the following terms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sickler</strong> – The term "sickler" has a pejorative connotation in some countries such as the United States and is linked to negative attitudes toward individuals with SCD, which in turn may be associated with reduced treatment of pain and/or distrust of the patient's report of pain [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pain crises</strong> – We refer to acute pain in individuals with SCD as "painful episodes" or "acute pain episodes" rather than pain "crises." This terminology reflects the nature of the pain, which may begin as severe pain rather than a crisis event and which should be treated at the outset rather than waiting for a crisis to develop. Further, the term "pain crisis" has a connotation that individuals with SCD do not have the ability to manage their acute pain and only present when they are in a crisis, when in fact, pain can often be (and often is) actively self-managed in individuals with SCD. "Pain catastrophizing" has been used to describe a pain experience that is exaggerated. In a 2018 study, individuals with SCD who had higher pain catastrophizing scores used higher doses of short-acting opioids for pain management [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Individuals who have increased negative thinking about pain and are not active in the medical management of their pain have been found to have higher levels of pain and greater health care use [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Frequent flier</strong> – We do not refer to individuals with the disease that often come to the emergency department or hospital as frequent fliers. This is a derogatory and dehumanizing term that has no place in medicine. If an individual has a high utilization of health care resources, we quantify the number of visits to the emergency department or hospitalization using neutral language, or we simply state that the individual has an increased rate of health care usage when compared with other individuals with SCD.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H730801"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF ACUTE PAIN MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early, aggressive, adequate treatment of pain is an essential component of the management of SCD  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105594" href="/d/graphic/105594.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14-17</a>].</p><p>Key features of acute pain management include the following, which are summarized in a rapid overview table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118094" href="/d/graphic/118094.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Home therapy</strong> – Every person with SCD should have an individualized plan for treating pain that includes information on how to treat pain at home and whom to contact for prescriptions and/or pain that cannot be controlled at home. (See <a class="local">'Management at home'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126298.html" rel="external">"Disease-modifying therapies to prevent pain and other complications of sickle cell disease", section on 'Individualized care plan'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rapid and thorough assessment</strong> – For those who present to the emergency department or day hospital, there should be rapid assessment of pain and SCD comorbidities that may require additional treatment. (See <a class="local">'Clinical assessment of pain'</a> below and <a class="local">'Possible contributing comorbidities'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rapid and effective analgesia</strong> – Analgesia should be provided rapidly and its efficacy assessed frequently. Individuals whose pain is not adequately treated should be admitted to the hospital for continuous opioids (preferably using patient-controlled analgesia [PCA]). As noted in the 2020 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline, standardized protocols are useful to ensure rapid analgesia for all individuals with sickle cell disease [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Initial pain control'</a> below and <a class="local">'Continuous opioids/patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other considerations</strong> – Attention should be paid to hydration status, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, renal and hepatic function, and potential opioid side effects. (See <a class="local">'Hydration, adjuvant therapies, and medication management'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The benefit of early and aggressive treatment of pain (eg, treating SCD pain similarly to cancer pain) was demonstrated in a study that compared emergency department visits and hospitalization before and after institution of an aggressive approach to pain management in 50 individuals with SCD [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The intervention involved rapid intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">morphine</a> with controlled-release (CR) opioids added as needed; staff and study participants were instructed regarding the new procedure. Following the intervention, emergency department visits decreased substantially in the entire cohort, and hospital admissions and length of stay declined dramatically in a subset of 15 individuals with the greatest frequency of acute pain episodes (77 versus 35 admissions over a six-month period; 173 versus 462 days in the hospital), without any compensatory changes in the use of other services.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2406488799"><span class="h1">CARE OUTSIDE OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Management at home</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Home management is the most frequent setting for acute (and chronic) pain management in SCD  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106388" href="/d/graphic/106388.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Evidence to support home management as the most common location for acute vaso-occlusive pain is demonstrated in a prospective series of 232 adults with SCD who completed a daily pain diary for up to six months (the Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study [PiSCES]) [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Daily pain was reported by 29 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe pain that prompted medical attention was reported on 3.5 percent of days</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pain was managed exclusively at home (without medical attention) on 38 percent of days, approximately 80 percent of which included use of opioids</p><p></p><p>The authors concluded that pain was the rule rather than the exception, despite relatively infrequent emergency department (ED) or office visits for pain control.</p><p>Home management should include access to short- and long-acting opioids, with a clear plan and instructions for when to seek medical attention.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals not receiving chronic opioids are given a prescription to fill and a plan that is tailored to the pain level and the therapies available  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106388" href="/d/graphic/106388.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Non-opioid therapy is used for mild pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067" href="/d/graphic/70067.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

In the Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study (PiSCES), at least 10 percent of the adults with SCD used non-opioid analgesics for pain control [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Adjuvant therapies such as relaxation and breathing exercises and/or local measures such as heat are included.

Studies suggest that management in an experienced day hospital or infusion center rather than the ED results in better outcomes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study from 2021 that compared pain management in 483 adults with SCD who were treated in an infusion center versus the ED found better outcomes with infusion center treatment (faster administration of pain medication, greater likelihood of rapid reassessment, lower likelihood of hospitalization) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Four infusion center sites were included: two dedicated to SCD and two that also see other hematology-oncology patients. Since infusion centers were closed on weekends, only weekday visits were evaluated, resulting in data for 1441 visits in 269 individuals. The time to first dose of pain medication was 132 minutes in EDs and 62 minutes in infusion centers (70 minutes faster, 95% CI, 54-98 minutes). Pain reassessment at 30 minutes was 3.8 times greater in infusion centers (95% CI, 2.6-5.6). Patients were four times more likely to be discharged home from the infusion center than the ED (95% CI, 3-5 times).

The vast majority of individuals with SCD have true, severe, often incapacitating lifelong pain, use pain medication appropriately, and do not have drug-seeking behavior or a substance abuse disorder. The cornerstone of evaluating a pain episode in an individual with SCD is the trust between the individual and the treating health care provider(s). The lack of trust between a patient in acute pain and a provider is common in the emergency department (ED) and hospital, where individuals caring for the patient may be less familiar with SCD and may be meeting the patient for the first time.</p><p><strong>The gold standard for assessment of pain is the individual's (or family's) report;</strong> <strong>no combination of clinical and laboratory findings exists to determine (or confirm) whether an individual with SCD is in pain </strong>[<a href="#rid2">2,14</a>]. Specifically, the absence of hemolysis or stability of the hemoglobin level should <strong>not</strong> be used to justify withholding of pain medication or administration of a lower dose. This is especially true in individuals with hemoglobin SC (Hb SC) disease, whose pain episodes may be triggered by hyperviscosity and who may present with a low-normal or normal hemoglobin level. Failure to adequately assess and appreciate the intensity and cause(s) of pain may lead to unnecessary withholding of opioids, which in turn may worsen pain and coping mechanisms [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The perspective of the individual in pain (or parent/family member) should be sought regarding whether the pain is typical or atypical of usual pain episodes.

It should be part of a standardized emergency room protocol in which patient eligibility, triage plans, and follow up medication is well defined. Intranasal fentanyl should be restricted to two doses. A 2014 Cochrane review of the use of intranasal fentanyl found it to be effective for pain control in children &gt;3 years of age without SCD who had moderate to severe pain [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. For children who weigh ≥10 kg, two doses of 1.5 mcg/kg administered 5 to 10 minutes apart (maximum single dose 100 mcg) have been administered [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].

Some programs use ketorolac as a narcotic-sparing therapy for individuals with SCD, and this practice may be reasonable when used in the emergency department for a short period of time (up to 12 hours). However, there is significant acute and chronic renal injury associated with this agent, and there are no randomized controlled trials demonstrating any efficacy of ketorolac in an inpatient setting for individuals receiving opioids to relieve pain. There are some limited reports of beneficial effects of ketorolac in SCD, particularly in patients experiencing bone pain [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Importantly, published as well as unpublished evidence indicates that even a single dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8591" href="/d/drug information/8591.html" rel="external">ketorolac</a> given during an acute vaso-occlusive pain event was associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>].

Thus, we believe the known toxicity of ketorolac, for even a short period of time, outweighs its unproven benefit for hastening recovery to baseline for acute vaso-occlusive pain events requiring hospitalization. Its use should be limited and designated for specific cases that demonstrate clinical efficacy, and even then, close monitoring of kidney function and assessment for intestinal bleeding should be repeated daily.

The risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal disease, and other complications are all reasons to avoid routine NSAID use in hospitalized individuals with SCD. NSAIDs compromise renal blood flow and reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by approximately 15 percent [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]; this effect is highly dependent on increased prostaglandin production in SCD and increases the risk for NSAID-induced acute renal failure (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7199.html" rel="external">"Sickle cell disease effects on the kidney"</a>). When used, the duration of NSAID therapy should be limited to four days [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].

The new continuous hourly dose is started at the level of the previous total hourly amount of medication used (continuous plus demand doses), provided that side effects are not limiting. The new demand dose should remain at one-sixth of the new continuous dose, allowing for all of the clinical personnel to double- and triple-check the amount of opioid provided. The goal is to provide the medication in the therapeutic window without requiring the patient to awaken from sleep to add more medication. This strategy requires all personnel to work as a team to ensure that the individual remains comfortable and not overly sedated. As the PCA is weaned, long-acting oral opioids may be required in some cases and may be continued following discharge from the hospital.

The hallmark of breakthrough pain is the swift increase in pain while the individual is being treated with continuous or around-the-clock opioid therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">All individuals hospitalized with pain episodes should have written orders for breakthrough pain medication to maintain a therapeutic effect when the breakthrough pain occurs. The best approach is to provide immediate access to pain medication without requiring the individual to call the nurse and wait for additional medication. This is most easily achieved using PCA with a demand-dose option.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Two of the more common mistakes in treating breakthrough pain are overtreating the episode by increasing the around-the-clock/continuous hourly dose, which is likely to result in overtreatment of pain and excessive side effects  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67008" href="/d/graphic/67008.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>), or allowing a delay in the treatment of the breakthrough pain, such that medication is administered after the pain has escalated further or subsided.

Many adults with SCD have underlying renal and cardiac dysfunction, and close monitoring of vital signs is essential due to the increased risks of heart failure and pulmonary edema [<a href="#rid66">66-68</a>].

Hospitalized individuals should be encouraged to drink fluids; it is important to place the fluids within reach because individuals in severe pain will be largely confined to the bed.

Many individuals with SCD are managed with a combination of long-acting and short-acting opioids. If the individual does not usually require long-acting opioids at home, we recommend discontinuing the long-acting opioids when the pain event subsides. However, if the individual requires long-acting opioids at home, these should be made available. (See <a class="local">'Management at home'</a> above.)</p><p>When tapering to an oral regimen, the opioid dose and schedule during the last 12 to 24 hours of hospitalization should be matched to what will be given at home. This strategy ensures that the home regimen will be effective [<a href="#rid94">94</a>]. Avoiding undertreatment for pain (due to concerns about addiction that may not apply) and overtreatment for pain (without addressing the root cause, such as avascular necrosis or menstrual pain) are both important and should be incorporated into an individual protocol specific to the patient that is reviewed regularly by their clinician. </p><p>We strongly advise that all individuals with SCD receive their prescription from the outpatient hospital pharmacy to ensure they have the appropriate medication prior to leaving the hospital. On more than one occasion, individuals have been sent home on the weekends or at other times of the week and are unable to fill their prescription at the neighborhood pharmacy, which has the potential to lead to recurrence of pain and rehospitalization. Discharge without opioid prescriptions (eg, with NSAIDs alone) has been shown to be associated with a higher 30-day readmission rate than discharge with adequate home medication [<a href="#rid95">95,96</a>]. Prescription monitoring programs are being implemented increasingly; these should <strong>not</strong> restrict the use of prescriptions nor limit the appropriate size of prescriptions for individuals with SCD. </p><p>All individuals need a follow-up visit in the outpatient clinic within two weeks of discharge [<a href="#rid97">97</a>]. A review of rehospitalization rates for 408 children with SCD admitted with acute pain episodes found that having an outpatient visit was associated with lower rates of readmission to the hospital at two weeks and one month (hazard ratios [HRs] 0.23, 95% CI 0.12-0.41 and 0.44, 95% CI 0.33-0.59, respectively) [<a href="#rid98">98</a>]. In a single-center pediatric case control study, the greatest risk factor for readmission was no outpatient hematology follow-up within 30 days of discharge (odds ratio [OR] 7.7, 95% CI 2.4-24.4) [<a href="#rid97">97</a>].</p><p>As noted above, individuals already receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> should continue it upon discharge; those for whom hydroxyurea will be initiated should do so during outpatient follow-up when they are well.

It is also especially important to distinguish opioid-induced central nervous system changes from cerebrovascular complications of SCD. The clinical differences are usually obvious (eg, timing relative to drug administration, abrupt versus gradual onset). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16353.html" rel="external">"Acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease (adults and children)"</a>.)</p><p>A reasonable plan for monitoring and risk reduction during an acute hospitalization includes [<a href="#rid14">14,21</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pulse oximetry, monitored during administration of intravenous opioids in the hospital</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Incentive spirometry, performed every two hours while awake</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ambulation and activity, encouraged as soon as possible</p><p></p><p>Sleep impairment increases pain sensitivity and the risk of hyperalgesia syndrome. While opioids alter the quality of sleep, insufficient sleep is probably more detrimental than reduced-quality sleep. Therefore, we recommend continued analgesia during the night in the individual with pain, rather than relying on having the patient wake up to request an as-needed (PRN) medication, as long as they are monitored closely and are responsive [<a href="#rid99">99-101</a>].</p><p>Other sedating medications should be avoided when possible. For nausea, we prefer a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonist (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9719" href="/d/drug information/9719.html" rel="external">ondansetron</a>) rather than a phenothiazine; for insomnia, we prefer melatonin and good sleep hygiene habits.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97849.html" rel="external">"Poor sleep and insomnia in hospitalized adults"</a>.)</p><p>The key to success with incentive spirometry is having hospital personnel engage the individual and provide sufficient instruction; often, this is best achieved using an established nursing protocol. In selected cases, intermittent positive pressure breathing therapy may be appropriate. The benefit of incentive spirometry in preventing respiratory complications during pain episodes was demonstrated in a trial that randomly assigned 29 children and young adults with SCD to receive incentive spirometry (10 maximal inspirations every two hours while awake) versus no incentive spirometry [<a href="#rid102">102</a>]. Pulmonary complications were significantly reduced in those receiving incentive spirometry compared with controls (5 versus 42 percent).</p><p>Importantly, an opioid reversal agent (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9678" href="/d/drug information/9678.html" rel="external">naloxone</a>) should <strong>not</strong> be given to an individual who is somnolent but easily arousable, as this may precipitate severe pain requiring greater opioid doses. Rather, the opioid should be held until somnolence lessens. Naloxone should be reserved for symptomatic respiratory depression and/or impending respiratory failure. If used, naloxone should be administered in small doses or as a low-dose infusion.

This may be in part because the majority of individuals with SCD manage their pain episodes at home or through their primary clinician. As a result, hospital staff may only encounter the one or two individuals with SCD who have an opioid use disorder from among the hundreds or thousands of individuals with SCD in the local population who do not. It is critical that clinicians not extrapolate from these one or two individuals to the rest of the SCD population.</p><p>The prevalence of opioid use disorders in individuals with SCD has been demonstrated to be similar to or lower than the general population [<a href="#rid109">109</a>]. Large academic centers in the United States and Europe have reported evidence of substance abuse in 0 to 9 percent of individuals with SCD; the incidence in comparable populations without SCD is 6 to 9 percent [<a href="#rid18">18,109-114</a>]. In a study of opioid-induced deaths that compared mortality of individuals with SCD to that in other chronic pain conditions over a 14-year period (1999 to 2013), individuals with SCD had a <strong>lower</strong> mortality than people with fibromyalgia, back pain, or migraine headache (0.77 percent of deaths in SCD, compared with 4.4, 2.1, and 4.5 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid114">114</a>]. It is important for clinicians to understand that the use of opioids under appropriate medical supervision, regardless of amount or frequency, does <strong>not</strong> constitute an opioid use disorder. Increasing dose requirements due to changes in drug metabolism (ie, tolerance) or withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation (ie, physical dependence) are normal physiologic reactions and do not indicate substance addiction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7804.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, health consequences, screening, and assessment", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>When concerns about opioid use disorder or drug abuse occur, they are best raised and discussed outside an acute pain episode. A multidisciplinary approach is used, including a complete review of the opioid prescription history, hospital records of opioid usage, and a discussion with the primary care clinician and the rest of the clinical team (medical social worker, case worker, psychologist). A care plan for addressing these concerns should be created and implemented with subsequent episodes.

Individuals not receiving chronic opioids start with nonopioid therapy for mild pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067" href="/d/graphic/70067.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) followed by opioids of escalating strengths  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108947" href="/d/graphic/108947.html" rel="external">table 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108954" href="/d/graphic/108954.html" rel="external">table 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108955" href="/d/graphic/108955.html" rel="external">table 4</a>), with additional short-acting medication for breakthrough pain. There should be a clear plan for when to seek medical services and whom to contact. Day hospitals or hematology-oncology infusion centers are the most effective locations for management of acute pain.
