         The long-term outcome of acute low back pain is generally favorable. Rapid improvement in pain and disability and return to work are the norm in the first month [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Further improvement generally occurs over three months. However, given how common low back pain is, persistent symptoms affect millions of individuals. Subacute low back pain is commonly defined as back pain lasting between 4 and 12 weeks, and chronic low back pain is defined as pain that persists for 12 or more weeks. For those with chronic symptoms, few achieve the complete resolution they seek, but, rather, treatment focuses on controlling pain and improving activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will address indications and outcomes of surgery for patients with subacute and chronic back pain who do not respond to more conservative treatment. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment, as well as nonsurgical interventional therapies for patients with subacute and chronic low back pain, are discussed separately. (See

         Two related issues, surgical treatment for patients with lumbar stenosis and the initial management of patients with acute low back pain, are also discussed separately. (See

          INDICATIONS FOR SPINAL SURGERY

         </span>
         Only a small minority of patients suffering from low back pain ever require surgery. However, rates of surgical procedures are rising in the United States, particularly for spinal fusion in patients with nonspecific back pain [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For the small minority of low back pain patients with severe or progressive motor weakness, or signs and symptoms of cauda equina syndrome, urgent evaluation by a neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon with experience in back surgery is indicated (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7781.html" rel="external">
          "Lumbar spinal stenosis: Treatment and prognosis", section on 'Surgical treatment'
         </a>
         ). There is no evidence that early referral for surgery, in the absence of severe or progressive neurologic deficits, improves outcomes for lumbar disc prolapse with radiculopathy or symptomatic spinal stenosis [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of mild foot drop or other minor motor deficits due to lumbar disc prolapse with radiculopathy is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         an absolute indication for surgery, because many such patients will recover with nonsurgical treatment [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5259.html" rel="external">
          "Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Treatment and prognosis", section on 'Patients with disc herniation or spinal stenosis'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of severe or progressive weakness, or signs of cauda equina syndrome, surgery may be an elective option for patients with persistent disabling symptoms of low back pain and significantly impaired quality of life who have not responded to adequate trials of nonsurgical approaches. For lumbar disc prolapse with radiculopathy or symptomatic spinal stenosis, no randomized trial showing benefits of surgery has enrolled patients with less than four to six weeks of nonsurgical therapy. For nonspecific low back pain, trials of fusion surgery have only enrolled patients who have not responded to one year of nonsurgical therapies. Data are lacking on how to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from spinal fusion surgery. A systematic review of diagnostic tests found that immobilization, provocative discography, and temporary external fixation were not useful for identifying patients more likely to benefit from fusion surgery [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. No studies of facet joint blocks or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) met inclusion criteria. Evidence from observational studies and randomized trials suggest that psychologic factors may be the strongest predictors of low back pain outcomes, including outcomes following surgery [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. Before referring to surgery, patients should be assessed for the presence of psychologic factors (depression, anxiety, or other mood disorders) that may decrease response to any treatment for subacute or chronic low back pain. (See

         Surgical interventions fall into two broad treatment categories: radicular pain conditions, most commonly due to disc herniation or spinal stenosis with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis; and nonspecific low back pain (often presumed to be related to degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs or facet joints).

         </span>
         Most patients with subacute and chronic low back pain and degenerative lumbar disc disease do not have radicular symptoms or symptoms attributable to a specific condition, and they are categorized as having nonspecific low back pain [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. There is ongoing debate about the role for surgery in the treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain. Surgery is not recommended for patients with nonspecific subacute low back pain. Regardless of treatment (disc replacement, fusion, or nonsurgical), few patients report complete symptom resolution.

         The most common surgery for chronic nonspecific low back pain with lumbar disc degenerative changes is vertebral fusion, a procedure that unites (fuses) two or more vertebral bodies together. The goal is to restrict spinal motion and remove the degenerated disc (the presumed pain generator) in order to relieve symptoms. A variety of fusion techniques are practiced. All involve the placement of a bone graft between the vertebrae. Fusion can be performed with or without supplemental hardware (instrumentation), such as plates, screws, or cages, that serve as an internal splint while the bone graft heals. Fusion alters the normal mechanics of the spine and is associated with an increase in long-term degenerative changes in adjacent spine segments.
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review of four randomized trials found that disability outcomes between lumbar vertebral fusion and nonsurgical treatment did not meet US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria for clinically meaningful differences [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Enrolled patients had at least one year of low back pain that did not respond to standard nonsurgical therapy. Patients with significant psychiatric or somatic illness, ongoing compensation issues, or other chronic pain conditions were generally excluded. One randomized trial of 289 patients found fusion superior to unstructured nonsurgical therapy at two-year follow-up for decrease in pain (33 versus 7 percent), reduction in disability (25 versus 6 percent), return to work (36 versus 13 percent) and self-perception of improvement (63 versus 29 percent) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Three trials found no clear or clinically relevant difference between surgery and nonsurgical treatment, but two trials were underpowered and a third trial had a high crossover rate between groups [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-13
         </a>
         ]. Four-year follow-up of two of these randomized trials again failed to demonstrate any benefit of spinal fusion surgery compared with cognitive intervention and exercises [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One factor for the inconsistent results between trials may be the nonsurgical treatment chosen as the comparator. In trials that showed no, or only modest, differences, the nonsurgical treatment was an intensive rehabilitation program incorporating a cognitive behavioral component [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-13
         </a>
         ]. In the trial that reported better results with surgery, the nonsurgical treatment intervention was less intensive and more heterogeneous [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The systematic review concluded that although methodologic flaws limit firm conclusions, surgery may be more effective than unstructured nonsurgical care but may not be more effective than intense rehabilitation with cognitive behavioral therapy [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. A subsequent systematic review came to a similar conclusion [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Practice guidelines from the American Pain Society, based on this subsequent review, recommend that surgery be presented as an option to patients with persistent (&gt;1 year) disabling nonradicular low back pain with discussion of its risks and benefits and with interdisciplinary rehabilitation discussed as similarly effective [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Shared decision-making with regard to surgery should take into account that most patients who undergo surgery will have some residual symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         A Medicare advisory committee reviewed lumbar fusion surgery in older patients with low back pain related to degenerative disc disease. The report noted flaws in existing studies (poorly defined clinical conditions and outcomes, lack of standardization for control populations, few older adult patients, few randomized studies) and concluded that there was uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of lumbar fusion for older patients with chronic back pain [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A small (n = 41) trial published subsequent to the above reviews differed from previous studies in that it only enrolled patients with chronic low back pain who had single-level degenerative disc disease at L4/L5 or L5/S1, positive provocative discography, and positive response to a local anesthetic disc block. It allocated patients based on a minimization technique to surgery (anterior interbody fusion or posterolateral fusion with screws) versus a minimal exercise intervention (walking and stretching). Like the earlier trial that compared fusion with standard rehabilitation, this trial found that both surgical procedures were associated with lower pain scores and improved function compared with minimal exercise [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Randomized trials that directly compare different fusion techniques are inconsistent and do not permit reliable judgment about comparative benefits. The use of instrumentation is popular with some surgeons. A systematic review found that instrumentation was associated with improved fusion rates without a clear difference in clinical outcome [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The use of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) to speed bone fusion significantly increased between 2002 and 2006 in the United States [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. In a large database sampling 20 percent of community hospitals in the United States, use of bone morphogenetic proteins for spinal fusion was associated with greater hospital costs and a longer hospital stay (3.2 percent increase after multivariable adjustment) but no difference in complication rates for lumbar procedures [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Two systematic reviews based on individual patient data each found no clear advantages of lumbar fusion with BMP over iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) in rates of overall success, fusion, or other measures of effectiveness [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22
         </a>
         ]. The systematic reviews also found an association between use of BMP and risk of cancer (risk ratio [RR] 3.45, 95% CI 1.98-6.00) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ], although rates of cancer were low and the cancers were heterogeneous. Although the reviews found no clear differences in risk of other harms between BMP and ICBG, the rate of harms was high overall and substantially underreported in journal publications [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,23
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         No operative deaths were reported in any of the trials comparing fusion with nonsurgical therapy. A systematic review that included observational data estimated the following complication rates for spinal fusion: in-hospital mortality, 0.2 percent; deep wound infection, 1.5 percent; deep vein thrombosis, 1.6 percent; pulmonary embolus, 2.2 percent; and nerve injury, 2.8 percent [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. One trial found that more technically difficult procedures were associated with higher rates of complications but did not result in better overall outcome at two years [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>

         Artificial disc replacement is a newer alternative to fusion. A theoretic advantage of lumbar disc replacement compared with fusion is that a prosthetic disc could help preserve normal range of motion and spine mechanics. This could reduce the long-term degenerative changes in adjacent vertebral segments that have been observed following spinal fusion. However, the evidence suggests that the efficacy of this approach is similar to that of spinal fusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         A 2012 systematic review of seven randomized trials evaluated the use of disc replacement for chronic low back pain [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Five trials (n = 1301) specifically compared disc replacement versus fusion for improvement of pain (visual analog score) and function (Oswestry Disability Index) outcomes at two years [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27-31
         </a>
         ]. All studies had risk of bias due to lack of blinding and industry sponsorship; in addition, two of the trials evaluated an artificial disc that has not been approved by the FDA. Pooled results demonstrated no significant difference in pain scores between the two groups. There was a statistically, but not clinically, significant difference in improvement in function in the disc replacement group compared with the fusion group (4.3 points, 95% CI 1.9-6.7).
        </p>
        <p>
         Only one trial has compared lumbar disc replacement versus a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. This study included 173 patients with chronic pain, disability, and L4-5 and/or L5-S1 degenerative disc disease. Those randomly assigned to disc replacement had a statistically, but not clinically, significant improvement in disability score (difference of 8 points on a 100 point scale) at two-year follow-up and lower pain scores (difference 12 points on a 100 point scale) compared with the rehabilitation arm. Six patients in the surgery group had complications resulting in physical impairment, with one patient requiring a lower leg amputation following revision surgery. No major complications were reported for the rehabilitation arm.
        </p>
        <p>
         Two randomized trials found no clear differences between different artificial discs [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33,34
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach is consistent with guidelines from the American Pain Society, which found insufficient supporting evidence regarding long-term benefits and harms of disc replacement to recommend the procedure [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. A key limitation of existing evidence for the role of lumbar disc replacement is the lack of longer-term follow-up to assess efficacy and failure rates necessitating device removal and potential conversion to a fusion procedure. Regardless of treatment (disc replacement, fusion, or nonsurgical), few patients report complete symptom resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
         Disc replacement is approved by the FDA for patients who are in good health and ≤60 years old, with disease limited to one disc between L3 and S1 and no associated deformity, spondylolisthesis, or neurologic deficit. If undertaken, patients should be treated by surgeons experienced in performing disc replacement to minimize complications and length of hospitalization [

         Microdiscectomy, a refinement of open discectomy, has become the most common procedure and can be performed on an outpatient basis. It involves a smaller incision in the back, with visualization through an operating microscope, followed by a hemilaminectomy (removal of part of the lamina in order to adequately visualize the disc) and removal of the disc fragment compressing the affected nerve or nerves.

         Minimally invasive techniques include percutaneous manual nucleotomy, percutaneous discectomy, laser discectomy, endoscopic discectomy, microendoscopic discectomy, and radiofrequency nucleoplasty [

         Minimally invasive techniques involve smaller incisions and surgery with the aid of indirect visualization; some techniques employ lasers to vaporize parts of the disc or automated techniques for removing portions of the disc. They have the potential advantage of quicker recovery from surgery compared with standard open discectomy or microdiscectomy.

         Randomized trials comparing surgery with nonsurgical management for lumbar disc prolapse with persistent radiculopathy indicate that patients who undergo surgery experience faster and larger improvements, though substantial improvements are observed regardless of whether patients undergo surgery or not, and in some studies, outcomes appear similar within two years [

          4,38,39,41,42

        <p>
         An early trial comparing surgery with nonsurgical therapy (inpatient rehabilitation) for lumbar disc prolapse with nerve root compression (duration of symptoms not reported) found one-year outcomes for standard open discectomy superior, with a lower likelihood of poor results (odds ratio [OR] 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.99), although differences were no longer present after 4 to 10 years [

         The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trials (SPORT) are multicenter, randomized trials, with associated prospective cohort studies, evaluating surgery versus nonsurgical therapy for three spinal conditions: lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis without degenerative spondylolisthesis, and spinal stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43

The SPORT trial of surgery for prolapsed lumbar disc (symptoms present at least six weeks) found standard open discectomy or microdiscectomy (technique left to discretion of the surgeon) no better than nonoperative treatment (including physical therapy, education/counseling, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [if tolerated]) for pain relief and improvement in function after three months [

Secondary outcomes (sciatica bothersomeness, self-rated improvement, and patient satisfaction with symptoms) were better for the group assigned to surgery [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45

         Minimally invasive surgical approaches that utilize techniques to further reduce incision size and the area of dissection have been introduced as potential alternatives to standard open discectomy and microdiscectomy. Until more definitive evidence is available showing clear advantages for alternative surgical techniques, our preference is for standard microdiscectomy or open discectomy for patients with lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy who are appropriate surgical candidates [

Challenges in interpreting this trial are that it used an inadequate randomization method (alternate allocation), and it is unclear why decompression would have a delayed effect, as most trials have shown that benefits of discectomy are most pronounced at short-term follow-up.

         Spondylolisthesis refers to slippage of a vertebral body over another, usually with the superior vertebral body slipping anteriorly relative to an adjacent inferior vertebral body (anterolisthesis). Retrolisthesis refers to posterior slippage. Degenerative spondylolisthesis, usually caused by degenerative changes at the facet joints and intervertebral discs, is a common cause of spinal stenosis. Degenerative spondylolisthesis leads to a loss of normal structural supports and subluxation of the affected vertebral body and can cause pain and neurologic deficits due to spinal stenosis or tension on nerve roots. The most common site for degenerative spondylolisthesis is L4.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surgery may be beneficial in patients with persistent symptoms related to spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal), although the benefit of surgery, compared with nonsurgical therapy, declines over time. Decompressive laminectomy, with or without fusion, is the most common surgery for spinal stenosis and symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis. Surgical options and outcomes for spinal stenosis and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis are discussed in detail separately. (See

Treatment is controversial as there are no randomized trials to guide treatment options. Treatment options for symptomatic spondylolysis include bracing, activity restriction, and physical therapy.

         Isthmic spondylolisthesis differs from degenerative spondylolisthesis in that a lytic defect in the pars interarticularis (lytic spondylolysis) results in anterior subluxation (slippage) of the affected vertebral body  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76454" href="/z/d/graphic/76454.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The subluxation may also place stress on the adjacent intervertebral disc, resulting in degenerative disc disease. The most common site of isthmic spondylolisthesis, L5, can cause back pain or radicular symptoms due to tension or compression on the L5 nerve root. Initial treatment for symptomatic isthmic spondylolisthesis is similar to treatment for spondylolysis. Surgical treatment is reserved for patients who do not respond to nonsurgical therapies. Potential indications for surgery include progressive slip, development of neurologic deficits, and segmental instability associated with pain. Segmental instability is typically diagnosed using a combination of imaging (dynamic slippage with extension or flexion) and clinical findings (frequent exacerbations of back symptoms with minimal provocation). The most common surgical procedure for isthmic spondylolisthesis is posterolateral (transpedicular) fusion, with or without decompressive laminectomy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence on efficacy of surgery versus nonsurgical therapy for isthmic spondylolisthesis is limited to one randomized trial (n = 114). In patients with low back pain and sciatica for at least one year, posterolateral fusion was associated with moderately decreased pain (mean score 37 versus 56 on a 0 to 100 scale) and disability (mean Disability Rating Index 29 versus 44 on a 0 to 100 scale) and superior patient-reported overall outcomes (74 versus 43 percent better or much better) after two years compared with an exercise program [

         Patients may have persistent, disabling low back pain despite use of several standard therapies or following back surgery (ie, failed back surgery syndrome). Though there are no well-proven treatments available for these patients, referral to clinicians experienced in treating intractable back pain should be considered when standard interventions have failed. Evaluation in an interdisciplinary pain clinic may include treatments to control pain, improve function, and provide behavioral support that may not be available in the primary care setting.

         Pharmacotherapy, including consideration of chronic opioid therapy, may be used in such patients to manage pain. However, for opioid therapy, responses are incomplete, long-term outcomes are unknown, and risks of harm are significant. Opioids should only be used after adequate risk assessment and with appropriate monitoring and supervision. (See

         For patients with persistent, disabling radicular pain after prior spine surgery, we offer spinal cord stimulation as a "last resort" option, as part of a shared decision-making process that highlights the lack of consistently demonstrated benefit in clinical trials and the relatively high rate of device-related complications. This approach is consistent with guidelines from the American Pain Society [
         <a href="#rid16">

         Spinal cord stimulation involves the placement of electrodes in the epidural space adjacent to the spinal area presumed to be the source of pain. An electric current is then applied to achieve sympatholytic and other neuromodulatory effects. The number and type of electrode leads and parameters of electrical stimulation can vary. Electrodes may be implanted percutaneously or by laminectomy, and power for the spinal cord stimulator is supplied by an implanted battery or transcutaneously through an external radiofrequency transmitter.

        <p>
         Complications are not rare. In the randomized trials, 18 to 32 percent of patients experienced a complication following spinal cord stimulator implantation, including electrode migration, infection or wound breakdown, generator pocket-related complications, and lead problems [

         Subacute low back pain is commonly defined as back pain lasting between 4 and 12 weeks, and chronic low back pain is defined as pain that persists for 12 or more weeks. For those with chronic symptoms, few achieve the complete resolution they seek, but rather treatment focuses on controlling pain and improving activity. (See

          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). Decisions regarding surgery should be based on shared decision-making. We suggest that surgery be limited to patients with nonspecific low back pain who meet the following criteria: persistent symptoms with associated disability last for at least one year despite nonsurgical interventions; the patient is an appropriate surgical candidate; and intensive rehabilitation with a cognitive behavioral therapy component is either not available or has not been effective (

          Spinal fusion surgery for nonspecific low back pain with degenerative changes
         </strong>
         – Vertebral fusion is the most common surgery for chronic, nonspecific low back pain. Surgical instrumentation (use of pedicle screws or other hardware) increases fusion rates, but it is not known if instrumentation improves clinical outcomes. More research with longer follow-up is needed to determine the appropriate role of artificial disc replacement versus fusion. We suggest that vertebral fusion be performed for patients who undergo surgical intervention for chronic low back pain (

          Discectomy for lumbar disc prolapse
         </strong>
         – In patients with lumbar disc prolapse and radiculopathy who do not have severe or progressive neurologic deficits, there is no evidence that early referral for surgery improves outcomes. Outcomes for patients who undergo discectomy, compared with nonsurgical therapy, favor surgery at short-term follow-up; however, in some trials, results are equivalent after one to two years. The optimal timing of surgery is uncertain, although benefits have been observed in patients even with subacute or chronic symptoms. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Minimally invasive discectomy techniques have not been demonstrated to be superior to traditional discectomy methods and may not be applicable for many patients. For patients with lumbar radicular symptoms of at least 6 to 12 weeks who are good surgical candidates and desire surgery based on shared decision-making, we suggest either open discectomy or microdiscectomy (
