As a result, it would be optimal to identify those survivors at the greatest risk for significant neurodevelopmental disability who would most benefit from ongoing costly comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment and early intervention services. However, early prediction of complex academic, behavioral, and functional outcomes for preterm infants is imprecise because of the limitations of available clinical tools to accurately prognosticate long-term neurodevelopmental outcome for individuals at school age, at adolescence, and as adults. The available clinical tools to predict outcome include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neuroimaging (cranial ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early childhood clinical assessment during the first two years of life consisting of neurologic examination and formal evaluation of cognitive and motor function, language, and social development and behavior.</p><p></p><p>Although these tools are useful in assessing population-based or large birth cohorts, they are not specific enough to be helpful in accurately predicting outcome for each individual survivor. Nevertheless, despite their limitations, these tools are the best ones available and are used to monitor the neurodevelopmental status of the individual survivor, who is at significant risk for NDI. Early identification of survivors who are likely to have moderate to severe neurodevelopmental deficits allows for early intervention. Further assessment through school age of survivors with or at-risk for significant impairment may detect other neurodevelopmental deficits, particularly more subtle behavioral and functional impairment. This allows for additional educational support as needed. (See <a class="local">'Approach for follow-up care'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1941180854"><span class="h2">Tools</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H363536871"><span class="h3">Neuroimaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Advances in the development and utilization of cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have enhanced detection of brain injury in preterm infants and improved the understanding of the links between brain injury and neurodevelopmental outcomes [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In particular, neuroimaging is able to identify preterm infants with significant brain injury, who are at-risk for NDI [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. However, neuroimaging poorly predicts cognitive function for the individual patients later in life. As a result, neuroimaging should not be used as the <strong>sole</strong> accurate predictor of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome for individuals. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ultrasonography</strong> – Cranial ultrasonography is the primary neuroimaging modality used to evaluate intracranial pathology in preterm infants and predict long-term outcome [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It is considerably less expensive and more readily available than MRI, although it is less sensitive. In most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), ultrasound is routinely performed for preterm infants with a gestational age (GA) &lt;32 weeks typically within the first few days or week of life. Subsequent serial exams are used for ongoing surveillance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cranial ultrasonography using both anterior fontanelle and mastoid views can reliably detect<em> </em>germinal matrix hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) and periventricular leukomalacia [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Ultrasonography is not as sensitive as MRI in detecting diffuse white matter abnormalities or cerebellar abnormalities in the posterior fossa, particularly during the first month of life [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. However, extremely preterm (EPT) infants (GA &lt;28 weeks) with normal ultrasounds at term equivalent are unlikely to have moderate or severe white matter or gray matter abnormalities on MRI performed at term-age equivalent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Abnormal late ultrasound findings (35 to 42 weeks postmenstrual age) associated with an increased risk of cognitive delay and/or psychomotor delay include moderate or severe ventriculomegaly, echolucency and echodensity, severe IVH (grade III or higher), and periventricular hemorrhage [<a href="#rid2">2,5,6</a>]. As a result, it is the most commonly used neuroimaging modality for the detection of brain injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127099.html" rel="external">"Overview of cerebellar injury and malformations in neonates", section on 'Neuroimaging'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5051.html" rel="external">"Germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the newborn: Risk factors, clinical features, screening, and diagnosis", section on 'Screening'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although patients with neonatal cranial ultrasound abnormalities compared with those with normal studies are more likely to have long-term NDI, approximately one-fourth of EPT infants with a normal ultrasound may still have cognitive and psychomotor delay [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. As a result, the lack of sensitivity in detecting all patients with long-term impairment by ultrasound must be taken into account. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It also uncertain whether low-grade (grade I or II) GMH-IVH detected by cranial ultrasonography is associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes, especially in EPT infants. The controversy on the effect of grade I and II GMH-IVH based on different outcomes from observational studies is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5000.html" rel="external">"Germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the newborn: Management and outcome", section on 'Low-grade GMH-IVH'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>MRI at term gestation</strong> – MRI at term gestation may be useful in predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcome for preterm infants at risk for NDI. In our practice, we perform MRI selectively based upon clinical risk factors in the individual patient [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. We do not perform routine MRI due to its increased costs, logistics, and potential for parental anxiety without accessible evidence-based interventions. (See <a class="local">'Selective MRI imaging'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Neonatal MRI studies have shown that most very preterm infants (GA ≤30 weeks) have white matter abnormalities, which include increasing ventricular size, decreasing white matter volume, increasing intensity of white matter signal, and evidence of decreasing myelination [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>]. Studies have shown correlation between MRI findings at term equivalent and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, particularly if the MRI is grossly abnormal (predictive of poor neurodevelopmental outcome) or normal (predictive of favorable neurodevelopmental outcome) [<a href="#rid2">2,9-11,13-19</a>]. However, a prospective cohort study from a single center reported that while MRI findings at term were associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in the short term (ie, at two years of age), many of the correlations did not persist to age 10 years [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The only domains for which early MRI findings continued to correlate with at age 10 years were motor skills and behavior, whereas the correlation with cognitive function was no longer significant. In this study, environmental factors (such as maternal level of education) were more predictive of cognitive function as children grew older. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, not all children with white matter abnormalities on term MRI had severe impairment, and severe neurologic impairment can occur in children without white matter abnormalities. As a result, the use of neuroimaging <strong>alone</strong> is insufficient to determine long-term outcome and follow-up intervention for individual patients [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The cost and challenge of performing MRI in infants also limit the routine use of MRI. Infants need to be transported to the MRI suite and sedation may be required to minimize motion artifact, requiring personnel with expertise in neonatal transport and sedation. Accurate neonatal MRI readings require expertise by knowledgeable pediatric neuroradiologists. In particular, the ability to detect mild and moderate degrees of injury on MRI may need sophisticated scanning sequences as well as proficiency in the analysis of results.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3712124569"><span class="h3">Formal clinical assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For preterm survivors who are at-risk for NDI, early clinical assessment can identify moderate to severe impairments. Children with significant NDI in early childhood often have persistent disability at school age and may benefit from early intervention [<a href="#rid21">21-24</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Early intervention programs'</a> below.) </p><p>Comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment is generally reserved for at-risk survivors because it is costly and time-consuming. (See <a class="local">'Identifying at-risk infants'</a> below.)</p><p>During the first two years of life, the formal clinical assessment for NDI includes <strong>all</strong> of the following.

However, a systematic review of the literature reported that the evidence, which is based on a small number of studies, is limited due to the high risk of bias and the wide variability in study design, including EEG criteria and outcome measures [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. As a result, aEEG and EEG should <strong>not</strong> be used clinically and should be restricted as a research tool until there are high-quality studies that show that they are accurate predictors of neurodevelopmental outcome.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H363543685"><span class="h1">APPROACH FOR FOLLOW-UP CARE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1223092451"><span class="h2">Goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At discharge, our overall goals of follow-up care for the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) survivor and his/her family are to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Effectively manage long-term sequelae of preterm birth</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Facilitate optimal growth and development of the child</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Integrate the child into the family, school system, and targeted community services</p><p></p><p>Because of the need to provide optimal care to the infants discharged from the NICU, who are primarily preterm infants, guidelines for the primary care provider in the management of these patients from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have been developed [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].

In some units, the follow-up medical team meets with the family once the infant is stable and provides information, including educational material (eg, brochures) to the family and stresses both the importance of follow-up and partnership with their primary care provider. The initial follow-up visit with the primary care provider should occur within a few days to a week after neonatal discharge depending on the infant's GA and clinical status. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5005.html" rel="external">"Care of the neonatal intensive care unit graduate", section on 'Initial visit'</a>.)</p><p>This visit should evaluate the adaptation to the home environment and troubleshoot any medical concerns. There should be specific assessment of the infant's feeding behavior, frequency, and volume; safe sleep positioning; and medication dosing and administration practices; and the parents' understanding of the home feeding plan, including the way to increase the calories of the breast milk (if needed) and/or mix the formula. In addition, the physical examination should include assessment of the infant's head control, muscle tone, level of alertness and activity, and presence of asymmetric neurologic findings. The general pediatrician may use screening tools such as the Ages and Stages Questionnaire [<a href="#rid30">30</a>] and Child Behavior Checklist to screen development  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116108" href="/d/graphic/116108.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and behavior prior to referral for a neurodevelopmental assessment.

In a meta-analysis of 16 randomized and quasi-randomized trials, EI improved cognitive function in infancy and preschool age, but the differences were no longer statistically significant at school age [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial found that a preventive EI program had minimal long-term effects of neurodevelopment (with the exception of improved achievement in mathematics); however, parents in the EI group were less likely to experience depressive symptoms [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. There is also evidence that EI programs may improve the early childhood outcome of high-risk preterm children, especially those from marginalized socioeconomical groups [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. EI programs vary in their timing, setting, duration, intensity, and focus, and it remains uncertain what components, if any, have significant long-term effects.

In most states, patients discharged from NICU meet the eligibility criteria for diagnostic evaluation, which consists of a multidisciplinary set of assessments (eg, medical, nutritional, speech/language, hearing, vision, development, and family). However, eligibility for EI differs from state to state and not all NICU graduates will qualify in some states. Unfortunately, many children undergo their initial assessment for early intervention and are found to have a normal neurologic exam and are thus discharged from EI program. It is important to evaluate children at subsequent time points for the emergence of possible developmental delay.
