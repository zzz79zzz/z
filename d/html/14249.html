Pain affects the psychological, cognitive, physical, social, and spiritual domains of patients' lives, and its burden is manifested not only through the experience of the symptom itself, but also through impaired function, decreased activity, and alterations in one's sense of identity and social role. Poorly relieved pain can have a profoundly negative impact on the quality of life and can trigger hopelessness, despair, and a desire for a hastened death. Caregivers who are witnesses to pain also may experience helplessness, distress, and burden. For both patients and caregivers, the assumption that pain heralds progressive disease may cause fear and distress.</p><p>Although opioid-based pharmacotherapy is widely accepted as the mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe pain in patients with active cancer, other treatment approaches should be considered in every case. A multimodality approach that includes nonpharmacologic therapies in conjunction with opioids has the potential to augment pain relief, reduce opioid side effects through lower opioid doses, and yield better physical and psychosocial outcomes. There are numerous nonpharmacologic therapies, including primary treatments for the etiology of the pain (eg, radiotherapy), and both invasive (eg, nerve blocks) and noninvasive symptomatic therapies.</p><p>This topic review discusses a diverse group of noninvasive, nonpharmacologic therapies that are widely used as adjuncts to opioid therapy for patients with cancer pain. Included are the so called integrative (complementary) approaches and rehabilitative therapies that employ physical medicine techniques for analgesic purposes. Classification approaches for integrative therapies vary and this review encompasses well accepted psychologic approaches that are sometimes included among the integrative therapies, specifically mind-body approaches (eg, relaxation training, meditation, guided imagery and clinical hypnosis). Cognitive behavioral therapy is considered a mainstream, conventional psychologic approach. However, because it often incorporates mind-body practices (eg mindfulness) it can be described as an integrative therapy [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Assessment of cancer pain, a review of specific cancer pain syndromes, general principles of cancer pain management, the clinical use of opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics (including adjuvant analgesics), invasive symptomatic therapies for cancer pain management, and an overview of complementary and integrative therapies in oncology care are covered separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2795.html" rel="external">"Assessment of cancer pain"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2804.html" rel="external">"Overview of cancer pain syndromes"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2792.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2815.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: Role of adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14248.html" rel="external">"Interventional therapies for chronic pain"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2805.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy for the management of painful bone metastases"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2831.html" rel="external">"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H44713453"><span class="h1">REHABILITATIVE INTERVENTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The primary goal of rehabilitative interventions may be functional improvement, symptom control, or both. The sections that follow will focus on role in symptom management. Interventions include various types of therapeutic exercise (usually initiated or guided by a physical therapist); hydrotherapy; the use of orthoses, ambulation aids, or other devices; and the use of modalities, such as the application of heat and cold, vibration, ultrasound, or electricity (eg, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS]). A focused approach to the treatment of cancer or cancer-treatment-related lymphedema that includes massage therapy also may be included if this condition is present and contributing to symptom distress. (See <a class="local">'Lymphedema treatment'</a> below and <a class="local">'Massage therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Other approaches that use electricity or magnetic waves are invasive (eg, dorsal column stimulation) or yet rarely considered for cancer patients (eg, transcranial neuromodulation) and are not discussed in this topic. Some of these techniques and other invasive interventional therapies for cancer pain are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14248.html" rel="external">"Interventional therapies for chronic pain"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H44713460"><span class="h2">Therapeutic exercise</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Therapeutic exercise has the potential for analgesia resulting from both direct and indirect effects, and also improves self-efficacy, functional gains, and quality of life. A role in cancer pain management is particularly suggested when the pain is related to musculoskeletal pathology that may be addressed by supervised exercise. Safe and effective therapy is most assured when treatment is implemented by a physical therapist who has experience with pain and is competent in dealing with the specific concerns related to cancer and its treatment.</p><p>Therapeutic exercise (physical therapy) can be a time-limited intervention that may ameliorate pain and other musculoskeletal symptoms. Therapeutic exercise involves the systematic implementation of planned physical movements, postures, or activities designed to ameliorate impairment, improve function, and enhance overall wellbeing. Manual stretching, myofascial therapy, passive mobilization, and active exercises are some of the modalities utilized within this approach. The type, frequency, and duration of exercise is always informed by the specific needs and medical condition of the patient and the overall goals of care. Self-exercises using an inflatable ball and Pilates (a low-impact exercise program that focuses on improving flexibility, stability, core strength and range of motion) may be considered in tandem with therapeutic exercise as approaches that may address pain and function impairment in cancer patients.</p><p>Particularly in patients who have musculoskeletal pathology contributing to pain or dysfunction, physical therapy may address this pathology and yield positive effects. Indirect positive effects resulting from general conditioning or other physiologic or psychologic changes also may occur [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>There are very few data from high-quality controlled studies that assess the impact of therapeutic exercise on pain [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Nonetheless, studies in cancer populations, including populations with advanced cancer [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], suggest benefits for exercise in terms of symptom control and other aspects of quality of life:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A systematic review of 18 randomized studies demonstrated the effectiveness of physical therapy for improving postoperative pain and range of motion after breast cancer treatment [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A multicenter trial that randomized 355 patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) to usual care or usual care plus Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP; a six-week, individualized, moderate-intensity program of progressive walking and resistance training) found that EXCAP was effective in reducing numbness and tingling and hot/coldness in hands and feet [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Another randomized trial of a 10-week, home-based exercise program (incorporating muscle strengthening and balancing exercise) in 45 patients with CIPN showed that this program yielded significant positive change in neuropathic pain scores and quality of life [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The benefits of exercise in patients with chemotherapy-induced chronic neuropathy are addressed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94976.html" rel="external">"Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy", section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another randomized trial of 121 breast cancer survivors with aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia found that 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week and supervised strength training sessions twice a week yielded a significant reduction of joint pain, pain severity, and interference group [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. A similar benefit was shown in the randomized HOPE trial [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer", section on 'Musculoskeletal pains and stiffness'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective study of 102 adult cancer patients found that an individualized exercise program resulted in a significant improvement in cardiopulmonary function and both fatigue and pain [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2813.html" rel="external">"Cancer-related fatigue: Treatment", section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A quasi-experimental study of inflatable ball exercise in breast cancer survivors found that the intervention significantly improved flexion and extension of shoulder range of motion compared with conventional exercise (n = 38 in inflatable exercise group and n = 34 in conventional exercise group). The authors concluded that inflatable ball exercise could be appropriate to start a physical rehabilitation program and should be followed by conventional exercise after the pain and range of motion have improved [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized studies and two uncontrolled trials evaluating Pilates concluded that this approach was superior to other therapeutic exercise programs in improving pain and self-reported upper extremity function in patients with breast cancer [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H676924897"><span class="h3">Hydrotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hydrotherapy involves the supervised submersion into water of the patient or a part of the patient's body to address symptoms or impairments. It provides a reduced-gravity environment and sensory experience that may decrease pain with movement, augment muscle relaxation, improve emotional state, and facilitate physical therapy (ie, aquatic exercise) because of the effect of buoyancy and decreased stress on joints. Patients may report both physical and psychologic benefits.</p><p>Hydrotherapy has been used in many disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and fibromyalgia [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7790.html" rel="external">"Treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults", section on 'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7498.html" rel="external">"Nonpharmacologic therapies for patients with rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Physical therapy'</a>.) </p><p>Hydrotherapy has also been used in the management of pain and other symptoms in populations with cancer. A 2022 systematic review of studies reporting the use, effectiveness, and potential harms associated with water therapy for cancer-related symptoms identified 12 studies describing 430 patients [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]; outcomes were heterogeneous and definitive conclusions were not possible, but the data suggested that the approaches are generally safe and can benefit some patients. For example, a single-blind randomized trial of 40 breast cancer survivors with aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia found that aquatic exercise in a chest-high pool (three sessions/week for a total of 24 sessions over two months) decreased the pressure pain threshold in neck, hand, shoulder, and leg, with no worsening of pain, compared with controls [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/764.html" rel="external">"Managing the side effects of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors", section on 'Musculoskeletal pains and stiffness'</a>.)</p><p>As with other therapeutic exercise approaches, hydrotherapy and aquatic exercise should always be preceded by a consultation between the physiatrist and the oncologist and careful evaluation of the patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H44713467"><span class="h2">Orthoses and other devices</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Examples of orthoses include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immobilizers of the shoulder and arm for a painful brachial plexopathy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Corsets for persistent pain after treatment for vertebral metastases.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Wrist or ankle splints for distal extremity weakness or pain related to neuropathy.</p><p></p><p>Patients with pain on movement may benefit from a splint that is designed to limit those motions that incite the pain. In the cancer population, and particularly in the setting of advanced illness, the use of an orthosis may be preferable to other interventions, such as physical therapy, that attempt to improve function. A return to full function may not be possible, or it may not be the primary treatment goal. Evaluation by an occupational therapist, with input by the oncologist, can clarify the availability and cost of various options.</p><p>Stump pain may be ameliorated by a well-fitting prosthesis, an ambulation aid may reduce pain exacerbation with walking, and devices designed to facilitate specific functions such as toileting or eating can have analgesic consequences or reduce the risk of secondary painful complications related to immobility.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H44713474"><span class="h2">Other modalities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The therapeutic application of heat or cold, ultrasound, and electrical stimulation to focal sites of pain that are unrelated to cancer (eg, sprains) is widely accepted. However, there have been very few studies evaluating short-term efficacy, long-term effectiveness, and safety of these physical modalities in populations with cancer pain, and the evidence in other populations is extremely limited [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Physical modalities may be especially useful as adjuncts for mild to moderate pain and while awaiting the effect of a breakthrough analgesic. They are never adequate alone for managing moderate or severe cancer pain. There are no comparative data to guide suggestions concerning the selection of specific modalities when used as adjunctive treatment for pain, and the choice of technique is empirical. Based on inference and concern about adverse cutaneous effects, guidelines often suggest avoiding the topical application of these stimuli to areas with reduced sensation and those that are directly superficial to tumor masses.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23390067"><span class="h3">Cold</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cold application with ice packs, malleable chemical gel packs, and vapocoolant sprays may reduce muscle spasm, inflammation, and edema. Cold produces an initial vasoconstriction, followed by vasodilation, but the extent to which these effects relate to analgesia is unknown. Despite widespread use, there are no controlled studies of cold-induced analgesia for cancer pain. Application of cold should be avoided in ischemic and irradiated tissues [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2689394121"><span class="h3">Heat</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Various heating methods may be used to help manage focal or regional, acute or chronic pain. Heat increases local blood flow and may decrease joint stiffness; it also may induce a state of mental relaxation. Pain relief may be related to these effects. Evidence for efficacy in cancer pain is lacking but heating approaches often are tried for musculoskeletal pains. Superficial heating can be accomplished with hot packs, medicated heat patches (eg, containing <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8840" href="/z/d/drug information/8840.html" rel="external">capsaicin</a>), heating pads, or hot baths.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23390227"><span class="h3">TENS and other electrostimulation devices</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is widely used, despite limited evidence of efficacy in any type of chronic pain, including cancer-related pain [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Although case reports and uncontrolled studies suggest efficacy with limited duration of benefit [<a href="#rid22">22</a>], two small randomized trials of TENS in patients with cancer pain were negative [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>], and five systematic reviews concluded that there was insufficient evidence to judge whether TENS should be used in adults with cancer-related pain [<a href="#rid21">21,25-28</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, clinical experience suggests that some patients with cancer-related pain benefit from TENS, and TENS is included in the list of potential nonpharmacologic interventions for adult cancer pain in guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>TENS can be tried during a home trial or as a supervised trial when working with a physical therapist. Given the lack of certainly about the stimulation parameters most likely to help in an individual patient, a serious trial of TENS requires many days and should explore various sites and timing of stimulation, as well as a variety of stimulation parameters (amplitude, frequency, and pattern).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H624905594"><span class="h3">Scrambler therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Scrambler therapy is a novel transcutaneous neurostimulatory approach that involves the delivery of electrical current through electrocardiogram-like pads that are placed bilaterally on the skin, above and below the site of pain. It has been evaluated through case series, surveys, and small trials involving patients with chronic noncancer neuropathic pain [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>] or CIPN [<a href="#rid32">32-34</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective survey of 219 patients treated with Scrambler therapy for different types of chronic pain (37.9 percent with cancer pain) documented pain reduction for at least two weeks [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On the other hand, two randomized, sham-controlled pilot trials of scrambler therapy for CIPN yielded conflicting results, one positive [<a href="#rid33">33</a>] and one negative [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p>The available data support the conclusion that Scrambler therapy is safe [<a href="#rid36">36</a>], and notwithstanding the need for larger randomized studies, the available data suggest that Scrambler therapy may be a useful alternative for some patients [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. A neuropathic component to the pain may increase the likelihood of benefit. The use of Scrambler therapy for treatment of patients with CIPN is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94976.html" rel="external">"Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy", section on 'Scrambler therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23390263"><span class="h3">Ultrasound</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Focal musculoskeletal pains also may be treated with ultrasound. The technique is widely regarded as safe but there have been no studies that assess efficacy or effectiveness relative to other modalities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7757.html" rel="external">"Overview of soft tissue musculoskeletal disorders", section on 'Myofascial pain syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H44713481"><span class="h2">Lymphedema treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the cancer population, lymphedema usually occurs in an extremity and results from cancer treatment; it is often painful. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17013.html" rel="external">"Lower extremity lymphedema"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/755.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104714.html" rel="external">"Breast cancer-associated lymphedema"</a>.)</p><p>Numerous clinical guidelines have been developed to guide the treatment of lymphedema; several focus on the cancer population [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Most of these guidelines, whether cancer-related or not, recommend an integrated approach that considers both physical and psychologic interventions.

Relaxation techniques can take many forms and are increasingly being incorporated in several therapeutic exercise and psychotherapy approaches. Relaxation is also an essential component in clinical hypnosis and yoga. In its simplest form, relaxation practice involves focusing attention on the breath. The patient is invited to breathe in and out slowly and regularly (eg, "Take a slow, deep breath" or "Take three slow, cleansing breaths"). Simple imagery can be suggested, such as imagining releasing tension with the outbreath and receiving energizing or soothing energy during the inbreath.</p><p>Relaxation techniques share two components: the repetitive focus on a word or phrase, sound, or breath, body sensation such as muscular activity, and the adoption of a passive attitude towards intrusive thoughts. As a group, relaxation techniques attempt to induce a so-called relaxation response characterized by decreased arousal and diminished sympathetic activity (eg, decreased heart rate and lower blood pressure). This is accompanied by increased electroencephalographic slow wave activity. When used therapeutically, relaxation techniques may be divided into two methods, deep and brief, or by the specific strategy used to induce the relaxed state, including progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training, and breath training. The data are currently insufficient to conclude that any one technique is more effective than another for any given condition.</p><p>A benefit for relaxation for cancer pain has been shown in several small randomized trials [<a href="#rid91">91,92,118-120</a>], but in some cases, the benefits have been transient. In a trial of 59 patients with cancer pain requiring opioid therapy who were randomly assigned to one of three active CBTs (distraction, positive mood, or relaxation interventions) or to a control, patients in the relaxation and distraction groups reported significantly decreased pain intensity immediately after intervention [<a href="#rid120">120</a>].

Guided imagery practitioners use words to create states of focused attention that are thought to alter the experience of pain. Other techniques, such as distraction, mental dissociation, muscle relaxation, and controlled abdominal breathing, are also practiced as part of guided imagery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Two of the most common clinical imagery techniques are mental rehearsal imagery and end-state imagery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Mental rehearsal imagery is a technique that is often used to prepare patients for painful treatments or surgical procedures (eg, biopsies).

End-state imagery has been successfully used to alleviate chemotherapy-induced nausea and to assist in the control of cancer pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">End state imagery for the treatment of pain is called analgesic imagery; it is either pain-transforming or pain-incompatible. Pain-transforming imagery concentrates on changing specific aspects of the pain experience, such as the contextual aspect of the painful experience (eg, imagining that the moment the chemotherapy needle touches the skin and before it is inserted, it releases a massive amount of powerful analgesic medication that completely numbs the arm). Pain incompatible-imagery can be used to evoke positive emotions and feelings of relaxation, excitement, or peace that are not compatible with the image of pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Published outcomes from older studies on mental rehearsal imagery were almost uniformly positive, reporting significant reductions in pain and anxiety, length of postoperative hospital stay, pain medication use, and fewer treatment-related side effects [<a href="#rid91">91,115,119,125,126</a>].

The instrument transforms a physiologic response, such as skin temperature, into an electrical signal, which is amplified and displayed in the form of a visible and/or audible stimulus such as a changing tone, a light bar, or a moving line on a computer screen [<a href="#rid130">130,131</a>]. By monitoring the stimulus and learning to control the physiologic response that generates it, biofeedback can facilitate healthier cognitive and behavioral response patterns to pain and stress.

Surface EMG biofeedback, for example, has been used for the treatment of cancer-related pain by targeting muscle groups associated with the patient's response to pain; relaxing these muscles can also help induce a general relaxation response, which can further alter pain perception or reduce anxiety [<a href="#rid133">133,134</a>].

Generally, meditation involves consistent daily or regular practice. Some examples include mindfulness meditation, transcendental meditation, and Zen meditation.</p><p>Mindfulness is the practice of focusing attention on internal or external stimuli without evaluating or judging and it can be a core component of several interventions. Among these, MBSR developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn, has been investigated in several studies. It is an eight-week, evidence-based and group intervention that uses meditation practices to increase awareness, learn self-regulation strategies, and improve adaptation to stress and physical and psychologic discomfort. This patient-centered educational and training approach essentially teaches people how to live in the moment and take better care of themselves.

Most meditation practices have four elements in common: a quiet location with few distractions; a specific, comfortable posture achieved by sitting or lying down; a focus of attention; and an open attitude of letting thoughts come and go naturally without judgment [<a href="#rid137">137</a>]. The focus of attention may be on a specific target, such as the breath or a repeated sound or mantra (known as concentration meditation); on all experiences that enter the field of awareness (called open awareness or mindfulness meditation); or a combination of both.</p><p>Very few studies have suggested benefit for meditation in controlling pain in cancer patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a prospective single arm study, for example, 75 breast cancer survivors practiced Pranic meditation 20 minutes at a time, twice daily, for eight weeks and experienced a significant improvement in quality of life scores and scores for pain, as well as fatigue self-image, and sleep disturbance [<a href="#rid138">138</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a retrospective analysis of 34 children receiving anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody treatment (which is associated with a high prevalence of visceral pain during the infusion) for high-risk neuroblastoma [<a href="#rid139">139</a>], 24 were able to complete 11 minutes of meditation on the first or second attempt, and this group received significantly fewer doses of analgesic medication.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2831.html" rel="external">"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm", section on 'Reiki'</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, there is no scientific evidence supporting the existence of the energy field thought to play a role in Reiki. Proponents of Reiki suggest that it can reduce stress and induce a relaxation response, which may be therapeutic in a manner similar to other MBPs. The Reiki practitioner can provide a calm and reassuring presence. Additionally, they will typically attune their breathing to the patient's and progressively slowing and deepening their breath, which can have a beneficial effect on the patient's well-being.</p><p>Reiki for patients with cancer has received increasing interest in clinical settings, including palliative care, but the limited data on effectiveness and the lack of large and well-controlled studies prevent drawing firm conclusions as to its benefits for pain management [<a href="#rid180">180,181</a>].

It is based on the premise that cure can result from stimulation of the body's natural healing abilities. This is achieved by introducing into the body a substance that, in a healthy person, can induce symptoms that are identical to the symptoms of the disease. The philosophical foundations of homeopathy can be found in Hippocrates' teachings of the Law of Similars, or "like cures like." It is also based on the "law of minimum dose," the notion that the lower the dose of the medication, the greater its effectiveness. Thus, homeopathic remedies are dilutions of substances that are derived from plants, minerals, and animals; patients are prescribed the remedies that most closely match their symptom profile. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2831.html" rel="external">"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm", section on 'Homeopathy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14591.html" rel="external">"Homeopathy"</a>.)</p><p>Homeopathy is one of the most popular complementary/integrative therapies chosen to address chemotherapy side effects among cancer patients in Europe [<a href="#rid193">193</a>].
