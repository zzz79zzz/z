         Timely recognition and management of issues that arise in the immediate postoperative period may be life-saving. The likelihood that a specific complication will arise for a given patient is determined by the nature of the procedure, the anesthetic techniques used, the patient's comorbidities, and preoperative medical assessment and optimization.

         It is common practice for most patients who receive general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia care to be monitored in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) prior to discharge from the hospital or transfer to a ward bed. The exception is critically ill patients and those who are intubated, who may bypass the PACU and be recovered directly in an intensive care unit (ICU). In most PACUs, medical oversight of patients is the responsibility of the anesthesiology service.

         The initial handoff from the anesthesia care team to personnel in the PACU is typically standardized, as shown in the examples  (

         PACU care is typically divided into two phases. Phase I emphasizes ensuring the patient's full recovery from anesthesia and return of vital signs to near baseline. Phase II recovery focuses on preparing patients for hospital discharge, including education regarding the surgeon's postoperative instructions and any prescribed discharge medications.

         ]. Neuromuscular function is also assessed by physical examination; a peripheral nerve stimulator may be employed for patients who remain intubated and received a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) intraoperatively (see

         In addition to standard assessments, the degree of analgesic efficacy and gradual return of motor and sensory function are documented in patients who have received a neuraxial block. (See

          1
         </a>
         ]. There are no evidence-based guidelines regarding frequency of vital sign monitoring in the PACU. Vital signs are typically obtained every five minutes for the first 15 minutes, then every 15 minutes for the duration of the Phase I period. Typically, HR and BP are maintained within approximately 20 percent of baseline values for the individual patient, while RR and SpO
         <sub>

         are maintained as close to baseline levels as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         During Phase II recovery, vital signs are typically obtained every 30 to 60 minutes. For patients remaining in the PACU due to logistical reasons after discharge criteria have been met (eg, lack of inpatient bed availability or a ride home), vital signs are obtained only when indicated or at the same frequency employed in the hospital unit to which the patient will be transferred.

         A retrospective review involving 18,473 patients noted that the most common problem in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) is postoperative nausea and vomiting (9.8 percent) [

Other complications involved the upper airway (6.9 percent) or cardiovascular system (eg, hypotension [2.7 percent], dysrhythmias [1.4 percent], hypertension [1.1 percent], major cardiac events [0.6 percent]). In a 2002 review of 419 PACU incident reports from the Australian Incident Monitoring Study (AIMS), 44 percent were upper airway or respiratory complications, while 24 percent were cardiovascular complications [

         Since epidural catheters are often placed just prior to induction of anesthesia, presence of an epidural hematoma may not become apparent until the effects of anesthetics and sedatives have worn off. The most common presenting symptoms for neurologically significant SEH are progressive motor block, sensory block, or bowel and bladder dysfunction; back pain is a less common presenting complaint [
         <a href="#rid6">

        </p>
        <p>
         Lack of expected resolution of motor block may raise concern for SEH. Although rare, SEH is a medical emergency that requires urgent assessment and treatment. Typically, emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed (or computed tomography [CT] scan if MRI is contraindicated). If SEH is detected, urgent consultation with the neurosurgery or orthopedic spine surgery service is necessary for possible decompressive laminectomy since neurologic recovery is more likely if decompression occurs within eight hours of symptom onset.

         Postoperative temperature derangements are common; thus, temperature is measured during initial assessment upon arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Both hypothermia and hyperthermia have negative consequences in the immediate postoperative period, and either may cause shivering and/or thermal discomfort.

         Patients who are unable to void in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) may or may not complain of bladder fullness or lower abdominal discomfort, and physical examination is not sufficiently sensitive to detect bladder volume before the development of overdistention [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Thus, bladder volume is measured directly either with ultrasound or by draining the bladder, which requires catheterization. We prefer bladder ultrasound because this noninvasive technique will usually confirm the diagnosis. This technique is employed in any patient with risk factors for POUR who remains unable to void four hours after surgery [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. If &gt;600 mL is measured on ultrasound, or if the patient has discomfort with suspected inaccuracy of the ultrasound measurement (eg, due to body habitus, tissue edema, prior surgery with scarring), a one-time bladder catheterization is performed while the patient is still in the PACU. The volume of urine drained in the first 10 to 15 minutes after bladder catheterization should be noted and recorded. If volume exceeds 400 mL in a patient who will be admitted as a hospital inpatient, the catheter may be left in place. Clean intermittent catheterization is also an option [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, ambulatory patients who have no risk factors for POUR and &lt;600 mL of urine measured with bladder ultrasound may be discharged home without being catheterized even if they have not urinated [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         Discharge criteria are designed to determine a patient's readiness to safely leave the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Several scoring systems have been developed, both for the Phase I and Phase II PACU periods [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-17
         </a>
         ] (see
         <a class="local">
          'Phases in the post-anesthesia care unit'
         </a>
         above). For example, the Postanesthetic Discharge Scoring System (PADSS) is based on vital signs, activity level, nausea or vomiting, pain, surgical bleeding, and intake and output; criteria for discharge to home typically include a PADSS score ≥9 [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. A commonly used modification of the PADSS system is shown in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100381" href="/z/d/graphic/100381.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). Another example is the Aldrete score, which includes five elements (activity, respiration, circulation, consciousness, oxygen saturation) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The Modified Aldrete system includes five additional elements that are particularly useful during the Phase II recovery period prior to discharge to home (dressing, pain, ambulation, feeding, urine output) [

         In some cases, a patient may be discharged from the PACU when one or more of these criteria are unmet if there is consensus among the surgeon (or proceduralist), anesthesiologist, and PACU nurse. Ideally, each patient should be assessed by an anesthesiologist prior to discharge, with documentation of any exceptions to standard discharge criteria. Fully trained nurses should be available to care for all postoperative patients until the time of discharge [

         A "fast track" pathway for discharge from the PACU is appropriate for some ambulatory surgical patients [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ]. Patients who are "fast-tracked" bypass Phase I recovery and proceed directly from the operating room to Phase II recovery. The main benefits of this approach are shorter times to patient discharge and increased PACU productivity. Most fast-track protocols involve the use of preemptive analgesia and intraoperative use of short-acting anesthetic drugs and techniques. Careful patient selection is needed to ensure that a fast-track pathway does not increase risk of postoperative morbidity.

          Assessment of neuraxial block
         </strong>
         – In patients who have received a neuraxial block, the degree of analgesic efficacy and gradual return of motor and sensory function are documented. Suspected complications of a neuraxial anesthetic, in particular spinal epidural hematoma (SEH), may require urgent assessment and treatment. (See
         <a class="local">

          Inability to void
         </strong>
         – Patients with patient-specific, procedure-specific, and/or anesthetic-specific risk factors for urinary retention should undergo assessment of urinary volume with bladder ultrasound to determine if one-time catheterization is needed prior to PACU discharge. Patients are instructed to seek medical attention if they have not spontaneously voided within eight hours after discharge. (See

          Discharge criteria
         </strong>
         – Standardized discharge criteria are designed to determine a patient's readiness to safely leave the PACU setting. An example is the Postanesthetic Discharge Scoring System (PADSS), with points based on vital signs, activity level, nausea and/or vomiting, pain, and surgical bleeding  (

          Post-anesthetic evaluation
         </strong>
         – An evaluation should be completed and documented by a qualified anesthesia provider (eg, an anesthesiologist or certified registered nurse anesthetist or anesthesiology assistant) within 48 hours of the procedure. Respiratory and cardiovascular function, mental status, temperature, pain level, nausea or vomiting, hydration status, and possible awareness with recall are assessed. (See
