The assessment and management of spider bites caused by recluse and widow spiders are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6485.html" rel="external">"Bites of recluse spiders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88938.html" rel="external">"Widow spider bites: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6510.html" rel="external">"Widow spider bites: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2766493592"><span class="h1">MEDICALLY IMPORTANT SPIDERS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spiders are arachnids (a group of arthropods), which have four pairs of legs, similar to scorpions, mites, and ticks  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50381" href="/d/graphic/50381.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). They use sharp fangs at the end of their chelicerae (mouth appendages) to bite prey (typically insects, other arthropods, or small vertebrates) and inject venom. The arachnology of recluse and widow spiders is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6485.html" rel="external">"Bites of recluse spiders", section on 'Entomology of recluse spiders'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88938.html" rel="external">"Widow spider bites: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Arachnology'</a>.)</p><p>Spider bites are rare medical events. Of the thousands of spider species that exist around the world, only a handful cause problems in humans [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The venom of most spiders has little or no effect on mammalian tissues [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. In addition, only a few species have cheliceral muscles powerful enough to penetrate human skin, and most of these spiders bite humans only in rare and extreme circumstances (eg, as they are being fatally crushed between skin and some object). Thus, most spiders pose no threat to humans.</p><p>The spiders most likely to inflict medically significant bites in humans include widow and false black widow spiders, recluse spiders, Australian funnel web spiders, and <em>Phoneutria</em> spiders [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Each of these spiders is described briefly below, and their appearance and geographical distribution are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59049" href="/d/graphic/59049.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1086737961"><span class="h2">Widow spiders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>Latrodectus</em>, or widow spiders (found worldwide), include the Southern black widow  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78920" href="/d/graphic/78920.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) and Western black widow in the United States, and the Australian redback spider. Although less toxic than the black widows, the brown widow  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79607" href="/d/graphic/79607.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) is causing increased interest because of its novelty as a nonnative spider quickly spreading throughout the southern United States. Widow bites cause unremarkable local lesions that are sometimes accompanied by a characteristic systemic reaction with prominent, proximally-spreading severe pain and localized diaphoresis surrounding the site of the bite. Rigid abdominal musculature may also occur and be mistaken for an acute surgical abdomen. Sialorrhea, diffuse erythema, muscle tremors or weakness, and neurologic manifestations including tetany and seizures may occur in infants and preschool children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88938.html" rel="external">"Widow spider bites: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Black widow spiders'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1388299389"><span class="h2">False black widow spiders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>Steatoda</em> or false black widow spiders (found worldwide) are less often implicated in human bites, and typically cause less severe symptoms that those of widows. Significant local reactions accompanied by pain, pruritus, and secondary infection have occurred  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73853" href="/d/graphic/73853.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). <em>Steatoda</em> bites are usually painful and may be accompanied by nausea, headache, lethargy, and malaise. Diaphoresis may occur but is less common than in patients with <em>Latrodectus</em> bites. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88938.html" rel="external">"Widow spider bites: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'False black widow spiders'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1688786013"><span class="h2">Recluse spiders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>Loxosceles</em> or recluse spiders are found predominantly in North and South America  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70229" href="/d/graphic/70229.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). Their initial fang penetration is typically painless, but development of pain within the next few days can be significant. Their bites may appear as red plaques or papules that develop central pallor  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71174" href="/d/graphic/71174.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>). Skin examination features are provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94477" href="/d/graphic/94477.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Although recluse bites are notorious for becoming necrotic  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96172" href="/d/graphic/96172.html" rel="external">picture 6</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96174" href="/d/graphic/96174.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>), this progression happens in a minority of cases.</p><p>Systemic reactions to bites are usually mild and consist of nonspecific systemic signs and symptoms. Rarely, patients may develop systemic manifestations including constitutional symptoms and hematologic abnormalities. Systemic response is very rare but can be critical in children who develop hemoglobinuria, hemoglobinemia, and thrombocytopenia. Systemic manifestation is of concern because it can be fatal in 12 to 30 hours, prior to lesion manifestation, confounding accurate diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6485.html" rel="external">"Bites of recluse spiders"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2512789750"><span class="h2">Australian funnel web spiders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Australian funnel web spiders are found in limited areas of eastern coastal Australia [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Their bites can cause dramatic systemic reactions that mimic organophosphate poisoning and include salivation, diaphoresis, muscle spasms, tachycardia, hypertension, muscle fasciculations (tongue fasciculations are typical), paresthesias, catecholamine-induced myocarditis, and pulmonary edema [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p>First aid for a suspected funnel web spider envenomation consists of pressure immobilization applied as for elapid snake bites without local tissue necrosis and rapid transport to definitive care [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93182.html" rel="external">"Snakebites worldwide: Management", section on 'Pressure immobilization'</a>.)</p><p>Antivenom, derived from rabbit IgG, is typically given to patients with severe signs of envenomation [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Dosing consists of two to four vials for severe envenomation and two vials for signs of systemic envenomation [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In one case series of eight patients, two vials of antivenom were sufficient to bind all free venom in serum samples from patients with moderate to severe envenomation, although cardiac toxicity in severe cases was not reversed [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Allergic reactions are uncommon, occurring in approximately two percent of patients [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Nevertheless, antivenom administration should only occur in facilities equipped to rapidly manage anaphylaxis and when <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>, antihistamine, and corticosteroid medications are immediately available and ready to administer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78744" href="/d/graphic/78744.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3834316654"><span class="h2">South American Phoneutria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>Phoneutria</em> or armed spiders are large spiders found predominantly in South America, especially urban areas of Brazil. The bites of these spiders typically cause mild envenomation consisting of pain at the site, redness, piloerection, and primary (localized) diaphoresis [<a href="#rid4">4,8</a>]. However, systemic reactions, consisting of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, visual disturbances and autonomic effects (ie, tachycardia, hypertension, generalized diaphoresis, salivation, and, especially in young boys, priapism) may occur in up to 10 percent of bites with a higher frequency of systemic findings in young children. Fatalities from pulmonary edema and shock can occur but are rare [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p>Pain control is the primary treatment for mild envenomation [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Polyvalent Fab fragment antivenom is available and indicated for patients with systemic envenomation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2021658463"><span class="h2">Yellow sac spiders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Yellow sac spiders (<em>Cheiracanthium spp.</em>)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95326" href="/d/graphic/95326.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>) are common indoor resident spiders in North America, but can occupy indoor and outdoor niches and are distributed worldwide. In human environments, they can be found in garden sheds, garages, house foundations, window sills, between folds of curtains, and baseboards [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. While reputed in prior literature to be a cause of skin necrosis, more recent case series have not identified skin necrosis in association with documented yellow sac spider bites. They can, however, cause painful bites similar to bee stings (unlike the painless bites of <em>Loxosceles</em> and <em>Latrodectus</em>) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This species is very aggressive and is known to bite suddenly while crawling over its victims. Because the bite is painful, it is often rapidly recognized with recovery of the spider. </p><p>A case series of 20 documented <em>Cheiracanthium</em> spider bites in the United States and Australia reported pain or discomfort in all cases [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Redness at the bite site was also common. Other local effects included swelling and pruritus. The median duration of pain was approximately two hours but pain lasted 2 days in one patient. Systemic effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, or headache) occurred in three patients. </p><p>Treatment consists of washing of the bite site, pain control with oral analgesics (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a>), and, when present, symptomatic treatment of pruritus with an antihistamine. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no commercially available laboratory tests for identifying the presence of spider venom. Thus, the diagnosis is made clinically. Each of the toxic spiders lives in specific parts of the world  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59049" href="/d/graphic/59049.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Clinicians should know which spiders are indigenous to their area:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Widows and false black widows are found worldwide. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88938.html" rel="external">"Widow spider bites: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Geographic distribution'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88938.html" rel="external">"Widow spider bites: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Geographic distribution'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recluse spiders are found predominantly in North and South America. Within the United States, they are limited to the mid-western and southern portions of the country  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56537" href="/d/graphic/56537.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6485.html" rel="external">"Bites of recluse spiders"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><em>Phoneutria</em> spiders are predominantly limited to South America with one minimally toxic species extending north to Costa Rica.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Australian funnel web spiders are limited to southeastern and coastal Australia.</p><p></p><p>A presumptive diagnosis of a spider bite is most often based upon the history and clinical presentation. However, the diagnosis of a spider bite can be considered definitive <strong>only</strong> if the criteria below are fulfilled [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A spider was observed inflicting the bite.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The spider was recovered, collected, and properly identified.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A skin lesion and/or systemic finding typically associated with the type of spider bite are present.</p><p></p><p>The setting in which the patient sustained the alleged bite should also be carefully reviewed to see if it is consistent with the known habitat and behavior of the toxic spiders that live in the area. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88938.html" rel="external">"Widow spider bites: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6485.html" rel="external">"Bites of recluse spiders", section on 'Habitat'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6485.html" rel="external">"Bites of recluse spiders", section on 'Clinical history'</a>.)</p><p>If the above criteria are not met, then other conditions such as vasculitis, infection, vascular problems, or other relevant disorders must be ruled out (see <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). Clinical clues that essentially <strong>exclude</strong> the diagnosis of spider bite include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple lesions or more than one lesion on widely-separated parts of the body suggest another etiology. Spider bites are typically single lesions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bites are generally not simultaneously sustained by multiple residents of the same household.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the diagnostic criteria for spider bites are rarely met, even in published medical reports [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. This has resulted in a body of literature and considerable media attention falsely attributing various lesions and symptoms to spider bites [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The extent of this problem was illustrated in a review of 600 cases of suspected spider bites, which found that 80 percent of presumed bites could be more reasonably attributed to other causes [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. These other causes included bites of different arthropods such as ants, fleas, bedbugs, ticks, mites, mosquitoes, and biting flies, as well as erysipelas, cellulitis, ecthyma, vasculitis, pyoderma, ophthalmic zoster, urticaria, angioedema, and burns. Similarly, in an observational study of 182 patients who came to an emergency department with a chief complaint of a spider bite, 84 percent were diagnosed with a skin or soft tissue infection; only seven patients were confirmed by a clinician to have a spider bite, and of these, only three had the spider identified, none by an arachnologist [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Most patient reports of spider bites are unreliable. The bite history is often speculative and retrospective and a spider was never visualized, either inflicting the bite or even present [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Even when a bite is witnessed by the patient, the "spider" is commonly found to be some other arthropod [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Spider bites capture the imagination. Reports exist of patients both feigning spider bites as part of drug seeking behavior [<a href="#rid15">15</a>] and attempting suicide with genuine spider bites [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Patients may also worry about the possibility that a toxic spider was transported into a non-indigenous area on fruit or other produce. However, it is rare for spiders to survive intact through the many steps involved in produce transportation, and then end up in a situation in which they would bite. The risk may be more significant for a person working in food transport and handling, but it is minimal in the general community. The most common event occurring after the discovery of a large spider in transported produce is misidentification of a harmless tropic spider as that of a potentially dangerous <em>Phoneutria</em> spider [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A spider bite usually presents as a local lesion (possibly with necrosis in the case of recluse bites) with or without systemic symptoms (see <a class="local">'Management overview'</a> below). The differential diagnoses for local and systemic symptoms are reviewed in this section. Disorders that can mimic the bites of specific spiders are discussed in the appropriate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6485.html" rel="external">"Bites of recluse spiders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88938.html" rel="external">"Widow spider bites: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>As discussed previously, many other conditions are more common than spider bites and pose a more immediate threat to the patient's health if not accurately diagnosed. A patient who did not clearly witness a spider inflicting the bite should be presumed to have some other disorder, and the presence of multiple lesions essentially excludes the diagnosis of spider bite. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The clinician can usually determine whether a spider bite is possible based upon a careful history of the patient's recent activities, details of the onset and evolution of the lesion, and knowledge of biting spiders found in the area. Despite this, it is not uncommon for patients to present with nondescript lesions, suggest that it might be a spider bite because of some circumstantial detail, and have that history accepted without further questioning.</p><p>A spider bite may present as a papule, pustule, wheal, plaque (possibly ecchymotic), or ulcer. The most common disorders that are mistaken for local reactions to spider bites include infections and the bites of other insects.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h2">Infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Papules and pustules should be carefully unroofed and cultured to identify infectious causes. Common infections that could be mistaken for spider bites include staphylococcus and streptococcal infections, the skin lesion of early Lyme disease, and atypical presentations of herpes zoster or herpes simplex.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Community-acquired methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (CA-MRSA) skin infections can begin with singular papules or pustules that may evolve to necrotic lesions [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. CA-MRSA is far more prevalent than spider bites. Infections occur both sporadically and as institutional epidemics in nursing homes, prisons, military barracks, and athletic facilities.

Spiders are less likely to do so than many others. With the exception of tick-borne illnesses and allergic reactions, the exact insect inflicting the bite is of little clinical importance and local care suffices.</p><p>Scorpion stings are more common than spider envenomations worldwide, and most stings have been reported in Africa, the Middle East, southern Asia, and Central and South America. In the United States, scorpion stings are most common in Arizona and nearby areas of the Southwest. Stings are instantaneously painful, and patients usually capture or at least clearly witness the offender [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. Local pain is the most common presenting symptom.

It has associations with several conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, pyogenic arthritis pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, myeloma, leukemia, lymphoma, and myelodysplasia, but it also occurs as an isolated phenomenon in about half of cases. The diagnosis is often difficult and is initially misdiagnosed in up to 40 percent of patients [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Skin biopsy findings are nonspecific but helpful in excluding other diseases such as neoplasms and infection. Patients with pyoderma gangrenosum should have a full vasculitis and coagulation workup, including methylhydrofolate reductase levels. A diagnostic algorithm exists to help rule in the diagnosis [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

In reality, the majority of spider bites result in unremarkable wheals, papules, or pustules. Local redness with a tender nodule at the site of the bite appears within minutes. The lesions are similar to those induced by a bee sting. In some cases, the markings of the fangs (one or two small puncture marks) are visible  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52977" href="/d/graphic/52977.html" rel="external">picture 15</a>) although this is not always a diagnostic feature. Some bites also itch or burn.</p><p>Spider bites may or may not be painful, and some go unnoticed. Discomfort can develop gradually over the ensuing hours after a bite, and can range from a slight prickly sensation to severe pain. The variability among bites and patients limits the clinical utility of pain in implicating a specific type of spider.</p><p>Most local reactions to spider bites resolve spontaneously in approximately 7 to 10 days.

In addition, airborne material from tarantulas can cause foreign body reactions in the eye [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Since physical removal of the 1 mm long hairs from the eye is not feasible, we provide solely supportive management while the hairs are degraded and absorbed, which may take six to nine months.
