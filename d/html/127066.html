These diseases share the clinical manifestation of progressive muscle weakness and the histopathologic finding of inflammatory infiltrates of varying degrees in muscle tissue. Variations in extramuscular clinical manifestations, specific findings on muscle biopsy, and disease-specific serologic abnormalities help to distinguish one of these entities from another.</p><p>Although much is known about the pathologic processes present in this group of diseases, the precise cause of the IIMs remains unknown. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14918.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathies"</a>.)</p><p>The nomenclature and classification criteria of the IIMs will be addressed in this topic, as well as a general approach to the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of the IIMs. A more complete and detailed description of clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and treatment options in the various IIMs are discussed in separate topics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5160.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5133.html" rel="external">"Treatment of recurrent and resistant dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5163.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of inclusion body myositis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5164.html" rel="external">"Management of inclusion body myositis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1207838070"><span class="h1">NOMENCLATURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some authors use "immune-mediated myopathy" (IMM) instead of "idiopathic inflammatory myopathy" (IIM) to describe this group of diseases because in some cases, such as statin-induced necrotizing myopathy, there is little if any inflammatory cell infiltrate [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Polymyositis (PM) is thought to be quite rare. In the last decade, the concept of pure PM has been absorbed by separate defined entities, including immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), inclusion body myositis (IBM) that is early in diagnosis or misdiagnosed, or myositis secondary to a connective tissue disease overlap syndrome. Additionally, antisynthetase syndrome may present with a myopathy without a rash; some experts would classify this as PM whereas others prefer to recognize the antisynthetase syndrome as a separate entity.</p><p>Overlap syndrome refers to the coexistence of inflammatory myopathy with another systemic rheumatic disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), and, less often, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Sjögren's disease.</p><p>Antisynthetase syndrome is defined by the presence of inflammatory myopathy and/or extramuscular manifestations affecting skin, lung, or joints together with an antibody directed against an aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase. Myositis may not always be present when interstitial lung disease and/or arthritis are prominent feature(s).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3139357904"><span class="h1">MAJOR DISEASE SUBTYPES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Brief descriptions of the various disorders classified as idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) will be presented here. More detailed information can be found in the specific disease topics.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3169739628"><span class="h2">Dermatomyositis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with classic dermatomyositis (DM) typically present with symmetric muscle weakness, elevated muscle enzymes, and characteristic cutaneous findings. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) may be present, including in patients with a DM-specific autoantibody, such as anti-Mi-2, anti-NXP2, anti-transcriptional intermediary factor 1gamma (anti-TIF 1gamma), or anti-small ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme (anti-SAE). By contrast, another DM-specific antibody, anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (anti-MDA5), is cytoplasmic in origin. Myositis-specific antibodies are detected in 45 to 85 percent of adult patients with IIM depending on the test and laboratory utilized [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]<em>.</em> Many experts use the presence of a myositis-specific antibody to determine what particular myositis phenotype a patient may have, and thereby to help with prognostication, rather than to make the diagnosis of DM. As an example, the presence of anti-TIF-1gamma is associated with an increased risk of cancer in these patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5162.html" rel="external">"Malignancy in dermatomyositis and polymyositis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2216699871"><span class="h2">Clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with clinically amyopathic DM (CADM) are those patients with cutaneous findings who lack clinical evidence of muscle involvement (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13771.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous dermatomyositis in adults: Overview and initial management"</a>). Patients are considered to have provisional CADM at six months and confirmed CADM at two years. Despite lacking clinically significant muscle disease, concomitant pulmonary disease or malignancy may still occur, thus mandating appropriate workup. A subset of these patients, those with "hypomyopathic dermatomyositis," will have minimal elevations of muscle enzymes or subtle abnormalities on muscle studies in the absence of any objective or subjective weakness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15653.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Similar to patients with classic DM, some CADM patients will have myositis-specific antibodies. As described above, these are typically used by experts more for prognostication than for diagnosis. As an example, the presence of anti-MDA5 is associated with an increased likelihood of amyopathic disease as well as an increased risk of interstitial lung disease. (See <a class="local">'Myositis-specific autoantibodies'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3565898310"><span class="h2">Polymyositis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients presenting with weakness and elevated muscle enzymes in the absence of characteristic cutaneous findings of DM present a more difficult diagnostic challenge as there are no specific cutaneous findings of other IIMs and diagnostic serologic tests are less likely to be present. Most importantly, these patients need to be distinguished from other causes of myopathy without rash including hypothyroid myopathy, the various forms of muscular dystrophy, and metabolic myopathies. All patients presenting with evidence of myopathy without rash should be screened for hypothyroidism with appropriate thyroid function testing. Additionally, patients with immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM) present with muscle disease without rash and may be difficult to distinguish from primary polymyositis (PM), and care must be taken to avoid misclassification as PM cases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4056013949"><span class="h2">Overlap syndromes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inflammatory myopathy may occur in the setting of another systemic rheumatic disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), and, less often, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Sjögren's disease. The muscle involvement is often subclinical or mild. Mild elevations of creatine kinase may occur and be the only indication of muscle involvement. Certain autoantibodies have been associated with overlap syndromes. As an example, MCTD is defined by the presence of the anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibody and the presence of overlapping clinical features of inflammatory myopathy, SLE, and/or SSc (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7546.html" rel="external">"Mixed connective tissue disease"</a>). Patients with the anti-PM-Scl antibody manifest various degrees of myositis along with telangiectasias, Raynaud phenomenon, "mechanic's hands," inflammatory arthritis, and SSc. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7550.html" rel="external">"Neuromuscular manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)", section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H830958524"><span class="h2">Antisynthetase syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antisynthetase syndrome group is defined by the presence of an antibody directed against one of several aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases. Clinical findings include inflammatory myopathy and extramuscular findings including interstitial lung disease, "mechanic's hands"  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56057" href="/z/d/graphic/56057.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), inflammatory arthritis, and Raynaud phenomenon. Onset is often more acute than in primary DM. There does not appear to be an increased risk of malignancy in this group.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3646371462"><span class="h2">Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinically, this group resembles primary PM, but the extent of muscle necrosis and relative paucity of inflammatory infiltrate seen on muscle biopsy distinguish it from PM. One subgroup with this myopathy has associated anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (anti-HMGCR) autoantibodies with or without a history of statin use. Another subgroup has associated autoantibodies to the signal recognition particle (SRP).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H531079545"><span class="h2">Inclusion body myositis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although classified with the IIMs, IBM has epidemiologic, clinical, and histopathologic findings that distinguish it from the other IIMs. IBM affects older individuals, more commonly men. It generally has a more insidious onset and slower progression than the other inflammatory myopathies. The distribution of weakness tends to be more distal in the upper extremities and less symmetric. Autoantibodies against cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A (NT5C1A) are present in the sera in approximately half of patients [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Muscle biopsy shows prominent endomysial inflammatory infiltrate and muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles and inclusions. However, rimmed vacuoles and inclusions are not evident in 20 to 30 percent of any given muscle biopsy, suggesting the need for repeated biopsy in selected patients [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Pathogenesis is not understood but is likely distinct from the other IIMs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5163.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of inclusion body myositis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14918.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathies"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629679280"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common presentation of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) is gradual onset of symmetric proximal muscle weakness associated with enzyme elevations indicative of muscle injury due to inflammation, namely an elevation of creatine kinase and other muscle enzymes (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5155.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with muscle weakness"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5161.html" rel="external">"Muscle enzymes in the evaluation of neuromuscular diseases"</a>). However, the clinician needs to recognize the possibility of an IIM even in patients without evidence of muscle weakness and also needs to recognize the clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic findings that distinguish the different diseases classified as IIM. Furthermore, not all patients with myopathy will have elevated creatine kinase or other muscle enzyme levels, thus requiring other muscle studies to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4110681226"><span class="h2">Clinical presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recognize three distinct clinical presentations of IIM:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients presenting with evidence of muscle weakness only. Patients usually report a history of the insidious or subacute development of the muscle weakness, with gradual worsening over a period of several months before medical attention is sought, which helps to distinguish IIM from the many causes of rhabdomyolysis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16414.html" rel="external">"Rhabdomyolysis: Epidemiology and etiology"</a>), which is usually very sudden in onset. Patients may describe increasing difficulty climbing stairs, getting up from a chair, carrying heavy groceries, or picking up their children due to the proximal muscle involvement. Primary polymyositis (PM), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM) would fall into this category.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients presenting with evidence of extramuscular disease only. Pathognomonic or characteristic cutaneous eruptions, pulmonary disease, inflammatory arthritis, and Raynaud phenomenon may be the presenting features of an IIM. Dermatologic manifestations are highly variable and include Gottron papule and Gottron sign, pink to violaceous erythema of the eyelids (referred to as the heliotrope eruption), midfacial erythema involving the nasolabial folds, periungual erythema and nailfold capillary abnormalities, poikiloderma of sun-exposed areas including the "shawl" and "V-neck" signs, scalp erythema and psoriasiform scaling, "holster" sign, and calcinosis cutis, among many others. Hyperkeratotic, fissured skin on the palmar and lateral aspects of the fingers, termed "mechanic's hands," is characteristic of antisynthetase syndrome (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13771.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous dermatomyositis in adults: Overview and initial management"</a>). Pulmonary disease includes various forms of interstitial lung disease. When present, inflammatory arthritis resembles rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients may have a constellation of extramuscular manifestations such as skin rash in combination with interstitial lung disease. Patients with cutaneous dermatomyositis (DM) in the absence of muscle involvement are referred to as having CADM.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients presenting with both muscle disease and extramuscular manifestations. This presentation would include patients with classic DM, who have both typical DM skin disease and muscle weakness, patients with antisynthetase syndrome, and patients with overlap conditions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3266870050"><span class="h2">Laboratory findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laboratory abnormalities in IIM include nonspecific abnormalities indicative of muscle inflammation or systemic illness or specific serologic abnormalities characteristic of specific IIM subgroups.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1393928584"><span class="h3">Muscle enzymes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with IIM will have an elevation of one or more of the muscle-derived enzymes, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aldolase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Creatine kinase is the most sensitive muscle enzyme and is the one most commonly tested for and followed. Creatine kinase levels vary widely but are often increased more than 10-fold above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in untreated disease. However, creatine kinase levels can be normal in 20 percent of patients with DM, even in those patients with weakness and active muscle inflammation on studies, and are often normal or only slightly elevated in IBM (ie, less than 10 times the ULN) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Creatine kinase levels can be used to follow the response to treatment and to detect disease relapse in most patients, but the levels do not correlate with disease severity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5161.html" rel="external">"Muscle enzymes in the evaluation of neuromuscular diseases"</a>.)</p><p>While creatine kinase levels in the inflammatory myopathies may be extremely high, even in the range seen in acute rhabdomyolysis, the complication of acute rhabdomyolysis with its risk of acute renal injury is rarely seen with the IIM diseases.</p><p>It should be noted that not all elevations of AST and ALT are evidence of liver disease, especially when AST is higher than ALT. Patients with an unexplained elevation of transaminases should have a creatine kinase level checked to evaluate for evidence of myopathy in order to avoid an unnecessary liver biopsy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H510341007"><span class="h3">Myositis-specific autoantibodies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Myositis-specific autoantibodies are associated with particular clinical syndromes within the IIM spectrum. The evaluation of patients suspected of having an IIM is facilitated by serologic test panels available from reference laboratories. This eliminates the need to order the numerous tests individually. However, the results are often not available for several weeks, while treatment decisions may need to be made before the specific serologic profile is known. Furthermore, given that these tests are only positive in 20 to 40 percent of patients (depending on the specific disease), a negative myositis panel does not rule out a diagnosis of myositis. In fact, many experts use the myositis panel to determine what particular myositis phenotype may best fit the patient rather than to make a diagnosis of myositis. Notably, many commercially available myositis panels have varying degrees of accuracy. Hence, using careful clinical judgment based on the patient's examination and studies is crucial.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antisynthetase antibodies</strong> – This family of antibodies is directed against aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases. For example, the anti-Jo-1 antibody is directed against histidyl-tRNA synthetase. Anti-Jo-1 is the most common antisynthetase antibody and the most common myositis-specific autoantibody, occurring in approximately 20 percent of IIM patients. These antibodies are strongly associated with interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, arthritis, and mechanic's hands  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56057" href="/z/d/graphic/56057.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Anti-Jo-1 and other antisynthetase antibodies, such as anti-PL-12, have been observed in some patients with interstitial lung disease who lack evidence of myositis [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Other antisynthetase antibodies include antibodies to the OJ, EJ, PL-7, PL-12, KS, Zo, and Ha antigens [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. In the aggregate, these other antisynthetases are found in 1 to 5 percent of IIM patients. Patients with these may have clinical manifestations similar to those with anti-Jo-1-antibodies, but differences have sometimes been noted, particularly in the frequency of myositis [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Individual patients with antisynthetase syndrome usually have an antibody to only one unique synthetase.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anti-SRP antibody</strong> – The signal recognition particle (SRP) is involved in the translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. Anti-SRP antibodies have been found in approximately 5 percent of patients with IIM [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Muscle biopsies in these patients show a necrotizing myopathy with minimal inflammation, and extramuscular manifestations are infrequent.

Characteristic abnormalities on EMG (eg, presence of fibrillation potentials) can support a diagnosis of IIM but are not diagnostic of it, as similar findings occur in various infectious, toxic, or metabolic myopathies. EMG can be used to identify the muscle group that is likely to provide useful information on biopsy, but muscle biopsy should not be performed on a muscle that has recently undergone EMG testing.

For example, the pathologic changes in muscle in DM tend to be vascular, located in the perifascicular region of the muscle, while in PM, the cellular infiltrate is predominantly within the fascicle, with inflammatory cells invading individual muscle fibers. The presence of prominent necrosis together with a paucity of inflammatory cells is typical of IMNM, while the presence of rimmed vacuoles and Congo red or p62+ inclusions or tubulofilament-filled inclusions on electron microscopy are characteristic of IBM.</p><p>Although clinical and serologic findings may be diagnostic in some patients, others may present with ambiguous cutaneous findings or cutaneous findings that are suggestive of DM in the absence of clinical signs of muscle disease.

Although their imperfect sensitivity and specificity limit their use for diagnostic purposes in individual patients, these criteria are helpful to clinicians in identifying key features of the diseases. Several sets of classification criteria have been developed for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) for the primary purpose of defining these disorders for clinical and epidemiologic research.</p><p>In 2017, the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) developed and validated revised classification criteria for adult and juvenile IIMs and their major subgroups [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>]. These criteria address some of the shortcomings of previously used classification systems by capturing a broader spectrum of patients and subgroups with IIM, and by including more well-defined clinical and laboratory criteria [<a href="#rid52">52-57</a>]. The criteria were derived from data on 976 IIM patients (74 percent adults; 26 percent children) and 624 non-IIM patients with mimicking conditions (82 percent adults; 18 percent children).</p><p class="bulletIndent1">The EULAR/ACR criteria classify patients as having "definite," "probable," and "possible" disease based on a score and corresponding probability of disease.

In addition, adult patients with pathognomonic skin eruptions (heliotrope eruption and/or Gottron papules and/or Gottron sign) are classified with DM without including muscle biopsy data. A muscle biopsy, however, is recommended for patients without the cutaneous manifestations. In these guidelines, a skin biopsy is recommended for DM patients without muscle involvement.</p><p>Prior to this, the most widely used classification criteria developed by Bohan and Peter in 1975 defined DM and PM based upon the following features [<a href="#rid53">53,54</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symmetric proximal muscle weakness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Typical cutaneous eruption of DM (the only feature distinguishing DM from PM)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated serum muscle enzymes</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myopathic changes on electromyography (EMG)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Characteristic muscle biopsy abnormalities and the absence of histopathologic signs of other myopathies</p><p></p><p>Patients with the cutaneous eruption and at least three of the other four criteria met the requirements for definite DM according to these criteria, while requirements for definite PM were met by those with all four criteria other than the cutaneous features [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].
