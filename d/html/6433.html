The term refers to either an abnormal preferred position of the neck or a normal position associated with restricted range of motion. A broad range of conditions from benign to life-threatening may present with neck stiffness as a primary complaint or accompanying other concerns.</p><p>Torticollis and meningismus describe specific types of neck stiffness:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Torticollis</strong> – Torticollis (from the Latin for twisted neck, also referred to as wry neck) is a subset of neck stiffness. In torticollis, the child holds his or her head tilted to one side with the chin rotated in the opposite direction. Neck stiffness and torticollis may present with or without accompanying neck pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Meningismus</strong> – Meningismus is another important subset of neck stiffness that defines neck stiffness in association with meningeal irritation. With meningismus, the child typically has fever, restriction of neck movement (of neck flexion in particular), and pain. Conditions presenting with meningismus require emergency evaluation and management. Causes include meningitis and infection of adjacent structures such as spinal epidural abscesses. Deep space neck infections can occasionally present with meningismus but are more commonly associated with restriction of extension. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6078.html" rel="external">"Retropharyngeal infections in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6078.html" rel="external">"Retropharyngeal infections in children", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neck stiffness is best considered as traumatic or non-traumatic, recognizing that in children, trauma may be unwitnessed, or unreported in the setting of child abuse  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67226" href="/z/d/graphic/67226.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In a single center series of 170 children evaluated for neck complaints in an emergency department, neck stiffness was most commonly caused by trauma (62 percent) and localized infection (20 percent) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In any child with neck stiffness, the presence of neurologic signs or symptom warrants emergency evaluation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Life-threatening conditions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Traumatic</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810359"><span class="h4">Cervical spine injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical spine fractures and subluxations are rare in children under the age of eight years. When present, they typically involve the upper cervical spine, and occur in the setting of high kinetic energy mechanisms such as motor vehicle collisions and falls. Similar to adults, older children and adolescents are vulnerable to lower cervical spine trauma caused by motor vehicle collisions and sports injuries. Caution should always be exercised in patients with high-energy mechanisms and/or axial load injuries. Signs of cervical spine injury can include neck pain, tenderness, and stiffness, but these may be absent or subtle in patients with altered mental status. While some children with fractures of the cervical spine are unresponsive at the time of evaluation, many are awake, alert and verbal, complaining of neck pain, and have no demonstrable neurologic deficit. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6561.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6531.html" rel="external">"Overview of musculoskeletal neck injuries in the child or adolescent athlete"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810371"><span class="h4">SCIWORA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) occurs in children due to the ligamentous laxity and hypermobility of the pediatric cervical spine. Various mechanisms, including longitudinal distraction, hyperflexion, hyperextension, and ischemia to the spinal cord, may result in SCIWORA syndrome. Younger children (&lt;8 years) are likely to have lesions higher in the cervical spine due to age-related changes in the location of the fulcrum for maximal flexion. Children with SCIWORA may develop significant or progressive paralysis within 48 hours of a traumatic injury; a latency of up to four days has been reported. Some children, however, may have transient neurologic symptoms that remit and then recur, often within the next day, with worsening neurologic abnormalities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15603.html" rel="external">"Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) in children", section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p>It should be noted that the term radiographic abnormality has historically been used with reference to plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT), but not magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many patients with neurologic findings in the setting of trauma will have radiographic abnormalities of the spinal cord or surrounding soft tissue structures on MRI. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810386"><span class="h4">Subluxation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Traumatic subluxation of the cervical spine is more common than fracture and typically occurs in the setting of severe trauma. Spinal subluxation may present with or without accompanying neurologic deficit.</p><p>Rotary (or "rotatory") atlantoaxial subluxation is the most common subluxation of the cervical spine in the pediatric age group. It generally does not compromise the spinal canal because the transverse ligament of the atlas remains intact. Rotary subluxation typically causes neck pain and torticollis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6462.html" rel="external">"Acquired torticollis in children", section on 'Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation'</a>.)</p><p>Atlantoaxial subluxation with compromise of the spinal canal results from ligamentous laxity or rupture and resultant anterior movement of the atlas on the axis. Children with Down syndrome, Morquio syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and connective tissue disorders are susceptible to atlantoaxial subluxation with minor trauma. In contrast to congenital or acquired muscular torticollis, the head tilts away from the involved sternocleidomastoid muscle and the chin towards the muscle in patients with atlantoaxial subluxation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6531.html" rel="external">"Overview of musculoskeletal neck injuries in the child or adolescent athlete", section on 'Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6462.html" rel="external">"Acquired torticollis in children", section on 'Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810395"><span class="h4">Spinal epidural hematoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Epidural hematoma of the cervical spine is rare but may occur even after apparently minor trauma, or in the absence of trauma. It should be considered in patients with the abrupt onset of unexplained neck pain. The hematoma may compress the spinal cord, leading to progressive neurologic signs and symptoms. Emergency neurosurgical consultation and surgical decompression are indicated.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810404"><span class="h4">Subarachnoid hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is accompanied by headache or other physical findings of head trauma. Note that subarachnoid hemorrhage can also occur in the absence of trauma, usually associated in these cases with aneurysm and hemorrhage. It may be associated with exertion. Classically, it presents as the sudden onset of severe headache. Neck stiffness usually occurs after a few hours. More rarely, it presents with seizures, changes in mental status, cranial nerve six palsy due to increased intracranial pressure, other focal neurologic findings, ocular hemorrhage, nausea, or vomiting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6566.html" rel="external">"Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children: Initial evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Nontraumatic</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810522"><span class="h4">Meningitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bacterial meningitis is the most important infectious cause of neck stiffness and is almost always accompanied by fever. Older children with meningitis commonly have findings of neck stiffness on physical examination. This finding may be nonspecific or absent in young infants and in children who lack an inflammatory response. Etiologies vary by age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5968.html" rel="external">"Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Viral or Lyme meningitis also may cause neck pain and stiffness accompanied by cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis with a negative culture. Fever is commonly but not always presents in these cases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5983.html" rel="external">"Viral meningitis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Common features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6038.html" rel="external">"Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children", section on 'Meningitis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810536"><span class="h4">Peritonsillar and neck space abscesses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Stiff neck with fever can be caused by infection or abscess in the peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, submandibular, and submental spaces, as well as the anterior or posterior triangles. The prevalence of each type of infection varies by age. A rare but serious neck infection is Lemierre syndrome, a suppurative thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein; these patients are febrile and ill appearing with clinical and laboratory features of serious infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6079.html" rel="external">"Peritonsillar cellulitis and abscess"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6078.html" rel="external">"Retropharyngeal infections in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129255.html" rel="external">"Lemierre syndrome: Septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein"</a>.)</p><p>Limitation of neck extension, with use of eye movement for upward gaze, is particularly suggestive of retropharyngeal abscess. Other clinical features may include sore throat, cervical lymphadenopathy, rhinorrhea, and non-specific findings such as irritability, lethargy, and poor oral intake. Trismus is a hallmark of peritonsillar or less commonly retropharyngeal abscess. It may sometimes be clinically difficult to differentiate a deep neck space infection from meningitis without a lumbar puncture, especially in a toxic-appearing younger patient. Imaging may be indicated prior to lumbar puncture when the clinical picture is more suggestive of a neck infection. In these cases, the clinical presentation and severity of illness should be considering regarding the need to initiate antibiotics prior to definitive diagnosis. Procedural sedation, which is often required for adequate radiographic examination, should be undertaken with caution given the potential for airway compromise.</p><p>Factors that impact the choice of imaging are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6078.html" rel="external">"Retropharyngeal infections in children", section on 'Imaging'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3415.html" rel="external">"Deep neck space infections in adults", section on 'Clinical suspicion and urgent imaging'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810551"><span class="h4">Epidural abscess</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although uncommon, a cervical spine epidural abscess is important to consider in patients with fever, pain, and a stiff neck. Cervical spine abscesses are associated with severe neurologic deficits and mortality. Risk factors including but not limited to immunodeficiency, recent trauma, and intravenous drug use should be elicited to help raise the index of suspicion for this infrequent diagnosis, as prompt recognition and surgical drainage are essential to optimize outcomes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1292.html" rel="external">"Spinal epidural abscess"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810584"><span class="h4">Central nervous system lesions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Regardless of histological and metastatic features, these lesions are potentially life-threatening because of the potential for intracranial pressure elevation and the associated brain and spinal cord compression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6077.html" rel="external">"Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Physiology'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Brain tumors</strong> – Brain tumors located in the posterior fossa may present with head tilt, neck stiffness, or torticollis. Associated symptoms may include vomiting, headache, ataxia, vision disturbances, papilledema, or cranial nerve deficits. Head tilt may result from attempts to compensate for diplopia. However, neck stiffness is believed to result from irritation of the accessory nerve by the cerebellar tonsils trapped in the occipital foramen or by tonsillar herniation. Thus, any patient with torticollis should have a thorough neurologic examination, and a posterior fossa tumor should be considered in a patient with headache, vomiting, focal neurological deficits, or torticollis that does not resolve over several days with conservative measures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6250.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spinal cord tumors</strong> – Torticollis may be seen rarely in patients with tumors of the spinal cord. Spinal cord tumors are infrequent and typically cause pain at the site of the tumor along with neurologic defects (sensory and motor defects, impaired bowel and bladder function). Symptoms may be very slow to develop, often leading to delay in diagnosis. Patients may also hold their heads in a forward flexed position ("hanging head") sign. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6250.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other head and neck space-occupying lesions</strong> – Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an uncommon tumor in children, but it may present with epistaxis, neck pain, and cervical adenopathy. Other tumors of the head and neck that may present with neck stiffness include orbital tumors, vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas), osteoblastomas, Ewing sarcomas, and tumors metastatic to the spine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other space-occupying lesions of the spinal cord</strong> – Other uncommon space-occupying lesions of the cervical spine such as neurenteric cysts, arteriovenous malformations, spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas, and syringomyelia may also cause neck pain and stiffness; neurologic findings are commonly present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vascular</strong> <strong>anomalies</strong> – Congenital berry aneurysms and acquired cerebral aneurysms associated with sickle cell disease may rupture spontaneously and result in life-threatening SAH. As for traumatic SAH, classic features are the abrupt onset of severe headache, nausea and vomiting, and sometimes photophobia. Fever can also be present. The abruptness of onset of these symptoms distinguishes this presentation from meningitis, although the distinction may be difficult. Occasionally, milder symptoms thought to represent leaking from an aneurysm whose rupture is imminent are the earliest presenting features. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1130.html" rel="external">"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Arnold-Chiari malformation </strong>– This malformation may also cause neck pain and/or stiffness, and frequently occurs in patients with myelomeningocele; stridor is a classic clinical feature. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13507.html" rel="external">"Chiari malformations", section on 'Chiari II clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Common conditions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Traumatic</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810652"><span class="h4">Clavicle fracture</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fracture of the clavicle in children is common and may cause neck stiffness because of decreased movement secondary to pain, or due to sternocleidomastoid muscle spasm. The diagnosis of clavicle fracture is usually clear because pain and tenderness are noted over the fracture site. A history of trauma is usually elicited, but it may be absent in the case of unwitnessed minor trauma. The acute symptoms associated with clavicle fracture may on occasion mask an associated cervical spine injury or atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation. Thus, careful examination of the spine is warranted in patients presenting with clavicle fracture, especially if a high-energy mechanism is present. Medial clavicle fractures are also associated with neurovascular and lung injuries and careful evaluation, often with dedicated additional imaging, is necessary to exclude them. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/231.html" rel="external">"Clavicle fractures", section on 'Clinical presentation and examination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810661"><span class="h4">Muscular injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blunt trauma to the neck may result in neck pain as a result of muscular contusion or spasm. This is a diagnosis of exclusion, however, and should not be entertained until a detailed physical including neurologic examination and radiographs of the cervical spine exclude the possibility of a more serious injury. The possibility of associated vascular injury must also be considered. Similarly, acceleration/deceleration injuries may result in muscle strain causing neck stiffness, but bony and ligamentous injuries must be excluded before making this diagnosis. It is not always possible to differentiate among these entities at the time of an acute injury based upon plain radiographs alone. Further imaging and care should be guided by the specific mechanism and physical findings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6531.html" rel="external">"Overview of musculoskeletal neck injuries in the child or adolescent athlete", section on 'Muscular injuries'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6561.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Nontraumatic</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17810699"><span class="h4">Lymphadenitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical lymphadenitis, either acute or chronic, is a common cause of neck stiffness. The child with this condition typically has tender swelling over the lateral aspect of the neck, with or without fever. Most cases of cervical lymphadenitis are due to Staphylococcus aureus or Group A streptococcus. Other bacteria (eg, Bartonella henselae, the cause of cat-scratch disease) and mycobacteria are less common causes. Occasionally, severe reactive but not primarily infected cervical lymphadenopathy, as with infectious mononucleosis or other pharyngeal infections, may cause mild neck stiffness. The generalized lymphadenopathy associated with Kawasaki’s disease may also present with neck stiffness; in these cases, other stigmata of Kawasaki’s should be present.

It is characterized by mild neck stiffness, usually associated with a twisting of the head toward the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the chin away from the muscle, with or without pain, in a well-appearing child. It may result from minor irritation or an awkward sleeping position. No fever, trauma, or intercurrent illness is present. Torticollis that does not resolve with conservative measures should be re-evaluated for other causes of neck stiffness.

Systemic viral processes may present with myalgias, and myositis can cause neck pain and stiffness, but these are typically accompanied by muscular symptoms beyond the neck alone. Similarly, Lyme disease may present with cervical myalgias even in the absence of Lyme meningitis; other stigmata of Lyme disease are typically present.

It is usually bacterial, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus, but it may be caused by mycobacteria as well. The average age of presentation is approximately eight years [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. It may present insidiously, and it should be considered in patients with fever of unknown origin and neck symptoms.

This disease is thought to be caused by infection with Staphylococcus aureus, although bacterial cultures from the blood, and even from the disc, are commonly negative. The cause has been debated. Most children with infectious discitis are younger than three years of age. Disease is usually in the lumbar or thoracic vertebrae rather than in the cervical spine. However, it can occur at any vertebral level and present with percussion tenderness over the involved cervical spine and neurologic findings such as weakness and decreased reflexes. Fever may be present as well, though less commonly than in osteomyelitis. MRI confirms the diagnosis.

The etiology of this condition is unclear but is believed to be related to birth trauma that causes an injury to the SCM muscle with hematoma formation, followed by fibrous contracture of the muscle. Many patients will have a history of breech presentation. On examination, a palpable mass can often be detected in the inferior aspect of the SCM. The mass is generally not present at birth but appears in the neonatal period. The head is held in the characteristic position, with the patient's chin pointing away from the affected, contracted SCM muscle. Radiographs of the cervical spine are necessary to exclude other congenital causes of torticollis.

Cysts of third or fourth branchial origin present as recurrent abscesses in the lateral neck that cause redness, swelling, and neck pain with stiffness similar to cervical lymphadenitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6302.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies of the jaw, mouth, oral cavity, and pharynx", section on 'Third and fourth branchial arch'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thyroglossal duct cyst abscess</strong> – Thyroglossal duct cysts are usually within two cm of the midline but can be somewhat more lateral. Cysts with associated abscesses cause midline or lateral neck redness, swelling, and pain with stiffness. The typical cyst maintains a close relationship to the hyoid, thyrohyoid membrane, or thyroid cartilage. Classically, thyroglossal duct cysts move up with swallowing or protrusion of the tongue, emphasizing their close relationship with the hyoid/larynx complex.

In addition to Down and Klippel-Feil syndromes, these include other skeletal dysplasias and os odontoideum (aplasia or hypoplasia of the odontoid). Children with these conditions should be screened for atlantoaxial instability. Morquio syndrome is a mucopolysaccharidosis resulting in flattening of the vertebrae and multiple skeletal dysplasias. The odontoid process of the axis is underdeveloped and may lead to atlantoaxial subluxation.

Genetic analysis indicates heterogeneous inheritance, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and sporadic occurrence. It is often associated with other bony abnormalities, and significant scoliosis develops in more than 50 percent of affected children. Limitation in range of motion of the neck is the most common physical sign. In addition to limited neck motion, the classic triad, seen in less than half of patients, also includes a low hairline and a short neck. Deafness, genitourinary abnormalities, and cardiovascular abnormalities are also associated findings in these patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sprengel deformity</strong> – Sprengel deformity is characterized by congenital failure of the scapula to descend to its correct position. The scapula rests in a high position in relation to the neck and thorax. In its most severe form, the scapula may be connected to the cervical spine by a congenitally anomalous ossification, the omovertebral bone, and limit neck movement. Patients with Sprengel deformity should undergo evaluation for associated bony and spinal cord abnormalities (eg, absent ribs, fused ribs, congenital scoliosis, Klippel-Feil syndrome, diastematomyelia).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemiatlas</strong> – Hemiatlas is a malformation of the first cervical vertebra, which may cause severe, progressive torticollis.

The child attempts to correct for the disturbance through changes in neck position. Careful ophthalmologic and neurologic examinations of the child with head tilt are necessary to exclude these possibilities. Torticollis has also been reported in patients with migraine headaches.

The cause of the condition and its acute symptoms are unknown. It is generally believed that acute symptoms are secondary to some inciting event (eg, mild trauma, viral infection) that results in an inflammatory response, possibly because of the release of calcium crystals.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Children typically present with 24 to 48 hours of neck pain associated with neck stiffness or torticollis; fever is often present as well. The disease is generally benign and self-limited, although disc protrusion and cord compression may uncommonly occur. Distinguishing features of infectious discitis as opposed to IDC include the lack of disc calcification and the single disc involvement of acute infectious discitis. Infectious discitis is most common in the lumbar spine, whereas IDC in children most commonly involves the cervical spine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rheumatologic causes</strong> – Collagen vascular disease in children may involve the cervical spine and lead to neck stiffness and/or pain. Although isolated cervical disease is unusual, neck stiffness or torticollis may be the presenting sign of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Cervical involvement in ankylosing spondylitis is a late finding, as it is in other spondyloarthropathies. Girls with psoriatic arthritis, however, may have cervical involvement preceding sacroiliac and lumbar involvement.

They may be necessary in other unclear presentations, and the possibility of occult trauma should always be considered. Plain films do not always detect rotary atlantoaxial subluxation or atlantoaxial subluxation. It is typically impractical to obtain odontoid views in children under five years. If a fracture is found or suspected, CT scanning can better define an injury. MRI is useful to evaluate for suspected spinal cord or ligamentous injury, and in cases of suspected cervical spine epidural hematoma or vertebral osteomyelitis.

The use of CT for the diagnosis of retropharyngeal infections in children is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6078.html" rel="external">"Retropharyngeal infections in children", section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Spine CT with IV contrast can also be useful to diagnose an epidural abscess of the spinal cord.

However, MRI is required to adequately image the posterior fossa. The sensitivity of modern head CT for detecting SAH is highest in the first six hours after SAH and then progressively declines over time. Other diagnostic testing may be indicated beyond this six-hour window. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1130.html" rel="external">"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Head CT scan'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Radiographic findings of atlantoaxial subluxation may include a widened predental space and prevertebral soft tissue swelling. In Grisel syndrome (nontraumatic atlantoaxial subluxation), routine radiographs of the neck may or may not reveal asymmetry between the facet joints and increased space between the dens of the axis and the anterior arch of the atlas. Dynamic or high-resolution CT scan with three-dimensional reconstruction is the best way to visualize the subluxation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6462.html" rel="external">"Acquired torticollis in children", section on 'Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6531.html" rel="external">"Overview of musculoskeletal neck injuries in the child or adolescent athlete", section on 'Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging</strong> – An emergency MRI of the spine should be obtained for any child with signs and symptoms suggestive of a spinal cord tumor, hemorrhage, ischemia, or compression.

It is less sensitive and specific than MRI for diagnosing these diseases. Multiple nuclear medicine imaging procedures are available to evaluate for osteomyelitis. The three-phase bone scan, utilizing technetium 99m (99mTc), usually is performed initially. Scans using inflammation imaging tracers, such as gallium or indium, can be helpful when results of the initial 99mTc study are equivocal, but involve additional exposure to radiation. MRI is therefore generally preferred when further imaging is required.

Other important causes of fever and meningismus include upper lobe pneumonia, retropharyngeal abscess, septic thrombophlebitis, cervical spine osteomyelitis, cervical discitis, and CNS lupus. Pyelonephritis rarely causes meningismus and evaluation for an infection of the urinary tract as a cause of neck stiffness is usually performed only in febrile, young children in whom no other etiology is identified.
