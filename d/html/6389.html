Less common causes include gastrointestinal bleeding, postoperative bleeding, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Sickle cell anemia complicated by sequestration crisis can result in physiologic complications similar to hemorrhagic shock. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypovolemic shock develops when intravascular volume is insufficient to maintain tissue perfusion. Fluid losses may be strictly intravascular (eg, hemorrhage, third-space losses from intraabdominal processes [eg, pancreatitis, intussusception, appendicitis] or capillary leak), a combination of intravascular and extravascular (eg, burn injury), or primarily extravascular (eg, diarrheal disease). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6142.html" rel="external">"Clinical assessment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children", section on 'Type of fluid lost'</a>.)</p><p>Initial compensation for volume depletion includes stimulation of thirst and fluid conservation by the kidneys. The following mechanisms come into play once perfusion becomes compromised [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tachycardia increases cardiac output. However, shortened ventricular filling time can result in decreased stroke volume and worsening cardiac output.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), mediated by the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems, results in redistribution of blood flow from peripheral structures (including skin, muscle, kidneys, and splanchnic organs) to the heart and central nervous system.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased cardiac contractility can maintain stroke volume by increasing ventricular emptying.</p><p></p><p>Among children with hypovolemic shock, hypotension develops late, and may signal impending cardiac arrest [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Compensatory vasoconstriction maintains blood pressure at the expense of reduced tissue perfusion. As a result, hypovolemic shock progresses rapidly to cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest once hypotension develops. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6388.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1229879847"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypovolemia can be classified by the degree of volume depletion, with patients in shock included in the most severe categories.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonhemorrhagic</strong> – For children with nonhemorrhagic losses, volume depletion is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe depending upon the percent loss of body weight: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Mild – 3 to 5 percent </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Moderate – 6 to 9 percent </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Severe – ≥10 percent </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinical features are typically used to estimate volume deficit since premorbid weight is usually not known  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76198" href="/z/d/graphic/76198.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Many children with moderate volume depletion and all of those with severe depletion have compromised perfusion and are in shock. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6142.html" rel="external">"Clinical assessment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children", section on 'Estimating degree of hypovolemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemorrhagic</strong> – Patients with hemorrhage can be categorized by severity into four classes based upon percent loss of blood volume. As with nonhemorrhagic losses, clinical features are typically used to estimate blood volume deficit  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68694" href="/z/d/graphic/68694.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Many children with class II hemorrhage and all of those with classes III and IV are in shock. The approach to hemorrhage by class is as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Class I</strong> – Class I hemorrhage occurs with acute loss of up to 15 percent of the child's blood volume. Minimal physiologic changes are evident, and patients usually respond well to crystalloid fluid replacement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Class II</strong> – Class II hemorrhage results from 15 to 30 percent blood loss. Physiologic changes include mild tachycardia and tachypnea with a narrow pulse pressure, slightly delayed capillary refill, decreased urine output, and mild anxiety. Patients can usually be stabilized with crystalloid solution, although they may require blood products.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Class III</strong> – Class III hemorrhage is the result of an acute blood loss of 30 to 40 percent. Signs of shock (including tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, delayed capillary refill, altered mental status, and oliguria) are present. Prompt resuscitation with crystalloid solution is necessary; most patients will need blood products as well.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Class IV</strong> – Class IV hemorrhage occurs with more than 40 percent acute blood loss. Signs of shock are obvious and immediately life-threatening. Patients are usually cold and pale with profoundly depressed mentation, marked tachypnea and tachycardia, and anuria. Children should quickly receive blood products. Operative intervention is often necessary to control hemorrhage.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1688868462"><span class="h2">Stabilization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical characteristics associated with imminent cardiovascular collapse must be quickly identified with an initial rapid assessment. Children who have been injured and have hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock may have associated injuries that require stabilization (ie, cervical spine immobilization for suspected neck injury or needle thoracostomy for tension pneumothorax). An approach to rapidly identifying the cause of shock based upon clinical findings is provided in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81356" href="/z/d/graphic/81356.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6396.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of shock in children", section on 'Rapid assessment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historical features typically suggest the source of volume loss (eg, vomiting and diarrhea with gastroenteritis, osmotic diuresis with diabetic ketoacidosis, insensible and capillary leak following burn injury, third space losses with intraabdominal processes [eg, pancreatitis, intussusception, small bowel obstruction], sickle cell disease with splenic sequestration crisis, or hemorrhage with blunt abdominal trauma).</p><p>Additional key historical information to consider includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The type of fluid loss may influence fluid management (eg. blood transfusion for children with hemorrhage or isotonic fluids followed by slower administration of hypotonic fluids in patients with hypernatremic dehydration). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6103.html" rel="external">"Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Hypernatremia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior fluid replacement may cause abnormalities in serum electrolyte levels (eg, hyponatremia from fluid replacement with free water, typically in young infants).

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6396.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of shock in children", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.) </p><p>These include signs of:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decreased cerebral perfusion</strong> (ie, poor tone, unfocused gaze, listlessness, or decreased responsiveness to caretakers or painful interventions)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Poor peripheral perfusion</strong> (ie, decreased or absent distal pulses, cool extremities, prolonged capillary refill [&gt;2 seconds])</p><p></p><p>Specific features of the physical examination that may be noted in children with hypovolemic shock include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypotension</strong> – Children who are hypotensive with histories of trauma are likely in hemorrhagic shock. They must be carefully evaluated to identify sources of bleeding and associated injuries  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/z/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Narrow pulse pressure</strong> – Children with hypovolemic shock typically have narrow pulse pressures as the result of elevated diastolic pressure from increased systemic vascular resistance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypertonic dehydration</strong> – Signs of significant volume loss may be less dramatic among children with hypertonic dehydration (as can occur with hypotonic fluid loss from conditions such as rotavirus gastroenteritis and arginine vasopressin deficiency or resistance [previously called central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, respectively]). This is because the associated increase in serum osmolality pulls water out of the cells, initially minimizing the degree of extracellular fluid volume loss. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6142.html" rel="external">"Clinical assessment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children", section on 'Type of fluid lost'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abnormal abdominal examination</strong> – Abdominal distention, mass, or tenderness is consistent with an abdominal catastrophe, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or peritonitis. Inflicted injury should be suspected in the absence of a history of trauma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition", section on 'Red flag history'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition", section on 'Visceral injuries'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ongoing losses</strong> – Ongoing losses must be identified (eg, persistent vomiting, diarrhea, or active bleeding). They may need to be replaced and/or treated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Burns</strong> – Children with moderate to severe burns are at increased risk of hypovolemia due to insensible losses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6567.html" rel="external">"Moderate and severe thermal burns in children: Emergency management", section on 'Evaluation of burn injury'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Ancillary data</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of hypovolemic shock usually is based upon physical signs and symptoms. Once fluid therapy is initiated, ancillary data can be useful to detect associated electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities and to guide treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Laboratory evaluation</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypovolemic shock without hemorrhage</strong> – The following studies are suggested in children with hypovolemic shock without hemorrhage:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Rapid blood glucose</strong> – Children with hypovolemic shock from gastroenteritis are at risk for hypoglycemia. In contrast, pediatric trauma and burn victims commonly have hyperglycemia caused by physiologic stress. In some of these patients, the blood glucose can exceed 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) with the potential to cause an osmotic diuresis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hematocrit</strong> – In patients with hypovolemic shock primarily from fluid losses such as diarrhea, the hematocrit may be elevated due to hemoconcentration. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Electrolyte levels</strong> – Abnormalities in serum sodium and potassium levels may occur among children with hypovolemic shock. Serum sodium concentrations are influenced by the type of fluid loss, secretion of antidiuretic hormone, and prior fluid replacement. Clinical features that affect serum potassium include type of fluid loss (eg, increased loss in diarrheal stool) and the degree of acidosis (with marked acidosis, serum potassium concentration may be increased). Serum and urine electrolyte testing in hypovolemia is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6142.html" rel="external">"Clinical assessment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children", section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Creatinine</strong> – A baseline measurement of serum creatinine and early monitoring of urine output are essential to promptly identify acute kidney injury, which may develop in children with hypovolemic shock. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6126.html" rel="external">"Acute kidney injury in children: Clinical features, etiology, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Lactic acid</strong> – Although evidence is lacking, lactic acid measurement may be helpful in the initial evaluation of hypovolemic shock. Based on observational studies in children with septic shock, hypoperfusion should be suspected when the lactate is &gt;2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL). Initial lactate levels &gt;4.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) are associated with shock. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6395.html" rel="external">"Sepsis in children: Definitions, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Laboratory studies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Lactic acid measurement may be helpful in the initial evaluation of shock. Lactate levels &gt;5 mmol/L are associated with increased mortality in children [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. When shock is masked by “normal” blood pressure for age, a blood lactic acid level &gt;4 mmol/L usually indicates shock, even without overt clinical signs of hypoperfusion. Hypoperfusion may be masked by normal blood pressure. Although evidence is limited in children, studies in adults show that initial lactate levels are better than blood pressure at predicting mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1613.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Urine dipstick </strong>– Rapid urine dipstick provides a quick measurement of the urine specific gravity, ketones, and glucose.

Children with hemorrhagic shock may require transfusion and should have samples sent to the blood bank for type and cross match. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Successful management of children with hypovolemic shock requires identification and treatment of life-threatening conditions and the rapid initiation of aggressive fluid resuscitation:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cervical spine motion restriction (trauma patients)</strong> – Cervical spine motion restriction should be performed for children with traumatic hemorrhagic shock until a spinal fracture is ruled out. (See <a class="local">'Airway and breathing'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Airway and Breathing</strong> – Airway management should include supplemental oxygen with an initial inspired concentration of 100 percent. Early positive pressure ventilation and intubation should be performed in patients with airway compromise or impending respiratory failure. A rapid overview provides the suggested approach to rapid sequence intubation in children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51456" href="/z/d/graphic/51456.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'Airway and breathing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Circulation</strong> – Sites of significant external hemorrhage require direct manual pressure to control bleeding  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75556" href="/z/d/graphic/75556.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). In patients whose bleeding does not abate with direct pressure or who have a sharp foreign body at the site of bleeding or an amputation, compression at the nearest vascular pressure point provides an alternative means for hemorrhage control  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75765" href="/z/d/graphic/75765.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Control of hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Adequate vascular access must be obtained for rapid infusion of fluid. Two peripheral intravenous catheters consisting of the largest size that can be reliably placed (22 to 24 gauge in newborns and infants, 18 to 20 gauge for older children) typically suffice. For children in shock, intraosseous cannulation should be performed if intravenous access cannot be established quickly. (See <a class="local">'Vascular access'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Fluid resuscitation includes the administration of isotonic crystalloid in 20 mL/kg boluses, followed by evaluation of physiologic indicators of peripheral perfusion (blood pressure, quality of central and peripheral pulses, skin perfusion, mental status, and urine output). (See <a class="local">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Children who have not improved after receiving a total of 60 mL/kg of isotonic fluid should be evaluated for ongoing blood loss or other causes of shock. (See <a class="local">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For children with nonhemorrhagic shock, the sodium content of repletion fluid and the rate of correction are dependent upon the serum sodium. (See <a class="local">'Ongoing management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong> – Hypoglycemia should be corrected by rapid intravenous infusion of dextrose as described in the rapid overview  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83485" href="/z/d/graphic/83485.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). For patients with stress hyperglycemia, treatment of the underlying condition typically suffices.
