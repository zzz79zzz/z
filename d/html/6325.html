Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is then removed for sample.</p><p>LP should be performed distal to the spinal cord, at the level of the cauda equina  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef128016" href="/z/d/graphic/128016.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). At birth, the inferior tip of the spinal cord is located opposite the body of L3. The vertebral column grows more rapidly than the spinal cord. As a result, by adulthood, the tip of the spinal cord is at the inferior border of the body of L1. In older children, LP can be performed from the L2-L3 interspace to the L5-S1 interspace because these interspaces are below the termination of the spinal cord. LP in children younger than 12 months must be performed below the L2-L3 interspace [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>An imaginary line that connects the two posterior-superior iliac crests intersects the spine at approximately the fourth lumbar vertebra  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60862" href="/z/d/graphic/60862.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). This landmark helps to locate the L3-L4 and L4-L5 interspaces.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Major indications for LP in children are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Suspected central nervous system (CNS) infection</strong> – For children, evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for possible CNS infection remains the most common emergency indication for LP. Because delay in the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy can have deleterious effects on outcomes for patients with CNS infections, early empiric antimicrobial treatment is recommended. Such treatment should <strong>not</strong> be delayed when LP cannot be performed in a timely fashion (eg, when patients have contraindications to LP or when concern for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or a space-occupying intracranial lesion mandates neuroimaging prior to the procedure). However, other cultures or testing necessary to diagnose the type of infection should be obtained prior to antimicrobial therapy whenever possible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5983.html" rel="external">"Viral meningitis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Cerebrospinal fluid studies'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5968.html" rel="external">"Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage</strong> – Evaluation for spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage is a less common emergency indication for LP in children. A computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed initially for all children with findings suspicious for subarachnoid hemorrhage (eg, sudden onset of severe headache, which may or may not be accompanied by meningismus, neck pain, or preretinal hemorrhages). LP to assess for elevated opening pressures, red blood cells in the CSF that do not clear during collection, and xanthochromia is indicated when clinical suspicion remains high but subarachnoid hemorrhage is not seen on CT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1130.html" rel="external">"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other</strong> – Other pediatric indications for LP include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Measurement of opening pressure and removal of CSF for the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5257.html" rel="external">"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Diagnosis of neurologic conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or juvenile multiple sclerosis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6235.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Cerebrospinal fluid'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6229.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of pediatric multiple sclerosis", section on 'Cerebrospinal fluid analysis'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Diagnosis of pediatric metabolic disease (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17216.html" rel="external">"Inborn errors of metabolism: Identifying the specific disorder", section on 'Laboratory evaluation'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Instillation of chemotherapy for intrathecal treatment or prevention of CNS malignancy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6253.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of central nervous system tumors in children", section on 'Chemotherapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6245.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma in children and adolescents", section on 'CNS management'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Spinal anesthesia (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105456.html" rel="external">"Spinal anesthesia: Technique"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Potential contraindications to LP include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Increased intracranial pressure (ICP)</strong> — Children with elevated ICP are at risk for cerebral herniation when an LP is performed [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Consequently, in children with clinical suspicion for elevated ICP based upon physical examination or predisposing illness, LP should <strong>not</strong> be performed until neuroimaging is performed to identify cerebral edema, space-occupying lesion, or obstructive hydrocephalus, any one of which would contraindicate the procedure [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Preprocedure evaluation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Cerebral herniation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Furthermore, normal neuroimaging does not absolutely exclude the presence of elevated ICP or the possibility that elevated ICP will develop at a later time. Nevertheless, LP can usually be safely performed within six hours of a normal CT scan when no other contraindications are present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Respiratory distress</strong> — Children with respiratory compromise may become hypoxemic or apneic while undergoing LP, especially in the lateral recumbent position [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Thus, careful assessment and support of airway and breathing should be provided, as needed, before and during the procedure in patients with significant respiratory distress. Patients who cannot maintain their airway or who are in respiratory failure should undergo endotracheal intubation prior to LP.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemodynamic instability</strong> — Children with shock should undergo appropriate resuscitation before LP. As an example, a hemodynamically unstable patient with septic shock who may have bacterial meningitis should undergo emergency fluid resuscitation, have a blood culture obtained, and receive empiric antibiotics as soon as possible; LP should be deferred until the child's condition stabilizes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Soft tissue infection at the puncture site</strong> — Meningitis or other infections such as epidural abscess, vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, or intramedullary spinal abscess can be induced if the LP is performed through cellulitis or soft tissue infection (eg, epidural abscess) at the site of puncture [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. For this reason, local infection at the puncture site is a contraindication to performing LP.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding disorder</strong> — Because of the risk of spinal hematoma formation, we generally do <strong>not</strong> advise performing LP in patients with coagulation defects who are actively bleeding, have severe thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet counts &lt;50,000/microL), or have an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.4 without correcting the underlying abnormalities. When LP is considered essential for a patient with an abnormal INR or platelet count in whom the cause is not obvious, we suggest consultation with a hematologist to provide the best advice for safe correction of the coagulopathy prior to performing the LP. In cases in which LP is considered necessary but the risk of bleeding is considered to be high, it may be useful to perform the procedure under fluoroscopy or ultrasound guidance to reduce the chance of accidental injury to small blood vessels.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Evidence regarding the safety of performing LP in patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulation factor deficiency is limited:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The safety of performing LP in children with thrombocytopenia at the time of diagnosis or during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia was reported in two retrospective series describing 5223 and 9088 LPs, of which 941 [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] and 266 [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], respectively, were performed in children with a platelet count &lt;50,000/microL. No serious hemorrhagic complications occurred. However, the number of children with platelet counts &lt;10,000/microL was small in both studies, making the safety of performing LP without giving a platelet transfusion uncertain at these low levels.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No serious complications were reported in a small retrospective series describing children and adults with hemophilia who received LP following replacement of the deficient factor [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">PREPARATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Preprocedure evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Circumstances that should be identified in preparation for LP include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Critically ill children who require monitoring of oxygen saturation, respirations, and heart rate during the procedure, especially those with respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability that require stabilization before LP.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Children who may have increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and should have neuroimaging performed before LP based upon any one of the following physical findings [<a href="#rid3">3,10</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bradycardia with hypertension</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Altered mental status</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Unequal, dilated, or poorly responsive pupils</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Papilledema</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Focal neurologic findings</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Decorticate or decerebrate posturing</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>At risk for brain abscess (immunocompromise or congenital heart disease with a right-to-left shunt)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If meningitis or encephalitis is suspected, the clinician should obtain appropriate cultures (eg, blood, urine, and/or tissue cultures) and initiate antimicrobial therapy prior to neuroimaging.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Signs of infection of the skin or soft tissues in the lumbar region. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with spinal abnormalities (such as spina bifida or severe scoliosis) should be identified. An alternative approach for obtaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as performing the procedure under fluoroscopy, may be required for such patients [<a href="#rid1">1,11</a>]. Patients who have undergone posterior lumbar spinal fusion cannot have spinal fluid obtained by LP. Such patients need to undergo an alternative method for CSF collection (eg, cisternal or transforaminal tap); this procedure should be performed by a neurosurgeon or neuroradiologist.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Patient counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although LP is a relatively simple and safe procedure to perform, it is frightening for most children and their families. A clear explanation of the urgent indications for the procedure, as well as the details of the procedure itself, is usually reassuring and should routinely be provided. In addition, it may be helpful for older children and adolescents to "practice" the position that they will assume for the procedure.</p><p>In addition, written informed consent is advisable given the invasive nature of the procedure and the rare but potentially severe complications that can occur. Justification for and essential components of informed consent in the pediatric emergency department are described in the reference [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>In the emergency setting, LP is performed primarily to identify central nervous system (CNS) infection or subarachnoid hemorrhage, conditions that must be urgently diagnosed and treated (see <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above). Consequently, the benefit of early diagnosis far outweighs the risks of the procedure for patients who have been carefully screened for contraindications.

(See <a class="local">'Ultrasound guidance'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Topical anesthetics anesthetize the skin (but not the subcutaneous tissues) without altering landmarks but require 30 to 60 minutes to be effective, depending on the preparation. Thus, they are only useful for elective LP. The dose and precautions for specific topical anesthetics and their use in neonates are discussed separately.

However, a review of the literature found that herniation was unlikely in children with bacterial meningitis unless they had focal neurologic findings or coma; furthermore, a normal CT scan does not absolutely exclude subsequent herniation [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1515807833"><span class="h2">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Meningitis or other infections such as epidural abscess, vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, or intramedullary spinal abscess can be induced if the LP is performed through cellulitis or soft tissue infection at the site of puncture [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. For this reason, local infection at the puncture site is a contraindication to performing LP. Otherwise, with proper sterile technique, the risk of causing meningitis is extremely low in the absence of soft tissue infection at the puncture site.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H163138941"><span class="h2">Spinal hematoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spinal hematoma is a complication after LP that usually occurs in patients with uncorrected bleeding disorders, but it has also been reported in those with no apparent risk factors for bleeding [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis of spinal hematoma is complicated by the concealed nature of the bleeding; thus, a high index of suspicion must be maintained. Patients who have back pain that is associated with neurologic findings (eg, weakness, decreased sensation, or incontinence) after undergoing LP require emergency evaluation for possible spinal hematoma.</p><p>The appropriate treatment for the symptomatic patient is prompt surgical intervention, usually a laminectomy, and evacuation of the blood. Timely decompression of the hematoma is essential to avoiding permanent loss of neurologic function.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29"><span class="h2">Postspinal headache</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postspinal headache is one of the most common complications of LP. Limited evidence suggests that the frequency of postspinal headaches in children is approximately 5 to 15 percent [<a href="#rid37">37-43</a>]. Various techniques such as using the smallest possible needle, using atraumatic needles, and, when using a cutting needle, placing the bevel of the needle parallel to the long axis of the spine have been shown to prevent or lessen postspinal headache. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113316.html" rel="external">"Post dural puncture headache", section on 'Procedural risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, bed rest or prolonged supine position does <strong>not</strong> appear to prevent headache in children. As an example, in one randomized trial comparing bed rest for 24 hours with free mobility following LP in 111 children, positional headaches were more likely with bed rest than with no limitations on activity (15 versus 2 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. In a separate trial of 400 infants and young children undergoing LP, the frequency of postspinal headache was similar for individuals who remained flat for 30 minutes compared with those who remained flat for four hours (approximately 7 percent in both groups) [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. In this study, the presence of headache in infants was based upon a validated pain score administered by nurse observers.</p><p>The treatment of postspinal headache is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113316.html" rel="external">"Post dural puncture headache", section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17891054"><span class="h2">Back pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Observational studies suggest that back pain occurs in up to 11 percent of children following LP [<a href="#rid43">43,45</a>]. Back pain typically resolves within a few days of the procedure. Prolonged pain should raise concern for a localized infection or a spinal hematoma. (See <a class="local">'Infection'</a> above and <a class="local">'Spinal hematoma'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, transient, unilateral radicular pain radiating to the posterior leg may be reported by verbal patients during the procedure if the spinal needle contacts one of the nerves. Reversible low-pressure radiculopathy ("pseudo-tethered cord") has also been described [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. However, sustained radicular pain due to nerve injury is rare.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30"><span class="h2">Epidermoid tumor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The formation of an epidermoid spinal cord tumor is a rare complication of LP that may become evident years after the procedure is performed [<a href="#rid47">47-51</a>]. It is believed to be caused by epidermoid tissue that is transplanted into the spinal canal during LP without a stylet, or with one that is poorly fitting. For this reason, spinal needles with tight-fitting stylets should always be used during LP [<a href="#rid52">52,53</a>].

LP is also used for diagnostic testing (eg, suspicion for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, Guillain-Barré, juvenile multiple sclerosis, or metabolic disease), administration of intrathecal medications, and spinal anesthesia. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> – Prior to performing an LP, the clinician should assess for potential contraindications including signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability, skin or soft tissue infection at the puncture site, or bleeding disorder. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preprocedure evaluation</strong> – Preprocedure evaluation should determine the need for stabilization and neuroimaging prior to LP as well as the presence of spinal abnormalities(see <a class="local">'Preprocedure evaluation'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Signs of increased ICP</strong> – Children should have neuroimaging performed before LP if there are findings of increased ICP, including any one of the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Bradycardia with hypertension</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Altered mental status</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Unequal, dilated, or poorly responsive pupils</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Papilledema</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Focal neurologic findings</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Decorticate or decerebrate posturing</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>At risk for brain abscess (immunocompromise or congenital heart disease with a right-to-left shunt)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If meningitis or encephalitis is suspected, the clinician should obtain appropriate cultures (eg, blood and urine cultures) and initiate antimicrobial therapy <strong>prior to</strong> neuroimaging.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Critically ill patients</strong> – Children who are critically ill should undergo stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation prior to LP and have cardiorespiratory monitoring during LP. Because of the higher risk of apnea, we suggest that all young infants also undergo continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring and pulse oximetry during LP. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients with spinal abnormalities</strong> – Patients with spinal abnormalities (such as spina bifida or severe scoliosis) should be identified. An alternative approach for obtaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as performing the procedure under fluoroscopy, may be required for such patients. Patients who have undergone posterior lumbar spinal fusion cannot have spinal fluid obtained by LP. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Analgesia and sedation</strong> – LP is a painful procedure that warrants appropriate local anesthesia and, in uncooperative patients, mild or moderate sedation (see <a class="local">'Analgesia and sedation'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We suggest topical anesthesia for neonates and young infants for whom LP can safely be delayed until the medication has had an effect (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).
