         The pericardium is a fibroelastic sac surrounding the heart that contains a thin layer of fluid. A pericardial effusion is considered to be present when accumulated fluid within the sac exceeds the small physiologic amount (15 to 50 mL). Cardiac tamponade results from pericardial fluid accumulating under pressure, impairing cardiac filling and reducing stroke volume.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiac tamponade will be reviewed here. A general approach to pericardial effusion is discussed separately. (See

         In cardiac tamponade, the primary abnormality is compression of cardiac chambers due to increased pericardial pressure exceeding cardiac filling (diastolic) pressures [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. When there is free-flowing pericardial fluid, this compression may affect all cardiac chambers. Pericardial adhesions or organization of the pericardial fluid can result in localized and, thus, atypical cardiac tamponade.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pericardium has some degree of elasticity, but once the elastic limit is reached, the heart must compete with intrapericardial fluid for the fixed intrapericardial volume. As cardiac tamponade progresses, chamber diastolic compliance is reduced with the following consequences:

         <strong>
          Progressive decline in systemic venous return
         </strong>
         – Venous return is normally bimodal, with peaks during ventricular systole and early diastole. The effusion produces compression throughout the cardiac cycle, and cardiac volume is smallest during ejection. Thus, as cardiac tamponade becomes more severe, venous return is progressively shifted to systole as the peak associated with early diastolic filling diminishes. When cardiac tamponade is very severe, total venous return falls, the cardiac chambers shrink, stroke volume declines, and blood pressure falls.

         <strong>
          Enhanced ventricular interdependence
         </strong>
         – Inspiratory decline in thoracic pressure is transmitted through the pericardium to the right side of the heart and the pulmonary vasculature. As a result, systemic venous return to the right heart increases with inspiration, and pulmonary venous return to the left heart decreases with inspiration. Under normal conditions, the right ventricle (RV) expands with little impact on left heart volume.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In cardiac tamponade, the effective compliance of cardiac chambers is limited to that of the tightly stretched pericardium. The ensuing distension of the RV is limited to the interventricular septum, which along with relative underfilling of the left ventricle causes the septum to bulge to the left, reducing left ventricular compliance and contributing to further decreased filling of the left ventricle during inspiration. This concept is referred to as "ventricular interaction" or "ventricular interdependence." (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4936.html" rel="external">
          "Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease"

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The pericardial effusion volume at which cardiac tamponade occurs depends on the rate of pericardial fluid accumulation and pericardial compliance (which is impacted by pericardial scarring and inflammation), which are related to the underlying cause of pericardial effusion [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3
         </a>
         ]. As examples:

         <strong>
          Rapid accumulation
         </strong>
         – Acute bleeding (eg, due to traumatic cardiac rupture or perforation) into the pericardial sac can rapidly lead to cardiac tamponade with a small pericardial effusion. As intrapericardial volume increases, there is an initial small increase in intrapericardial pressure followed by an almost vertical ascent  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75068" href="/z/d/graphic/75068.html" rel="external">

          ●
         </span>
         <strong>
          Gradual accumulation
         </strong>
         – By comparison, subacute or chronic accumulation of a pericardial effusion (eg, due to renal failure or malignancy) allows the pericardial compliance to increase gradually. As a result, intrapericardial pressure increases more slowly until a critical point is reached when an almost vertical ascent is again seen  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75068" href="/z/d/graphic/75068.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). In this setting, cardiac tamponade may not occur until 2 liters or more have accumulated.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the pericardium can no longer stretch, very little fluid needs to accumulate to produce cardiac tamponade  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75068" href="/z/d/graphic/75068.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. At this point, the initial removal of fluid during pericardiocentesis produces the largest reduction in intrapericardial pressure.

         The causes of cardiac tamponade include all of the causes of pericardial effusion or hemorrhage into the pericardium, including iatrogenic causes  (

         ). Cardiac tamponade occurs more frequently in patients with identifiable causes of pericardial effusion than in patients with idiopathic pericardial disease. As an example, in one series, cardiac tamponade occurred in 61 percent of those with neoplastic, tuberculous, or purulent pericarditis and in 14 percent of patients with idiopathic pericarditis [

         In a series of 340 patients with cardiac tamponade, the most common etiologies were complications of invasive percutaneous cardiac procedures (33 percent), postpericardiotomy syndrome (&gt;7 days after cardiac surgery; 23 percent), neoplasm (15 percent). inflammatory processes (pericarditis associated with connective tissue disease, infectious, or noninfectious conditions; 12.5 percent), complications of cardiac surgery (9 percent), uremia (2 percent), and acute myocardial infarction (1.5 percent) [

         ]. Other causes included aortic dissection, post-myocardial infarction syndrome, radiation, chest trauma, and coagulopathy. Only three cases were deemed to have no known cause. The largest volumes of pericardial fluid drainage were in patients with post-myocardial infarction syndrome, uremic, and neoplastic etiologies. (See

         In a Swedish nationwide registry study, among 44,497 patients undergoing 58,770 invasive electrophysiology procedures, 200 patients experienced a procedure-related cardiac tamponade (procedural risk of 0.34 percent) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. During five-year follow-up, iatrogenic cardiac tamponade was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for pericarditis but no association with mortality rate or other adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a 15-year, single-center experience of 5222 catheter ablations of atrial fibrillation (3483 patients), cardiac tamponade complicated 51 procedures (1 percent) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         Cardiac tamponade has been described in less than 1 percent of patients with an acute myocardial infarction treated with fibrinolytic therapy; the risk may be lower in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The two major mechanisms are left ventricular free wall rupture and hemorrhagic pericarditis [

         Patients with cardiac tamponade commonly have an apparent cause such as a complication of invasive procedures (eg, invasive electrophysiologic or catheter-based procedures or cardiac surgery), traumatic injury, or conditions such as cancer, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, or infection. However, some patients require additional evaluation to identify the cause. (See

         Patients with cardiac tamponade commonly have one or more characteristic signs (particularly tachycardia and elevated jugular venous pressure). Physical signs vary depending upon the type and severity of cardiac tamponade, although none of the findings alone are highly sensitive or specific for the diagnosis [

         The combination of signs known as Beck triad, namely low arterial blood pressure, dilated neck veins, and muffled heart sounds, are all present in only a minority of cases of acute cardiac tamponade [

         Sinus tachycardia is seen in nearly all patients with cardiac tamponade, while hypotension (an ominous sign suggesting failure of tachycardia to compensate for decreased stroke volume) is more variably present. In the setting of cardiac tamponade, sinus tachycardia is a compensation for hemodynamic compromise and should prompt urgent pericardial fluid drainage, even if hypotension has not yet developed.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, tachycardia may not be present when the underlying disease is associated with bradycardia, as with a pericardial effusion and subacute cardiac tamponade associated with hypothyroidism. Tachycardia also may not be seen in some patients with early cardiac tamponade even though they have other signs of a hemodynamically significant effusion, such as an elevated jugular venous pressure.

         The jugular venous pressure is almost always elevated in cardiac tamponade and may be associated with venous distension in the forehead and scalp. The x descent is preserved, while the y descent is attenuated or absent because of the limited or absent late diastolic filling of the ventricle. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         However, absence of jugular venous pressure does not exclude cardiac tamponade. Some patients with severe hypovolemia have low-pressure cardiac tamponade and do not have elevated jugular venous pressure, as described above (See

         Pulsus paradoxus, defined as an abnormally large decrease in systolic blood pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) on inspiration, is a common finding in moderate to severe cardiac tamponade and is the direct consequence of ventricular interdependence. The limitation on outward expansion of the RV as blood flows in during inspiration, along with relative underfilling of the left ventricle during inspiration, results in bulging of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle. Both the bulging of the interventricular septum and the reduction in left ventricular filling contribute to a large decrease in stroke volume  (

         However, not all patients with cardiac tamponade have pulsus paradoxus (eg, those with chronic hypertension leading to elevated ventricular diastolic pressures, those with a coexistent atrial septal defect, or those with aortic insufficiency), and the finding of pulsus paradoxus is not specific for cardiac tamponade.

Symptoms may include chest pain, dyspnea, and tachypnea. The jugular venous pressure is markedly elevated and may be associated with venous distension in the forehead and scalp. The heart sounds are often muted. (See

         Hypotension, narrow pulse pressure, and tachycardia are common due to the decline in cardiac output. Patients in cardiogenic shock typically have cool extremities, peripheral cyanosis, and decreased urine output.

         Subacute cardiac tamponade occurs over days to weeks with causes including neoplastic, uremic, and idiopathic pericarditis. Patients may be asymptomatic early in the course, but once intrapericardial pressure reaches a critical value, they complain of dyspnea, chest discomfort or fullness, peripheral edema, fatigability, or other symptoms referable to increased filling pressures and limited cardiac output.

         The physical examination in subacute severe cardiac tamponade may reveal hypotension with a narrow pulse pressure, reflecting the limited stroke volume.

         Low-pressure (occult) cardiac tamponade is a subset of subacute cardiac tamponade that occurs in patients who are severely hypovolemic. Patients who are severely hypovolemic (due to causes such as traumatic hemorrhage, hemodialysis or ultrafiltration, or overdiuresis) may have low-pressure cardiac tamponade in which symptoms of tamponade such as fatigue may be present but the intracardiac and pericardial diastolic pressures are only 6 to 12 mmHg, so jugular venous distension may be absent [

          1

         ]. The hemodynamic significance of these effusions can be demonstrated on echocardiography by right heart chamber collapse and respiratory variations in transvalvular flows. A fluid challenge with a rapid infusion of 1 liter of isotonic

         Regional cardiac tamponade occurs when a loculated, eccentric pericardial effusion or hematoma produces tamponade in which at least one but not all cardiac chambers are compressed. As a result, the typical physical, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade, including pulsus paradoxus, diastolic pressure equalization, and chamber compression in standard apical and parasternal views, may be absent or attenuated in some cases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regional cardiac tamponade is most often seen after pericardiotomy (eg, after cardiac surgery), aortic dissection, iatrogenic myocardial or coronary perforation, or myocardial infarction with rupture. Clinical suspicion should be heightened in these settings. Establishing the diagnosis by echocardiography is challenging and may require additional echocardiographic views (eg, subcostal or transesophageal), other advanced imaging techniques (eg, computed tomography [CT]), and, in some cases, surgical exploration.

         The ECG in patients with cardiac tamponade typically shows sinus tachycardia and may also show low voltage. If pericarditis is present, the ECG findings typical of that disorder are also seen  (

        </p>
        <p>
         While the frequency of low voltage is higher among patients with cardiac tamponade than among patients with pericardial effusion without tamponade, the presence of low voltage is not specific for tamponade. In a study of ECG findings in 224 patients with moderate or large pericardial effusion, low voltage in limb and/or precordial leads was present in 66 percent of patients with cardiac tamponade and in 34 percent of patients without cardiac tamponade [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>

         Electrical alternans is characterized by beat-to-beat alterations in the QRS complex and, in some cases, other electrocardiographic waves that reflect the swinging of the heart in the pericardial fluid  (

         ). Electrical alternans with sinus tachycardia is a highly specific sign of pericardial effusion, usually with cardiac tamponade, but is only modestly sensitive. As a result, its absence does not exclude cardiac tamponade. In the above-cited study of ECG findings in 224 patients with moderate or large pericardial effusion, electrical alternans was observed in 35 percent of patients with cardiac tamponade and in only 7 percent of patients without tamponade [

          Chamber collapse

          Respiratory variation in volumes and flows

         Also, the respiratory variation of mitral and tricuspid flow velocities is greatly increased and out of phase, reflecting increased ventricular interdependence in which the hemodynamics of the left and right heart chambers are directly influenced by each other to a much greater degree than normal. Normally, there is no more than 20 to 25 percent variation in the amplitude of inflow and outflow signals across the valves during respiration. However, in cardiac tamponade, mitral flow variation usually exceeds 30 percent, and tricuspid valve flow variation usually exceeds 60 percent, when referenced to expiration.

         Patients with cardiac tamponade require urgent pericardial fluid drainage to alleviate symptoms and prevent hemodynamic collapse. This approach generally results in rapid and dramatic improvement in symptoms and hemodynamics. If the cause of the pericardial effusion is unknown, pericardial fluid analysis may aid in identifying the cause.
        </p>
        <p>
         An occasional patient with borderline signs of cardiac tamponade (eg, right atrial [RA] collapse during ≤1/3 of the cardiac cycle) may be observed with close clinical follow-up including serial physical examinations and echocardiograms (eg, every two to three days or sooner if clinically indicated) to enable prompt identification and treatment of cardiac tamponade.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pericardial fluid is most commonly drained via percutaneous pericardiocentesis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143187" href="/z/d/graphic/143187.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). If percutaneous drainage is not appropriate or feasible, the pericardial fluid is drained via a surgical approach. Indications for surgical pericardial fluid drainage include a pericardial effusion which is inaccessible to percutaneous drainage or a critical cardiac or aortic bleeding site (eg, type A aortic dissection, ventricular free wall rupture after acute myocardial infarction, traumatic cardiac rupture, or iatrogenic hemopericardium which cannot be controlled percutaneously). (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pericardial fluid removal is generally well tolerated. Rare complications of pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade include bleeding and heart failure (caused by posttap fluid shift into the central circulation). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/143123.html" rel="external">

         Catheter drainage is continued following pericardial fluid removal until the volume of flow is &lt;25 mL/day.

         While preparing for pericardial fluid drainage, patients with cardiac tamponade are treated with volume repletion with agents such as blood, plasma, dextran, or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">
          saline
         </a>
         , but only as a temporizing measure. The effects of volume replacement were shown to be variable in a study of 49 patients with a large pericardial effusion and hemodynamic criteria for cardiac tamponade who were given 500 mL of intravenous normal saline over 10 minutes; cardiac index increased by &gt;10 percent in 47 percent of patients, remained unchanged in 22 percent, and decreased in 31 percent [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Volume expansion significantly increased intrapericardial pressure, RA pressure, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg was predictive of a favorable response to volume expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Inotropic support is rarely indicated, and vasodilator therapy should be avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
         Positive pressure mechanical ventilation should be avoided, if possible, because the positive thoracic pressures can further impair cardiac filling [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Among patients with cardiac arrest and pericardial effusion, the benefit of external cardiac compression is markedly reduced since additional cardiac filling is difficult to achieve [

        <p>
         A patient with a pericardial effusion without cardiac tamponade, and in whom fluid sampling is not needed for diagnostic purposes, does not require pericardiocentesis and can be observed with serial clinical and echocardiographic follow-up [

        </p>
        <p>
         Following either percutaneous or surgical drainage of a pericardial effusion in a patient with cardiac tamponade, the patient should generally be monitored with continuous telemetry and frequent vital signs for at least 24 to 48 hours. Subsequent monitoring with two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography (eg, prior to and following discharge from the hospital) is warranted to confirm adequate fluid removal, detect possible recurrent fluid accumulation, and identify signs of early constrictive pericarditis [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. In general, an early follow-up echocardiogram should be performed within one to two weeks following discharge, with an additional follow-up study in 6 to 12 months; however, the frequency of follow-up should be individualized according to the patient's clinical status, etiology of the effusion, and recurrence of effusion.

         As noted above, catheter drainage is continued following pericardial fluid removal until the volume of flow is &lt;25 mL/day. After completion of this postprocedural drainage period, most patients who have been treated with pericardial fluid removal for cardiac tamponade require no additional drainage procedure. However, a minority of patients (particularly patients with malignant pericardial effusion) require intervention (eg, surgical pericardial window) to treat or prevent recurrent pericardial effusion. In the above-cited series of 340 patients treated for cardiac tamponade, 3 of 50 patients with a neoplastic pericardial effusion and three patients with an inflammatory pericardial effusion subsequently required a pericardial window [

          Pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Cardiac tamponade results from an accumulation of pericardial fluid under pressure, leading to impaired cardiac filling and hemodynamic compromise. Progressive decline in systemic venous return and enhanced ventricular interdependence are largely responsible for the physical and imaging signs of cardiac tamponade. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Acute
         </strong>
         – Acute cardiac tamponade occurs within minutes and causes cardiogenic shock requiring urgent intervention with pericardial fluid drainage. Symptoms may include chest pain, dyspnea, and tachypnea. Signs include markedly elevated jugular venous pressure, tachycardia, hypotension, and narrow pulse pressure. Causes include traumatic rupture of the heart or aorta, aortic dissection, or a cardiac or coronary artery perforation caused by an invasive procedure. The pericardial effusion is often small. (See

          Subacute
         </strong>
         – Subacute cardiac tamponade occurs over days to weeks with causes including neoplastic, uremic, and idiopathic pericarditis. Symptoms may include fatigue, dyspnea, chest discomfort or fullness, and peripheral edema. Hypotension may be present, although some patients may be hypertensive. The pericardial effusion is often moderate or large. (See

          Low-pressure
         </strong>
         – Low-pressure (occult) cardiac tamponade occurs in patients who are severely hypovolemic, so jugular venous distension may be absent. (See

          Monitoring

         – Monitoring is required for patients with pericardial effusion at risk for developing cardiac tamponade (prior to or following pericardial drainage). A patient with a pericardial effusion without cardiac tamponade, and in whom fluid sampling is not needed for diagnostic purposes, does not require pericardiocentesis and can be observed with serial clinical and echocardiographic follow-up. Patients who have undergone percutaneous or surgical drainage should generally be monitored with telemetry and frequent vital signs for 24 to 48 hours and subsequent clinical and echocardiographic follow-up to detect possibly recurrent fluid accumulation and identify signs of early constriction.
