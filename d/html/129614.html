         A novel coronavirus was identified in late 2019 that rapidly reached pandemic proportions. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
        </p>
        <p>
         In children, COVID-19 is usually mild. However, in rare cases, children can be severely affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. In April of 2020, reports from the United Kingdom and Italy documented a severe shock-like illness in children with features of incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) or toxic shock syndrome [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Subsequently, there have been reports of similarly affected children from most parts of the world [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-11
         </a>
         ]. The condition has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C; also referred to as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome [PMIS], pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 [PIMS-TS], pediatric hyperinflammatory syndrome, or pediatric hyperinflammatory shock). Understanding of COVID-19 and MIS-C continues to evolve.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management and prognosis of MIS-C are discussed here. The epidemiology, clinical features  (

          Inpatient management
         </strong>
         – Essentially all children who meet the case definition for MIS-C  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128201" href="/z/d/graphic/128201.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) are managed in the inpatient setting because they have multisystem involvement and are moderately to severely ill. In addition, we generally hospitalize children with clinical findings that strongly suggest a diagnosis of MIS-C while they are undergoing evaluation, even if their symptoms are relatively mild initially (eg, no hemodynamic instability). This is because children with MIS-C often have worsening of their clinical status as the illness progresses. However, practice varies regarding management of mild or equivocal cases, and other centers may not admit such patients but rather observe them closely in the outpatient setting. An underlying medical condition that may place the child at increased risk for complications (eg, immunodeficiency, cardiac or pulmonary conditions) also should be taken into consideration when deciding need for supportive care and treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The level of care (ward versus intensive care unit [ICU]) is determined by the severity of illness. Admission to an ICU is appropriate for children with hemodynamic instability (shock, arrhythmia), significant respiratory compromise, or other potentially life-threatening complications. In the available case series, approximately 60 to 80 percent of affected patients required ICU care [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,11-14
         </a>
         ], but this may change as milder cases come to attention.

         <strong>
          Outpatient observation
         </strong>
         – It is reasonable to observe select patients with mild symptoms in whom the diagnosis is suspected but not confirmed in the outpatient setting provided that the child is well appearing (ie, normal vital signs other than fever and reassuring physical examination) and close clinical follow-up can be assured. Such patients are typically those who have undergone evaluation for MIS-C because of nonspecific symptoms or findings (eg, fever, rash), who lack worrisome findings, and in whom the diagnosis of MIS-C is unlikely. Vaccination status should also be considered as MIS-C is quite unlikely in a child vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, children with more convincing findings who either meet diagnostic criteria for MIS-C  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128201" href="/z/d/graphic/128201.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) or in whom the diagnosis is strongly suspected should generally be hospitalized, even if the manifestations are mild initially. As described above, such patients are at risk for worsening of their clinical status as the illness progresses.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For children who are observed in the outpatient setting, it is critical to provide instructions for when to seek care and to ensure appropriate follow-up (see
         <a class="local">
          'Information for patients'
         </a>
         below). Most children should have follow-up within 24 to 48 hours if persistently febrile. Follow-up should include clinical assessment and repeat laboratory testing. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128190.html" rel="external">

         Limiting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 and COVID-19-related illnesses, including MIS-C. This includes identifying and isolating patients and their contacts with suspected COVID-19, universal source control (eg, covering the patient's nose and mouth with a mask to contain respiratory secretions), use of appropriate personal protective equipment when caring for patients with COVID-19, and environmental disinfection. Institutional infection control guidelines related to testing for COVID-19 and managing test positive patients should be followed. A detailed discussion of COVID-19-related infection control measures, including advice regarding visitors and family members, is provided separately. (See

         During the acute inflammatory phase of illness, children with cardiac involvement may present with hemodynamic compromise and can develop arrhythmias during their course of illness. Serial echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function and monitoring of brain natriuretic peptide and troponin levels can help guide therapy. Management focuses on supportive care to maintain hemodynamic stability and ensure adequate systemic perfusion. We suggest intravenous

         Continuous telemetry monitoring is essential so that arrhythmias are promptly detected and treated. Patients with severe LV dysfunction are treated with intravenous (IV) diuretics and inotropic agents, such as

         <a href="#rid17">
          17,20

         However, some children do have positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and may have active infection.

IVIG alone may be reasonable in the patient with mild disease (no evidence of cardiovascular dysfunction), especially if the patient has a preexisting condition that may warrant avoidance of glucocorticoids (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity). However, if the patient has persistent fevers and rising C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and/or ferritin despite treatment with IVIG, we suggest adding glucocorticoid therapy. If IVIG is not available, treating patients with systemic glucocorticoids alone is acceptable. (See

For patients with significant LV dysfunction, if there is concern that the patient will not tolerate the volume load of the full dose in a single infusion, it can be given in divided doses over two days. A second dose of IVIG is generally avoided because of the risk of volume overload and hemolytic anemia. (See

         ]. Disease severity was considerably higher in the US and French studies compared with the international study (eg, in the multicenter US and French studies, 45 to 60 percent of patients required vasopressors versus 12 percent in the international study; 40 to 47 percent had LV dysfunction versus 12 percent, respectively; and 8 to 20 percent required mechanical ventilation versus 1.5 percent, respectively). In addition, all patients in the French and multicenter US studies met CDC or WHO diagnostic criteria for MIS-C, whereas 20 percent of patients in the international study did not meet WHO criteria. Lastly, the outcomes differed among the studies. In the French study, the primary outcome was fever persistence at 48 hours or recrudescence within seven days following treatment. In the multicenter US study, the primary outcome was a composite of LV dysfunction or shock requiring vasopressor use on or two days after treatment. In the international study, the primary outcomes included a composite of inotropic support or mechanical ventilation by two days or later after treatment or death, as well as a reduction on an ordinal scale of clinical severity. These differences across the studies may explain the dissimilar findings.

Of these drugs, anakinra (5 to 10 mg/kg IV or subcutaneous daily for approximately three days, maximum dose 400 mg/day) and infliximab (5 to 10 mg/kg IV for one dose) are the most commonly used. The evidence supporting these drugs for MIS-C is limited to case series and to indirect evidence from studies of patients with similar hyperinflammatory conditions such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and KD. Of note, infliximab should not be used in patients with signs of MAS. We make decisions about the use of adjunctive therapies on a case-by-case basis, according to disease severity and markers of inflammation or active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Use of these agents should be guided by consultation with pediatric rheumatology and infectious disease specialists and should occur in the context of a clinical trial whenever possible. (See

Compared with IVIG alone, the combined therapy group had a higher percentage of patients with CA dilation and/or LV dysfunction on admission (71 versus 40 percent, respectively) and were more likely to have been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU; 56 versus 10 percent, respectively). After initial treatment, fewer patients who received IVIG and infliximab required additional therapy (31 versus 65 percent, respectively) or had new or worsening LV dysfunction (4 versus 20 percent, respectively). The patients on combination therapy also had a greater decrease in CRP levels at 24 and 48 hours after treatment initiation.

In addition, patients may be at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, due to hypercoagulability associated with COVID-19. (See

          Patients with less severe MIS-C

         – For hospitalized patients without indications for therapeutic anticoagulation who have less severe MIS-C (ie, patients managed in the general pediatric ward), the decision to administer an anticoagulant in addition to low-dose

          aspirin
         </a>
         for VTE prophylaxis is individualized, weighing the risk of thrombosis and risk of bleeding. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related MIS-C itself is an independent risk factor for VTE, occurring mainly in postpubertal children with MIS-C. Other important risk factors include the presence of a central venous catheter, underlying malignancy, prolonged immobility, obesity, oral contraceptive use, and family history of thrombophilia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122844" href="/z/d/graphic/122844.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). VTE prophylaxis is appropriate for most adolescents hospitalized with MIS-C, provided that bleeding risk is not high. In younger children, the decision is made on a case-by-case basis. When VTE prophylaxis is used, LMWH is generally the preferred agent. Prophylactic dosing of LMWH is summarized in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64075" href="/z/d/graphic/64075.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). Nonpharmacologic strategies for VTE prophylaxis (eg, intermittent pneumatic compression devices [size permitting] and early mobilization) are encouraged, but MIS-C-related coagulopathy may merit a higher level of intervention. The approach to VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized children is discussed in greater detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5916.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Our suggested approach is supported by limited observational data. In a retrospective study that included 138 children hospitalized for MIS-C, nine patients (6.5 percent) had documented thrombotic events, including upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis (n = 4), lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis (n = 3), intracardiac thrombus (n = 1), and acute ischemic stroke (n = 1) [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. All of these episodes occurred in adolescents ≥12 years old who had central venous catheters in place. Most of the affected patients (67 percent) were critically ill. Markedly elevated D-dimer (ie, more than five times the upper limit of normal) was an independent predictor of thrombosis. There was wide practice variation regarding the use and dosing of anticoagulant therapy in the study; overall, 58 percent of patients received thromboprophylaxis during their hospitalization. Thus, the incidence of thrombosis in this study may underestimate the true baseline risk of thrombosis in patients with MIS-C. Nevertheless, the rate of thrombosis in this study is considerably higher than in the general pediatric inpatient population (which is &lt;1 percent). (See

         For patients who had evidence of CA involvement or systolic dysfunction in the acute phase, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be considered at approximately two to six months after the acute illness to assess ventricular function and evaluate for edema, diffuse fibrosis, and scar by myocardial delayed enhancement.

Similar to other forms of myocarditis, when significant myocardial involvement is present in the acute phase (left ventricular [LV] systolic dysfunction, elevated troponin, or MRI evidence of myocardial edema/inflammation), follow-up cardiac MRI and exercise stress testing at approximately six months may help inform timing of return to full physical activity. Additionally, patients with myocardial involvement and arrhythmia should have follow-up ambulatory rhythm monitoring over the subacute and convalescent phases of illness. (See

         The prognosis of MIS-C requires further characterization but overall looks positive as most children have a full clinical recovery. However, long-term follow-up studies are limited. The disease course in MIS-C can be quite severe, with many children requiring intensive care interventions. The vast majority of children survive, but deaths have been reported [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,14,28

          28

         ]. In another case series of 2818 patients hospitalized for MIS-C from February 2020 to March 2021, of whom 35 died, odds of death were higher in 16 to 20 year olds compared with 6 to 11 year olds (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.8, 95% CI 2.7-17.1) and in those with at least one comorbidity (aOR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.9), most commonly neurologic disease or a noncardiac congenital abnormality [

          42
         </a>
         ]. Those with stroke, kidney failure, or liver failure were 38-, 12-, and 11-fold more likely, respectively, to die than those without the same complication. Of over 7400 cases reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by March 1, 2022, &lt;1 percent (n = 63) of patients had died [

          20,28,44-46
         </a>
         ]. In some reports, up to 20 percent of affected patients still had mildly depressed function at the time of hospital discharge, but, in a longer-term series, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and CA abnormalities had resolved in all patients by six months [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47

Additional findings included normalization of inflammatory markers by six weeks and cardiac and kidney function by six months in nearly all patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms, dysphonia, anosmia, and dysgeusia persisted in a small percentage of patients. Three patients were readmitted to the hospital for either MIS-C relapse or infectious complications (including pneumonia, urosepsis, and skin and soft tissue infection) during the follow-up period.

          Overview
         </strong>
         – Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The presentation is characterized by prominent cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and mucocutaneous symptoms  (

          Initial therapy
         </strong>
         – For most patients who meet diagnostic criteria for MIS-C, we suggest treatment with both intravenous
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">
          immune globulin
         </a>
         (IVIG) and glucocorticoids rather than either drug alone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). IVIG alone may be reasonable in the patient with mild disease (no evidence of cardiovascular dysfunction), especially if the patient has a preexisting condition that might warrant avoidance of glucocorticoids (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity). However, if the patient has persistent fevers and rising C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and/or ferritin despite treatment with IVIG, we suggest adding glucocorticoid therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). If IVIG is not available, treating patients with systemic glucocorticoids alone is acceptable. (See

          Therapy for refractory disease
         </strong>
         – Patients are considered refractory to initial therapy if they do not show improvement within 24 hours of treatment (eg, resolution of fever, improving organ function, decreasing levels of inflammatory markers). For patients with MIS-C who do not respond to

         </a>
         plus low-to-moderate dose glucocorticoids, we suggest pulse-dose glucocorticoid therapy,

          infliximab

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). A second dose of IVIG is generally avoided because of the risk of volume overload and hemolytic anemia. Consultation with pediatric infectious disease and rheumatology specialists is advised. (See

          Prevention of thrombotic complications
         </strong>
         – Patients with MIS-C are at increased risk of thrombosis. The optimal approach to thromboprophylaxis in this setting is uncertain, and practice varies considerably. Our general approach is as follows  (

          Patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction

         – For patients who do not have any of the above listed indications for therapeutic anticoagulation but who have severe MIS-C manifestations requiring immobilization, central lines, and PICU care, we suggest administering an anticoagulant at prophylactic dosing, provided that bleeding risk is not high (

          Patients with less severe MIS-C

         – For hospitalized patients without indications for therapeutic anticoagulation who have less severe MIS-C (ie, patients managed on the general pediatric ward), the decision to administer an anticoagulant in addition to low-dose

         for VTE prophylaxis is individualized, weighing the risks and benefits. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related MIS-C itself is an independent risk factor for VTE, occurring mainly in postpubertal children with MIS-C. The approach to VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized children is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         – Long-term follow-up data are limited, but the prognosis of MIS-C looks positive as most children have a full clinical recovery. The overall mortality rate is approximately 1 to 2 percent. Most children with cardiac involvement have recovery of function by hospital discharge. Children with cardiac dysfunction should have follow-up with cardiology after discharge. (See
