It is the most common monogenic disorder in non-Hispanic White people of Northern European descent, with a carrier frequency of 1in 24 to 1 in 25 and birth prevalence of 1 in 2500. Carrier screening is offered to people planning pregnancy or in early pregnancy to identify couples at risk of conceiving a child with classic CF.</p><p>This topic will review CF carrier screening and reproductive options for carrier couples, including prenatal diagnosis. Other issues related to CF are discussed separately, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6367.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6368.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CF MUTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CF is caused by mutations (also called pathogenic variants) in a single large gene on chromosome 7. This gene encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which regulates chloride channel function of epithelial cells of the sweat gland, airway, pancreas, and intestine. </p><p>Clinical disease occurs when disease-causing pathogenic variants are present in both copies of the <em>CFTR</em> gene. The two inherited pathogenic variants may be the same (homozygote) or different (compound heterozygote). Over 2100 different mutations in the <em>CFTR</em> gene have been identified [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], although the vast majority of <em>CFTR</em> pathogenic variants occur at frequencies less than 1 in 1000 (&lt;0.1 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The specific pathogenic variants that an individual carries are a major determinant of clinical severity. The range of clinical expression likely reflects the degree to which protein function is changed by the mutation, modulation of the phenotype by other genes, and variation in susceptibility to environmental factors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6368.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H344023054"><span class="h2">CFTR mutation prevalence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mutation types and carrier frequencies vary among populations, as shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58715" href="/z/d/graphic/58715.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The highest carrier frequency is observed in non-Hispanic White individuals and individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, of whom 1 in 29 carries a <em>CFTR</em> pathogenic variant. The delta F508 deletion-<em>CFTR</em> accounts for a large proportion of disease-causing alleles in White (70 percent), Hispanic (46 percent), African American (48 percent), Ashkenazi Jewish (30 percent) and Asian (30 percent) populations. Some Native American populations, specifically Pueblo and Zuni people, have <em>CFTR</em> mutation carrier rates (1 in 3970 and 1 in 1580, respectively); however, their pathogenic variants do not involve delta F508.</p><p>Among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the most common mutation is W1282X (accounting for 46 percent of all CF cases); other common mutations are F508del-CFTR, G542X, 3849+10kb C&gt;T, and N1303K, which together with W1282X account for 94 to 97 percent of CF cases [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Among individuals with ethnic origins in Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, or Libya, <em>CFTR</em> mutation carrier rates range from 1 in 24 to 1 in 29; for those with ethnic origins in Iran or Iraq, the carrier rate is 1 in 90.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF SCREENING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H388228965"><span class="h2">Benefits</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preconception or prenatal carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis of CF have several potential benefits:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Couples at increased risk of having a child with CF can be identified so that they can make an informed decision about their reproductive options. (See <a class="local">'Reproductive options for carrier couples'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Couples can be educated about CF before the birth of an affected child, and they can better prepare for the birth. Such preparation is largely psychological, since the management of prenatal care, labor, and delivery is not changed by the prenatal diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prenatal diagnosis of CF allows the pediatricians caring for the neonate to perform additional tests that might recognize a CF-related problem earlier. For example, prenatal diagnosis of CF in fetuses with echogenic bowel can facilitate diagnosis and treatment of neonatal meconium ileus, which is the earliest clinical manifestation of CF, occurring in 10 to 20 percent of fetuses with the disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most newborns with CF are asymptomatic; without neonatal screening for CF, the average age at diagnosis is 2.9 years. All 50 states in the United States include CF in their newborn screening panel; therefore, waiting for results from neonatal screening is another reasonable option for carriers who definitely would not terminate an affected pregnancy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Newborn screening is less costly than prenatal diagnosis and avoids the small risk of pregnancy loss associated with invasive procedures for definitive fetal diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6367.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Meconium ileus and distal ileal obstruction'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6367.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Newborn screening'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is possible that, in the future, early detection of the CF variant may provide an opportunity for in utero gene therapy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4243271370"><span class="h2">Limitations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Limitations and challenges of carrier screening for CF include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prenatal risk assessment is limited in some ethnic groups because the specific mutations responsible for CF in these groups are incompletely understood or unknown [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In addition, many people are of mixed ancestry, making selection of an appropriate panel of mutations for screening difficult. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although CF screening provides an opportunity to obtain important information about a current or future pregnancy, the information can also provoke significant and prolonged anxiety because of the inability to reliably predict phenotype after a positive screen, the inability of a negative screen to reliably exclude clinical disease in all cases, and the improving prognosis for individuals with CF (median survival &gt;50 years for individuals born after 2000 [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Once an individual is identified as carrying a CF mutation, family members may learn that they are at increased risk of being a carrier even though they might not have wanted this information.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">CANDIDATES FOR SCREENING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We offer CF screening to <strong>all</strong> couples actively planning pregnancy and all pregnant people regardless of personal or family history or ethnicity, in accordance with guidelines from several professional organizations [<a href="#rid6">6,8,9</a>]. Counseling and screening are ideally performed before conception but can be done in the first or early second trimester.</p><p>Risk factors for carrying the CF mutation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Positive personal or family history of CF</strong> – Couples in whom one or both partners have a personal or family history of CF (first-degree relative [son, daughter, sibling, mother, father] or second-degree relative [aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, grandparent]) are at high risk of carrying a CF mutation. A modified screening strategy may be appropriate for these couples. (See <a class="local">'Couples with a personal or family history of CF'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Race and ethnicity</strong> – Non-Hispanic White individuals and individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent have higher carrier rates (1 in 29)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58715" href="/z/d/graphic/58715.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), whereas African American, Hispanic, and Asian individuals have lower carrier rates (1 in 60 to 1 in 65, 1 in 46, and 1 in 90, respectively), and they may have different <em>CFTR</em> mutations than the most common mutations included in the standard panel.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because mixed ethnicity is common, it is important that all couples understand that CF screening is most accurate for non-Hispanic White people of Northern European descent and those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent since a high proportion of disease in these groups is attributable to common identifiable mutations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55196" href="/z/d/graphic/55196.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Individuals of other ethnic backgrounds may not have as great a benefit from current standard CF screening tests if their carrier rate is low or if common CF-causing mutations have not been identified in their ethnic group and therefore are not included in the screening panel. Although couples of ethnicities with low carrier rates may decide to forego testing for this reason, this information and the option for testing should be presented to these patients. (See <a class="local">'Negative screen'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Findings on ultrasound examination</strong> – In couples who decline preconception or early pregnancy carrier screening, visualization of echogenic bowel in the second trimester, particularly with dilated bowel and a nonvisualized gallbladder [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], is another indication for offering carrier screening or, for carrier couples, fetal diagnostic testing. Sonographic evidence of echogenic fetal bowel in the second trimester has been associated with CF (risk of approximately 1 percent), as well as other fetal disorders. This subject is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/420.html" rel="external">"Fetal echogenic bowel"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H344022607"><span class="h1">CARRIER TEST SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because over 2100 different mutations in the CF gene have been identified, it is not possible to screen for all known mutations. The key to effective CF screening is determining which mutations should be included in the screening panel. This requires knowledge of the most common <em>CFTR </em>mutations in the general population and in individuals of specific ethnic groups. For couples with an affected family member, it requires knowledge of the specific mutations identified in that relative.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H434305174"><span class="h2">Standard panel</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most CF testing laboratories screen for a specific panel of mutations with a frequency of at least 0.1 percent in the North American population [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]; the current standard CF targeted screening panel includes, at a minimum, 23 of the more common mutations in this group<strong> </strong> (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65637" href="/z/d/graphic/65637.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Although the standard panel performs well [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], sensitivity varies in different populations. The following carrier detection rates by racial/ethnic group have been reported for this panel in the United States: people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (94 percent), non-Hispanic White people (88 percent), Hispanic White people (72 percent), African American people (64 percent), Asian American people (49 percent) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Among these groups, Asian American people have the lowest proportion of detectable mutations and the lowest birth prevalence of CF, which makes them least likely to benefit from prenatal carrier testing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1808046404"><span class="h3">Reflex testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In two situations, additional "reflex" testing will also be done. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the test identifies F508del-CFTR or F507del, the result could be a false positive due to variant codons at positions 506, 507, or 508. Accordingly, when F508del-CFTR or F507del are identified, the sample is specifically tested for the variant codons I506V, I507V, and F508C to clarify the risk of having an actual (pathogenic) CF mutation and thus the full CF phenotype. Identification of a variant suggests a false positive. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the test identifies the R117H mutation, this mutation can cause classic CF if it is on the same chromosome as a mutation consisting of an intronic poly-T tract, called the 5T variant, located in a noncoding region of the CF gene, <strong>and</strong> there is a CF mutation on the other chromosome. The outcome of the R117H with other poly-T sizes (7T, 9T) and a second disease-causing <em>CFTR</em> mutation can be quite variable, ranging from no symptoms to mild lung disease. However, if an R117H mutation is on one chromosome and the 5T variant is on the other chromosome, or any of several other arrangements, and the fetus is male, the likelihood of having congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) is significantly increased  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81257" href="/z/d/graphic/81257.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). To resolve these possibilities, when R117H is identified, additional testing for the 5T/7T/9T variants is performed and, if possible, the cis/trans location of the alleles is determined.</p><p></p><p>Additional information on genetic testing for carriers can be obtained from the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cff.org%2F&amp;token=R4Uiw8%2FbmPVaqNHRDqpXLFjyqvU35kZn0R9%2B2RF%2BaoU%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=463" target="_blank">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</a>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H434305180"><span class="h2">Expanded panel</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For individuals of non-White, non-Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicities, an expanded screening panel could theoretically provide a higher carrier detection rate than the standard panel [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, determining which CF mutations to add to the standard panel can be difficult since, in these populations, CF mutation types and frequencies and their clinical significance are not well understood. For this reason, commercially available panethnic expanded panels may not have higher sensitivity than the standard panel, and may include mutations of unclear clinical significance, which make prediction of the phenotype of offspring problematic. (See <a class="local">'Prediction of phenotype'</a> below.)</p><p>In cases in which the standard screening panel has identified a CF mutation in one partner, some clinicians offer the expanded panel to the other partner to improve identification of couples at risk of having an affected child.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H434305291"><span class="h2">CFTR sequencing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>CFTR</em> sequencing is not appropriate for routine carrier screening. It is generally performed in patients with a family history of CF but whose family test results are not available and either ethnicity is other than non-Hispanic White person of North European ancestry or standard carrier screening test results are negative. <em>CFTR</em> sequencing may also be considered for prenatal screening when one partner is known to be a CF carrier and the other partner is unavailable for screening, testing the other partner would be too expensive, the partner's results would not be available in time to assist decision making, or the pregnant person is undergoing amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling for some other reason [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>Full genomic sequencing is the most thorough method for identifying CF mutations; however, even genomic sequencing cannot identify all CF mutations, and all mutations in the <em>CFTR</em> gene do not result in classic CF. One study of individuals with CF reported that, in approximately 10 percent of cases, the responsible CF mutations could not be identified after comprehensive <em>CFTR</em> analysis that included deletion/duplication analysis and extensive sequencing [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Prediction of phenotype'</a> below.)</p><p>In the past, the main drawback to <em>CFTR</em> sequencing was the cost, so it was used primarily for cases in which an individual met clinical criteria for CF but standard screening did not identify CF mutations. Many genetic testing companies in the United States now offer <em>CFTR</em> sequencing at a price comparable to or lower than the cost of the standard or expanded screening panel, although the cost of the test may not be covered by all insurance carriers. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">SCREENING STRATEGIES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H344022705"><span class="h2">Couples with no personal or family history of CF</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Single partner screening</strong> – The least expensive and probably most widely used screening strategy is to offer the 23 mutation targeted testing panel to the person who will be or is pregnant [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The risk of an affected child is calculated based on this person's positive or negative test result  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71503" href="/z/d/graphic/71503.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) and the background carrier rate for their partner's ethnicity. Some couples will be reassured by this estimate and will not request screening of the other partner, especially if the only goal of screening is to determine if the child is at high risk of being affected. This approach is also appropriate when the biologic father is unavailable for testing or is unknown. (See <a class="local">'Father unavailable'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Couples who conceive using donor gametes can be reassured that donors identified through the health care system usually undergo genetic screening and are screen negative, thus testing of the "partner" has already been done; however, this should be confirmed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Serial screening</strong> – The next least expensive screening strategy (called serial screening) is to screen the person who will be or is pregnant first. If this person is screen negative, the child is assumed to be at low risk, and the partner is not offered screening. If this person is screen positive, the partner is screened using the standard panel, and the risk of an affected child is then calculated. For partners whose ethnicity requires testing for less common mutations, or for the reasons stated above, an expanded panel or <em>CFTR</em> sequencing may improve sensitivity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Couple screening</strong> – The most expensive, accurate, and efficient approach is to screen both members of the couple at the same time (called couple screening) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This method is most appropriate for couples who need to know their risk of having an affected child rapidly and cannot wait for results from serial screening, for couples who want the most accurate risk assessment of having an affected child, and for couples who want to use their results to inform their siblings about their potential CF carrier status.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H344022263"><span class="h2">Couples with a personal or family history of CF</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ideally, when a family member has confirmed CF, other family members should be screened by the same laboratory that tested the affected relative [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

If both parents were <em>CFTR</em> mutation carriers and each carried a different mutation, or if the maternal and paternal mutations were the same but were closely linked to polymorphisms that could distinguish the two, then excluding the paternal mutation in the cell-free DNA sample would indicate that the fetus was not affected (would either be a heterozygote carrying the mother's mutation or would be mutation-free). If the paternal mutation was present in the sample, techniques to determine if the fetus also inherited the maternal mutation would have to be employed.
