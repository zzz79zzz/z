         Food allergy is estimated to affect up to 8 percent of children in the United States and is an emerging public health issue globally [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>

        <p>
         The most common food allergies in childhood are cow's milk, hen's eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, and soy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,7
         </a>
         ]. Peanut allergy is of particular concern in the United States because it is implicated in fatal reactions more than any other food [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10
         </a>
         ]. However, many foods can cause life-threatening allergic reactions [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. It is crucial for medical professionals to understand the challenge that this disorder presents [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The avoidance strategies in place to keep a food-allergic child safe will often impact the entire classroom of children, particularly in younger age groups.

         The safe management of food allergies in school and camp settings has become a prominent issue for many children and their caregivers and communities. The following observations about food allergy are especially relevant:

         In a survey of 400 elementary school nurses, 44 percent reported an increase in children with food allergies in their schools over a five-year period; only 2 percent reported a decrease [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. More than one-third of the nurses reported having 10 or more students with food allergies. The school nurses ranked the challenge of managing food allergies on par with other serious health concerns, such as diabetes. In a study of 170 camps representing 122,424 campers in the US and Canada, 2.5 percent of campers had documented food allergies, although only 39.7 percent brought an

         ]. In another survey of leaders from 258 camps, 24 percent reported having anaphylaxis treated with epinephrine at their camp over the prior two years [

         Sending a child with food allergy to daycare or school can be terrifying to parents/caregivers. They must trust that others will be vigilant in helping their child avoid ingestion of the allergen and respond to symptoms of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. In addition, the widespread misunderstanding of food allergy among the general population [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ] may result in both resentment from other parents/caregivers and fear and confusion on the part of staff members. Additionally, school personnel may lack sufficient knowledge about food allergy and anaphylaxis management, although educational programs may help close the gap [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-23

         Avoidance of a food allergen is challenging. In addition to the food served in the cafeteria, there are snacks in classrooms and on the playground. Food items are used for classroom activities, such as art projects, cooking lessons, and math instruction. Examples include craft projects, such as rolling pine cones in peanut butter to make bird feeders, using empty milk containers to create cities, using candy as counting items in math class, or using peanuts in science class. In addition, school supplies may contain hidden allergens: Modeling clay can contain wheat, and egg white may be used to smooth finger paints. Holiday celebrations, birthday parties, and other special events traditionally involve food items prepared at home by the caregivers of non-food-allergic children. (See

         Insight into the nature of food-allergic reactions in schools has been provided by the following studies [

         Although allergic reactions induced by food in schools are not rare, preparation for managing them is often inadequate [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,25,26
         </a>
         ]. In a telephone survey of 80 schools and the parents of 132 food-allergic children, 39 percent of schools reported at least one food-allergic reaction during the prior two years [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In the same period, 58 percent of food-allergic students experienced a reaction at school, and, of those, 30 percent did not have clinician's instructions or medication available at school at the time of their reaction. Preparation for management of food-allergic reactions in schools may differ by socioeconomic status [

         Cow's milk and peanut are leading causes of school reactions in the United States. In one study, milk was reported to be the most common cause of allergic reactions in the preschool setting and peanut the leading cause in children in the kindergarten through high-school years [

         use in Massachusetts schools over a two-year period (2001 to 2003) reported 115 administrations of epinephrine [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>

         A significant percentage of children were not known to have food allergy upon entering school and had their initial food-allergic reaction at school. Two studies found that 25 percent of the food allergy reactions in the schools were initial reactions [

         Peanut is the food most often implicated in fatal reactions, although any immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated food allergy has the potential to cause severe or fatal reactions [

          9,10

         <a href="#rid6">
          6,29

         ]. Possible contributing factors that are also risk-taking behaviors associated with adolescence include reduced diligence in avoidance of allergens and delay in using or not carrying self-injectable

         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. As a group, the respondents felt that education of their peers about food allergy would help them cope better with having food allergy. Thus, one strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality in this age group might be increased education on a school-wide basis.

         Strict avoidance of the causative food is critical for avoiding an allergic reaction. However, absolute avoidance is extremely difficult, making accidental exposures almost inevitable [

School nurses may not be available for children at risk, so training of non-nursing staff is key [

         Food allergy management requires a school-wide approach that may have many facets to ensure allergen avoidance and prompt recognition and treatment of reactions [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,34
         </a>
         ]. In addition, individual students may be provided with an Individualized Health Plan (IHP) addressing daily management. Food allergy may also qualify as a disability under the US federal disability law, and a Section 504 plan or Individualized Education Plan (IEP) can be written to provide accommodations, if needed. The nature of the care to be provided may vary among individual children depending upon their allergies, age, and developmental abilities. As an example, a six-year-old child with severe peanut allergy who may take another child’s food may need more supervision than a 12-year-old child with the same allergy.

         All individuals on the school or camp staff should understand food allergy, should be able to recognize symptoms and respond to a reaction, and should be vigilant and proactive in eliminating food allergens from the allergic student's meals, educational tools, arts and crafts projects, or incentives. In particular, food service staff must understand how to provide safe, allergen-free meals, including appropriate substitutions, when children with food allergies are obtaining meals from the cafeteria.
        </p>
        <p>
         Generally, school or camp nurses conduct training sessions prior to the start of the school year or camp term. During these sessions, relevant staff members can review information about the food-allergic child, treatment protocols, reading food labels, and other risk-reduction strategies designed to keep the child safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nurses and other staff members should be trained in the proper use of

         </a>
         injectors. They should have access to training devices and should practice using them so that they are confident and capable of administering epinephrine quickly and properly. All staff members should know where epinephrine autoinjectors are stored and should either be trained or be aware of another staff member who has been trained and will be reliably available. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epinephrine location'

        </p>

         Staff should contact the local municipal emergency response team and find out if ambulances in the area are equipped with

          epinephrine

         and if the attendants are allowed to administer it. Emergency teams differ in this respect, and schools should summon a team that is able to provide this treatment when possible. They should also notify the response team periodically that there are students at the school with life-threatening food allergies. If none of the local emergency teams are able to administer epinephrine, we suggest informing the child's parent/caregiver of this in writing so that the situation is properly addressed.

         Bullying, particularly at school, is a common problem faced by children with food allergies that can have a negative impact on quality of life. School staff should adopt a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, have a plan for quickly handling any reports of this behavior, and institute programs to combat bullying [

         A survey of parents of children with food allergy and of teens and young adults with food allergy (n = 353) showed that 24 percent (or 35 percent of participants over age five years) had been victims of bullying, teasing, or harassment [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. The majority of victims were male (61 percent). The most common trigger for this behavior was simply the individual having a food allergy (79 percent). Other cited causes included their carrying medications, sitting at separate tables, or having other forms of special treatment. The teasing, harassment, and bullying occurred multiple times for most of these individuals (86 percent), primarily in the school settings (82 percent) by classmates (80 percent). Unfortunately, one-fifth of those bullied, teased, or harassed were subjected to this behavior by school staff members. The children and young adults were verbally teased and physically threatened with the food to which they are allergic. Two-thirds of respondents reporting consequences indicated that they or their child felt sad, depressed, and embarrassed or humiliated because of the teasing, bullying, and harassment.

        <p>
         Similar results were found in another survey of parents and children aged 8 to 17 years with food allergy, with 25 percent of parents and 32 percent of children reporting bullying due to food allergy [

Food allergy-related bullying often persists but is less likely to if action is taken, primarily by informing school personnel [

         ]. However, in one study, 33 percent of parents who were aware of bullying did not inform the school [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48

         A number of strategies for managing food allergies in schools have been devised, although none have been validated. Approaches vary depending on the size of the school, whether or not there is a full-time nurse, the proximity to emergency rescue services (rural versus urban), and the number and age of the students with food allergies. Below are some of the policies that are commonly adopted:

         In several respects, the management of food allergy in the camp setting is similar to that in school. Camp staff must be educated in the recognition and treatment of food allergies and anaphylaxis [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. A personalized food allergy action plan should be provided for each child.
        </p>
        <p>
         Selecting a camp that can monitor food and work with the parents/caregivers to identify risks to the child is critical for success. Parents/caregivers should discuss their child's food allergies with camp staff as they are choosing a camp. Ideally, the camp should have a full-time nurse and easy access to a medical facility. The parents/caregivers of the allergic camper are an excellent source of information and guidance for developing a plan for a safe camp experience. Other issues are specific for the camp setting and may vary according to the type and size of the camp and the severity of the camper's allergies. Guidelines for managing food allergies at camp have been published  (

        <p>

        <p>
         Special considerations are needed for overnight trips and travel to remote areas, such as bringing extra supplies of safe food for the allergic camper and ample supplies of medications needed to treat a reaction. The supervising staff member should carry a well-charged cell phone and assure that the group will remain in cell phone-accessible territory.

         Some parents/caregivers provide food for their child to minimize the chances of a reaction. For campers staying overnight, parents/caregivers can ship or personally deliver food at the beginning of each week. The food should be clearly labeled with the child's name and cabin information.
        </p>
        <p>
         For children eating camp-provided food, strategies for minimizing risks include separating and labeling "safe" products in the kitchen with stickers so that food can be prepared and served without cross-contamination. Alternatively, if the allergic camper must avoid certain dishes, then allowing that child to be the first in the buffet line and discouraging return trips through the food line for "seconds" should help reduce the risk of a reaction from cross-contact through serving utensils.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sharing of care packages of homemade foods should be avoided by those with food allergies, unless prepared by their own parents/caregivers. Children with food allergies should only consider eating food from care packages if it is commercially prepared and an ingredients list is provided on the packaging.

         </span>
         School staff and parents/caregivers may decide to institute peanut-free policies, excluding peanut from schools, specific classrooms, or tables. School-wide bans are particularly controversial because of issues such as a potential false sense of security, difficulty in enforcement, impact on unaffected children, and attention to some food allergens and not others [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. Unfortunately, reactions have been reported in schools with active peanut (or tree nut) bans, indicating that bans are not sufficient to protect allergic children from exposure [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,50
         </a>
         ]. In a study of Massachusetts public schools, allergic reactions were still reported in all schools with "peanut-free" policies [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Although a number of peanut-free policies were used, schools with peanut-free tables compared with those without this restriction had lower rates of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">
          epinephrine
         </a>
         administration (2 versus 6 per 100,000 students). Guidelines emphasize that additional safety measures must be in place, even if schools choose to ban specific foods from a classroom or school [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. A 2021 practice guideline suggested as a conditional recommendation (level of evidence graded as very low certainty) that schools not prohibit specific foods site-wide and not establish allergen-restricted zones except in special circumstances, such as having students who by age or developmental capacity have limitations in self-management [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We favor an approach based upon education and cooperation from the entire school community, rather than blanket bans of certain foods. However, bans (in particular allergen-safe tables with increased supervision) are an option for younger children and in specific circumstances. The specific recommendations presented previously should be effective in preventing the majority of reactions and successfully managing the rest. We are not in favor of isolation of the child with food allergy from social settings. (See

         </a>
         , depending upon local policies. We encourage school staff to recognize that permission to carry is not equivalent to delegation of responsibility solely to the child to self-treat. A survey of caregivers of children with food allergy indicated that they thought children can have responsibility to self-treat with epinephrine starting at approximately age 6 to 11 years [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ], while a survey of allergists thought this transition should be at approximately ages 12 to 14 years [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. A survey of 123 caregivers showed that 45 percent thought age 9 to 11 years was an appropriate age range for education about self-injection of epinephrine, but almost half of the caregivers lacked confidence in doing this training [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Ultimately, an adult should be assigned responsibility for ensuring prompt treatment with epinephrine when it is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the event that the food-allergic child is not mature/responsible enough to carry their own

          epinephrine

         , every effort should be made to ensure that epinephrine is kept in a secure but unlocked location known to all staff members and accessible within minutes. This sometimes involves epinephrine being "handed off" from teacher to teacher or between camp staff as the child changes locations throughout the day.

         A focus on avoidance of ingestion of the allergen is key because ingestion is more likely than skin or inhalation exposure to cause anaphylaxis [

          33,49

         ]. The cheese fell down the back of his shirt, resulting in scratching at the skin and cheese and bleeding, which was presumed to have increased systemic exposure and resulted in anaphylaxis. Although most anaphylaxis is related to allergen ingestion, several factors played a role in this exceptional, tragic case including an unusual amount of skin exposure, delayed use of

         Act was signed into law in the United States. This act encourages states to adopt laws requiring schools to have "stock" epinephrine autoinjectors on hand. Several studies have underscored the benefit of having stock epinephrine autoinjectors available. In a Chicago survey of school district-issued epinephrine autoinjectors, 55 percent were administered for first-time anaphylaxis [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>

         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. The benefits of stock epinephrine also include expanding availability to those unable to afford the devices. A 2021 practice guideline noted that implementation of stock epinephrine could supplant the need for individually assigned epinephrine autoinjectors (which could then be optional) [

         Children with life-threatening food allergies are protected under federal civil rights laws, such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60,61
         </a>
         ]. This is because a severe food allergy meets the legal definition of a "disability" (ie, a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities [such as eating or breathing]).
        </p>
        <p>
         The spirit of these two federal laws is essentially the same: to prevent discrimination on the basis of a disability. The major difference between the laws lies in their application: Section 504 applies to public schools and other institutions that receive federal funding. The ADA, however, typically applies to institutions that are privately run, such as private child care centers, preschools, private schools, and privately run recreational camps.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under these laws, schools cannot turn away a child based on the child's food allergies or the school's perceived inability to manage the food allergies. According to the law, facilities must address the health and safety needs of the child with a disability and must provide accommodations to ensure that the child participates safely and equally in all normal facets of the program, including classroom activities, field trips, and eating in the cafeteria [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Similar legislation has been put into effect in other countries. In Ontario, Canada, an Act to Protect Anaphylactic Pupils (Sabrina's Law), which established minimum standards for managing anaphylaxis in schools, was enacted in 2006 [

         </a>
         ]. In addition, most states have "Good Samaritan" laws, which are designed to protect individuals from liability who render emergency assistance in good faith, with no expectation of payment, and who transfer care of the patient to appropriate medical personnel (eg, emergency medical technicians, the school nurse) as soon as possible. Furthermore, some states have enacted Good Samaritan laws that specifically cover epinephrine administration.

          Overview
         </strong>
         – Food allergy affects up to 8 percent of school-age children and is increasing in prevalence. Policies to keep food-allergic children safe often affect all members of the student body and staff within a given setting. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Reactions in schools
         </strong>
         – Food is ubiquitous in most schools, and reactions can occur in unexpected places. Allergic reactions to food are not rare, with approximately 40 percent of schools reporting at least one event in the previous two years. Approximately one-quarter of these reactions occur in children not previously recognized to have food allergy. Milk and peanut are leading causes of school reactions in the United States. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Characteristics of reactions in schools'

         <strong>
          Avoidance
         </strong>
         – Strict avoidance of the allergy-causing food is extremely difficult. Patients often develop reactions from foods they thought were safe. For these reasons, reactions are virtually inevitable, and schools and similar settings must have plans in place for effective emergency management. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy of avoidance'

         <strong>
          Institutional food allergy management plan
         </strong>
         – The food allergy management plan of a school or camp should include policies regarding where food is allowed, where medications are stored, and protocols for contacting emergency services and parents/caregivers during a reaction  (
