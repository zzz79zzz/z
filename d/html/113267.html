         The upper genitourinary (GU) tract consists of the kidneys (parenchyma, collecting system) and ureters. The kidneys are the most commonly injured GU organ. While ureteral injury is very rare, when it occurs, it is usually associated with other severe injuries. Younger males (mean age approximately 30 years) are predominantly affected.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of GU tract injuries requires clinical knowledge pertaining to each GU organ to avoid unwanted outcomes (eg, loss of renal function, urinary incontinence, difficulty voiding) and secondary psychosocial stressors. Coordination of care among general/trauma surgeons, urologists, orthopedic surgeons, and other services is essential to improve overall outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of the evaluation and management of upper genitourinary tract injuries will be reviewed here. Management of individual upper GU organ injuries is reviewed separately. (See

         Injury to the genitourinary system is overall uncommon, with an estimated incidence of &lt;1 percent [

         The initial evaluation of the abdominal trauma patient commonly uses focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST exam) and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The FAST exam is useful in hemodynamically unstable patients to identify the immediate need for abdominal exploration. While the exam is useful in the emergency room to evaluate for hemoperitoneum, important renal injuries can be missed [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ], and it does not identify ureteral injury.

         The primary and secondary survey should identify individuals with findings suggestive of upper genitourinary (GU) tract injury. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/354.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         For trauma patients with indications for immediate laparotomy (eg, hemodynamically unstable), the diagnosis of upper GU tract injury will often be made during exploration. For others, radiographic imaging is recommended in those with appropriate clinical features (eg, blunt abdominal trauma and gross hematuria, deceleration injury, penetrating trajectory) to confirm and grade the injury [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. Knowledge of entry/exit wounds following penetrating abdominal trauma is important to guide regions of the body that require imaging. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16214.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of injury to the kidneys or ureters in hemodynamically stable patients relies on GU tract imaging, typically using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis (ie, CT pyelography, CT urography). It is important to note that the protocols for these studies differ from the typical contrast-enhanced study obtained for abdominal trauma. The appropriate performance of CT pyelography and CT urography is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115553.html" rel="external">

         Renal injury – An appropriate mechanism of injury (eg, rapid deceleration injury, direct blow to the back or flank), hemodynamic instability, and presence of hematuria should increase suspicion for significant renal trauma. Physical exam findings such as flank ecchymosis should alert treating providers to possible renal injury. The degree of hematuria cannot predict the severity of renal injury, highlighting the need for kidney imaging [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Findings on CT scan indicative of renal injury include subcapsular hematoma, perirenal hematoma, renal pelvis rupture, parenchymal laceration with or without collecting system injury, intravenous contrast extravasation from the renal artery or vein, or nonvisualization of a portion of or the entire kidney. (See

         Ureteral injury – Flank pain, hematuria, and/or flank ecchymosis or posterior rib or spine fractures should increase suspicion for ureteral injury [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Hematuria is an unreliable finding following ureteric trauma. There are no signs that are pathognomonic for ureteral injury. Some patients will not have any external signs to suggest a ureter injury. As such, a high index of suspicion (eg, deceleration injury) is necessary to identify the presence of ureteral injuries. Findings on CT that suggest ureteral injury include nonvisualization of the ureter, contrast extravasation from the ureter, ipsilateral hydronephrosis, and poor renal excretion localized to one side. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115553.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         When new symptoms of fever, flank pain, sepsis, or ileus occur following initial trauma stabilization, clinicians should be mindful to assess for a potential missed upper GU tract injury, particularly ureteral injury, which is difficult to diagnose.

         Following trauma, upper GU tract injury needs to be distinguished from lower GU tract injury (ie, bladder, urethra), particularly since both are associated with hematuria. Often the mechanism of injury or penetrating injury tract will aid with increasing or decreasing suspicion of one over the other. Imaging studies will identify the origin of the injury, though at times both the upper and lower GU tract may be injured, more likely in association with pelvic fracture. (See

         For patients who are hemodynamically unstable or have other indications for laparotomy, exploration may identify the presence of a retroperitoneal hematoma. Whether to open the retroperitoneum (zone II) and explore the kidney depends upon the mechanism of injury (blunt, penetrating), whether the hematoma is expanding, and the presence and severity of other injuries  (

         During damage control surgery, an attempt should always be made to preserve the kidney. When the trauma service is the primary service, there should be a low threshold to consult urology for assistance for exploration of the upper GU tract when the clinical situation does not dictate nephrectomy as the only surgical option, since the urology service is more experienced with renal-preserving surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to renal exploration and possible nephrectomy, if indicated, the use of a one-shot intravenous pyelogram (IVP) in the operating room is controversial. The primary role of a one-shot IVP is to identify a normal contralateral kidney before renal exploration and possible nephrectomy. IVP has been recommended in the setting of hemodynamic instability when immediate laparotomy precludes preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging. When chosen, this study can be performed in the operating room; however, doing so can delay treatment. To perform this study, 2 mL/kg of renal contrast medium is given intravenously with a one-shot anteroposterior radiograph performed 10 minutes later (ie, urogram). Intraoperative IVP is not a sensitive test for urologic injury [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The clarity of the exam can be affected by massive fluid resuscitation, peripheral edema, and/or significant hypotension. In addition, when not performed on a routine basis, the test can be cumbersome and time consuming. As such, most trauma surgeons have abandoned this study, and it is becoming less used by urologists as well. As an alternative method to confirm a functioning contralateral kidney, we prefer to quickly evaluate the flow to the uninjured kidney by manual palpation of the contralateral renal pedicle to ensure a strong renal artery pulse.

         For patients taken to the operating room under emergency circumstances without imaging studies, and for whom the retroperitoneum was not explored, subsequent postoperative CT scan may be indicated to reduce the incidence of missed injuries [

         Blunt renal injury – Do not explore a contained, nonexpanding hematoma (zone II). Explore only an expanding hematoma or one that has failed alternative methods of hemorrhage control (angioembolization). Conservative management of nonexpanding renal hematoma is the same for blunt renal injury identified intraoperatively in the setting of concomitant trauma as for injury identified on imaging studies in hemodynamically stable patients [

         During exploratory laparotomy in the hemodynamically unstable patient, direct inspection of the ureters is the most sensitive method to assess the ureters when injury is suspected, particularly in those who had no, or inadequate, preoperative imaging. The use of intravenous dyes such as

         can be used at the time of direct inspection to assess for dye leakage along the ureter. Direct injection of the dye into the ureter is another method. Retrograde pyelography may be performed in equivocal cases, when possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         In cases of ureteral injury noted in patients with hemodynamic instability due to severe concomitant injuries, the ureter can be ligated with subsequent urinary drainage. (See

         Conservative management of upper genitourinary (GU) trauma includes supportive care, serial clinical evaluation, and laboratory monitoring, and may include a variety of minimally invasive techniques, such as angioembolization for renal parenchymal bleeding, or tube drainage procedures for urine leak.

        <p>
         The location of in-hospital care of patients with renal injury can vary across institutions. At our institution, trauma patients are admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU), where vital signs and clinical examinations can be monitored on an hourly basis. Serial laboratory studies (hematocrit levels) are monitored every six to eight hours initially and decreased in frequency as the patient's overall condition stabilizes.

        <p>
         Repeat contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging with 10-minute delays at 48 to 72 hours is recommended for patients with high-grade renal injuries or worsening clinical signs [

          21

         ]. Clinical signs during the period of observation that suggest a missed upper GU tract injury include progressively worsening flank pain, fever, persistent blood loss, abdominal distention, ileus, or hemodynamic instability. When indicated, surgical intervention should be undertaken expeditiously to minimize morbidity and mortality. (See

          Upper genitourinary injury
         </strong>
         – Injury to the genitourinary (GU) tract is overall uncommon. The kidneys are the most commonly injured GU organ. Ureteral trauma is very rare. Younger males are predominantly affected, and, while renal injuries are more commonly due to blunt trauma, most ureteral injuries are due to penetrating injury. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical features and diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Upper GU tract injury is suggested by an appropriate mechanism of injury and clinical signs (flank pain, gross hematuria, micro hematuria). The degree of hematuria does not predict the severity of renal injury. When new symptoms of fever, flank pain, sepsis, or ileus occur following initial trauma stabilization, clinicians should be mindful to assess for a potential missed upper GU tract injury, particularly ureteral injury, which is difficult to diagnose. (See

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – A diagnosis of renal or ureteral injury in hemodynamically stable patients relies on GU tract imaging, typically using contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with immediate and delayed imaging phases (ie, CT pyelography, CT urography). Protocols for these studies differ from the typical contrast-enhanced study obtained for abdominal trauma. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical features and diagnosis'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Approach to management
         </strong>
         – The initial approach to the trauma patient depends upon the clinical status of the patient, as well as the type and severity of injuries. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to management'
         </a>

          Conservative management
         </strong>
         – Hemodynamically stable patients with
         <strong>
          blunt
         </strong>
         renal trauma (all grades)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57943" href="/z/d/graphic/57943.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ) are managed conservatively  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ), which includes supportive care and serial evaluation and may include angioembolization for renal parenchymal bleeding, or tube drainage procedures for collecting system injuries. Conservative management of
         <strong>
          penetrating
         </strong>
         renal injury (typically low grade; American Association for the Surgery of Trauma [AAST] I, II, III) can be considered for selected patients. During a period of conservative care, surgical exploration may be necessary if bleeding continues or urinary extravasation worsens. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Conservative care'

         <strong>
          Surgical management
         </strong>
         – Whether to open the retroperitoneum and explore the kidney and ureters in hemodynamically unstable patients is based on the mechanism of injury (blunt, penetrating), whether the hematoma is expanding, and the presence and severity of other injuries  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115816" href="/z/d/graphic/115816.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Every effort should be made to salvage the kidneys. Prior to considering nephrectomy, we manually palpate the contralateral kidney to confirm its viability. There should be a low threshold to consult urology for assistance with renal exploration. Nephrectomy may be required despite efforts to salvage the kidney. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Exploration and repair'

         <strong>
          Blunt renal injury
         </strong>
         – For blunt renal injury, only an expanding perinephric hematoma or one that has failed alternative methods of hemorrhage control (eg, angioembolization) should be opened and explored. Surgical exploration is associated with high rates of kidney loss. Nonexpanding renal hematoma identified intraoperatively is managed conservatively.

         <strong>
          Penetrating renal injury
         </strong>
         – For penetrating renal injury, the kidneys should generally be explored if there is concern for injury (eg, active hemorrhage, expanding hematoma).
        </p>

         <strong>
          Collecting system injury
         </strong>
         – Although parenchymal collecting system injuries often resolve spontaneously, injuries to the renal pelvis, and ureteropelvic junction generally require some form of treatment using minimally invasive (stenting, tube drainage) or open reconstructive techniques (immediate or delayed).
        </p>
        <p>

         <strong>
          Ureteral injury
         </strong>
         – Most ureteral injuries occur in the setting of concomitant injuries that often require exploratory laparotomy. Direct inspection of the ureters is the most sensitive method to assess for ureteral injury. Immediate repair is preferred, if possible, but drainage and delay of definitive management may be necessary, particularly in the setting of severe concomitant injuries.
