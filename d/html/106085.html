The decision is based upon the clinical history, physical examination, and imaging studies, which determine the type of information that is desired (ie, cytological, histological, microbiological, immunocytochemical, cell counting), and location of the lesion or area of interest  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50508" href="/d/graphic/50508.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Multiple diagnostic procedures are often combined to increase the diagnostic yield. When this is done, bronchial washing is generally performed after brushing, endobronchial biopsy, and/or transbronchial biopsy in order to collect any diagnostic material that was dislodged by the brushing or biopsies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4400.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications", section on 'Diagnostic indications'</a>.)  </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Desired type of information</strong> – With respect to the type of information that is desired, the following should be considered:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cytological information can be obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), brushing, washings, and either transbronchial or endobronchial needle aspiration.

Endobronchial biopsy is the preferred sampling procedure for such lesions because it will provide histological information, whereas the other procedures provide only cytological and microbiological information. Cryobiopsy in this situation may provide a larger biopsy sample if available to the operator, with an added risk of bleeding. If the lesion is large or has a necrotic layer, however, the forceps are likely to grasp the necrotic surface and be nondiagnostic. Needle aspiration or needle core biopsy is a reasonable alternative in this situation because it may provide a good sample from deeper tissue. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89115.html" rel="external">"Procedures for tissue biopsy in patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Bronchoscopic approaches'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infiltrates, lesions, nodules, or areas of interest that are too distal to be visualized during the airway inspection can be sampled bronchoscopically by BAL, brushing, transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA), or transbronchial biopsy. BAL, TBNA, and brushing provide cytological and microbiological information, while transbronchial biopsy provides histological information about the lung parenchyma, including the distal airways and alveoli. Newer techniques that utilize imaging or navigational technology to biopsy peripheral nodules enhance the diagnostic yield but are limited to centers with expertise. Transbronchial cryobiopsies can provide a larger sample with an added risk of bleeding, which is beneficial in the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89115.html" rel="external">"Procedures for tissue biopsy in patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Enhanced, image-guided bronchoscopic techniques'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96531.html" rel="external">"Image-guided bronchoscopy for biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4385.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial ultrasound: Technical aspects", section on 'Parenchymal lesions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Masses or lymph nodes adjacent to an airway (ie, paratracheal, peribronchial or hilar) can be sampled via transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA). EBUS guided TBNA is commonly performed to localize and sample mediastinal lymph nodes or peribronchial lesions with real-time ultrasound imaging. Radial ultrasound can be used to guide tissue sampling from parenchymal nodules or masses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4383.html" rel="external">"Bronchoscopy: Transbronchial needle aspiration"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4386.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial ultrasound: Indications, contraindications, and complications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4385.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial ultrasound: Technical aspects"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic yield for the suspected disorder</strong> – The diagnostic utility of samples obtained bronchoscopically depends upon the suspicion for the underlying disorder. As an example, the diagnostic utility for transbronchial biopsy for sarcoidosis is high while the yield is lower for other ILDs and for smaller peripheral lesions suspected to be cancerous. Similarly, bronchoalveolar lavage is helpful in the evaluation of sarcoidosis but not diagnostic; in contrast, it is more helpful for the diagnosis of infection or pneumonia especially in the immunosuppressed patient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88822.html" rel="external">"Selection of modality for diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4379.html" rel="external">"Role of lung biopsy in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1401.html" rel="external">"Approach to the immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates", section on 'Lung sampling'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4353.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of sarcoidosis", section on 'Invasive diagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3874473256"><span class="h2">Endobronchial brushing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Brushing specimens are collected using a special, sterile, single-use brush that is enclosed within a catheter sheath  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52310" href="/d/graphic/52310.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Brushings are more commonly used to obtain cytologic specimens from endobronchial lesions, and rarely from parenchymal lesions . Samples are sent for culture, and for cytologic, and occasionally genomic analysis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. They cannot be used to biopsy tissue for pathological analysis. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To obtain a specimen from an endobronchial lesion, the tip of the bronchoscope is placed near the lesion and then the catheter sheath (which contains the brush) is advanced through the working channel of the bronchoscope until its tip is adjacent to the lesion and can be visualized by the operator. The brush is pushed out from the sheath and briskly rubbed against the lesion multiple times in order to trap any cells or micro-organisms within its bristles. Finally, the brush is retracted within its sheath and both the brush and sheath are withdrawn from the bronchoscope. The sample is prepared by placing the brush in <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> or cytological fixative, or by smearing the brush onto a microscope slide. The airway is inspected for bleeding, which is usually minor. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To obtain a specimen from a parenchymal lesion that is beyond the bronchoscopic visualization field, the bronchoscope is placed in or near the bronchus that leads to the lesion, as determined from prior imaging studies. The catheter sheath is then advanced toward the expected location of the lesion, the brush is pushed out from the sheath, and the specimen is collected by gently moving the brush as described above. Fluoroscopy, if available, can guide accurate placement of the brush before the specimen is collected.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the catheter sheath is to prevent contamination of the brush with oropharyngeal flora that may remain inside the working channel of the bronchoscope, as well as to protect the inside of the working channel from damage by the brush. The value of protected specimen brushing in the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia and sensitivity of brushings for the diagnosis of lung cancer are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1635.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia", section on 'Noninvasive respiratory sampling'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89115.html" rel="external">"Procedures for tissue biopsy in patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Conventional bronchoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>Brushes come in different sizes, length, and stiffness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1324093937"><span class="h2">Bronchoalveolar lavage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a procedure that can be used to obtain samples for microbiologic and cytologic analysis only. BAL cannot be used to obtain tissue for histologic analysis, although rarely architectural features or other features that are diagnostic of some conditions (eg, alveolar hemorrhage, glandular formation in adenocarcinoma) can be appreciated. </p><p>It involves the instillation of sequential aliquots of sterile <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> in to a bronchoalveolar segment from a bronchoscope that is wedged into the second or third order of bronchi  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076" href="/d/graphic/104076.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). After instillation of each aliquot, saline is aspirated from the distal space using a specimen trap attached to the suction port  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64093" href="/d/graphic/64093.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) or directly into the syringe from which the saline was originally infused. A BAL typically recovers less than half of the instilled saline. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4303.html" rel="external">"Basic principles and technique of bronchoalveolar lavage"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4308.html" rel="external">"Role of bronchoalveolar lavage in diagnosis of interstitial lung disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2734112278"><span class="h2">Bronchial washing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bronchial washings are obtained by advancing the bronchoscope into an airway, instilling about 5 to 20 mL of sterile <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>, and then quickly aspirating the instilled saline into a specimen trap. Bronchial washings are similar to BAL, except washings do not require that the bronchoscope be wedged and they require a smaller volume of sterile saline. They are usually contaminated by oral flora and do not provide a good specimen for determining the differential cell count. Washings and suctioning thick secretions may be therapeutic for patients with lobar collapse or atelectasis causing hypoxemia. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2421352000"><span class="h2">Endobronchial biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Endobronchial biopsy is used to obtain tissue under direct visual guidance from the tracheobronchial tree for histologic analysis.

In suspected cases of malignancy, the sample is placed in formalin. Additional immunohistochemical (IHC) staining or mutation studies for genetic biomarkers can be done from this sample by pathologists. Some experts rinse the biopsy forceps in saline or cytologic fixative to enhance the potential diagnostic yield.

Guidance procedures confirm proper placement of the forceps, which is particularly helpful if the lesion or area of interest is small and peripheral. It is associated with an improved diagnostic yield, although it does not appear to reduce the incidence of pneumothorax [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. In contrast, the blind approach is sufficient for a diffuse process because the area of interest is widespread (eg, sarcoidosis). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96531.html" rel="external">"Image-guided bronchoscopy for biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4385.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial ultrasound: Technical aspects", section on 'RP-EBUS-guided transbronchial biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>There are a variety of forceps available, none of which are superior such that choosing one type over another is usually operator-dependent. The distal tip of the bronchoscope is placed near or in the airway leading to the lesion or area of interest, as determined from imaging studies. Biopsy forceps are then advanced through the working channel of the bronchoscope until the tip is seen emerging for the distal end of the bronchoscope  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50208" href="/d/graphic/50208.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anatomy-guided TBB</strong> – In anatomy-guided or blind technique, the forceps are advanced slowly into the airway of the lung parenchyma until resistance is encountered (resistance signifies that the tip of the forceps has probably reached the pleura; the tip of the forceps will be out of view). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The forceps are then pulled back approximately 2 cm.

This avoids potential damage to the lung parenchyma. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pain while the forceps are closed indicates that the forceps may have grasped the pleura, since pleural tissue, not alveolar tissue, has the highest concentration of pain receptors, thereby increasing the risk of pneumothorax. If pneumothorax is suspected, no further biopsy specimens should be taken.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>After each biopsy, the bronchial segment where the forceps were inserted should be inspected for bleeding while the assistant is preparing the sample. When bleeding is noted, suction is applied on the bronchial segment for at least two minutes to keep the specific bronchial segment collapsed to control bleeding. Additional biopsies are usually taken provided bleeding is minimal. We prefer to collect at least two to three good-sized biopsy specimens for pathologic examination and one to two specimens for tissue culture or flow cytometry. Details on how bleeding is managed is described separately.

The forceps are advanced into the distal airways under fluoroscopic guidance and, prior to attempting the biopsy, the location of the forceps is confirmed fluoroscopically to verify that it is in the target area and not against the pleura (to minimize the risk of pneumothorax). Some fluoroscopes are planar and can only determine how lateral the forceps are while others can rotate in different planes to provide more accurate three-dimension information regarding the location of the forceps tip.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Fluoroscopic guidance is not mandatory for transbronchial biopsies. Comparison studies of transbronchial biopsies with or without fluoroscopic guidance report similar rates of complications including pneumothorax and diagnostic yields [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].
