         The portal triad contains the extrahepatic segments of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile ducts. Injury to the portal triad is uncommon but is one of the most difficult to manage traumatic injuries associated with high morbidity and mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
         Deaths are due to exsanguinating hemorrhage often from more than one source and a challenging exposure. Furthermore, attempts to control bleeding with vascular ligation of the portal vein or hepatic artery may result in complete bowel ischemia or liver necrosis, respectively. Ductal injuries are difficult to identify, and postreconstruction complications of leak, sepsis, and death are not uncommon.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of portal trial injuries are reviewed. The initial approach to management of abdominal trauma is reviewed separately. (See

         The portal triad is contained within the hepatoduodenal ligament and contains the portal vein (posterolateral), hepatic artery (medial), and bile ducts (lateral)  (

         Injury to any structure in the portal triad is rare, and thus, most data on portal trial injuries come from small, single-center case series over the course of decades. In an 11-year retrospective series from Harborview Medical Center, injuries to the portal triad comprised only 0.21 percent of all trauma admissions [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         ]. The mechanism was penetrating injury in 62 percent, and the patients were predominantly male with a median age of 35. In a series of 302 abdominal vascular injuries over a six-year period in another urban level 1 trauma center, portal vein injuries occurred in 14 (5 percent) [

         Concomitant injuries to the portal vein, hepatic arteries, and bile ducts can occur; however, there are no apparent patterns with respect to the number of structures or combination or mechanism of injury (ie, penetrating, blunt). In the largest multicenter, retrospective review of 99 patients with portal triad injuries, 84 patients (88 percent) had one structure injured, 15 (16 percent) had two or more structures injured, and 4 patients had all three structures injured [

         Given the proximity of the portal triad to other anatomic structures, nearly all patients have an additional solid organ (liver, pancreas, right kidney, right adrenal gland), hollow viscous (stomach, duodenum, colon, gallbladder), or vascular injury (vena cava, aorta, renal vessels). In a series of 21 portal triad injuries, the most common solid organ injury was the liver (62 percent) followed by the pancreas (29 percent). The most common vascular injury was the vena cava (14 percent) and the aorta (9 percent) [

         </span>
         Hemorrhagic shock and signs of intra-abdominal injury are nonspecific, and the diagnosis of portal trial injury relies upon demonstration of the injury on direct examination of the portal structures in the operating room, or on imaging features that strongly suspect portal triad injury or demonstrate injury in the vicinity of the portal triad that are highly associated with portal triad injury.

         For patients with blunt abdominal trauma, hypotension with a positive Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma exam (commonly in the right upper quadrant) is an indication for immediate abdominal exploration. Other indications for immediate laparotomy in blunt abdominal trauma may include the presence of free air on plain radiography or computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen or signs of peritonitis from associated adjacent hollow viscus injury.

         For hemodynamically stable patients with blunt trauma, cross-sectional imaging using a CT scan with intravenous (IV) contrast might be able to identify hepatic artery or portal vein injuries, but the data on this are sparse.

         Features of hepatic artery injury may include intimal irregularity, pseudoaneurysm, and free contrast extravasation, and are all dependent on the timing of contrast injection and scanning. Delayed portal venous images may show portal venous thrombus or extravasation.

         For patients with hemorrhagic shock, portal triad injury may or may not be the main source of bleeding. When it is, the portal venous or hepatic artery bleeding is controlled first and then managed after quick control of other sources of bleeding and control of gastrointestinal contamination. If more urgent bleeding is from another source (eg, kidney, iliac artery), the portal triad is packed and managed once bleeding is controlled, and the patient is resuscitated according to damage control principles. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15148.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         A "damage control" approach to portal triad injury is recommended. For patients with vascular injury, hemorrhage control is the first priority of management. With portal venous injury, the surgeon is faced with bleeding from a structure that normally has an average of nearly 1 liter of blood flow per minute. In a Western Trauma Association review of portal triad injuries, exsanguination from the portal vein was responsible for 79 percent of early or operative deaths, and the overall mortality rate was 55 percent [

         Inflow control can be achieved with a Pringle maneuver  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51354" href="/z/d/graphic/51354.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). This involves encircling the hepatoduodenal ligament using vascular clamps or using a Rommel tourniquet for proximal control. A "double Pringle maneuver" can be achieved as well, with a second clamp near the liver for distal control  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132608" href="/z/d/graphic/132608.html" rel="external">
          figure 6

         </a>
         ]. Packing may also be used.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clamp time of the Pringle maneuver should be limited to what is necessary for hemorrhage control, and the clamp should be intermittently released, if possible, in 15-minute intervals. In a trial that randomly assigned patients to intermittent clamping of 15-minute intervals or ischemic preconditioning (20 minutes of ischemic preconditioning followed by inflow clamping for at least 30 minutes during transection) in patients undergoing elective liver resection, intermittent clamping was associated with lower blood loss [

         Following control of hemorrhage, optimal exposure is key. A wide Kocher maneuver  (

          figure 7

         ) with take-down and medial mobilization of the hepatic flexure of the colon and medial rotation of the duodenum will assist in exposure of the more proximal portal structures. It is important to leave the kidney and adrenal gland in their native locations. Identification and lateral retraction of the uninjured bile duct will protect it from potential iatrogenic injury. One of the most challenging portal vein injury locations to manage is behind the pancreas. In this situation, division of the pancreas will expose the retropancreatic portal vein and the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein. However, some authors reserve this heroic maneuver only when distal pancreatectomy is indicated [

         Following vascular control and exposure, the surgeon is faced with the decision to repair or reconstruct the injury, provide a temporary shunt, or to ligate the vein.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whenever possible, primary repair or reconstruction of the portal vein should be performed. In the Western Trauma Association multicenter series, survival was significantly increased for those in whom primary repair via lateral venorrhaphy was performed compared with venous ligation (58 versus 10 percent) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, ligation of the portal vein rather than attempts at complex reconstruction may be expedient and appropriate in the hemodynamically unstable patient. The decision to ligate must be made early in the operative course, before shock and coagulopathy set in. In a series of 83 patients, those treated from 1958 to 1973 only underwent ligation as a last resort and only 13 percent survived; however, after 1974, they proceeded directly with ligation if simple lateral repair of the vein was impractical, and survival increased to 80 percent [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Shunting the portal vein is another option if the injury is not amenable to lateral repair, with delayed reconstruction using a saphenous vein or prosthetic vascular graft. However, there have been no large series or long-term work to guide any details of portal vein shunting. In a 2015 multicenter American Association for the Surgery of Trauma study, among 213 vascular shunts, only two were placed in the portal or superior mesenteric veins [

         When a second-look surgery is planned, the timing of surgery should be within 48 hours, but earlier if there is any concern for bowel ischemia. Temporary abdominal closure using a transparent adhesive dressing over the incision allows for inspection of congested bowel and prevents the occurrence of abdominal compartment syndrome. (See

         The second-look surgery will also identify additional injuries that may have been missed during a hectic index operation. Nonviable bowel is resected, as needed.

         If the portal vein was ligated, portal venous pressure increases abruptly. Collateral blood flow may develop over the ensuing days to weeks. In the interim, large-volume resuscitation is needed to compensate for portal sequestration [

         </span>
         The hepatic artery is the least commonly injured portal triad structure. In the Western Trauma Association series, most hepatic artery injuries were due to blunt trauma [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. The common, proper, left, and right hepatic arteries were affected equally. Abdominal exploration is indicated for active bleeding (eg, exsanguination, contrast blush seen on computed tomographic imaging) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For most hepatic artery injuries causing bleeding, the hepatic artery can be ligated. If the hepatic artery is ligated, flow in the cystic artery, which provides the predominant blood supply to the gallbladder, will severely diminish, and as such, the gallbladder should be removed. Repair or reconstruction of the hepatic artery at any location (eg, common, proper, branches) can be time-consuming, and the repair is prone to thrombosis, given bleeding and shock. While there may be concern that ligation of the hepatic artery will lead to liver failure from ischemic hepatopathy, with isolated hepatic artery injury, this complication is unusual since the portal vein should contribute 80 percent of hepatic blood flow [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with injuries to both the hepatic artery and portal vein, repair of at least one is mandatory, with efforts preferentially focused on the portal vein (see
         <a class="local">
          'Portal venous injury'
         </a>
         above). Liver perfusion can be evaluated intraoperatively using with laser-assisted fluorescence angiography (LAFA). If ischemia is confirmed after hepatic artery ligation, hepatic arterial inflow can be restored and/or any ischemic liver debrided.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Western Trauma Association series, 28 of 99 patients had a hepatic artery injury [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. About two-thirds (68 percent) underwent ligation of the artery. Over 90 percent of survivors had ligation as the treatment of choice. All patients with a concomitant portal vein injury who underwent attempted primary repair of the hepatic artery died.

         </span>
         Injury to the extrahepatic bile ducts is unusual; however, the complications can be severe. In a Western Trauma Association series, only 35 patients had a bile duct injury over a 60-year cumulative experience [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Given the rarity of these injuries, the literature on the management of laparoscopic bile duct injuries is helpful for providing management, including the preferred type of repair (eg, primary repair, biliary-enteric reconstruction) and timing of repair.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bile staining during laparotomy is suggestive of biliary tree injury. Intraoperative cholangiography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography following index operation can also be used.
        </p>
        <p>
         The size of the injury influences the type of repair. Partial or small injuries of the larger bile ducts can be primarily repaired, potentially over T-tube drainage or internal stent. In one of the largest series of intraoperatively identified bile duct injuries (nonthermal injury) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 10 of 19 patients underwent primary repair with or without a T-tube [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Biliary reconstruction is recommended for complex bile duct injuries, including those with segmental tissue loss, injuries greater than 50 percent circumference laceration. In the Western Trauma Association series, 9 of 10 patients with complex extrahepatic bile duct injuries underwent biliary-enteric anastomoses [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Biliary-enteric anastomotic reconstruction may be preferable to end-to-end reconstruction due to lower the rate of stricture. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The timing of bile duct repair is critical for optimal outcome. The biliary enteric anastomosis should be performed with optimal physiology, especially in the face of a combined hepatic arterial injury and/or shock. In a series of 200 patients transferred to a tertiary referral center with bile duct injuries from laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the median time to repair was 10 weeks, and most patients (98 percent) underwent Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomies [

        <p>
         In the rare scenario of destruction of the distal common bile duct, a pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed. In a series of patients requiring pancreaticoduodenectomy for trauma, the most common indication for the procedure was massive injury to the distal bile ducts and pancreatic head [

         Morbidity and mortality related to portal triad injury is high. Despite improvements in survival for most other injury types, there has been little to no improvement in survival over the last 25 years due to the high degree of blood loss, frequency of associated injuries, and high complication rate.

          Anatomy and incidence
         </strong>
         – The portal triad contains the extrahepatic segments of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile ducts. Injury to any the structures in the portal triad is overall rare. Given the proximity of these structures, injury to more than one portal trial structure frequently occurs. A penetrating injury mechanism is more common than blunt injury. Anatomic variations to the portal triad structures are common  (

          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – Most patients with portal triad injuries have symptoms and signs of intra-abdominal injury (eg, pain, peritoneal signs) and are in hemorrhagic shock. Because of anatomic proximity, nearly all patients with portal triad injury will have an associated solid organ (liver, pancreas, right kidney, right adrenal gland), hollow viscous (stomach, duodenum, colon, gallbladder), or vascular injury (vena cava, aorta, renal vessels) that contributes to their symptomatology.

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Hemorrhagic shock and other signs of intra-abdominal injury are nonspecific. A definitive diagnosis of portal triad injury relies upon demonstration of the injury on direct examination of the portal structures in the operating room in patients with indications for abdominal exploration. In hemodynamically stable patients, findings on computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen may confirm a clinical suspicion for portal triad injury. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Damage control surgery
         </strong>
         – For patients in hemorrhagic shock, a "damage control" approach to portal triad injury should be used. The portal triad injury may or may not be the main source of bleeding. If it is, portal venous or hepatic arterial bleeding is controlled first using the Pringle maneuver  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132608" href="/z/d/graphic/132608.html" rel="external">
          figure 6
         </a>
         ) and then managed after control of other sources of bleeding and control of gastrointestinal contamination. If more urgent bleeding is from another source (eg, kidney, iliac artery), the portal triad is packed and managed once other serious bleeding controlled and the patient has been resuscitated. Following a damage control approach, a second-look procedure is recommended. (See
         <a class="local">

          Surgical repair
         </strong>
         – Once hemorrhage is controlled, the portal structures are exposed. Division of the pancreas may be required to expose retropancreatic portal vein injury; however, this is generally performed only when distal pancreatectomy is also indicated due to injury.

          Bile duct injury

         – Non-iatrogenic traumatic injury to the extrahepatic bile ducts is unusual. Drainage with delayed repair is commonly used to manage these injuries. Depending on the size of the injury, options for repair include repair over a T-tube or biliary reconstruction (eg, end-to-end repair, biliary-enteric anastomosis). Severe distal bile duct injuries with concomitant injury to the head of the pancreas may mandate pancreaticoduodenectomy and reconstruction (ie, Whipple procedure). (See

          Mortality
         </strong>
         – Despite improvements in survival for most other injury types, there has been little to no improvement in survival over the last 25 years due to the high degree of blood loss, frequency of associated injuries, and high complication rates. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Morbidity and mortality'
         </a>
         above.)
