         The approach to post-cardiac arrest stabilization consists of ongoing monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamic status with continued management of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Active temperature control and rapid treatment of seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and hyperglycemia are also critically important.

         After ROSC, the blood pressure is frequently labile. Close BP monitoring is achieved with continuously cycled non-invasive BP monitoring or insertion of an intra-arterial catheter. Efforts to obtain intra-arterial access should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         interfere with post-cardiac arrest stabilization. In many hospitals, arterial access is obtained after transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit. Procedures for obtaining intra-arterial access in children are discussed separately. (See

         After ROSC, airway assessment and management should occur simultaneously with support of breathing (oxygenation and ventilation) and circulation. C-spine motion restriction should be maintained or, if not present, initiated for patients with a history or suspicion of trauma until appropriate imaging can be performed. (See

         </span>
         For unintubated children with ROSC, the clinician must determine if the airway is maintainable or needs to be secured. Most children with altered mental status, respiratory distress, or shock after ROSC require endotracheal intubation. Prior to rapid sequence intubation (RSI) and if it does not delay timely airway management, the clinician should perform a focused neurologic examination to determine level of responsiveness (AVPU), pupillary response, and presence of key reflexes prior to neuromuscular blockade. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Disability/Dextrose'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         These children are at increased risk of hypotension during RSI. Furthermore, any sedative or analgesic medication can result in hypotension during the post-arrest period. For this reason, intermittent doses of short-acting sedatives are good choices. Medications traditionally used for RSI in patients with hemodynamic instability such as

         Children who are awake and without signs of shock after ROSC should receive supplemental oxygen as needed  (

         For children receiving mechanical ventilation after ROSC, consultation with an expert in the mechanical ventilation of children (eg, pediatric intensivist or pediatric anesthesiologist) is strongly encouraged. Lung protective strategies including low-inspiratory volume and use of positive end-expiratory pressure are typically warranted  (

         For these patients, the physician must assess oxygenation and ventilation by measurement of an arterial blood gas shortly after initiation of mechanical ventilation and adjust settings based upon repeat arterial blood gases or correlated pulse oximetry, and/or capnography. When using non-invasive monitoring, the clinician should be aware of the errors associated with pulse oximetry  (

         To optimize management, a second vascular access should be obtained after ROSC. In the emergency department, either a peripheral intravenous (IV) or intraosseous catheter (IO) is an acceptable second form of access. However, patients with persistent altered mental status or fluid-refractory shock may eventually need central venous access to permit measurement of central venous pressure and oxygen saturation and to provide central access for vasopressor administration.

         – For patients with hypotensive shock, the physician may administer a continuous infusion of epinephrine or norepinephrine. The choice between epinephrine and norepinephrine is guided by preference of the physician, patient physiology, and local system factors. Typically, epinephrine is used in patients with signs of myocardial dysfunction, and norepinephrine is used in patients with signs of low systemic vascular resistance or vasodilation. This suggestion is based upon indirect evidence of benefit of epinephrine or norepinephrine in children and adults with fluid-refractory septic shock. (See

         For patients with recurrent arrest or persistent post-arrest shock, ECMO may be an option if there is an underlying condition with potential for recovery. Examples include ingestions of cardiotoxic medications or thrombosis of an aorta-pulmonary shunt following surgical palliation procedures. Rapid consultation with a pediatric critical care specialist is recommended as soon as ECMO is being considered. In general, ECMO is not indicated following unwitnessed or prolonged out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to associated hypoxic-ischemic organ injury unless there are mitigating circumstances such as moderate to severe environmental hypothermia.

         After return of spontaneous circulation, children should receive post-cardiac arrest care under the direction of a pediatric critical care specialist in a pediatric intensive care unit. If the child is not being treated in a center with pediatric critical care expertise, the child should be stabilized and rapidly transferred for definitive care at a regional pediatric center with a full complement of pediatric specialty care and advanced technologic capabilities including dialysis and, whenever available, Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Critically ill or injured children typically benefit from transport by a team with pediatric expertise and advanced pediatric treatment capability as well, although in some isolated cases more rapid transport by an immediately available non-pediatric team may be acceptable. (See

        <p>
         Prior to transfer, the physician responsible for the child's care at the transferring hospital should speak directly to the physician who will be taking charge of the patient at the receiving hospital. All documentation of care (eg, medical chart, medication administration record, laboratory results, copies of ancillary studies [radiographs, ECGs]) should be sent with the patient. (See

         After a cardiac arrest, it is essential that the clinician optimize cerebral oxygenation and perfusion and avoid increased metabolic demand caused by fever and seizures. In addition, general measures to address increased intracranial pressure (ICP) should be employed.

         </span>
         Active temperature control (ATC; also called targeted temperature management) after cardiac arrest refers to the practice of continuously monitoring core body temperature and actively intervening (typically with cooling blankets and antipyretics [eg,
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13028" href="/z/d/drug information/13028.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         ]) to maintain core temperature in a narrow pre-defined range.
        </p>
        <p>
         ATC is a broad term that includes targeted normothermia (maintaining core temperature 36 to 37.5°C [96.8 to 99.5°F]), mild hypothermia (core temperature 34 to 36°C [93.2 to 96.8°F]), and therapeutic hypothermia (core temperature 32 to 34°C [89.6 to 93.2°F]). The optimal temperature is uncertain, as discussed below.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for ATC following cardiac arrest is based upon observations that fever is common in the initial days after cardiac arrest and that fevers are associated with worse outcomes [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Thus, avoiding fever is an important part of post-resuscitation care. The rationale for therapeutic hypothermia is to reduce cerebral metabolic demand, which may reduce the risk of reperfusion injury during the early post-resuscitation period.

         Therapeutic hypothermia (targeted temperature range 32 to 34°C [89.6 to 93.2°F]) for two days followed by three days of normothermia. Patients who receive therapeutic hypothermia are at increased risk of shivering, coagulopathy with bleeding, hyperglycemia, arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, and cold diuresis that can cause hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalance [

         The authors maintain normothermia with strict avoidance of fever for most patients during post-cardiac arrest care because of fewer adverse effects and similar benefit when compared to hypothermia. When targeting normothermia, many experts maintain children at 35°C to provide a buffer that avoids fever because temperature elevation can occur rapidly in these patients. However, this approach has not been studied or compared to either normothermia or therapeutic hypothermia.

          Timing and duration
         </strong>
         – ATC should be started as soon as is feasible (within minutes to hours after achieving ROSC). It is typically continued for three to five days. When targeting normothermia, the same temperature target is used for the entire duration. When using therapeutic hypothermia, the lower temperature is maintained for 48 hours, followed by a period of slow rewarming and then one to three days of targeted normothermia.

          Monitoring

         – Accurate monitoring of core body temperature requires the use of a low-reading thermometer and is best obtained with a flexible temperature probe. Sites of measurement include the bladder, rectum, esophagus, nasopharynx, and central vein. Rectal temperature probes are commonly used for this purpose; however, clinicians should be aware that the rectal temperature may lag behind the true core temperature.

          Trials comparing therapeutic hypothermia versus targeted normothermia

         – The available clinical trial data suggest that clinical outcomes are similar for patients managed with therapeutic hypothermia (32 to 34°C [89.6 to 93.2°F]) or targeted normothermia (36 to 37.5°C [96.8 to 99.5°F]) [

This question was addressed in two randomized controlled trials, one involving 260 children who were resuscitated from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (THAPCA-OH [Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Out of Hospital trial]) and the other involving 329 children resuscitated from in-hospital cardiac arrest (THAPCA-IH) [

         During post-cardiac arrest care, children frequently require sedation and analgesia to control pain and to prevent or manage shivering. Dosing, type of administration (intermittent or continuous), and specific agent depends upon a variety of factors that include the patient's age, underlying comorbidities, degree of neurologic injury, hemodynamic status, and time since arrest. Agents used for sedation and analgesia can cause hypotension and complicate neurologic assessment. Thus, the minimally effective dose should be used.

         Our typical approach consists of sedation with a continuous infusion of

         Neuroprognostication for children during post-cardiac arrest care should be performed by pediatric neurologists or physicians with similar expertise. Many factors impact the prognosis for neurologic recovery after cardiac arrest in children. The ability to predict outcomes within the first 24 to 48 hours of arrest is generally poor, especially when the physical examination is altered by sedation and/or the use of therapeutic hypothermia. In particular, lack of motor function and pupillary response should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be used as reasons to withdraw care soon after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in children [

         Serial electroencephalograms, evoked potentials, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are all studies that can be used to assess cerebral function but have limitations as well, especially soon after cardiac arrest. Thus, they should

         During post-cardiac arrest care, parents/primary caregivers require accurate and empathetic communication of their child's condition, current level of support and treatments, and next steps in care. Soon after return of spontaneous circulation, the clinician should emphasize that outcomes are difficult to predict and that multiple clinical findings must be considered by a physician with the appropriate expertise. The clinician should avoid premature predictions of clinical outcomes. Given the dynamic nature of post-arrest physiology, it is generally our practice to provide a broad overview during initial communication without focusing on speculative details. It is often helpful for families to anticipate at least several days of critical care; for comatose patients, the prognosis may remain unknown for at least three to five days.
