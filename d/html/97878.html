         Positive airway pressure (PAP) devices are primarily used to treat sleep disordered breathing including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Adherence and efficacy of PAP is routinely monitored subjectively. However, downloadable data from PAP devices provide objective data that complement subjective assessment to facilitate further management [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Documentation of adherence (ie, compliance) from these downloads is often mandated by insurers. Although downloading additional data from PAP devices has become commonplace, their accuracy in determining efficacy of treatment compared with in-laboratory polysomnography is uncertain and data demonstrating improved outcomes with their use are few.
        </p>
        <p>
         Using device data downloads to determine adherence with and efficacy of PAP is discussed in this topic review. Details regarding use of downloadable information for continuous PAP (CPAP) titration following initiation are discussed separately. (See

         Documentation of adherence (ie, compliance) to PAP devices is often mandated by third party insurers so that reimbursement can be justified. Adherence can be readily identified and quantified from device downloads. (See

         </span>
         Downloads may also be able to provide clues as to the underlying reason for nonadherence or poor efficacy (eg, airway leak or a complex sleep disorder) and in some cases, prompt the need for a formal in-laboratory sleep study. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessing leak'

         Downloadable data from the device itself has many advantages when compared with an in-laboratory study while the patient uses continuous PAP (CPAP) since it is cheaper, an overnight stay is not required, and data from more than one night can be obtained. However, they may be less accurate for the detection of sleep related events, underestimate the frequency of hypopneas, and fail to diagnose complex sleep disorders when present. Thus, the clinician should be aware of the associated caveats so that patients may receive further evaluation when necessary and be treated accordingly. (See

         All modern PAP devices are able to be externally accessed, and the stored data downloaded or reviewed. Data can be downloaded using various methods, which depend upon the device brand and model (secure digital cards, modems, and wireless transmission). Thus, the clinician should be aware of what device is being used by the patient and how information can be accessed from it. With increasing use of telemedicine outpatient care, remote access to data with use of modem devices or wireless transmission is increasingly important.

         Secure digital (SD) cards can be used to externally download data using an SD card reader and software provided by the device manufacturer. In general, cards can be removed by the patient or medical supply company, and taken or mailed to the provider's office to be read by a card-reader device.

         Wireless transmission technology is incorporated into some of the machines, allowing data to be uploaded daily to an online database as long as the machine is connected to an electrical outlet. Providers should be aware that some older devices that previously transmitted data wirelessly may no longer do so if they used a 3G network as all US carriers shut down their 3G networks in 2022. For clinicians or office staff to access data that are remotely transmitted, they must request to be added as a clinical provider by the medical supply company. Alternatively, some online monitoring systems allow the provider to add themselves as a care provider to a patient if the PAP serial number and personal health information is available.

         Occasionally, if the device card or modem are not accessible, the device itself may have a menu that can be accessed to reveal some of the stored data, although these data are considerably less detailed than those accessed from the SD card or modem.

         Continuous PAP (CPAP) devices are the most commonly used PAP devices. Download reports can be generated with various levels of detail with some older devices providing minimal information only. However, most newer devices provide the following information:

         <span class="glyph">

         The basic download report consists of data on adherence (ie, compliance), effectiveness, and leak, usually reported out as a summary of events over a specific period (eg, 30 to 90 days). Most physicians routinely review this information within the first month of therapy as adherence patterns are established early [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Long term, it is recommended that patients have adherence documented at least annually or when symptoms develop [

         A detailed or comprehensive report provides the same basic information as well as information from individual days, and may also provide information on individual respiratory events occurring throughout a night. Most clinicians access this information when further detail on poor adherence and effectiveness are needed or when data is incongruent with the patient symptoms.

         CPAP devices provide information on duration and frequency of use. Although the definition of adherence is ill-defined, most medical insurance companies and professional organizations consider usage for ≥4 hours per night for ≥70 percent of nights to define CPAP adherence. However, in general, most experts agree that the greater the number of hours spent receiving CPAP, the more likely a patient is to benefit. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7702.html" rel="external">
          "Assessing and managing nonadherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for adults with obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Sequalae'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal period for adherence analysis (eg, days or weeks) is unknown. However, we agree with the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommendations that suggest selecting a period between 7 and 90 days for the adequate assessment of adherence [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. For the period that is preselected by the physician, total CPAP usage is typically displayed both as total percentage of days used as well as percentage of days used ≥4 hours  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111642" href="/z/d/graphic/111642.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). In addition to providing information on CPAP usage, this section of the download will display the mode of use (ie, CPAP or auto-adjusting CPAP [APAP]) and whether or not expiratory pressure relief is being used. Expiratory pressure relief is a technology that allows for expiratory pressure reduction. This mechanism may have different names based on the manufacturer. The reduction of pressure during exhalation can help patients who are expiratory pressure intolerant (ie, patients who have difficulty exhaling against PAP). The amount of pressure reduction can be adjusted between levels of 1 and 3, but the amount of pressure reduction based on these levels are not equivalent between manufacturers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinician should be aware of whether they are reviewing the "mask-on" or "machine-on" time, or both. Downloads report the cumulative hours used during the assessed time period (mask-on) as well as the cumulative hours during which the device was turned on (blower time; machine-on). An estimated 10 percent difference between these measurements may be associated with normal use [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. A large discrepancy in these numbers may suggest excessive leak (eg, mouth breathing with a nasal mask in place) or a patient leaving the machine on when not actually in use (see
         <a class="local">
          'Assessing detailed data to assist in troubleshooting'
         </a>
         below).While most CPAP machines can differentiate between mask-on and machine-on time, some older machines may only contain meters that record machine-on time, making them less accurate for the assessment of adherence since they only record total hours or days used.
        </p>
        <p>
         If it is determined that a patient is nonadherent, then measures can be taken to investigate the underlying reason(s) (eg, mask intolerance, dry nares, embarrassment) and to fix them (eg, mask adjustment, humidification, education). Reasons and interventions for nonadherence are discussed separately. (See

         – An apnea hypopnea index (AHI) is defined as apneas plus hypopneas divided by total sleep time ([apneas + hypopneas]/total sleep time) based on polysomnography. Under optimal circumstances, apneas and hypopneas during in-laboratory polysomnography are identified by changes in oximetry, arousals, and airflow [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. However, since CPAP devices cannot measure oximetry or sleep including arousals from sleep, only airflow can be used to calculate a surrogate value for the AHI known as AHI
         <sub>
          flow
         </sub>
         . Although an AHI
         <sub>
          flow
         </sub>
         of &lt;10 events per hour is sometimes considered adequate therapy [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ], validated outcomes studies to determine a clinically significant residual AHI
         <sub>
          flow
         </sub>
         have not yet been done. While this AHI
         <sub>
          flow
         </sub>
         can be used as an indicator of CPAP efficacy, it should be noted that it is an estimate only. Respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs) are also reported here. However, RERAs reported on CPAP downloads are not the same as those scored during a polysomnogram. Since there is no measure of sleep or arousal on a CPAP device, RERAs are estimated based on progressive flow limitation in an event that does not meet criteria for apnea or hypopnea.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Several studies have compared device-calculated AHI
         <sub>
          flow
         </sub>
         with polysomnographic measurement of AHI (ie, the gold standard). The findings generally show good correlation for apneas [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-14
         </a>
         ], although some studies have suggested that the detection of hypopneas and other sleep-related events are underestimated by devices, which may lead to overestimation of CPAP efficacy [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,15
         </a>
         ]. In addition, it is important for the clinician to understand that definitions of apnea and hypopnea event detection are not uniform among manufacturers. Each device manufacturer has a unique algorithm to determine AHI
         <sub>
          flow
         </sub>
         . For example, one commercial entity uses a 50 percent decrease from baseline ventilation as a hypopnea and a 75 percent decrease from baseline ventilation as an apnea. Conversely, a different commercial entity uses a 40 to 80 percent reduction in flow to determine hypopneas and a greater than 80 percent reduction in flow to determine apneas [

         – In addition to AHI
         <sub>
          flow
         </sub>
         , some CPAP devices use pressure pulse or forced oscillation technology to determine if the airway is open or closed during a respiratory event. Thus, when a respiratory event is detected by the device, it may be recorded as an open airway (a possible central event) or a closed airway (a possible obstructive event)  (

         ). However, compared with polysomnography, data from these devices are less accurate. One study of 45 patients with OSA and complex sleep apnea reported that the device correctly detected airway obstruction in most cases (87 percent), while only 16 percent of apneic events associated with an open airway were not correctly identified [

         Excessive airflow leak, usually via the mask (eg, ineffective seal from an ill-fitting mask) or mouth (eg, mouth breathing with nasal mask in place), can alter the effectiveness of PAP therapy by failure to deliver the desired airway pressure. Leak data definitions may differ among device manufacturers; thus, when evaluating leak data, it is important to know how leak is defined by each device. In addition, a certain amount of mask leak is intentional ("allowable" leak; ie, masks are purposely designed to have fenestrations that allow a portion of exhaled air to escape to wash out exhaled carbon dioxide and prevent rebreathing). Thus, the volume of airflow leak varies based upon each mask type (eg, higher with nasal mask than full face mask). The mask type may be programmed into some devices to improve the accuracy of the calculated leak volume. The threshold for determining excessive leak should be dependent on the device being used.
        </p>
        <p>
         Devices also vary in how they report leak:

         <span class="glyph">

         If a clinician determines that the device download demonstrates an excessive leak that is affecting OSA control, an intervention to improve the leak may be made, such as changing the mask type, ensuring the mask size is correct, refitting the mask, and occasionally use of a chin strap. Leak through the mouth using a nasal mask may be reduced by use of a chin strap or a full face mask. (See

         </span>
         Auto-adjusting continuous PAP (autoCPAP or APAP) devices are sometimes used to diagnose and treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). APAP devices have proprietary modules for adjustment of CPAP during sleep to either set a fixed level of CPAP that can be administered through a regular CPAP device, or to treat obstructive sleep apnea with variable levels of autoCPAP throughout the night. Similar summary information to that provided by regular CPAP devices can be downloaded from APAP devices (eg, indices of efficacy including apnea hypopnea index

         <strong>
          Rationale
         </strong>
         – Positive airway pressure (PAP) devices are primarily used to treat sleep disordered breathing including obstructive sleep apnea. In conjunction with subjective monitoring, downloadable data from PAP devices can be used to provide objective data that may facilitate further management. The accuracy of downloaded data compared with in-laboratory polysomnography is uncertain and outcome data demonstrating improved outcomes with their use are few. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         <strong>
          Accessing data
         </strong>
         – Stored data can be downloaded or reviewed from most newer devices using various methods, which depend upon the brand and model (secure digital cards, modems, and wireless transmission). Thus, the clinician should be aware of what device is being used by the patient and how information can be accessed from it. (See

         <strong>
          CPAP downloads
         </strong>
         – Continuous PAP (CPAP) devices are the most commonly used PAP devices. While downloads from some older devices provide minimal basic data, most newer devices provide information on adherence (ie, compliance), effectiveness, and airway leak, and others provide further details on respiratory events during sleep. Clinicians should be aware of the parameter definitions used by manufacturer since they vary considerably. Data can be used to modify therapy, thereby improving adherence or effectiveness. The clinician should maintain a low threshold to perform in-laboratory polysomnography, particularly when data is incongruent with symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
