This topic review gives an overview of the technical aspects of flow cytometry and highlights some of its uses in the diagnosis of inborn errors of immunity (IEI; formerly "primary immunodeficiencies" [PIDs]). Each of these immunodeficiencies is discussed in greater detail separately in specific topic reviews.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TECHNICAL ASPECTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2031915676"><span class="h2">Flow cytometer components and function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A basic flow cytometer consists of five main components: a flow cell (through which cells flow), a laser, optical components, detectors to amplify signals, and an electronics/computer system. With these five components, the flow cytometer is capable of performing instantaneous measurements by passing thousands of cells per second through a laser beam and capturing the emerging light from each cell as it passes through the interrogation point. Any suspended cell or particle ranging from 0.2 to 150 micrometers in size is suitable for analysis. Analyses to determine cellular characteristics, such as size, granularity, viability, and immunophenotyping, are the most common types of studies done.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4171496282"><span class="h2">Sample types</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Theoretically, any biologic sample can be analyzed by flow cytometry, although peripheral blood is the most common sample analyzed. Depending upon the specific assay, whole blood may be used, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may be isolated and used for analysis. Bone marrow samples are used during the workup of suspected leukemia. Other biologic sources have been used for flow cytometry, such as cerebral spinal fluid or bronchoalveolar lavage, although the lack of published normals from these biologic sites can make interpretation difficult.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Immunophenotyping</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immunophenotyping is a technique used to characterize the makeup of cell populations by detecting cellular protein expression. Immunophenotyping uses an antibody specific for the antigen of interest that is conjugated to a fluorescent compound known as a fluorophore or fluorochrome  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68067" href="/d/graphic/68067.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). These fluorescent compounds absorb energy from the laser source, causing an electron to be raised to a higher energy level. The excited electron quickly returns to its ground state, emitting the excess energy as a photon of light of a characteristic wavelength that is detected by the flow cytometer.</p><p>Different fluorochromes are excited by different wavelengths of light and emit light at different wavelengths. Thus, it is possible to simultaneously detect several different fluorescently labeled antigens on a cell by using lasers of different wavelengths and filters of specific wavelengths to detect the fluorescent emission. As an example, flow cytometers may have as many as five lasers of different wavelengths. Each laser can be paired with three to four different filters, allowing for an analysis of up to 20 different proteins simultaneously. However, there is considerable overlap of excitation and emission spectra of individual fluorochrome, which can limit certain combinations of fluorochromes. Most immunophenotyping panels in clinical use consist of 10 to 12 different markers.</p><p>Spectral flow cytometry is similar to conventional flow cytometry but with multiple detectors for each fluorochrome rather than one detector. This allows for better differentiation of fluorochromes based upon the fluorescent spectral signature of each fluorochrome, enabling the use of more fluorochromes in a single sample. Some spectral flow cytometers may be able to resolve 40 different fluorochromes in one sample.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Data collection and analysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Each cell is analyzed by the following parameters as the cell suspension passes through the flow cytometer:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The intensity of the forward scatter (FSC) of light, which is a reflection of cell size</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The intensity of the side scatter (SSC) of light, which is a reflection of cell granularity</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The intensity of light emitted by each fluorochrome, which reflects the level of expression of the antigen of interest</p><p></p><p>The results are typically presented by two-dimensional dot plots or one-dimensional histograms. As an example, flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood by FSC (ie, size) and SSC (ie, granularity) yields a characteristic two-dimensional plot that distinguishes different cell populations  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72579" href="/d/graphic/72579.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neutrophils are large and highly granular and therefore exhibit high SSC and high FSC signal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monocytes are large but less granular. Thus, they exhibit lower SSC signal but similar FSC signal compared with neutrophils.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lymphocytes are the smallest and least granular of these cells and therefore exhibit the lowest SSC and FSC signals.</p><p></p><p>The level of expression of specific antigens can be examined in each of the populations defined by FSC and SSC profiles when flow cytometry is combined with fluorescent staining using antibodies against these antigens. As an example, when peripheral blood is stained with antibodies to CD15 (a neutrophil antigen) and CD14 (a monocyte antigen), three populations of cells are detected: a population of cells that only express CD15 (neutrophils), a population of cells that only express CD14 (monocytes), and a population of cells that express neither CD15 nor CD14  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51538" href="/d/graphic/51538.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The percentage of each of these populations is used together with a complete blood count (CBC) with differential to determine the absolute numbers of the different cell populations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1693336869"><span class="h2">Mass cytometry</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A technology has been developed that combines flow cytometry with mass spectrometry, known as mass cytometry or cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This technology uses labeled antibodies to evaluate cell populations similar to fluorescence-based readouts. However, in CyTOF, the antibodies are labeled with heavy-metal ions and interrogated by mass spectrometry. The advantage of this technique is that the readout is based on the atomic number of the heavy metal, and there is little overlap between the isotopes. Thus, a greater number of antibodies can be used simultaneously, allowing for the analysis of over 40 targets per cell. CyTOF is not widely available clinically but will probably become more prominent in the future [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">USE FOR DIAGNOSIS OF INBORN ERRORS OF IMMUNITY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2635898263"><span class="h2">Indications for use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IEI are a group of disorders, which are usually inherited, that can affect cells of the innate or adaptive immune systems [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Flow cytometry is an essential tool in the diagnosis of immunodeficiencies. Its use is not limited to IEI, since this methodology may be used to evaluate the immune system in secondary or acquired immunodeficiencies, such as those that may occur during viral infections (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection), post-bone marrow transplantation, during chemotherapy, and during immunosuppression for systemic autoimmunity.</p><p>There has been a rapid increase in discovery of novel IEI, mainly due to next-generation deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing technologies. In addition, there are now commercially available DNA sequencing panels that rapidly and economically screen genes responsible for a large number of IEI. The advancement in DNA sequencing technologies has led to a shift in our approach to the workup of suspected IEI, and we and others in the field use sequencing panels earlier during the assessment. However, flow cytometry remains a crucial technique, particularly when there are variants of uncertain significance detected in DNA sequencing panels. Immune phenotyping and functional testing by flow cytometry can help determine if the variants are functionally significant in order to ascertain the genetic cause of an IEI. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116805.html" rel="external">"Genetic testing in patients with a suspected primary immunodeficiency or autoinflammatory syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Defects in lymphocyte numbers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A complete blood count (CBC) with differential is an essential first step in the workup of suspected IEI, although this test does not determine the different lymphocyte subsets. Flow cytometry enables qualitative and quantitative enumeration of lymphocyte subsets, including CD4- and CD8-positive T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54176" href="/d/graphic/54176.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">T cells</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Markedly diminished numbers of naïve T cells, with or without diminished numbers of B and NK cells, are a hallmark of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66983" href="/d/graphic/66983.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). SCID can be divided into several subtypes based upon the cell types that are deficient. As examples, pathogenic variants in CD3 subunits, CD45, or interleukin (IL) 7 receptor alpha (IL-7-R-alpha) result in T-B+NK+ SCID. Pathogenic variants in the recombinase-activating genes (RAG) or Artemis result in T-B-NK+ SCID. Pathogenic variants in adenosine deaminase (ADA) result in T-B-NK- SCID. Pathogenic variants in the genes for Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) or the gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2-R-gamma) result in T-B+NK- SCID. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3955.html" rel="external">"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3912.html" rel="external">"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): Specific defects"</a>.)</p><p>Flow cytometry using markers specific for T cells (CD3), B cells (CD19), or NK cells (CD56) is the first step in evaluating children with suspected SCID due to clinical manifestations or a failed newborn screen for SCID. It is also important to determine the percentage of naïve and memory T cells in infants with suspected SCID. In normal newborns, nearly all of the T cells are naïve. However, in some situations such as<em> </em>maternal engraftment of T cells or hypomorphic variants in SCID-causing genes, the numbers of T cells may be normal in the affected infant, but nearly all are memory T cells. CD45RA and CD45RO are the two antigens that distinguish naïve from memory T cells, respectively. Staining with CD62L, CD45RA, and CD31 can enumerate the number of recent thymic emigrants, which is also low in SCID.</p><p>Enumeration of naïve T cells is also used to determine T cell counts in children with defects affecting thymic development, such as DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11 deletion syndrome, and CHARGE syndrome. Analysis of T cell numbers is important because T cell counts correlate with mortality in these individuals [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Affected individuals exhibit varying degrees of defects in the development of the thymus. Most patients with DiGeorge have mild defects in T cell numbers and are not clinically immunodeficient (incomplete DiGeorge syndrome). Rarely, infants may have a complete absence of thymic function (complete DiGeorge syndrome) with a profound reduction in the number of T cells similar to that found in SCID. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3909.html" rel="external">"DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Management and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Regulatory T cells</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) is a disorder causing widespread autoimmune manifestations, usually beginning soon after birth. Pathogenic variants in the forkhead box P3 gene (<em>FOXP3</em>) are the cause of IPEX. Foxp3 is a transcription factor that is crucial to the development, survival, and effector function of regulatory T (Treg) cells, which are essential in maintaining tolerance and preventing autoimmunity [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Treg cells account for approximately 5 to 10 percent of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells. Treg cells express high levels of CD25, the high-affinity binding subunit of the IL-2 receptor, and low levels of CD127, the alpha subunit of the IL-7 receptor [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Use of antibodies to CD4, CD25, CD127, and Foxp3 allows for the quantitation of Treg cells in peripheral blood that are usually reduced in patients with IPEX  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63330" href="/d/graphic/63330.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). The presence of Foxp3-positive cells does not rule out IPEX, since some pathogenic variants decrease or abolish Foxp3 function but not protein stability. Sequence analysis of the <em>FOXP3</em> gene should be performed if the clinical history suggests IPEX but Foxp3 positive cells are present on flow cytometry. IPEX-like diseases can also be caused by deficiencies in CD25 or signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b), key signal transduction subunits of the IL-2 receptor [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3924.html" rel="external">"IPEX: Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H118633225"><span class="h3">Follicular helper T cells</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Germinal center (GC) formation in secondary lymphoid organs indicates B cell clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation (SHM), and class-switch recombination (CSR) after proper activation of B cells by helper T cells. Three cell types comprise a GC: B cells, follicular dendritic cells (FDC), and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. Tfh cells migrate to the follicular region and provide costimulatory signals and cytokines to GC B cells, which then proliferate and undergo SHM and CSR. Tfh are characterized by the expression of the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5, where C = cysteine and X = any amino acid; also called CD185  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96194" href="/d/graphic/96194.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>)), which enables these cells to migrate towards a chemokine cytosine-X-cytosine motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) gradient secreted by the FDC [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Tfh are detected in elevated numbers in patients with systemic autoimmunity [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] and in patients with common variable immunodeficiency. Tfh cells are reduced in hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) due to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (<em>STAT3</em>) pathogenic variants [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3960.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome", section on 'T cell defects'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">B cells</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Severe reduction in all serum immunoglobulin isotypes with profoundly diminished or absent B cells are hallmarks of congenital forms of agammaglobulinemia. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the most common form of congenital agammaglobulinemia, accounting for approximately 85 percent of patients. Patients with XLA present in early childhood with recurrent infections, particularly with encapsulated bacteria and chronic enteroviral infections. XLA is caused by pathogenic variants in the Bruton tyrosine kinase (<em>BTK</em>) gene, leading to a developmental block at the pre-B cell stage of B cell development in the bone marrow that results in near complete deficiency of all mature B cells. B cell enumeration is performed using the pan B cell markers CD19 or CD20. The numbers of B cells are usually profoundly reduced in XLA. Intracellular expression of the BTK protein can be analyzed in monocytes to confirm loss of expression of the BTK protein since patients with XLA typically lack B cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82104" href="/d/graphic/82104.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). Females who carry the mutated allele express normal numbers of B cells and normal levels of BTK expression in B cells due to nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation, but only approximately 50 percent of their monocytes express BTK. Thus, the percent of monocytes expressing BTK can be used to determine the carrier status in relatives of affected children [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. BTK is also expressed in platelets, and platelet expression of BTK can be used to determine the presence of this protein when B cells are absent [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3931.html" rel="external">"Agammaglobulinemia"</a>.)</p><p>Autosomal recessive (AR) forms of agammaglobulinemia present with a clinical phenotype similar to XLA [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. AR agammaglobulinemias are caused by pathogenic variants in genes essential for the development of B cells (eg, immunoglobulin heavy constant mu [<em>IGHM</em>], immunoglobulin lambda-like polypeptide 1 [<em>IGLL1</em>]<em>, CD79A, CD79B, </em>B cell linker [<em>BLNK</em>],<em> </em>phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 [<em>PIK3R1</em>], and<em> </em>transcription factor 3 [<em>TCF3</em>]). Similar to XLA, the numbers of B cells are usually markedly decreased or absent in AR forms of agammaglobulinemia, but BTK expression is normal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3931.html" rel="external">"Agammaglobulinemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4274565373"><span class="h3">Natural killer cells</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NK cells are an innate lymphoid population that exhibit cytotoxicity toward virally infected cells and tumor cells. Unlike CD8 cells, which also exhibit cytotoxicity toward tumors and viruses, NK cells exhibit spontaneous cytotoxicity without a requirement for antigen activation. NK cells express unique cell lineage markers such as CD56, as well as CD16, an Fc receptor that mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Most NK cells do not express CD3, although there is a small population of cells, called NKT cells, that are CD3+CD56+. NK cell deficiencies can occur due to a lack of NK cells (eg, minichromosome maintenance complex component 4 [MCM4] or GATA binding protein 2 [GATA2] deficiency) or a lack of NK function (eg, defects in CD16) [<a href="#rid18">18-21</a>]. These patients are susceptible to herpetic viral infections. Defects in perforin and other genes involved in the cytotoxic machinery also lead to defective NK killing, as well as defective CD8 killing. These patients are at risk for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).

Frequently, patients with CVID also have disorders of immune regulation (eg, autoimmune cytopenias, inflammatory bowel disease, interstitial lung disease).

B cells go through a maturational program from naïve B cells (characterized by the expression of immunoglobulin D [IgD] but lacking the memory marker CD27) to memory B cells (IgD+CD27+) and switched memory B cells (IgD-CD27+) upon antigen exposure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52576" href="/d/graphic/52576.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>).</p><p>The EUROclass criteria for CVID distinguished patients based upon the extent of B cell lymphopenia (&lt;1 percent B cells), the reduction of switched memory B cells, the expansion of CD21 low B cells, and the expansion of transitional B cells (CD38++IgM++)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96193" href="/d/graphic/96193.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

The workup of these patients requires assessment of the proliferative ability of T cells. Historically, tritiated thymidine incorporation was used to measure the proliferation of T cells, but this can also be accomplished by flow cytometry.

CD40L is transiently expressed upon CD4+ T cell activation, which then interacts with CD40 on B cells, resulting in B cell activation, proliferation, immunoglobulin class switch recombination, and affinity maturation. Surface expression of CD40L on CD4+ T cells can be measured by in vitro activation of peripheral blood by phorbol esters (eg, phorbol 12-myristate 12-acetate [PMA]) and calcium ionophore that induce the expression of CD40L  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61633" href="/d/graphic/61633.html" rel="external">figure 11</a>). The failure to detect CD40L on activated cells is used as a screening flow cytometric assay to diagnose XHIM [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].
