Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is the term used to describe amenorrhea that results from such causes and is diagnosed after excluding other etiologies of amenorrhea. The terms FHA and hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) are often used interchangeably.</p><p>FHA is presumed to be a consequence of functional disruption of pulsatile hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. Abnormal GnRH secretion leads to reduced gonadotropin secretion, absent midcycle surges of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, absence of normal follicular development, anovulation, and low serum estradiol (E2) concentrations. Variable neuroendocrine patterns of LH secretion are reported, including reduced frequency and/or amplitude of LH pulses. Serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are low or normal, and often exceed those of LH, similar to the pattern observed in prepubertal girls.</p><p>This topic will review the diagnosis, evaluation and management of FHA. The pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of FHA, as well as the approach to women with primary and secondary amenorrhea, are presented separately.

The evaluation of both types of amenorrhea includes a thorough history and physical examination, biochemical testing, assessment of estrogen status, and, in some cases, imaging. These are reviewed in detail separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/z/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752" href="/z/d/graphic/106752.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).

In some women, menses may stop without a preceding period of oligomenorrhea. If a woman had exercise-induced amenorrhea in the past that remitted when she decreased exercising, it is likely to recur if she resumes exercising without a compensatory increase in caloric intake. Some women (more commonly adolescents) may present with primary amenorrhea, although this is less common.</p><p>The patient should be asked if she has had weight loss or has a history of disordered eating/eating disorder, excessive exercise, or psychogenic stressors. One way to ascertain whether weight is a potential cause is to ask the patient what her approximate weight was when she was having regular menses. This weight can then be used as a benchmark for comparison with her weights during times of menstrual dysfunction/amenorrhea. In order to exclude other causes of amenorrhea, as FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion, it is also important to ask about pregnancy and symptoms that might suggest inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, thyroid disease, primary ovarian insufficiency, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia, hypopituitarism (including anosmia), intracranial space occupying lesion, or other disorders associated with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, as reviewed in detail separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73995" href="/z/d/graphic/73995.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7402.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea", section on 'History'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7403.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of primary amenorrhea", section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>The physical examination can help exclude other causes of amenorrhea, as described in detail separately, and should include an assessment of the external and internal genitalia. Vaginal mucosa that appears red on inspection suggest hypoestrogenism. The bimanual pelvic examination to assess internal genitalia is typically deferred in adolescent girls who are not sexually active  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/z/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752" href="/z/d/graphic/106752.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7402.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea", section on 'Physical examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7403.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of primary amenorrhea", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H126906867"><span class="h2">Biochemical testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women suspected to have FHA should undergo biochemical testing to rule out other causes of amenorrhea, including serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for pregnancy and serum concentrations of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to rule out hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, and primary ovarian insufficiency, respectively. FSH is the best test for primary ovarian insufficiency, but we also measure luteinizing hormone (LH) and E2 when we suspect FHA  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/z/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). If there is evidence of hyperandrogenism, we measure serum androgens (total <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9981" href="/z/d/drug information/9981.html" rel="external">testosterone</a>, sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG], dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEAS]). While many individuals with PCOS are overweight, athletic women with PCOS may present with a leaner phenotype and/or less obvious signs of hyperandrogenism [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. For example, an athlete with PCOS who also has very low weight may have hormonal suppression of androgens and estrogen until weight is restored. At a higher weight, the same athlete may then demonstrate increased androgens on laboratory testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7441.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism", section on 'Biochemical testing'</a>.)</p><p><strong>Low </strong>levels of LH, FSH, and E2 are observed in FHA, but this pattern is also seen in other causes of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, including hypothalamic or pituitary tumors. In many women with FHA, random FSH and LH levels are in the "normal" range with higher FSH than LH concentrations, particularly during recovery  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/z/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7402.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea", section on 'Low or normal serum FSH'</a>.)</p><p>We typically also measure a complete blood count, sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, and basic metabolic panel to exclude inflammatory conditions, and also serologic screening to exclude celiac disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7402.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea", section on 'Low or normal serum FSH'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4281743511"><span class="h2">Estrogen status</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A progestin challenge test may be useful in differentiating between FHA, a condition associated with E2 deficiency and scant or no withdrawal bleeding, and conditions such as PCOS in which E2 levels are not low and bleeding occurs following administration of exogenous progestin. Measurement of a serum E2 concentration at the time of the LH and FSH measurements is another way to assess estrogen status. If LH, FSH, and E2 are all low, the patient has hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (and likely FHA if the patient's history is consistent with the diagnosis). Women with PCOS alone are not estrogen deficient, LH levels are typically higher than FSH levels, and androgen levels are high. In women with primary amenorrhea, withdrawal bleeding following the progestin challenge test also indicates an intact uterus, cervix, and vagina. An imaging study to assess the internal genitalia may be of value in adolescents with primary amenorrhea before the progestin challenge test. This issue is reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7402.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea", section on 'Assessment of estrogen status'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2710749129"><span class="h2">Imaging</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The role of transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasound and other imaging modalities for uterine and uterine outflow tract disorders are reviewed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/z/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752" href="/z/d/graphic/106752.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella region is indicated in all women with unexplained hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and in all women with central nervous system-localizing symptoms such as visual field defects or headaches, or other pituitary hormone deficiencies.

If BMD is low, we measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to rule out vitamin D deficiency.

The first step of management is to encourage weight gain through lifestyle changes, such as (i) increased caloric intake to match energy, and/or (ii) reduced exercise. Other potential interventions include stress reduction, cognitive behavioral therapy, and family-based therapy. For some women with FHA who are inadvertently undereating or practicing simple dieting, simply explaining the need for adequate caloric intake to match energy expenditure may result in increased caloric intake or reduced exercise, followed by resumption of menses [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Team approach </strong>– A team approach is important to address concerns of eating disorders or disordered eating.

When the cause is insufficient caloric intake (from an eating disorder, disordered eating, or inadvertent undereating) or excessive exercise, it is important to emphasize the need for adequate caloric intake to compensate for daily energy expenditure.
