         The most common psychiatric disorders observed in patients treated with maintenance dialysis are unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) and other depressive syndromes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. Depression is associated with reduced adherence to treatment for end-stage kidney disease, as well as increased hospitalization and mortality, possibly independent of dialysis adequacy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other psychiatric disorders in patients on maintenance dialysis, as well as the risk of suicide, are discussed separately. (See

         </span>
         In patients who are treated with maintenance dialysis, multiple studies indicate that the point prevalence of unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) plus other depressive syndromes is approximately 25 percent [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,5-7
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a meta-analysis included 28 studies in which dialysis patients (n &gt;2800) were clinically interviewed, and estimated that the point prevalence of depressive syndromes diagnosed according to standardized criteria was 23 percent [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. This appears to be consistent with the prevalence of depression observed across all general medical disorders, and seems to be greater than the point prevalence in the general population. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1722.html" rel="external">
          "Unipolar depression in adults: Epidemiology", section on 'Prevalence'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although other studies report that the point prevalence of depression in dialysis patients may be as high as 35 to 50 percent, these estimates are largely based upon either patient self-report or clinician-administered instruments [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-12
         </a>
         ]. These instruments, especially self-report scales, may overestimate the prevalence because symptoms such as anergia, anorexia, and insomnia that are secondary to inadequate dialysis may be incorrectly attributed to depression.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Observational studies suggest that onset of depression may occur prior to or at commencement of dialysis in approximately 40 to 45 percent of patients. In two prospective studies of patients starting dialysis (n = 182 and 123), assessment with a self-report questionnaire found that clinically significant symptoms of depression were present at baseline in 40 and 44 percent [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,13
         </a>
         ]. Consistent with these results is the finding that among patients with chronic kidney disease who are not receiving dialysis, comorbid unipolar major depression increases the risk that patients will progress to dialysis [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].

         The risk of depression in dialysis patients may be increased in those who are married. A meta-analysis of 169 studies (n &gt;39,000 patients), which were largely based upon patient self-report or clinician-administered instruments, found that the prevalence of depression increased approximately 1 percent for each 1 percent increase in the proportion of patients who were married [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, age, sex, race, employment status, and diabetic status were not associated with an increased risk of depression. In addition, the risk of depression was comparable in patients treated with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

          SCREENING

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         We suggest that primary care clinicians or the nephrology treatment team screen all patients on dialysis for depression every 6 to 12 months, provided that services are in place to ensure follow-up for diagnosis and treatment [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians should interview patients who screen positive to establish or rule out the diagnosis because screening is not sufficient for case-finding. Immediate referral to emergency psychiatric services is indicated for patients who endorse suicidal ideation with a plan and intent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Screening for depression in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is mandatory for dialysis facilities in the United States [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,15,16
         </a>
         ]. In addition, practice guidelines issued by the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend screening all adults for depression [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ] (the full guideline can be accessed through the website for the

         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]), as do guidelines from the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (National Kidney Foundation) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. The rationale for screening is that depression is serious, prevalent, underrecognized, readily diagnosed, and treatable, and that standardized, valid screening tools are available and feasible to use. However, the benefit of screening for depression in ESKD remains uncertain because there are no data that demonstrate screening improves outcomes in this patient population [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,21
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We typically use the self-report Patient Health Questionnaire – Nine Item (PHQ-9)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/z/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) to screen for depressive disorders in ESKD. A study that validated the instrument in dialysis patients found that the optimal cutoff score was 10 or greater; the sensitivity and specificity were each 92 percent and the positive predictive value was 71 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,22
         </a>
         ]. Reasonable alternatives include the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory and the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, both of which are also self-report measures that have been validated in ESKD. Results from the three scales should be interpreted judiciously because the instruments include items about appetite, energy, and sleep, impairment of which may reflect symptoms related to kidney failure and inadequate dialysis rather than depression [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A reasonable alternative to a screening tool is to ask questions such as, “During the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?” and “During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?” [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. For patients who endorse dysphoria or anhedonia, follow-up questions can better determine the patient's clinical status, including questions as to whether patients have thoughts about harming themselves.

         Information about screening for depression in the general population, including implementation and efficacy, is discussed separately. (See

         The evaluation for unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder)  (

          table 2

          table 3
         </a>
         ), minor depression  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106958" href="/z/d/graphic/106958.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ), and other depressive syndromes is generally similar in patients treated with maintenance dialysis and individuals in the general population [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1721.html" rel="external">
          "Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis", section on 'Assessment'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, evaluating dialysis patients for depression is complicated because some patients are unaware that they are depressed, deny it when asked, or refuse to acknowledge it. In a study of 186 patients who were treated with dialysis and screened positive for major depression, 55 percent declined further evaluation to confirm the diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. The inability to accept a diagnosis of depression may be due in part to the stigma of mental illness as a sign of weakness. For patients who positive screen but refuse further assessment for depression, ongoing intermittent education may eventually make additional assessment more palatable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another difficulty in assessing dialysis patients for major depression is that some symptoms of depression, such as anergia, anorexia, sleep disturbance, and psychomotor retardation can overlap with symptoms commonly observed in patients on dialysis, which may reflect inadequate dialysis or medication adverse effects [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. To manage this problem, clinicians can focus upon the five mood and cognitive symptoms of depression. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the cognitive symptoms of major depression involves impairment of concentration, memory, and decision making. More specific aspects of this impairment were examined in a prospective study of dialysis patients who either screened positive for depression (n = 220) or did not (n = 238); all patients underwent neuropsychological testing [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. After controlling for potential confounding factors such as demographics, general medical comorbidities, and laboratory parameters, the analyses showed that depressive symptoms were associated with general cognitive dysfunction as well as impairment of executive function (eg, planning, problem solving, and sequencing actions), immediate memory, delayed memory, and language. In addition, even relatively mild depression was associated with cognitive dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although neuropsychological testing is typically not part of the initial evaluation for depression in dialysis patients, it can be useful for cases in which it is difficult to differentiate major depression from neurodegenerative disorders such as delirium or dementia. However, assessing cognitive function in dialysis patients is often difficult because of patient limitations. In a prospective study that examined cognitive function in 767 patients on dialysis, data were missing in 48 percent [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. The reasons for missing data included visual impairment, lack of motivation, and motor impairment. In addition, patients with missing data were more likely to have depression than patients with complete cognitive testing data. Additional information about cognitive impairment in patients treated with dialysis, as well as assessing cognition, is discussed separately. (See

         In patients who are treated with maintenance dialysis, unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) is associated with multiple adverse medical outcomes. Across different studies, depression predicted pain, peritonitis, pruritus, cardiovascular events, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, withdrawal from dialysis, and all-cause mortality, as well as sleep disturbance, sexual dysfunction, diminished cognitive functioning, decreased quality of life, and suicide [

        </p>
        <p>
         Poor medical outcomes may be increased in dialysis patients with depression because dialysis is a complex treatment, and depression may interfere with the patient’s ability to follow treatment recommendations and lead to poor adherence [

         ]. In addition, depression may be associated with other adverse health-related behaviors such as inadequate dietary intake or substance use disorders, or depression may reflect general physical deterioration or a specific disease process such as cardiovascular illness or abnormal functioning of the immune system.

         </a>

         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The engagement interview used motivational interviewing to help patients accept the diagnosis of depression and engage in treatment of depression; during the control visit, the depression diagnosis and available treatment options were discussed. Both the engagement interview and control visit occurred at the bedside while the patient received hemodialysis. The number of patients who accepted treatment for depression within one month was similar for the engagement interview and control visit (66 and 64 percent).

        <p>
         Patients on maintenance dialysis with depression may refuse starting treatment for depression or modifying existing treatment that is ineffective because they attribute the depressive syndrome to a recent acute event, chronic illness, or dialysis [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. In addition, patients may not want to take yet another medication or exert the effort required by psychotherapy, or psychotherapy may not be available [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Nephrologists may also decline initiating or modifying treatment for depression.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients on maintenance dialysis who have acute unipolar major depression, we suggest treating the depressive syndrome with an antidepressant plus psychotherapy. However, pharmacotherapy alone is reasonable for patients who decline or do not have access to psychotherapy, and antidepressant monotherapy may be superior to psychotherapy alone. In addition, psychotherapy alone is reasonable for patients who want to avoid the adverse effects of antidepressants and drug-drug interactions. Relatively few head-to-head, randomized trials have compared these three standard treatment regimens in dialysis patients, and clinicians should attempt to accommodate patient preferences. Other factors that help determine which treatment to prescribe are prior treatment history and cost.

However, there may be uncertainty about the diagnosis, or these clinicians may not be comfortable treating depression and thus refer patients to psychiatrists or other mental health clinicians if these specialists are available; referrals are also made if requested by patients.

         – For patients on maintenance dialysis who have unipolar major depression, treating the depressive syndrome with antidepressant monotherapy is a reasonable alternative to the combination of an antidepressant plus psychotherapy.

          SSRIs
         </strong>
         – In treating comorbid major depression in dialysis patients who prefer antidepressant monotherapy, we generally select an SSRI because SSRIs have demonstrated efficacy, are well tolerated, and have been more widely studied and may be more cost effective than other antidepressants [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. One review noted that SSRIs are among the top 10 drugs prescribed to dialysis patients [

         Although there is no evidence that one SSRI is more efficacious than another, we typically choose

          sertraline

         because of its demonstrated efficacy in dialysis patients treated for depression. In addition, the dose of sertraline does not need to be adjusted in patients undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and sertraline is not likely to cause drug-drug interactions that can lead to adverse side effects. Reasonable alternatives to sertraline include

         , which is the single isomer formulation of citalopram, may also prolong the corrected QT interval, the FDA concluded that the finding was not clinically significant and did not justify a warning. Nevertheless, we also avoid escitalopram in patients with ESKD because patients receiving maintenance dialysis are at increased risk of adverse cardiac events due to comorbid cardiovascular disease, electrolyte shifts during dialysis, and use of other medications that can prolong the QT interval [

After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, demographics, comorbid disorders, and concurrent medications), the analyses found that the one-year risk of sudden cardiac death following onset of antidepressant treatment was greater with citalopram or escitalopram than fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, or sertraline (hazard ratio 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3). The association between citalopram or escitalopram and sudden cardiac death appeared to be stronger in patients aged 65 years or more, females, patients with conduction disorders, or patients prescribed other QT-prolonging drugs.

          Efficacy
         </strong>
         – Evidence supporting the use of antidepressants for treating unipolar major depression in dialysis patients includes meta-analyses of randomized trials in the general population of adults with unipolar major depression, which demonstrate that antidepressants such as SSRIs are more efficacious than placebo.

In the subgroup of patients treated with SSRIs (16 trials, n &gt;1100), response occurred more often with active treatment than placebo (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.5). However, all-cause discontinuation of SSRIs was more likely in patients treated with antidepressants, as was dry mouth and sexual dysfunction.

CBT included standard components adapted for maintenance dialysis, and consisted of 10 sessions, each lasting 60 minutes and administered at the chairside while patients received dialysis. Improvement of depression was modestly superior with sertraline than CBT. In addition, functioning at work and home and interpersonally were better in the sertraline group, as was satisfaction with life. However, adverse effects occurred more frequently with sertraline.

Although this format is convenient for patients and may thus increase treatment uptake and adherence to treatment, it is not clear that this is the optimal setting for administering CBT, compared with the therapist’s office, given the lack of privacy between dialysis stations.

          Psychotherapy monotherapy
         </strong>
         – Patients on maintenance dialysis who have unipolar major depression may decline treatment with antidepressant drugs and prefer treatment with psychotherapy alone, due to reasons such as a prior history of poor response to antidepressants, and concerns about their adverse effects  (

         ) and drug-drug interactions with other medications. For these patients, we suggest monotherapy with CBT or another psychotherapy, such as interpersonal psychotherapy and problem-solving therapy. Other reasonable choices include behavioral activation, family and couples therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and supportive psychotherapy. (See

Although we suggest that these alternative treatments be used adjunctively with standard treatment, it is reasonable to use them alone in patients with mild to moderate depression who prefer this approach. During monotherapy with one of these alternative approaches, clinicians can continue to educate patients about depression and the potential benefits of standard treatments.

         – For patients on maintenance dialysis who have unipolar major depression, we suggest treating the depressive syndrome with an antidepressant plus psychotherapy rather than monotherapy (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). We typically use a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as

         Medication monotherapy – Patients on maintenance dialysis who have unipolar major depression may prefer using medication monotherapy due to a prior history of poor response to psychotherapy, or psychotherapy may not be available. For these patients, we suggest an SSRI (
