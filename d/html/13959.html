         In 2022, more than 280 million people lived outside their country of birth [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ]. Migration patterns are dynamic, reflecting political, environmental, and social factors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among refugee, immigrant, and migrant (RIM) groups, morbidity and mortality rates from certain infectious diseases (eg, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and hepatitis B) and noncommunicable diseases (eg, hemoglobinopathies/thalassemias) may be less familiar to clinicians than those found in native-born populations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Components of the health assessment include patient health concerns, screening for diseases associated with the migration history, initiating age-appropriate immunizations, and routine health care maintenance. Guidance on a broad range of topics related to immigrant and refugee health in the United States is available from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [

         A "migrant" refers to a person who moves away from their place of residence (either within a country or across an international border), temporarily or permanently. Migrants who are forcibly displaced commonly fall into the following categories (other categories also exist):

         Refugee – Someone who, "owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country" [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Refugees seek to establish their status as a refugee having fled their country of origin and while residing in a country of first asylum.

         An "immigrant" refers to a person who moves to a new country with the purpose of permanently resettling in that country. Another common term used in the United States is "migrant worker", commonly referred to as an individual who moves from place to place frequently for a low-income position, most commonly in the agricultural industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since these terms are not well defined and used in different ways in different places, we will refer to the larger group as refugees, immigrants, and migrants (RIM) groups.

          SCREENING PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN THE UNITED STATES
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Most RIM populations to the United States undergo screening prior to arrival when they come through an official process. Those with refugee status who arrive through the US Refugee Resettlement System receive the most thorough screening through an organized system that includes the Department of State, the International Organization for Migration (United Nations Migration Agency), and the CDC.
        </p>
        <p>
         The predeparture medical examination and screening for all immigrants and refugees was initially developed to identify conditions of "public health significance" such as certain infections (eg, tuberculosis [TB], sexually transmitted diseases), illicit drug use, and severe psychiatric issues. Non-refugee status immigrants are required to receive vaccinations prior to departure for the United States; refugees are exempted from this requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
         For refugees, the screening approach has been broadened to include identification and management of conditions that may affect refugee health either during the migration process or following arrival. [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the CDC has expanded the predeparture immunization program for refugees and has implemented a presumptive treatment program for refugees from areas with endemic tropical infections (such as malaria and soil-transmitted parasites) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. All pre-departure medical evaluations and health interventions are conducted by officially designated "panel physicians" who follow instructions outlined and overseen by the CDC [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Other groups of migrants (such as visitors, short-term visa holders, and students) have no specific health requirements under normal circumstances, although may have requirements or recommendations from an educational institution or employer; these individuals may or may not have health and immunization records. Those arriving through non-traditional routes (eg, the Afghan evacuation), or through unofficial processes (eg, undocumented individuals, asylees) have no formal predeparture medical examination and screening but may have health and immunization records with them.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important for clinicians to clarify whether individuals have received any predeparture screening or treatment prior to arrival, since this will affect their initial evaluation and care following arrival. Even migrants who have been in the new country for a long period of time before being seen in the medical system may need screening, particularly those who may be at risk for certain diseases (eg, sickle cell disease or trait) or those with diseases with long latency periods (eg, viral hepatitis [B/C], TB, schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In the absence of documentation, it should not be assumed that a screening test has been done or that a vaccine or presumptive treatment has been administered.

         Establishing rapport is critical for productive clinical encounters with refugee, immigrant, and migrant (RIM) patients. Stressful factors, especially for new RIM patients, may include lack of familiarity with the health care system, language and cultural barriers, limited health literacy, and the possibility of prior emotional or physical trauma. Patients may be reluctant to discuss health problems due to concerns about affecting their immigration status.
        </p>
        <p>
         Health care providers in the arriving country may lack awareness of and familiarity with the predeparture health interventions, guidelines for post arrival screening, or best practices in migration health. Health care providers may also lack familiarity with illnesses seen more commonly in migrants, have difficulty with language and cultural barriers (including best practices in communicating through a professional interpreter), and find it challenging to perform the recommended significant workload of testing, immunization, and health maintenance activities in the limited amount of time for a typical visit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Screening tests and immunizations need not be completed in the first visit. Completion of all the required elements can be facilitated by establishing a trusting relationship at the outset to facilitate a return to clinic for follow-up. Inquiring about and addressing immediate medical or social concerns prioritized by the patient will help facilitate establishment of rapport. Repeating inquiries about general and family well-being at each subsequent visit reinforces empathy and compassion. Effective listening and trust building may elicit additional concerns not revealed initially.

         Use of medically trained interpreters improves patient health care outcomes, and offering these services is required by US law [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. Culturally and linguistically appropriate educational materials and use of bilingual/bicultural health educators are also essential for care; resources may be found at the National Resource Center for Refugees, Immigrants and Migrants [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The health history should include standard elements such as current and prior medical problems, surgeries, pregnancies and their outcomes, medications (including complementary and alternative), allergies, and immunizations. Family history should also be elicited.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mental health issues deserve special attention; many migrants have lost not only their homeland but also family members to disease, war, or forced separation. Many have experienced rape or torture or have been victimized during their migration, including by government or border officials; this information may not be offered in early interviews. Mental health screening should occur in the first or second visit and include assessment for suicide risk and other issues. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mental health screening'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Social history should include inquiring about current living conditions as well as a thorough migration history, including regions of residence and travel. Migrants may spend many years enroute, which may include time in remote, rural settings, urban areas, or in refugee camps, frequently in multiple countries. Other important components of the social history include formal education level, languages spoken including preferred spoken and written language for interacting with the health system, occupational history, and current support system.
        </p>
        <p>
         Initial health encounters should also address issues such as explaining how to navigate the local medical care delivery system, including the concept of primary care, access to after-hours care, and when and how to utilize emergency services. The concept of preventive care may be unfamiliar, and time should be devoted to making sure patients understand the importance of routine preventive care. Emphasizing the importance of establishing a medical home and primary care provider is critical.

         Vital signs and growth parameters (height, weight, and head circumference in young children) should be measured and compared with age- and sex-based norms. Migrants may be underweight or overweight, undernourished or overnourished, and/or have specific nutritional deficiencies. They may have acute or chronic health conditions (such as hypertension and diabetes) which have gone undiagnosed or have not been revealed. Assessment of vision and hearing is important since deficiencies can affect work/school performance, job placement, and general quality of life and integration. Dental caries and other dental problems are common and should be addressed early, along with education about ongoing oral hygiene and dental care.
        </p>
        <p>
         A complete physical examination should be performed. If there are no acute issues, a genital examination may be deferred to a follow-up appointment once trust has been established and the patient is prepared. Attention should be paid to findings that may reflect previously undiagnosed medical conditions, traditional cultural practices, or signs of abuse or torture. For example, skin lesions may reflect parasitic infection, traditional healing methods (scarification), or physical signs of previous trauma. Examples of important clinical findings include hepatosplenomegaly (a clue that may suggest hyperreactive malaria syndrome or schistosomiasis) and heart murmur (suggesting a broad array of conditions ranging from anemia to rheumatic heart disease or Chagas infection). Genital examination may reveal female genital cutting or hydrocele from filariasis. (See

         The optimal approach to serologic testing for immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases is uncertain but varies with likelihood of previous vaccination or infection. For example, serologic testing may be appropriate for varicella and hepatitis A because of high population prevalence. Screening for chronic hepatitis B infection and immunity should be done [

         RIM patients at risk for parasitic infections with ongoing signs or symptoms of infection, including an unexplained elevated eosinophil count, should have diagnostic testing performed even if exposure is remote. Testing should include stool studies for ova and parasites and serology for strongyloides; additional testing should be tailored to epidemiologic exposure, and may include serologies for filaria, and/or schistosomes (along with urine sediment for schistosomes).

For high-risk individuals from areas that are highly endemic for malaria (where persons may be infected but asymptomatic), presumptive treatment is preferred given the cumbersome process for screening, which consists of three blood films at 12- to 24-hour intervals.

In addition, RIM groups may settle in areas of the country with older housing leading to risk of exposure after arrival. A baseline lead level can be useful to evaluate subsequent trends.
        </p>
        <p>
         Screening for lead is warranted following arrival and can be repeated three to six months later; this is particularly important for children between 6 months and 16 years of age and is also useful for pregnant patients [

         As an example, vitamin B12 deficiency has been observed with high prevalence among Bhutanese Nepali and Iraqi refugees. There is no consensus on universal screening for vitamin B12 deficiency; given the potential for long-term neurologic sequelae, some favor providing multivitamins with B12 to newly arriving migrants.

         There is a high prevalence of mental health issues among refugees, particularly those arriving from areas of civil unrest; these include major depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. For other migrant groups, the migrant journey and the stress of living undocumented in the United States is associated with increased risk for PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Mental health assessment includes a detailed social and psychiatric history; this is important but may be difficult to achieve in the initial visits.
        </p>
        <p>
         Assessing mental health is challenging and made even more difficult by language barriers, perceptions and conceptions of mental illness in other cultures, and lack of standardized screening instruments for different populations. The process of relocation may reflect a planned move for economic and educational pursuits, or an unwanted, unanticipated move brought about by unplanned circumstances. Discussing the individual's reasons for resettlement can allow greater understanding of stresses faced in the country of origin and along the migration route.
        </p>
        <p>
         RIM patients may have experienced loss of family members, personal health, and security. Many are victims of rape, torture, famine, or nutritional deprivation [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52

        </p>
        <p>
         Initial screening can be limited to questions to identify those with serious mental illness and risk for suicide. Subsequently, as rapport is established and depending on interventions available, a formal mental health assessment can be performed using a screening tool [

         ]. Significant cancer screening disparities are experienced by RIM in the United States. RIM patients should be asked if their reported age is accurate, as their stated age is often incorrect; inaccurate age may be associated with inappropriate or missed cancer screenings. Many RIM patients may be unfamiliar with the concept of cancer screening; additional effort to explain the rationale may be required. Women beyond the usual screening age for pap smears should have normal results (with co-testing for HPV) before ending cervical cancer screening.

         RIM are disproportionately affected by cancers attributable to infection. Infection-related cancers are far more common in parts of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa than in North America (31 percent versus 4 percent of cancers respectively); in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, more than 50 percent of all cancers are caused by infection;
         <em>
          Helicobacter pylori
         </em>
