         On occasion, athletes collapse. This can occur in the midst of competition, during practice, or at the completion of long endurance races. Often the cause is benign and the athlete recovers quickly and completely. However, in a small number of cases, collapse is caused by a serious or life-threatening medical condition or by traumatic injury. Clinicians responsible for providing medical supervision at endurance races and other athletic events must be prepared to evaluate, triage, and provide emergency medical care for the collapsed athlete [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses our approach to assessing, diagnosing, and stabilizing the collapsed athlete. Also provided are links to additional topics describing the management of specific conditions that may cause collapse. Medical planning for endurance sporting events is reviewed separately. (See

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         Collapse can be defined as failure of a physiologic system (eg, cardiovascular, pulmonary, nervous, or musculoskeletal); in the sporting environment, collapse means the athlete is unable to continue participating and unable to remove themselves under their own power from the race course or field due to such a failure [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Collapse is not necessarily defined by an alteration in the athlete's level of consciousness. While a cardiovascular arrhythmia may cause a complete loss of consciousness and exertional heat stroke may cause acute delirium, a musculoskeletal injury or a compilation of sickle cell trait can cause collapse without an alteration in consciousness, yet the athlete remains unable to render themselves off the sporting field without assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
         The National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research (NCCSIR), which is dedicated to compiling data on catastrophic sports injuries among high school and collegiate athletes in the United States, categorizes significant injury mechanisms as either direct or indirect [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Direct injuries result from performing skills required of the sport (eg, neck injury sustained by a tackler in American football or rugby), while indirect injuries are caused by systemic failure as a result of exertion while participating in a sport (eg, cardiac arrest sustained by a marathoner) or by a complication that was secondary to a nonfatal injury (eg, acute kidney injury due to exertional heat stroke). Direct and indirect mechanisms generally mean traumatic and exertional, respectively, and these are the terms we use in this topic. The challenge for the clinician assessing a collapsed athlete is to distinguish serious from benign causes, and to provide appropriate care expeditiously.

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         The epidemiology of collapsed athletes varies by sport, by whether collapse occurred during practice or competition, and by a range of potential risk factors, including characteristics of the individual participant (eg, comorbidities) and environmental conditions. Clinician understanding of the most likely potential diagnoses affects athlete morbidity and mortality, as it plays a fundamental role in preventive planning and acute management. The epidemiology literature, while limited, provides some guidance. Below we briefly review the epidemiology of the collapsed athlete by setting, including the important and common causes during endurance events and field sports, and by exertional and trauma-related causes of collapse.

         The epidemiology of collapse during mass participation endurance sporting events is well described and represents a subgroup of the total number of medical encounters. This epidemiology is discussed in greater detail separately; below we note some highlights of particular importance to clinicians assessing the collapsed athlete. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13816.html" rel="external">
          "Preparation and management of mass-participation endurance sporting events", section on 'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Medical conditions encountered at the finish areas of endurance races are relatively well defined. Exercise-associated postural hypotension (EAPH) accounts for nearly 60 percent of the medical encounters at the conclusion of marathons and ultramarathons [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 153,208 runners participating in 21.1- and 56-km races (Two Oceans Marathon) over an eight-year period, the overall incidence of exercise-associated collapse (EAC) was 1.5 (95% CI 1.31-1.71) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Longer race distance (incidence ratio [IR] 2.1; 95% CI 1.6-2.7) and slower running speed (IR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1-1.5) were significant risk factors for EAC.
        </p>
        <p>
         EAPH is a benign process that must be distinguished from the potentially life-threatening conditions that occur with far less frequency, including sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), exertional heat stroke (EHS), and exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). At triathlons, drowning may occur but is even less common. EAPH and the life-threatening conditions listed here occur more often at or near the finish line, but can present anywhere along the course of an endurance race. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial management of the collapsed athlete without trauma'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Environmental conditions affect both the incidence of medical encounters and the nature of the injuries sustained. Particularly in warm, humid conditions, EHS is significantly more common than the other life-threatening conditions mentioned above. Cold temperatures and high winds increase the risk for frostbite and hypothermia among participants in Nordic events (eg, cross-country skiing). (See

         The National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research (NCCSIR) of the United States categorizes athletic injury as either direct (traumatic) or indirect (exertional). Exertional injuries are caused by systemic failure as a result of physical exertion while participating in a sport (eg, EHS) or by a complication of a nonfatal injury (eg, seizure due to EAH). Traumatic injuries are sustained during the performance of techniques or actions required of the sport (eg, tackling in American football resulting in a catastrophic neck injury). (See

         According to the NCCSIR annual report, a total of 112 catastrophic injuries or illnesses occurred during high school and college sports in 2016 [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The majority occurred among high school athletes (81 percent). Of the exertional catastrophic events, 47.5 percent were fatal; the majority occurred during training or practice (65 percent) rather than competition. The majority of the exertional catastrophes were cardiac-related (60 percent) or secondary to exertion in the heat (22.5 percent). American football (35 percent), basketball (15 percent), and football (ie, soccer, 12.5 percent) accounted for the majority of exertional events. (See

         Exertional heat illness (EHI) is a potentially life-threatening cause of collapse among athletes playing during high heat and humidity. The epidemiology of EHI is discussed in detail separately. (See

         According to the NCCSIR 2016 annual report, over 60 percent of catastrophic events were the result of direct traumatic injury, occurring principally during competition (59.4 percent) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. American football competitions accounted for most such injuries (83.6 percent), followed by basketball. Thus, the estimated 1.1 million high school and 75,000 college athletes who participate in tackle football annually in the United States represent a relatively high-risk group for catastrophic injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nearly 15 percent of trauma-related catastrophes were fatal, with most occurring during competition (80.4 percent). The majority of deaths were due to injuries of the cervical spine (50.8 percent), followed by the head or brain (31.1 percent), and heart (ie, commotio cordis, 4.9 percent). (See

         According to a report from the US Centers for Disease Control, from 2005 to 2014 a total of 28 deaths (2.8 deaths per year) occurred from traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries among high school (24 deaths) and college (4 deaths) American football players [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Most deaths occurred during competitions and resulted from tackling or being tackled. All 4 of the college deaths and 14 (58 percent) of the 24 high school deaths occurred from 2010 to 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other sports with relatively high rates of catastrophic injury from trauma (although still rare overall) include ice hockey, lacrosse, gymnastics, track and field (eg, pole vault), and cheerleading [

          10-15

         EAPH (our preferred term), a subcategory of exercise-associated collapse (EAC), involves collapse after completion of an exertional event (eg, endurance race) in a
         <strong>
          conscious
         </strong>
         athlete who is unable to stand or walk unaided as a result of lightheadedness, faintness, or dizziness [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Runners with a normal or only mildly elevated core body temperature who collapse, and in whom major medical causes have been ruled out, typically have EAPH. Such patients are often described as "weak, wobbly, and dizzy."
        </p>
        <p>
         EAPH appears to be the most common condition confronted by medical providers attending to collapsed athletes at mass participation sporting events; however, clinicians must maintain vigilance for potentially life-threatening causes of EAC, such as cardiac arrest, exertional heat illness (EHI), and EAH. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Causes of collapse during exercise or sport'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         EAPH is a physiologic consequence of the specific training adaptations that occur in endurance athletes (eg, runners, triathletes, cyclists). Endurance training is associated with an increased cardiac output and volume load for the left and right ventricles. Repeated exposure to these conditions during endurance training causes the heart to compensate by developing eccentric hypertrophy, which manifests as a dilatation of the left ventricle and mild-to-moderate increases in left ventricular wall thickness. The increase in cardiac output causes trained athletes to develop a lower resting heart rate compared with nontrained individuals. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4948.html" rel="external">
          "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation", section on 'Athlete's heart'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, during exercise, the muscles of the lower extremities require increased blood flow and peripheral vascular resistance decreases to accommodate this need. To generate the large cardiac output, and counter the decrease in resting heart rate, athletes must increase their stroke volume. Maximum heart rate does not change with exercise training.
        </p>
        <p>
         Changes in skeletal muscle activity contribute to EAPH. During exercise, the repeated contractions of skeletal muscle increase venous return to the heart from the dilated lower extremity vasculature. When activity ceases, so too do these contractions, leading to diminished venous return. Large volumes of blood may pool in the lower extremities, thereby contributing to EAPH. In other words, the very adaptations that contribute to successful completion of endurance activities play a major role in the postural hypotension experienced by endurance athletes once exercise stops.
        </p>
        <p>
         Noakes was among the first to describe EAPH based on his work with long-distance runners in South Africa [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. He hypothesized that: "the most likely mechanism for exercise-associated collapse is a syncopal episode resulting from postural hypotension caused by a sudden cessation of exercise and loss of the skeletal muscle pump in the lower extremities." According to Noakes, additional factors that might contribute included mild dehydration, excessive effort during the race, and a reduction in the vasoconstrictor response to hypotensive stress brought on by long-term endurance training. Noakes' insights inform our approach to the management of EAPH, which is discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of exercise-associated postural hypotension'

         Sickle cell trait (SCT) is a carrier condition, usually with none of the symptoms of sickle cell anemia or other sickle cell diseases. However, SCT is associated with an increased relative risk of exercise-related sudden death in athletes. SCT is discussed in detail separately; some aspects of the relationship between SCT and exercise-related collapse are discussed below. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7145.html" rel="external">
          "Sickle cell trait"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In studies of military personnel, the risk of exercise-related death in warfighters with SCT is reported to be approximately 40 times higher than those without SCT, although the absolute risk of death remains small (approximately 1:3000 African American warfighters who are SCT positive). While the mechanism of ECAST is unknown, it is speculated that intravascular sickling is induced by relative hypoxia, acidosis, and hyperthermia in strenuously exercising muscles [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Intravascular sickling, in turn, is hypothesized to trigger a fulminant exertional rhabdomyolysis. Many patients can develop sustained acute exertional compartment syndromes, often involving multiple compartments. Most studies identify potential risk factors as excessive heat, poor hydration status, and lack of exercise acclimatization. ECAST may manifest as or comorbidly present with EHI. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13859.html" rel="external">

        </p>

         Most cases of ECAST occur during physical training or physical fitness testing [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. The initial presentation of ECAST is often confused with heat cramping, heat exhaustion, or EHS. Unlike EHS, ECAST often occurs early in a workout, before an athlete’s core temperature has had time to rise. Furthermore, ECAST is often a "conscious collapse," which may help differentiate it from an acute cardiac event or EHS. The most telling symptom of ECAST is increasing pain and weakness in the working muscles, especially the legs, buttocks, and low back [

         The first task of the clinician providing the initial care for a collapsed athlete without trauma is to distinguish life-threatening from benign conditions. This is accomplished by rapidly performing a focused history and physical examination. This is true regardless of whether the athlete has collapsed on a race course, track, or a playing field or court. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Life-threatening causes of collapse'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         A life-threatening injury or condition should be assumed for any athlete who collapses after direct trauma to the head, neck, or trunk. Such conditions as traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, cervical spine injury, and commotio cordis must be quickly recognized and managed [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         Team clinicians present at field-side may directly observe the collapse of the athlete, which may help them to distinguish dangerous from benign events. However, such distinctions can be difficult even when the collapse is witnessed.

        <p>
         Several studies have included assessments of video footage of fatal collapses. In one such study of six fatalities among soccer players, no athlete showed any sign of distress prior to collapse [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Four became unstable while standing and unexpectedly collapsed onto their backs, while two suddenly fell face down. All six had a fixed gaze and pupils when initially examined. In a second study, 13 deaths were analyzed (11 soccer, 2 martial arts) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. In 10 of 12 cases of cardiac–related collapse, the initial posture involved bowing and/or kneeling, followed by further collapse, often to a decubitus position. The authors concluded that in the absence of head injury, athletes who bow or kneel and then immediately collapse are likely to have sustained a life-threatening cardiac event.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Acute collapse without trauma during exercise frequently stems from a cardiac emergency, such as myocardial infarction, a complication of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or an arrhythmia [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians should assume that any athlete who collapses abruptly on the court or field during play, or on the course during an endurance event, is experiencing a cardiac emergency. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4948.html" rel="external">
          "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although a serious condition is possible, an athlete who collapses after the conclusion of an athletic event (during "cool-down period" or later) typically suffers from exercise-associated postural hypotension (EAPH), a benign condition that rapidly improves with supportive care [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. However, such athletes should be triaged expeditiously, including vital signs, and blood work if indicated, to confirm the benign nature of the collapse. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Exercise-associated postural hypotension (EAPH)'

         Vital signs and a focused physical examination help to distinguish serious from benign causes of collapse. Low blood pressure (&lt;90/60 mmHg), high blood pressure (&gt;180/110 mmHg), persistent relative tachycardia not improving with standard care (eg, patient supine with legs elevated above heart level), symptomatic bradycardia, hypothermia, and symptomatic hyperthermia (typically a rectal temperature &gt;40°C) are all signs of potentially life-threatening conditions.

        <p>
         Clinicians must look closely for signs of significant head injury, including depressed mental status, vision loss or decline, rhinorrhea or otorrhea, and diffuse facial swelling or obvious deformity. Midline cervical spine tenderness or deformity (eg, bony step-off) and any evidence of motor or sensory deficits suggest cervical spinal cord injury. Particularly in athletes who sustained chest trauma, such findings as a new, prominent heart murmur, muffled heart sounds or a rub, distant or asymmetric breath sounds, or poor air movement are concerning findings suggesting a life-threatening condition. Any sign suggesting significant injury mandates evaluation in the emergency department. (See

          Exercise collapse associated with sickle cell trait
         </strong>
         <strong>
          (ECAST)
         </strong>
         – Collapse in an athlete with known sickle cell trait. Athletes often remain conscious while slumping to the ground, complaining more of weakness than pain. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7145.html" rel="external">
          "Sickle cell trait"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Once these conditions are ruled out, the diagnosis of EAPH may be entertained. Of note, the clinical scenario may initially appear benign but may in fact be caused by a serious condition that is early in its evolution. Therefore, all athletes who collapse and receive medical care should be reassessed, including their response to any treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         If EAPH is suspected, the athlete is placed in a Trendelenburg or "feet up" position  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111041" href="/z/d/graphic/111041.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ) at the start of the evaluation. This helps to redistribute blood to the brain and torso and speeds recovery. The treatment of EAPH is discussed in greater detail below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of exercise-associated postural hypotension'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         EAPH is marked by facial flushing combined with a subtle or pronounced perioral vasoconstriction (diamond of vasoconstriction)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111042" href="/z/d/graphic/111042.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ) that resolves as the condition clears. By contrast, EHS and EAH present with facial pallor that is distinctly different, with no perioral vasoconstriction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Endurance athletes can appear "near death" upon crossing the finish line, only to walk out of the medical area 15 minutes later healthy and unharmed. However, distinguishing between EAPH and a life-threatening medical condition such as exertional heat illness (EHI) can be difficult even for seasoned sports medicine physicians, and clinicians must remain vigilant and assess each patient carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
         Contrary to common belief, dehydration is not a common cause of EAPH in most athletic settings. Intravenous (IV) fluids are rarely required for runners who have completed a marathon or shorter-distance races. Participants in extreme endurance activities may require IV fluids, once it is determined that acute hyponatremia is not present. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Determining whether IV fluid is necessary'
         </a>

         Regardless of setting, it is critical to perform a focused, rapid assessment of the collapsed athlete to identify and treat any life-threatening conditions. Nevertheless, the setting and nature of the collapse alter the list of the more likely life-threatening causes, thereby altering the immediate concerns and approach of the clinician. One critical piece of history is the location of the collapsed endurance athlete: collapse on the course is ominous; collapse
         <strong>
          after

         Careful preparation that anticipates the common medical conditions (including collapse) that a clinician may encounter at an endurance sporting event is imperative. Preparation for such events is discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13816.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Part of the medical preparation for every mass participation endurance sporting event should include the development of an emergency action plan (EAP)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118232" href="/z/d/graphic/118232.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). During the pre-race medical meeting, all key medical personnel should review the EAP together. If time allows, an EAP rehearsal helps to alleviate confusion and clarify defined roles in the event of an emergency.

         The longer the athlete is on a course, the higher the chance of developing exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. EAH typically occurs among slower, less experienced "charity" runners who tend to drink water at every break station during a marathon. (See

         Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is likely the most catastrophic event that can cause the collapse of an athlete during a court or field sport. Therefore, an AED must be available at court- or field-side, and deployed whenever a cardiac event is suspected. An interval of less than five minutes from collapse to administration of the first AED shock maximizes the likelihood of survival [

         EAPH and EAH are unlikely etiologies of collapse in field or court athletes.
        </p>
        <p>
         At a field or court event, the clinician may not have point-of-care laboratory testing available. The ability to obtain IV access, too, may be limited. If a metabolic abnormality, such as hypoglycemia, is suspected and the medical resources needed to care for the patient are unavailable, the athlete should be transported immediately to a higher level of care for testing and management. Basic interventions, such as giving oral glucose to the athlete with suspected hypoglycemia, may be performed at field-side.

        <p>
         At field and court venues used regularly for sport, an emergency action plan (EAP) should be in place that accounts for the limitations of the venue, including immediately available medical support and equipment, and coordination with local ambulance services and emergency departments (EDs). The EAP should be reviewed regularly. The key elements of an EAP are found in the table  (

         In sports that involve regular contact or collision between athletes, it may be obvious when an athlete has collapsed due to the effect of direct impact. If the traumatic incident was witnessed or seen on video replay, this may help determine the severity and nature of the injury. In some circumstances, however, it may be difficult to ascertain whether collapse occurred because of direct trauma. This may be due to a substantial delay between the impact and manifestations of injury (eg, small pneumothorax leading to tension physiology, splenic laceration with slow hemorrhage) or due to some other underlying cause of the collapse (eg, arrhythmia) unrelated or indirectly related to the impact [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians should assume the worst in cases of trauma-related collapse and assess the patient according to standard trauma protocols. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         When providing medical support for sports that involve regular contact or collision, it is critical to be prepared to manage SCA, head and neck injuries, airway injuries and respiratory distress, and chest injuries. An EAP for such scenarios should be in place, skilled medical personnel needed to implement such a plan should be at field-side, and all necessary equipment available. This includes an AED, and equipment for airway management and cervical spine stabilization [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Head and neck injuries caused by direct trauma are the leading cause of catastrophic injuries among athletes, often presenting immediately, but sometimes hours later (eg, subdural hemorrhage), with sudden collapse [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Any collapsed athlete who clearly sustained direct trauma to the head and neck, or may have sustained such trauma, must be assumed to have a cervical spine and traumatic brain injury until proven otherwise. The airway and cervical spine must be protected as indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although rare in sport, disruption of cardiac or major vascular structures (eg, aortic rupture) causes immediate collapse, and outcomes are usually dismal [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Among athletes who collapse immediately after sustaining a direct blow to the chest, commotio cordis is of greatest concern. This can occur with or without a protective chest pad in place [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, when approaching the unconscious athlete who collapsed immediately after direct trauma to the chest, be prepared to begin CPR and apply an AED to correct any lethal arrhythmia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15853.html" rel="external">
          "Commotio cordis"

        </p>
        <p>
         The athlete who sustains direct trauma to the chest and develops a pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, cardiac contusion, or other intrathoracic or chest wall injury rarely collapses immediately after sustaining that injury. Typically, some delay is needed for the effects of the injury to manifest. Any severe or increasing respiratory difficulty or pain or weakness warrants close evaluation of the athlete. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/353.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Abdominal trauma resulting in immediate collapse is rare in sport. Pain may cause the athlete to "buckle over" and possibly experience a pain-induced vasovagal event. Splenic laceration or rupture is the injury that most often leads to a delayed syncopal presentation, although this is uncommon [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. The clinician should perform a careful initial abdominal examination, followed by serial examinations if the pain is not resolving. The athlete must be evaluated at a higher level of care with imaging if there is any suspicion for splenic or other intraabdominal injury. (See

         Exercise-associated postural hypotension (EAPH) is likely the most common form of exercise-associated collapse (EAC), particularly among racers who collapse after crossing the finish line at mass participation sporting events (eg, road races, triathlons). Nevertheless, EAPH remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and the clinician must first rule out life-threatening causes of collapse. To help prevent EAPH, we encourage athletes, and medical personnel assisting athletes, to keep walking upon completion of an event. This helps to prevent venous pooling in the extremities and promotes active recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our recommended approach to assessment and initial management of the collapsed athlete is provided in the following table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118017" href="/z/d/graphic/118017.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         ); management of athletes more likely to have life-threatening causes of collapse are discussed above. (See

         If the initial assessment does not identify life-threatening conditions, the collapsed athlete presumed to have EAPH is managed as follows [

         Contrary to common belief, dehydration is not a common reason for EAPH in most settings, and treatment with intravenous (IV) fluids is rarely required for runners who have completed a marathon or shorter-distance races. Moreover, such treatment may be life-threatening if collapse is due to EAH from excessive intake of free water over the course of the race. Collapsed participants in longer-duration activities (eg, Iron Man races) may require IV fluids. (See

         IV fluids are rarely needed to manage EAPH. Indications for administering IV fluids are summarized in the following table  (

          table 7

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Over 12 years of finish-line care at the Twin Cities Marathon, only 106 IV catheters were placed out of 81,300 finishers [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The main reasons to start an IV in an athlete with EAPH include fluid replacement for those with persistent emesis or diarrhea, and administration of medications.
        </p>
        <p>
         The number of IVs started at an endurance race medical facility appears to vary according to the training and experience of the clinicians involved and their comfort managing collapsed athletes. Clinicians with less experience start more IVs, so close supervision by experienced staff reduces unneeded interventions. Aggressive IV hydration is rarely needed in post-race field management, and doing so runs the risk of exacerbating undetected acute hyponatremia (ie, EAH), which can be life threatening. Many race medical teams check a blood sodium concentration prior to administering IV fluids using a point-of-care device. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2290.html" rel="external">
          "Exercise-associated hyponatremia"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Current insights into the appropriate use of IV hydration in collapsed endurance athletes is due in large part to the research of Noakes and his colleagues, who found that EAPH is rarely due to dehydration. Noakes argued that the infusion of large volumes of IV fluid, a common practice previously, would be ineffective, as such fluids do not reverse the state of low peripheral vascular resistance causing the condition. Moreover, in cases where collapse is caused by acute hyponatremia due to excessive intake of free water, such treatment could be potentially life-threatening [

         <span class="glyph">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the patient is walking without any problem and meets all other criteria noted above, they may be discharged. Typically, recovery occurs within approximately 30 minutes, although it can take longer in some cases. The athlete should be given written discharge instructions that discuss continued fluid and energy replacement, criteria for reevaluation, and follow-up recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ideally, the athlete is handed off personally to family or friends as part of the transition out of the medical area. For athletes with more severe problems, transfer is made to an emergency department. For athletes thought to have EAPH but who are not responding to standard treatment, transfer to the hospital is appropriate. Admission or continued observation may be needed for such patients if they are unable to tolerate oral fluids or have persistent diarrhea.

          Definitions and causes of athlete collapse
         </strong>
         – Adult athletes collapse when the cardiovascular, pulmonary, nervous, or musculoskeletal system fails, making the athlete unable to continue participating and unable to remove themselves from the race course or field under their own power. Exercise-associated postural hypotension (EAPH) is the most common cause of collapse at the conclusion of endurance races, but it must be distinguished from the potentially life-threatening conditions that occur with far less frequency, including sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), exertional heat stroke (EHS), and exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). Collapse during field or court sports may be related to exertion or trauma. Other potential life-threatening causes of collapse during sport include anaphylaxis, insulin shock, and asthma exacerbation. (See

          Exercise-associated postural hypotension
         </strong>
         – EAPH involves collapse after completion of an exertional event (eg, endurance race) in a
         <strong>
          conscious
         </strong>
         athlete who is unable to stand or walk unaided due to lightheadedness, faintness, or dizziness. EAPH develops from a precipitous decline in venous return immediately following cessation of activity. EAPH is a benign condition that rapidly improves with supportive care. (See

          Timing of collapse

         Any sign suggesting significant injury mandates evaluation in the emergency department. Clinicians must look closely for signs of head injury, including depressed mental status, vision loss or decline, rhinorrhea or otorrhea, and diffuse facial swelling or obvious deformity. Midline cervical spine tenderness or deformity and any evidence of motor or sensory deficits suggest cervical spinal cord injury.

         Particularly in athletes who sustained chest trauma, such findings as a new, prominent heart murmur, muffled heart sounds or a rub, distant or asymmetric breath sounds, or poor air movement are concerning and suggest a life-threatening condition. (See
