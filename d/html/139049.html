         A tracheostomy is defined as an opening into the anterior wall of the trachea. The procedure that creates a tracheostomy is called a tracheotomy. A tracheostomy tube or cannula is placed through the tracheostomy to provide a mechanism for ventilation and airway protection.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss preanesthesia assessment and intraoperative airway management for patients with a tracheostomy in place. The tracheostomy procedure is discussed separately.

         In addition to routine preoperative evaluation for anesthesia, assessment should include determining the indication for tracheostomy, when the tracheostomy was placed, existing airway anatomy, and type and size of the tracheostomy device in place. These issues will inform the plan for airway management. The ADIOS-PP mnemonic can be used when assessing the patient with a tracheostomy prior to anesthesia and is shown in a table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140306" href="/z/d/graphic/140306.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Determining the feasibility of oral or nasal intubation preoperatively is of critical importance in case of intraoperative loss of the tracheostomy airway. Knowing the age of the tracheostomy is imperative, as manipulation of an immature tracheostomy tract may result in devastating complications. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131521.html" rel="external">
          "Tracheostomy: Postoperative care, maintenance, and complications in adults", section on 'Early (within 7 to 10 days)'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other than patients who have had a laryngectomy, routine airway evaluation should be performed to assess for potential difficulty with mask ventilation and/or intubation should the tracheostomy tube become dislodged or fail.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients should be asked whether there are typically any problems during routine tracheostomy tube changes, and what maneuvers may be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
         Important comorbidities that may affect the plan for airway management include severe obesity, coagulopathy, and chronic respiratory failure.

         The reason the tracheostomy was placed should help determine whether oral or nasal intubation would be possible, and whether the patient would be able to breathe adequately, in case of unexpected inability to ventilate through the tracheostomy. Oral and nasal intubation are not possible in patients who have had a laryngectomy and may be difficult or impossible in patients with upper airway obstruction due to fractures, upper airway masses, or other anatomic abnormalities.

        <p>
         Maturation of the tracheostomy tract occurs over several weeks. Elective tube change is often delayed until seven days after placement because of the increased risk of complications with earlier tube change. Tracheostomy tube replacement while the tract is immature increases the risk of inserting the tube in the pre-tracheal or peristomal tissue through a false passage. This may result in inability to ventilate, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, hemorrhage, or infection [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-6
         </a>
         ]. The risk is higher when the stoma tract is longer because of severe obesity or edema [

         Tracheostomy tubes are available in a variety of styles and dimensions. When positive pressure ventilation is necessary, a cuffed, non-fenestrated tube must be in place. If the tube must be replaced prior to anesthesia, it should usually be replaced with a similar diameter tracheal tube.

         Characteristics and parts of available tracheostomy tubes are discussed in detail separately  (

         The size of tracheostomy tubes is commonly labeled according to the internal diameter (ID) expressed in millimeters [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ], (eg, a size 7 tube has an internal diameter of 7 mm). For dual cannula tubes the size refers to the internal diameter of the outer cannula. Importantly, dimensions of tracheostomy tubes for a given size are not standardized across manufacturers, and may not be the same as the same size tracheal tube. The internal and external diameters are printed on the flange of the tracheostomy tube, and are also printed on tracheal tubes  (

          Inflatable cuff
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Inflatable cuffs are necessary for patients who require positive pressure ventilation. Not all tracheostomy tubes have cuffs.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Some tracheostomy tubes meant for chronic use have a “tight to shaft” cuff, which contracts around the shaft of the tube when not inflated  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef140168" href="/z/d/graphic/140168.html" rel="external">
          picture 4
         </a>
         ). These are high pressure, low volume cuffs, and are not used for patients who require the cuff inflated for most of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Tight to shaft tracheostomy tubes may be used for positive pressure ventilation during short procedures but should be used cautiously for longer anesthetics to avoid injury of the tracheal mucosa. For some of these tubes (eg, the Bivona Tight to Shaft tube), the cuff must be filled with water rather than air, because air leaks out of the cuff over time. As these are low-volume high-pressure cuffs, the measured cuff pressure does not reflect the pressure exerted by the cuff on the tracheal mucosa. Thus, minimal occlusive volume should be used to prevent tracheal mucosal ischemia if the tube is used for longer anesthetics.

          Fenestration

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Some tracheostomy tubes consist of two cannulae; the inner cannula is a tube of smaller diameter designed to fit closely inside the outer cannula. A locking mechanism secures the two cannulae together  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef127992" href="/z/d/graphic/127992.html" rel="external">
          picture 2

         ). The inner cannula can be removed for cleaning without having to remove the outer tube from the stoma. Importantly, the standard 15 mm connector for ventilation devices may be part of either the inner or outer cannula, depending on the tube in place. Airway resistance will be higher during ventilation through the smaller inner cannula. Both single and dual cannula tracheostomy tubes are available in cuffed and uncuffed versions.

         When creating a plan for airway management, important decisions include whether airway management would be possible from above (ie, by mask, supraglottic airway, oral or nasal intubation), whether the tracheostomy tube should be changed, and if so, whether a surgeon should be present or involved in replacing the tube  (

          Patients with a mature tracheostomy tract

         – For most patients with a mature tracheostomy who will be positioned prone or lateral or who will be repositioned during surgery, we change the tracheostomy tube to a wire reinforced tracheal tube, whether the tracheostomy tube is cuffed or uncuffed. Reinforced tubes are flexible and resist kinking.

         The stiffness of the tracheostomy tube and its connection with the anesthesia breathing circuit increases the risk of dislodgement, tracheal trauma, and impaired ventilation in the prone position or when the patient is repositioned [

         </a>
         ]. The length of the tracheal tube allows access to the connection of the anesthesia circuit to the tube for suctioning of tracheobronchial secretions with a suction catheter if needed. It also permits the introduction of a flexible scope for troubleshooting airway problems (eg, ruling out main stem intubation).

         For most anesthetics, the clinician must plan for the possible need for positive pressure ventilation, whether required for the planned surgery, or in the case of loss of ventilation through the tracheostomy tube. This may determine whether the existing tube must be exchanged.

         For these patients having surgery in the supine position, there is usually no need to change the tracheostomy tube, unless required by the procedure (eg, for bronchoscopy with an existing tube too small to fit the bronchoscope). For patients who have a tight to shaft (TTS) cuffed tube in place and who will undergo a very long procedure, we consider exchanging the tube. TTS cuffs are high pressure low volume cuffs and can cause injury to the tracheal mucosa with prolonged use. (See

         The tracheostomy tube should be replaced prior to general anesthesia for most patients with an uncuffed or fenestrated tube in place. For patients with uncuffed tracheostomy tubes undergoing procedures in the supine position that can be performed with intravenous sedation or anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation (eg, some endoscopic gastrointestinal procedures, some cystoscopies, selected interventional radiology or electrophysiology procedures), the procedure can be started without exchanging the tracheostomy tube. If oxygenation or ventilation becomes inadequate the uncuffed tracheostomy tube should be exchanged for a cuffed tracheal tube.

         Insert the tube just until the proximal border of the tube cuff passes all the way through the tracheostomy tract, to minimize the risk of mainstem intubation. The distance from the tracheal stoma to the carina is usually 5 to 7 cm (longer in taller patients) [

          AIRWAY MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS WITH T-TUBES
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         There are special concerns for airway management for patients with t-tubes in place [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21-23
         </a>
         ]. T-tubes are used in patients with conditions that scar, compress, or narrow the airway (eg, tumors, caustic tracheal damage, radiation injury, tracheal or subglottic stenosis), or tracheomalacia [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-12,24
         </a>
         ]. In these patients, oral and nasal intubation may be difficult or impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Positive pressure ventilation through a t-tube is challenging. The extratracheal limb has no connector for ventilation devices, and the tracheal limb is open on both ends. Thus, in order to ventilate through the t-tube, an adaptor must be used for the extratracheal limb, and the upper airway must be sealed.
        </p>
        <p>
         In an emergency when the techniques described here are ineffective for ventilation, the t-tube should be removed by pulling on the horizontal limb. A cuffed tracheal tube should then be inserted into the trachea through the tracheostomy stoma.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several techniques have been used to ventilate patients with a t-tube. The choice of technique will depend on the patient’s anatomy, the size of the tracheal limb relative to the trachea, and any degree of upper airway obstruction. Examples of reported techniques include the following:

          Ventilate with a supraglottic airway
         </strong>
         – Insert a supraglottic airway (SGA) and cap or plug the horizontal limb of the t-tube. Two options for positive pressure ventilation with an SGA in the patient with a t-tube in place are shown in a figure  (

          figure 4

         For patients who will be positioned prone or lateral or will be repositioned during surgery and whose tracheostomy was placed &gt;7 days prior, we change the existing tube for a wire reinforced tracheal tube to reduce the risk of dislodgement or kinking. For patients with an immature tracheostomy tract (ie, placed &lt;7 days prior), we balance the risk of difficulty with tube exchange versus the likelihood of tube dislodgement.

          Tracheostomy tube exchange
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Tracheostomy tubes can be exchanged prior to induction of anesthesia in patients with chronic tracheostomies. For other patients we usually exchange the tube after induction and paralysis to prevent coughing and to facilitate airway management in case of difficult tube exchange. The technique for tube exchange is described above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Tube exchange'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
         </strong>
         For patients who had a tracheostomy tube exchanged for anesthesia, the tube should be exchanged back to the original type of tube while the patient is still in the operating room anesthetized. (See

          Airway management in patients with t-tubes

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         For effective ventilation in patients with t-tubes in place, the breathing circuit must be connected to the extratracheal limb (which has no standard connector), and the upper airway or the cranial portion of the tracheal limb must be sealed.  (

         <strong>
         </strong>
         Inability to ventilate through a tracheostomy tube may be due to tube obstruction or displacement of the tube. Management of a displaced tracheostomy tube during anesthesia is shown in an algorithm  (
