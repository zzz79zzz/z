         Lyme disease is the most common tickborne disease in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It is a spirochetal infection caused by species in the spirochete family
         <em>
          Borreliaceae
         </em>
         . The taxonomy of these spirochetes is undergoing revision, and the genus name may be represented as either
         <em>
          Borrelia
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          Borreliella
         </em>
         . In either case, the abbreviation for the genus is "B" and stands for both terminologies in the discussion below.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Borrelia burgdorferi
         </em>
         in the United States and primarily
         <em>
          B. afzelii
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          B. garinii
         </em>
         in Europe and Asia are transmitted by the bite of infected
         <em>
          Ixodes
         </em>
         <em>
          ricinus
         </em>
         complex ticks. Lyme disease can involve the skin, joints, nervous system, and heart. In the United States,
         <em>
          Ixodes
         </em>
         ticks can also transmit human granulocytic anaplasmosis and babesiosis. In Europe, they can also transmit tickborne encephalitis virus, and in the US, they may transmit a closely related virus called the Powassan encephalitis virus (also called the deer-tick virus).
        </p>
        <p>
         Ticks have three stages in their life cycle: larva, nymph, and adult. Lyme disease is most commonly transmitted by nymphal ticks, which are typically most active during the late spring and early summer in temperate regions. Adult ticks can also transmit Lyme disease, but this occurs less commonly because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and because they are larger and thus more likely to be detected and removed promptly. Adult ticks are most active on warm days in the fall.
        </p>
        <p>
         Individuals at highest risk for Lyme disease are those who live in an endemic region and have occupational (eg, forestry and telephone line workers) or recreational (eg, hunting, camping, hiking, gardening, children playing in wooded areas) exposure to ticks  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80168" data-inline-graphics="80168" href="/z/d/graphic/80168.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). However, in highly endemic areas, people may be at risk even in their yards, particularly where grassy areas and woodlands meet.
        </p>
        <p>
         The factors affecting transmission of Lyme disease, methods for tick removal, and indications for antibiotic prophylaxis following a tick bite are reviewed here. The epidemiology, microbiology, prevention, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of Lyme disease are discussed separately. (See

         Tick size and appearance can be helpful clues for determining the risk of disease transmission, but the validity of this information is highly dependent upon the expertise of the person viewing the tick. Patients sometimes confuse tick bites with bites by other types of arthropods. As an example, in one study 6 percent of specimens submitted by clinicians for tick identification were actually arthropods (most commonly beetles and lice) rather than ticks [
         <a href="#rid1">

         Nymphal
         <em>
          Ixodes
         </em>
         ticks are typically tiny and round (about the size of a poppy seed) before feeding. Nymphal stages of the American dog tick,
         <em>
          Dermacentor variabilis
         </em>
         , rarely bite humans, and nymphal stages of the lone star tick,
         <em>
          Amblyomma americanum
         </em>
         , are larger in comparison to

         <em>

         <em>
          Ixodes
         </em>
         ticks are orange-reddish, with a dark brown oval-shaped structure called a scutum covering the superior portion of the dorsal surface  (

          picture 2

         ); in contrast, the dorsal surface of male
         <em>
          Ixodes
         </em>
         ticks is uniformly brown since the entire surface is covered by a large scutum  (

          figure 2

         ). Adult female
         <em>
          A. americanum
         </em>
         ticks have a solitary white spot on their back (the "lone star")  (

          picture 3

         ). Adult male
         <em>
          A. americanum
         </em>
         ticks have an interconnected ring of white markings  (

         and
         <em>
          Amblyomma
         </em>
         ticks are not vectors of Lyme disease, although the former can transmit Rocky Mountain spotted fever and the latter is the vector of human monocytic ehrlichiosis.
         <em>
          Amblyomma
         </em>
         ticks have also been implicated in STARI (Southern tick-associated rash illness), which causes an expanding skin lesion similar to erythema migrans (EM). Although an infectious agent is thought to be the cause of STARI, none has yet been conclusively identified [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. While the skin lesion of STARI is similar to the EM rash of Lyme disease, STARI is not known to have the later manifestations associated with Lyme disease. (See

         Ticks that are feeding are firmly attached to the skin. A tiny, round tick that is walking on the skin surface or that is easily removed has not yet started the feeding process and is thus not capable of transmitting Lyme disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The duration of tick attachment is important in assessing the risk of transmission of Lyme disease.
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         are rarely transmitted within the first 48 hours of tick attachment [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8
         </a>
         ]. As examples:

         </span>
         A study of Lyme disease prevention found that among subjects bitten by nymphal ticks in whom the duration of attachment could be estimated, the risk of Lyme disease was 25 percent if the tick had fed for 72 hours compared with 0 percent if the tick had fed for a shorter period [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. A separate study found that the incidence of Lyme disease was significantly higher when the duration of attachment was at least 72 hours: 3 of 15 such patients (20 percent) developed Lyme disease, compared with 1 of 94 (1 percent) in whom the tick was attached for less than 72 hours [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         ].

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In another study, the risk of Lyme disease transmission from a firmly attached but unengorged tick was only 1 percent in a trial that was performed in a Lyme-endemic area in which approximately 15 percent of ticks were infected with
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         As feeding ticks become engorged with blood, they release their saliva into the bite wound. However, animal studies suggest that spirochetes are not found in the tick’s saliva until approximately 48 hours after it starts to feed. One study, for example, found that spirochetes are restricted to the lumen of the tick gut in unfed
         <em>
          Ixodes
         </em>
         ticks [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. When the nymphal ticks fed on mice, the number of spirochetes in the gut subsequently increased. It was only after 48 hours of feeding that the spirochetes disseminated to the salivary glands. Although similar studies have not been done in humans, it is anticipated that the behavior of the organism will be similar.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 48-hour period required for
         <em>
          B. burgdorferi
         </em>
         to migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands of the
         <em>
          Ixodes
         </em>
         tick contrasts with the much shorter time required for ticks of the same species to transmit the organisms that cause human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA, previously called human granulocyte ehrlichiosis;
         <em>
          Anaplasma phagocytophilum
         </em>
         ) and babesiosis (
         <em>
          Babesia microti
         </em>
         ).
         <em>
          Babesia
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          Anaplasma
         </em>
         spp are present in the tick's salivary glands before feeding has begun. Thus, the duration of tick attachment is less important for the risk assessment of transmission of these diseases. The transmission times for other less common tick borne illnesses (eg,
         <em>

         Although it is often difficult to determine how long a tick has been attached, it may be helpful if the patient can remember a situation in which he or she could have acquired a tick bite (eg, a walk through the woods).
        </p>
        <p>
         Ticks detach and fall off after becoming engorged from a blood meal. Engorged ticks are larger and have a globular shape  (

         To minimize retention of residual tick parts in the skin, various tick removal techniques have been studied. No studies have evaluated whether tick removal techniques affect the transmission of
         <em>

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Proper technique for removal of an attached tick includes the following steps  (

         </span>
         Use fine-tipped tweezers (or small forceps) to grasp the tick as close to the skin surface as possible. The tweezers should grasp the head of the tick and avoid compressing the tick’s body. In the absence of tweezers or forceps, remove by hand using paper or cloth to protect the fingers during tick extraction.

         Do not squeeze, crush, or puncture the body of the tick because its fluids may contain infectious agents.

         Do not jerk or twist the tick since this may cause mouth-parts to break off and remain in the skin.

         If the tick’s mouth-parts remain in the skin, we suggest waiting for the parts to fall out spontaneously; digging them out may increase the risk of soft tissue infection [

         After removing the tick, disinfect the bite site and cleanse your hands with alcohol or soap and water.

         After tick removal, the bitten person (or caregivers) should observe the bite site for the development of erythema migrans (EM) for 30 days. Components of tick saliva can cause transient erythema that should not be confused with EM.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Techniques that are not recommended include the application of petroleum jelly, fingernail polish, isopropyl alcohol, or a hot match. Unlike the use of tweezers, these techniques have been found to increase the likelihood of tick mouth-parts being left in host skin [

        <p>
         In some countries, such as Australia, freezing ticks before removal is advocated because the local ticks (
         <em>
          Ixodes holocyclus
         </em>
         ) cause toxin-mediated paralysis, and there is concern that removal without killing first may increase toxin release. However, in most other settings this is not necessary [

To this end, several studies have investigated the efficacy of giving antibiotics at the time of a tick bite to prevent Lyme disease.

Data from this trial suggest that it would be necessary to give doxycycline to approximately 40 people to prevent one case of Lyme disease; 125 people would need to be treated if the efficacy was at the lower end of the calculated confidence interval. These estimates were based on exposure to ticks in an area with a relatively high incidence of Lyme disease (Westchester County, New York, where the incidence of Lyme disease was 0.5 to 1.0 reported cases per 1000 persons per at the time of the study). In most areas of the United States, the risk of Lyme disease is much lower, and thus the benefit of prophylactic doxycycline would be correspondingly much lower as well.

          Risk of resistance
         </strong>
         – A potential concern with antibiotic prophylaxis is, if it is not successful in eradicating the bacteria, whether there will be changes in the course of infection that will make it difficult to diagnose Lyme disease or make it more resistant to subsequent treatment. There is currently no evidence to support this concern.

         In most cases we do not send ticks for species identification if a tick is removed and available for testing. Although some clinicians find it helpful, as this information can be used to counsel patients on the potential risk of Lyme disease or other coinfections [

In contrast, if the tick has been attached for ≥36 hours, then prophylaxis is recommended and a delay in initiation of prophylaxis while awaiting results of testing could be detrimental.
