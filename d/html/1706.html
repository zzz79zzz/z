         Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first line antidepressants for multiple psychiatric disorders. However, these drugs can interfere with different aspects of sexual functioning, including desire, arousal, and orgasm [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction occurs in both males and females, and can lead to nonadherence.
        </p>
        <p>
         The frequency of sexual side effects may vary among the different SSRIs. Although it is not known how SSRIs impair sexual functioning, the symptoms appear to be dose dependent [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ] and genetic polymorphisms may be involved [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Sexual side effects can occur with other classes of antidepressants, including serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors; however, there are more studies of sexual dysfunction secondary to SSRIs [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Unipolar major depression can also impair sexual functioning, and treatment with an SSRI can improve satisfaction [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].

         This topic reviews the management of sexual dysfunction caused by SSRIs. The pharmacology, administration, and other side effects of SSRIs are discussed separately. (See

         Studies of sexual problems secondary to SSRIs often underestimate the problem due to methodologic problems, including absence of baseline assessments and comparison groups, and different definitions of sexual dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid2">

        </p>
        <p>
         Sexual dysfunction is one of the most common adverse effects of SSRIs [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Although the incidence of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction in different studies ranges widely from approximately 15 to 80 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,6,7
         </a>
         ], the best estimate is that sexual impairment occurs in roughly 50 percent of patients treated with SSRIs:

         A cross-sectional survey of 704 patients who had started SSRIs or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors estimated that treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction occurred in approximately 50 percent [
         <a href="#rid8">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         SSRI-related sexual dysfunction is observed more often in females because they are treated with SSRIs more frequently than males (in a ratio of 2:1) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although there are rare, anecdotal reports of adverse sexual effects persisting for months or years after discontinuation of SSRI use, there is no compelling evidence that SSRI-induced sexual side effects persist after discontinuation. Based upon our clinical experience, sexual side effects induced by SSRIs resolve soon after the medication is stopped.

         SSRIs may worsen pre-existing impairment or cause new onset of dysfunction. We thus suggest that clinicians ask about sexual functioning prior to administering these drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
         When SSRIs are prescribed, assessment of sexual dysfunction includes questions about different aspects of sexual activity:

         The assessment should also determine the severity of sexual dysfunction, including the number of impairments and intensity of each.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several validated screening or severity questionnaires are available for assessing SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, including The Arizona Sexual Experience Scale and Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,9
         </a>
         ], as well as the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (see

          "Evaluation of male sexual dysfunction", section on 'Validated instruments'

         ). However, these instruments are not part of standard clinical practice and are generally reserved for research settings.

         Most treatment strategies and specific treatments have not been compared in head-to-head trials. In addition, the results of some studies are difficult to interpret because it is not clear whether sexual dysfunction began during SSRI treatment and thus represents an adverse effect, or began prior to onset of treatment with SSRIs and represents a symptom of the depressive syndrome or a primary sexual disorder.

         For depressed patients who receive an SSRI and develop sexual dysfunction, we suggest initially waiting (eg, two to eight weeks) for spontaneous remission of the adverse effect  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122687" href="/z/d/graphic/122687.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). If sexual impairment persists, we then decrease the dose within the therapeutic range. Although not well studied, these interventions are frequently the first approach taken by many clinicians and experts [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, it appears that watchful waiting alone is typically not effective [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. A prospective observational study in 156 patients treated with

          sertraline

         found that after waiting four to six months, moderate to complete improvement occurred in only 19 percent [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Waiting for patients to adapt to the SSRI may work best for patients with mild sexual dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, decreasing the dose for patients with SSRI-induced sexual impairment often appears to be helpful. In a prospective observational study (n = 30 patients) in which the dose was decreased by 50 percent, at least moderate improvement occurred in 77 percent [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Reducing the dose may be most feasible for remitted patients whose depression has remained stable for at least several weeks or months [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ], and for patients taking relatively high doses (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9046" href="/z/d/drug information/9046.html" rel="external">
          escitalopram

         30 mg/day or

          paroxetine

         50 mg/day) or suffering additional adverse effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, decreasing the dose may diminish therapeutic effects; thus, the dose should be decreased slowly in small increments and should not be reduced below the minimum therapeutic dose [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In addition, patients should be monitored. As an example,

          sertraline
         </a>
         200 mg per day can be reduced by 25 to 50 mg per day every two to four weeks, with patients interviewed prior to each decrease. The minimum therapeutic dose for sertraline is typically 50 mg per day  (

         Switching antidepressants is often preferable to augmentation because adherence may be better with monotherapy than combination treatment [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. In addition, monotherapy may cause fewer adverse effects, cost less, and present fewer risks of drug interactions in patients taking medications for other conditions. Conversely, augmentation with a second drug maintains the benefit derived from the SSRI, whereas switching antidepressants may lead to relapse of depression or new adverse effects [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         Some patients with SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction may also have ongoing depression, such that they respond only partially to the SSRI (eg, reduction of baseline depressive symptoms &lt;50 percent), or not at all. For these patients, we suggest switching to a non-SSRI antidepressant (eg,

         Multiple options are available for patients who decide to switch antidepressants. In selecting a new drug, the choice is based upon factors such as past treatment history, availability, potential side effects, cost, and patient preference. The different options, listed in order of preference, are as follows:

However, the degree of sexual dysfunction may be so substantial that patients insist upon switching to a non-SSRI. In addition, few head-to-head studies have compared sexual dysfunction among different SSRIs.

         For depressed patients who obtain at least moderate relief with an SSRI (eg, reduction of baseline depressive symptoms ≥50 percent), but suffer severe sexual dysfunction (eg, impairment occurs almost always during sexual activity), we suggest switching antidepressants. Multiple options are available for patients who decide to switch antidepressants. In selecting a new drug, the choice is based upon factors such as past treatment history, availability, potential side effects, cost, and patient preference. The specific antidepressants that we use for switching are described in the section immediately above and are listed in order of preference. (See

          Exercise

         – A randomized trial compared exercise (30 minutes of moderate strength training and cardiovascular exercise, three times/week) immediately before sexual activity with exercise separate from sexual activity in 52 females who reported antidepressant sexual side effects; nearly half were treated with SSRIs [

However, many of the females were not distressed by the antidepressant sexual side effects, and the study was marked by a high rate of attrition (46 percent).

          Manifestation and incidence of sexual dysfunction
         </strong>
         – Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause sexual dysfunction in males and females, including decreased libido, decreased arousal, and delayed orgasm and anorgasmia. Among patients receiving SSRIs, the estimated incidence of sexual dysfunction is roughly 50 percent. (See

          Initial management
         </strong>
         – Our initial approach for patients with SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction is to wait (eg, two to eight weeks) for spontaneous remission of the sexual impairment; if the impairment persists, we decrease the dose within the therapeutic dose range  (

          Treatment-resistant sexual dysfunction
         </strong>
         – Patients with SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction often do not respond to watchful waiting or lower doses. Management of treatment-resistant sexual dysfunction depends upon the efficacy of the SSRI in treating the depressive syndrome and the severity of sexual dysfunction:

          Ongoing depression
         </strong>
         – For patients whose depression responds only partially to an SSRI (eg, reduction of baseline depressive symptoms &lt;50 percent) or not at all, we suggest switching antidepressants, rather than augmenting the SSRI with a second drug (
