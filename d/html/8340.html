For example: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>HSV-2 is recovered from the genital lesion of a patient with pre-existing HSV-1 antibodies and no HSV-2 antibodies.

This scenario is rare.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recurrent</strong> – The HSV type recovered from the genital lesion is the same type as pre-existing antibodies in the serum. For patients with previously asymptomatic genital infection, a recurrence may be the first-recognized episode of genital herpes.</p><p></p><p>Both type-specific serologic and virologic assays are usually required for accurate classification [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], except in the case of well-documented recurrent HSV previously confirmed by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Type-specific antibodies to HSV generally develop within the first 12 weeks after infection and persist indefinitely.</p><p>Accurate classification is particularly important during pregnancy because a newly acquired genital infection (primary or nonprimary first-episode) near the time of delivery is a major risk factor for transmission to the neonate. The risk of neonatal transmission at delivery is much lower in patients with recurrent genital infection [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Vertical transmission'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14705932"><span class="h1">SEROPREVALENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A prior herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection with either herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is common among pregnant women [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. A study using data from the 2007 to 2014 United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) estimated that the seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in pregnant women was 59.3 and 21.1 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Compared with the prior seven-year period, there was a nonsignificant increase in seronegativity among pregnant women consistent with the decline in the overall prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the United States [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. While this means that a larger fraction of reproductive-age women may be seronegative, and thus at risk for acquiring HSV-1 or HSV-2 during pregnancy, the prevalence of these infections is also likely to be lower among their partners.</p><p>Concurrently, others have reported that the prevalence of neonatal HSV infection has remained stable [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Although HSV-2 caused the majority of virologically confirmed genital HSV infections in the past, HSV-1 has been associated with an increasing proportion of cases, especially among young women. This may explain why the rate of neonatal HSV infection has not decreased along with the decrease in maternal HSV-2 prevalence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical manifestations of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) can vary widely depending upon whether the infection is primary, nonprimary first episode, or recurrent. Clinical findings are similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women, and are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Primary infection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Nonprimary infection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Recurrent infection'</a>.)</p><p>Briefly, the initial presentation of primary genital infection can be severe, with painful genital ulcers, pruritus, dysuria, fever, tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, and headache. However, most patients have only mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic. In a prospective study of pregnant women who were initially HSV seronegative, only one-third of those who seroconverted had symptoms consistent with genital HSV infection [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p>The initial presentation of nonprimary first-episode genital infection tends to be milder than in primary infection, but the classification cannot be established on clinical grounds and requires both virologic and serologic tests. </p><p>Recurrent infections may be preceded by prodromal symptoms, such as pruritus, burning, or pain, before lesions are visible. Recurrent infections tend to have mild localized symptoms with few lesions and lack systemic findings. The lesions may be nontender or atypical in appearance (eg, fissure, vulvar irritation). The duration of lesions and viral shedding are shorter than during a primary episode. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14706735"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is generally made by the finding of vesicular or ulcerated lesions  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58485 graphicRef122027" href="/d/graphic/58485.html" rel="external">picture 1A-B</a>) but should be always confirmed with laboratory testing. Diagnostic tests for HSV infection include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral culture, direct fluorescent antibody testing, and type-specific serologic tests. The approach to diagnosis of genital HSV during pregnancy depends on the clinical presentation: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For women without a history of genital HSV who present with an active genital ulcer during pregnancy, we perform a direct viral test on the lesion and type-specific serologic testing. The vesicle can be unroofed and a swab of the vesicular fluid and ulcer base sent for PCR. PCR is more sensitive than culture and has become the preferred test for diagnostic testing in symptomatic patients [<a href="#rid10">10-13</a>]. Diagnostic techniques for HSV testing are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Genital HSV infection is diagnosed by a positive viral test. Type-specific HSV serology at the time of initial presentation is necessary for classifying maternal infection as primary, nonprimary, or recurrent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80693" href="/d/graphic/80693.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Classification of genital HSV infections'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For women with genital ulcers and a high clinical suspicion for HSV infection but negative tests for virus detection and for antibody, we repeat serologic testing three to four weeks later. If this repeat testing demonstrates seroconversion of either type-specific antibody, the diagnosis of primary infection (or nonprimary first-episode, if the other type-specific antibody was positive at baseline) can be made. If there is no seroconversion, the genital ulcers are unlikely to represent HSV infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Women who have a history of laboratory confirmed genital HSV do not warrant further testing. However, if a woman with a history of genital ulcers without prior laboratory diagnosis presents with an active genital ulcer during pregnancy, we perform a viral test on the lesion to confirm the recurrent HSV diagnosis. PCR is especially advantageous in the setting of a recurrent episode, as it has greater sensitivity in recurrent infection than viral culture. However, if the clinical history is suggestive of HSV infection, a negative viral test does not rule out the diagnosis of HSV infection. If a definitive diagnosis is desired in this situation, serology can be performed to confirm HSV infection.</p><p></p><p>We do not perform rapid HSV PCR testing to identify women with asymptomatic genital shedding at the time of delivery. It is unclear whether using this information to decide upon the route of delivery can reduce the risk of neonatal HSV infection.</p><p>Diagnostic testing is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h1">VERTICAL TRANSMISSION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2628659581"><span class="h2">General principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV) to the neonate usually occurs during labor and delivery as a result of direct contact with virus shed from infected sites (cervix, vagina, vulva, perianal area). </p><p>The key principles for understanding vertical transmission of HSV infection are [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most mothers of newborns with perinatally-acquired HSV infection lack a history of clinically evident genital herpes [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The highest risk for neonatal infection occurs in women with a primary genital HSV infection acquired near the time of delivery. The risk of neonatal infection is slightly lower in women with nonprimary first-episode genital infection, and substantially reduced in women with recurrent HSV. In two case series of women cultured on admission to labor and delivery and subsequently found to have positive culture results, the frequency of neonatal infection was [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Primary infection: 2/5 (40 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and 4/9 (44 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nonprimary first-episode genital infection: 4/13 (31 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and 4/17 (24 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Recurrent infection: 1/34 (3 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and 2/151 (1.3 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The observation that newborns of mothers with a primary or nonprimary first-episode genital infection near the time of labor are at the highest risk for infection is likely related to both the absence of maternal type-specific anti-HSV antibodies and to greater viral exposure (viral load and duration of viral shedding) during primary and nonprimary first-episode genital infection [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Women with a primary infection or nonprimary first-episode genital infection early in pregnancy who develop type-specific HSV antibodies before the onset of labor appear to be at a similar low risk of neonatal transmission as women with recurrent infection [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. As discussed above, type-specific antibodies to HSV generally develop within the first 12 weeks after infection and persist indefinitely. (See <a class="local">'Classification of genital HSV infections'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Viral shedding can occur in the absence of maternal symptoms and lesions [<a href="#rid13">13,15,18,19</a>]. As an example, in a study of nonpregnant individuals with antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), rates of subclinical viral shedding, as measured by daily HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on genital swabs, were 13 and 9 percent among individuals with a history of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, respectively [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. These concepts are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The frequency of viral shedding is higher in genital HSV-2 versus genital herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. Clinical management of the pregnancy is not influenced by HSV type, although the type of genital HSV (HSV-1 versus HSV-2) affects the risk of neonatal transmission and neonatal sequelae. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 may cause localized skin, eye, and mouth; CNS; or disseminated disease; however, HSV-1 has been associated more often with cutaneous skin involvement, and HSV-2 has been associated more often with CNS disease and with a poorer outcome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In utero infection acquired transplacentally or transcervically (across the amniochorionic membranes) has been reported in women with primary HSV infection, and could result in miscarriage, congenital anomalies (eg, ventriculomegaly and other CNS abnormalities), preterm birth, and/or intrauterine growth restriction [<a href="#rid9">9,20-23</a>]. Recurrent HSV has not been associated with these outcomes [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In utero acquisition of infection should be considered in cases of early neonatal HSV infection despite prelabor cesarean delivery and intact fetal membranes [<a href="#rid2">2,25</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6037.html" rel="external">"Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Intrauterine HSV'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of invasive fetal monitoring and preterm birth increase the risk of neonatal infection in patients with viral shedding [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H876362318"><span class="h2">Evidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Estimates of the risk and risk factors for vertical transmission were derived, in part, by the following seminal studies:</p><p>In a prospective study between 1982 and 1999, 58,000 pregnant women in Washington state were classified as having primary, nonprimary, or reactivation HSV by comprehensive testing with serologic, culture, and PCR techniques [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. HSV was isolated from the cervix and external genitalia in 202 (0.5 percent) women at the time of labor. The following observations were made in relation to neonatal infection:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Viral genital shedding in labor was a strong predictor of neonatal HSV infection (OR 346). Neonatal HSV infection occurred in 5 percent (10/202) of women with a positive HSV culture versus 0.02 percent (6/39,821) of women with a negative culture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The highest risk of neonatal HSV infection was in neonates of women with newly acquired primary genital HSV (ie, HSV-seronegative): 54 per 100,000 live births compared with 26 per 100,000 live births when the mother was HSV-1-seropositive and 22 per 100,000 live births when the mother was HSV-2-seropositive. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other significant risk factors for neonatal HSV included HSV isolation from the cervix (OR 33), shedding HSV-1 rather than HSV-2 (OR 17), invasive fetal monitoring (OR 7), delivery before 38 weeks (OR 4), and maternal age &lt;21 years (OR 4). Delivery by cesarean was protective (OR 0.14). </p><p></p><p>In a study of 7046 HSV-seronegative pregnant women followed throughout pregnancy, 94 developed primary infections [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

However, neither intervention fully eliminates the risk of neonatal herpes infection. Our approach to antiviral therapy for pregnant women with herpes simplex virus (HSV) considers the classification of infection (ie, primary genital, nonprimary first genital episode, recurrent), severity of symptoms, and the timing of infection relative to delivery.

Although we suggest cesarean delivery for women with a primary or nonprimary first-episode genital infection acquired during the latter weeks of pregnancy, this is a shared decision.

(See <a class="local">'Vertical transmission'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The highest risk for neonatal infection occurs in women with a newly acquired (primary or nonprimary first-episode) genital HSV infection near the time of delivery. The risk of neonatal infection is substantially lower in women with recurrent HSV infection. Other predictors of neonatal infection in women with viral shedding during labor include invasive fetal monitoring and premature delivery. (See <a class="local">'Vertical transmission'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For women without a history of genital HSV who present with a new genital ulcer during pregnancy, we recommend empiric antiviral therapy while awaiting viral studies (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">Grade 1A</a>). We use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> 400 mg orally three times daily for 7 to 10 days (treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days); <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">valacyclovir</a> is an alternative  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119518" href="/d/graphic/119518.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Antiviral therapy can lessen the duration of lesions and viral shedding and decrease the risk of complications in the pregnant women. Most recurrent episodes are short-lived and do not require intervention for symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Treatment of primary or nonprimary first-episode genital infection'</a> above and <a class="local">'Treatment of recurrent infection'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For all women who present with a genital HSV lesion anytime during pregnancy, whether with a primary, nonprimary first-episode, or recurrent infection, we recommend daily suppressive therapy at 36 weeks of gestation until the onset of labor rather than no therapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">Grade 1A</a>). We use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> 400 mg orally three times daily; <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">valacyclovir</a> is an alternative  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119518" href="/d/graphic/119518.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Suppressive therapy reduces the risk of clinical recurrence of HSV delivery, and thus the need for cesarean delivery. However, the clinical impact on neonatal HSV is unknown. (See <a class="local">'Suppressive therapy at 36 weeks'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> during pregnancy appears to be safe for the fetus at all stages of pregnancy.

(See <a class="local">'Drug choice, dose, and safety'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cesarean delivery can decrease but not eliminate the risk of neonatal HSV infection. For women with a history of HSV and genital HSV lesions or prodromal HSV symptoms at the time of labor, we recommend cesarean delivery (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). For women who had a primary or nonprimary first-episode genital infection during the latter weeks of pregnancy (eg, within six weeks of delivery) but have no active lesions at the time of labor, we suggest cesarean delivery (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, optimal management in such cases is unclear, and after discussion of the uncertain risks of transmission, some women may reasonably choose to forgo cesarean. (See <a class="local">'Route of delivery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical decision-making for patients with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) and active HSV infection requires weighing the risks associated with preterm birth versus the risk of fetal/neonatal HSV infection. The risks associated with preterm birth depend on the week of gestation; the risk of fetal/neonatal HSV infection is difficult to estimate and depends, in part, on whether the woman's clinical episode represents primary or recurrent infection. (See <a class="local">'Preterm premature rupture of membranes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In women with PPROM and recurrent HSV infection, we suggest expectant management remote from term (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We prescribe a course of antenatal corticosteroids to pregnancies &lt;34 weeks to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to preterm birth and intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> (5 mg/kg every 8 hours) to shorten the duration of active lesions and to decrease viral burden. (See <a class="local">'Preterm premature rupture of membranes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There are no clinical trials evaluating the optimum management of women with PPROM and primary or first-episode genital nonprimary HSV infection. Before 28 to 32 weeks, the risks of prematurity are high and may outweigh the risk of fetal/neonatal infection with expectant management. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Remote from term, we give <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> to the mother to shorten the duration of lesions and reduce viral shedding; there are no data showing prevention of neonatal infection. We also give a course of antenatal corticosteroids to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to preterm birth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Closer to term, immediate cesarean delivery is preferable because of the overall high risk of fetal/neonatal transmission associated with first-episode genital HSV infection. The neonate is then treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> and surfactant.
