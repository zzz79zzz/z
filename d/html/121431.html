         Conduct disorder is a disorder defined by various forms of aggressive and rule-breaking behaviors in which the basic rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms are violated. Symptoms frequently lead to conflicts with adults (eg, parents, teachers, and other authority figures) or peers, and may include involvement with the legal system. Conduct disorder is often, but not always, preceded in early childhood by the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Symptoms of conduct disorder typically begin either in childhood or adolescence and may often persist into adulthood, at times developing into antisocial personality disorder.

         This topic describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of conduct disorder. Another topic describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of ODD. Treatment of ODD and conduct disorder are discussed separately. (See

         Twin and adoption studies support a moderate heritability for conduct disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Genetic influence may be higher for conduct disorder, specifically, than for antisocial behavior in general. For example, in a meta-analysis of 51 twin and adoption studies estimating the genetic and environmental influences on general antisocial behavior, genetic influences accounted for 41 percent of the variance, shared environmental influences accounted for 16 percent, and nonshared environmental influences accounted for 43 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In the same study, analyses of these influences on conduct disorder found a higher heritability of 50 percent, shared environmental influences of 11 percent, and nonshared environmental influences of 39 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, these influences appear to vary depending on the predominant symptoms present. As examples:

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Heritability appears to be higher for those with aggressive symptoms as compared with those with primarily rule-breaking symptoms (65 versus 48 percent). Furthermore, shared environmental influence are lower for the aggressive symptoms as compared with those with primarily the rule breaking symptoms (5 versus 18 percent) [
         <a href="#rid7">

         Heritability appears to be higher in individuals with callous-unemotional traits and environmental influence appears to be lower in individuals with callous-unemotional traits as compared with those without the presence of callous-unemotional traits [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite its importance, fewer behavior genetic studies have examined differences in heritability and environmental influences on conduct disorder as a function of age of onset, with one study showing no difference in heritability, and no evidence for shared environmental influences, on child- versus adolescent-onset conduct disorder [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There are only a few genome-wide studies of conduct disorder. Early genome-wide studies using linkage analysis and genome-wide association studies found no replicable results [
         <a href="#rid12">

         </span>
         Structural and functional neuroimaging studies of conduct disorder have found evidence of structural abnormalities (small size, cortical thinning, folding deficits) and areas of decreased activity in brain regions associated with emotion-processing, aggression, problem solving, and impulse control [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-21
         </a>
         ]. The pattern of these changes are different than those observed in other disorders such as ADHD [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, in a meta-analysis of 29 studies examining structural and functional neuroimaging, a diagnosis of either ODD or conduct disorder was associated with smaller brain structures and lower brain activity in the bilateral amygdala, bilateral insula, right striatum, left medial/superior frontal gyrus, and left precuneus as compared with control [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. These areas are associated with emotion-processing, error-monitoring, problem solving, and self-control and are thought to play a role in the neurocognitive and behavioral deficits implicated in ODD/conduct disorder. Evidence suggests that the abnormalities in the amygdala are specific to ODD/conduct disorder, irrespective of the presence of ADHD.

          —
         </span>
         The prominent feature of conduct disorder is a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated, as manifested by three or more aggressive and/or rule-breaking symptoms over the past year, with at least one symptom presenting in the past six months [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Youth presenting such symptoms often come to the attention of the school system, as well as family members and, if sufficiently severe, the legal system.
        </p>
        <p>
         The symptoms of conduct disorder are heterogenous with behaviors falling into four main groupings: aggressive symptoms or threats of harm to people and animals, nonaggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage, deceitfulness or theft, and serious rule violations. Onset may be seen in childhood or adolescence. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the individual or others (family, peer group), often impacts negatively upon social/interpersonal, educational, occupational, or other areas of functioning, and can include involvement with the legal system. (See

        <p>
         Other characteristics (eg, the presence of limited prosocial emotions, lack of remorse or guilt, callousness/lack of empathy, or shallow or deficient emotions) are indicated in specifiers. Conduct disorder accompanied by such callous-unemotional traits (or “limited prosocial emotions,” as designated in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5]) appears to show higher heritability [
         <a href="#rid23">

         Up to 50 percent of youth with conduct disorder have been found to develop antisocial personality disorder as adults [

         Children and adolescents with conduct disorder are at increased risk of functional impairments in relationships, education, workplace, and involvement with the legal system in adulthood. Additionally, the disorder is associated with externalizing psychopathology (such as impulse control disorders and substance misuse) and internalizing psychopathology (such as anxiety and mood disorders), especially if their conduct disorder is more severe and/or persistent [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34-38
         </a>
         ]. Conduct disorder is a stronger predictor of adult externalizing psychopathology in males, but a stronger predictor of adult internalizing psychopathology in females [

         We consider a diagnosis of conduct disorder in all youth who present with persistent behavior problems affecting academic performance, work performance, or causing psychosocial disruption. We assess interpersonal or relationship problems, school or work-related
         <strong>
         </strong>
         problems, and legal problems across multiple situations and settings. We do this by obtaining history from caregivers and teachers. Children under the age of 10 are rarely used as informants
         <strong>
         </strong>
         given the lack of reliability and validity of the child's reports of their conduct disorder symptoms. However, children’s reports are an important source of symptom information once they are in late childhood and are approaching adolescence.
        </p>
        <p>
         We often use parent, caregiver, and teacher questionnaires such as the Emory Combined Rating Scale [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ] as an alternative or supplement to structured or semistructured interviews. These rating scales are relatively quick and easy for parents or teachers to complete [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Other options that we occasionally use for diagnostic purposes are structured or semistructured interviews including the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

          Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)

         – The behaviors occurring in ODD are typically less severe than those in conduct disorder. Conduct disorder includes aggression towards people or animals, or destruction of property while these are not described in ODD. Emotional dysregulation (eg, irritability, anger) is often seen in ODD though not necessarily in conduct disorder. Additionally, while ODD symptoms include “often losing temper” and “is often angry or resentful” they do not include the more serious, overt forms of aggression that constitute symptoms of conduct disorder. Finally, ODD does not include the various forms of rule-breaking symptoms that are part of conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both disorders, both diagnoses can be given. (See

          Conduct disorder
         </strong>
         – Conduct disorder is defined by various forms of aggressive and rule-breaking behaviors in which the basic rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms are violated. Symptoms frequently lead to conflicts with adults (eg, parents, teachers, and other authority figures) or peers, and may include involvement with the legal system. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         <strong>
          Sociodemographic correlates
         </strong>
         – Conduct disorder has been associated with various sociodemographic correlates, including younger age, male gender, lower educational attainment, lower income, being separated or divorced, residing in large urban settings, and self-identification as non-Hispanic White compared with Hispanic. (See

          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The prominent feature of conduct disorder is a pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated. This is manifested by three or more aggressive and/or rule-breaking symptoms over the past year with at least one symptom presenting in the past six months.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The symptoms of conduct disorder are heterogenous with behaviors falling into four main groupings: aggressive symptoms or threats of harm to people and animals, nonaggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage, deceitfulness or theft, and serious rule violations. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical presentation'

         <strong>
          Course
         </strong>
         – The course of illness is heterogeneous with a median age of onset at 12 years. Conduct disorder is often, but not always, preceded in early childhood by the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Symptoms may persist into adulthood, in some patients, developing into antisocial personality disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Children and adolescents with conduct disorder are at increased risk of functional impairments in adulthood (eg, in relationships, education, the workplace, and involvement with the legal system) and other psychopathology such as impulse control, substance misuse, anxiety, and mood disorders, especially if their conduct disorder is more severe and/or persistent. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Course'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Assessment
         </strong>
         – We consider a diagnosis of conduct disorder in all youth who present with persistent behavior problems affecting academic performance, work performance, or causing psychosocial disruption. We assess interpersonal or relationship problems, school- or work-related
         <strong>
         </strong>
         problems, and legal problems across multiple situations and settings. We rarely use children under age 10 as reliable informants. We often use parent, caregiver, and teacher questionnaires as a supplement or alternative to structured or semistructured interviews. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessment'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – We differentiate conduct disorder from other disorders with similar or overlapping presentations by detailed history and assessment. These other disorders include ODD, ADHD, adjustment disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, mood disorders, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.
