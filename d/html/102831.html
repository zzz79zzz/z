Patients with significant comorbidities may require complex or prolonged procedures in these hospital settings that are remote from the main OR area. For these reasons, the need for non-operating room anesthesia (NORA) care is increasing in locations such as interventional radiology (IR), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), electrophysiology (EP), interventional cardiology, endoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and interventional pulmonary suites [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Special preparations are typically necessary to provide anesthetic care in these locations. This topic will review general considerations for NORA care of patients undergoing various procedures in IR suites, TEE suites, and other locations that are distant from the main OR. Additional details regarding specific considerations that are relevant in certain locations are discussed in separate topics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intracranial neurovascular procedures (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114425.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94284.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for intracranial neurovascular procedures in adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Endovascular aortic repair or peripheral arterial balloon angioplasty, embolization, or thrombolysis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93506.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for endovascular aortic repair"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94264.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for infrainguinal revascularization"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>MRI or CT (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91608.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography procedures"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Procedures in the EP suite (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94294.html" rel="external">"Anesthetic considerations for electrophysiology procedures"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2588185299"><span class="h1">ANESTHETIC CHALLENGES IN NON-OPERATING ROOM LOCATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Challenges in providing anesthetic care for procedures performed in interventional radiology (IR), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), electrophysiology, cardiac catheterization, endoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and interventional pulmonary suites include distance from the main operating room area, access to equipment, ergonomics, staffing, and communication issues  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141986" href="/z/d/graphic/141986.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. We agree with consensus recommendations developed by the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) for Safe Conduct of Non-operating Room Anesthesia (NORA) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. These include guidelines for preprocedure evaluation and postanesthesia recovery; standards for anesthesia and monitoring equipment, supplies, and medications; need for interdisciplinary communication during the procedure; and immediate availability of emergency equipment, drugs, and crisis manuals appropriate for the patient population and procedures in these locations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H404262229"><span class="h2">Preparation of anesthetic equipment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the APSF have provided recommendations for management of patients receiving anesthetic care in off-site locations [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Preparation typically requires extra time to complete the following tasks [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Remote settings with permanent anesthesia equipment </strong>–<strong> </strong>The anesthesia provider must establish familiarity with the anesthesia machine, monitors, medication cart, and oxygen and suction sources that are present in a remote location. Such equipment often differs from that used in the main ORs. In many institutions, new anesthesia equipment is installed in the main OR area, while older equipment with different components and monitors is rotated to off-site locations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94594.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions", section on 'Malfunction of anesthesia machine components'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94594.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions", section on 'Malfunction of integrated anesthesia monitors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Remote settings with no anesthesia equipment </strong>–<strong> </strong>Anesthesia personnel must transport equipment such as the anesthesia machine, monitors, warming devices, and other equipment, as well as anesthetic agents and other medications to the remote location. Potential clinical problems that might require special anesthetic equipment or specific pharmacologic agents must be anticipated. Due to the remote location, there is a high likelihood of a significant delay if additional items or assistance is needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Furthermore, if inhalation anesthetic agents are to be administered via the anesthesia machine, the availability of compatible connections from the scavenger system to waste anesthesia gas disposal (WAGD) outlets or medical vacuum outlets is a consideration in some off-site locations [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. WAGD outlets are typically only found in operating or procedure rooms where anesthesia care is routinely provided. Waste gas hoses from anesthesia machines may not be compatible with the medical vacuum outlets found in other locations  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef127954" href="/z/d/graphic/127954.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Potential solutions for these issues when anesthesia machines are used in locations outside the ORs include (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127762.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines", section on 'Unique safety issues'</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Refrain from use of inhalation anesthetics </strong>– If the anesthesia machine has an open scavenger system that is not connected to a WAGD or medical vacuum outlet, refrain from administering inhalation anesthetic agents. No modifications are necessary if there are no waste anesthetic gases to be scavenged.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Modify an anesthesia machine with a closed scavenger system </strong>– If the anesthesia machine has a closed scavenger system (a reservoir bag), modifications are necessary to prevent inappropriate continuous positive airway pressure, excessive positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and high peak pressures even if no inhalation anesthetic agent is used [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Options include disconnecting the scavenger system from the hoses coming from the breathing system and ventilator, or removing the reservoir bag altogether  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef127943" href="/z/d/graphic/127943.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Special preparations for planned use of inhalation anesthetics </strong>– Regardless of whether the anesthesia machine has an open or closed scavenger system, scavenging will be required if an inhalation anesthetic agent will be used. The anesthesia machine must be connected to an available WAGD or medical vacuum outlet. Alternate tubing or connectors or connection adapters may be necessary to make this connection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Also, if high fresh gas flow will be used, then the scavenger system will require high vacuum flow, and the scavenger suction must be adjusted upward to ensure proper function.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4338056"><span class="h2">Positioning of anesthesia equipment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many off-site suites are not designed for delivery of anesthetic care, and there is no specific space allocated for anesthesia equipment [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. After transport of the anesthesia machine, monitors, and medication cart to the location, anesthesia personnel typically must position these bulky items in relation to radiology or other equipment that is already located within the suite. Circuit extenders for the anesthesia machine may be necessary to facilitate ventilation and monitoring respiratory gases (eg, end-tidal carbon dioxide [ETCO<sub>2</sub>], expired inhaled anesthetic concentrations), particularly if the patient is to be moved into an imaging tube for MRI, CT, or other radiographic imaging. Extension tubing for the patient’s intravenous (IV) lines may also be necessary in these settings (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91608.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography procedures", section on 'Positioning in the MRI suite'</a>). After induction of anesthesia and prior to draping, we move the fluoroscopy machine through its full range of motion, checking that all lines and tubes are out of the way.</p><p>After final positioning, the anesthesia provider may not have easy access to the anesthesia machine and monitors or to the patient. Ideally, the room setup will allow the anesthesiologist to view both the patient and the anesthesia machine and monitors. In some off-site locations, direct observation is possible. In other instances, patient and monitors are viewed from a shielded control room via a video monitor.</p><p>In all settings, IV anesthetic agents, airway equipment, and emergency drugs should be immediately accessible as interventions such as increasing or decreasing anesthetic depth or managing an airway or cardiopulmonary emergency may be suddenly necessary. (See <a class="local">'Management of emergencies'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2825543677"><span class="h2">Need for interdisciplinary communication</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The multidisciplinary team members including the anesthesiologist, subspecialized nursing personnel, technicians, and interventionalist (eg, radiologist, cardiologist, gastroenterologist, pulmonologist) in many off-site locations may not work together regularly and may be unfamiliar with the procedures and techniques planned by the other [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. For this reason, we discuss planned events in a preprocedure briefing. Issues include how and where anesthesia will be induced (eg, in the imaging room itself or in a separate induction room), how the patient will be transported to the imaging room and positioned, specific requirements for the imaging procedure (eg, periods of apnea for thoracic imaging), and where the patient will recover from anesthesia. As with briefings in an OR setting, availability and proper functioning of all necessary anesthetic and monitoring equipment is also verified [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15077.html" rel="external">"Patient safety in the operating room", section on 'Timeouts and briefing in the operating room'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H950433783"><span class="h2">Management of emergencies</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H134384852"><span class="h3">Complications during elective cases</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ASA closed claims analysis has noted a higher incidence of malpractice claims for death after NORA care compared with OR settings [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Nonanesthesia personnel working in off-site settings are often unfamiliar with anesthetic care, particularly urgent or emergency interventions that may be necessary due to loss of control of the airway or cardiac arrest. Likewise, anesthesia personnel may be unfamiliar with life-threatening complications associated with the planned interventional procedure. Advance planning and strategies to manage such emergencies include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ensure ready access to specialized resuscitative equipment that might be necessary for high-risk patients (eg, difficult airway cart, invasive monitoring equipment) by prior placement in the immediate vicinity of the off-site suite.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ensure ready availability of cognitive aids for specific emergency situations [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This is particularly important if personnel in the off-site location only rarely participate in crisis management for anesthesia-related emergencies [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94543.html" rel="external">"Cognitive aids for perioperative emergencies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prearrange communication protocols with anesthesiology and other specialized personnel outside the off-site location to ensure rapid response to an emergency call for assistance [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. For pediatric cases, responding personnel should be subspecialized in pediatric resuscitation. (See <a class="local">'Challenges during emergency cases'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ensure a process for multidisciplinary review of emergency events (ie, debriefings). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15077.html" rel="external">"Patient safety in the operating room", section on 'Debriefing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2555493789"><span class="h3">Challenges during emergency cases</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Additional challenges exist during anesthetic management of hemodynamically unstable emergency cases such as a patient with traumatic injuries:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When there is lack of time for preparation due to emergency presentation, we request immediate help from anesthesia personnel for delivery of equipment and assistance with ongoing resuscitation. This may include insertion and monitoring of an intra-arterial and/or central venous catheter to administer medications, fluids, and blood transfusions. Trauma centers should have full monitoring capabilities and be stocked with routine and advanced airway capabilities, equipment for rapid transfusion, and a variety of catheters for intravascular and intra-arterial access in off-site locations. If necessary, the radiologist can assist with emergency placement of intravascular cannulae. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94581.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for adult trauma patients", section on 'General principles'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Additional blood loss and unresolved hemodynamic instability may occur even after successful embolization treatment after a traumatic injury due to other injuries to visceral organs or major blood vessels. Arrangements for access to blood products without delay are particularly critical to provide adequate resuscitation of traumatically injured patients in an off-site location. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94581.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for adult trauma patients"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H748544338"><span class="h2">Radiation risks</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risks for anesthesiologists </strong>–<strong> </strong>In IR, CT, EP, and interventional cardiology suites, the anesthesia provider will likely be exposed to ionizing radiation. Dosimeter badges should be worn by anesthesiologists who are regularly exposed to radiation risks so that cumulative radiation exposure may be monitored [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Radiation dose is determined by (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14613.html" rel="external">"Radiation-related risks of imaging"</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Distance</strong> –<strong> </strong>The amount of radiation to anesthesiologists decreases in proportion to the square of their distance from the source (ie, doubling the distance from the tube decreases the amount of radiation by a factor of four). Generally, the anesthesiologist should be physically located in an observation room distant from the source of radiation, or stand as far away as possible behind a portable shield and wear suitable shielding equipment, as noted below [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Time</strong> –<strong> </strong>Anesthesiologists may be exposed to longer durations and higher doses of radiation than radiologists and other personnel during IR or CT imaging because the radiology team members can perform their duties within the shielded control room, while the anesthesiologist may be exposed during adjustments of doses of anesthetic agents or while troubleshooting monitoring equipment. In some cases (eg, a sedated patient with a potentially difficult airway), the anesthesiologist must remain by the patient's side at all times.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Shielding</strong> – Availability of portable shields, lead aprons, thyroid collars, and eye protection should be ensured and used by all anesthesia personnel to mitigate risk [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Although lead aprons are always worn, the dose of radiation may become excessive over time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risks for patients </strong>– Risks for all patients undergoing exposure to ionizing radiation are discussed in a separate topic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14613.html" rel="external">"Radiation-related risks of imaging"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Specific risks for children are discussed separately.

(See <a class="local">'Preanesthesia evaluation'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4791.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic imaging in pregnant and lactating patients", section on 'Fetal risks'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2536296555"><span class="h1">PREANESTHESIA EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A member of the interventionalist team in the off-site location (eg, interventional radiologist or cardiologist) typically consults anesthesia personnel to determine what type of anesthetic care is recommended. The anesthesiologist reviews the pathology for which the procedure is being performed, the interventionalist's specific requirements for completion of the procedure, and patient-related factors that affect choice of anesthetic technique. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94539.html" rel="external">"Preoperative evaluation for anesthesia for noncardiac surgery"</a> and <a class="local">'Selection of anesthetic technique'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients undergoing interventional radiology (IR) procedures are often receiving care from a different in-hospital service or are referred for the procedure from an outside practitioner. In many cases, the anesthesiologist serves as a liaison between the interventionalist and the referring clinician (primary care clinician and/or other specialists) during the preprocedure evaluation. For elective cases, the anesthesiologist ensures that preprocedure medical status is optimal and that patient education regarding periprocedural expectations has been accomplished.</p><p>Special preparations are necessary for some patient-specific issues. Examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Need for prophylactic medications – Antibiotic and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis may be necessary in selected cases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Prophylactic measures are taken if the patient has a history of allergic reactions to any agents that will be administered (eg, contrast material, protamine), or the agent is avoided. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113083.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation prior to oral or iodinated intravenous contrast for computed tomography", section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who are pregnant – Patients of childbearing age are assessed for the possibility of pregnancy.
