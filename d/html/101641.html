         A narrow QRS complex (&lt;120 milliseconds) reflects rapid activation of the ventricles via the normal His-Purkinje system, which in turn suggests that the arrhythmia originates above or within the atrioventricular (AV) node (ie, a supraventricular tachycardia [SVT]).

         The acute management of a patient with WCT depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Urgent or emergency management is required in unstable patients, with management taking precedence over further diagnostic workup until the patient has been stabilized. Following initial management and stabilization of the patient, chronic management of the patient with WCT will be directed by the etiology of the WCT (supraventricular versus ventricular).

         An unstable patient will have evidence of hemodynamic compromise, such as hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, or heart failure, but generally remains awake with a discernible pulse. Patients who become unresponsive or pulseless are considered to have a cardiac arrest and are treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms.

         A stable patient shows no evidence of hemodynamic compromise despite a sustained rapid heart rate, but should have continuous monitoring and frequent reevaluations due to the potential for rapid deterioration as long as the WCT persists.

        <p>
         Patients who are initially stable may rapidly become unstable, particularly in the setting of extremely rapid heart rates (greater than 200 beats per minute) or significant underlying cardiac comorbidities.

         Hemodynamic compromise may occur with any WCT, regardless of the etiology, but is more likely in patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT). Patients who are felt to be hemodynamically unstable require prompt treatment with electrical cardioversion/defibrillation to prevent further clinical deterioration or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).

         Patients with WCT who are hemodynamically unstable and pulseless, or who become pulseless during the course of evaluation and treatment, should be managed according to standard advance cardiac life support (ACLS) resuscitation algorithms, with immediate high-energy countershock and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  (

Patients should initially be treated with a synchronized (if possible) 120 to 200 joule shock from a biphasic defibrillator or a 360 joule shock from a monophasic defibrillator; if synchronization is not possible, then an unsynchronized countershock should be delivered, typically at higher energy doses [

         For patients with WCT who are hemodynamically unstable, but still responsive with a discernible blood pressure and pulse, we recommend urgent cardioversion (with procedural sedation when feasible). The selection of energy level and the choice between synchronized and unsynchronized shocks depends on the clinical situation  (

         </span>
         If the QRS complex and T wave can be distinguished, an attempt at emergent synchronized cardioversion can be performed. Initial cardioversion is performed with a synchronized shock of 100 joules using either a biphasic or monophasic defibrillator, with upward titration of the energy if additional shocks are needed [

         Intravenous analgesics or sedatives should be cautiously administered if the blood pressure will tolerate their use. However, the use of such agents must be balanced against the risks of further hemodynamic deterioration, and therapy should not be unnecessarily delayed if the ability to administer conscious sedation is not readily available.

         In a patient with WCT who is hemodynamically stable, additional time may be spent attempting to determine the diagnosis. If the initial diagnosis of WCT was made from a single-lead rhythm strip, a full 12-lead ECG should be obtained during the WCT and methodically reviewed as this may provide additional clues to the etiology. In addition, a trial of vagal maneuvers and/or pharmacologic intervention can provide both diagnostic information and, on occasion, prove therapeutic if there is resolution of the WCT. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/920.html" rel="external">

         For hemodynamically stable patients with WCT which is regular and monomorphic in whom the etiology of the WCT remains uncertain, we suggest the following approach  (

         Perform vagal maneuvers (Valsalva, carotid sinus massage, etc) – Introducing transient block at the AV node can serve as a diagnostic/therapeutic challenge. Most supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) are AV node dependent (eg, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia [AVRT]), so transient AV nodal block will terminate most SVTs. Atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia may be "unmasked" by transient AVN block. Vagal maneuvers should have no significant effect on VT. (See

Some idiopathic VTs (eg, right ventricular outflow tract [RVOT] VT) may terminate with adenosine. Resuscitation equipment should be immediately available as rarely adenosine will precipitate hemodynamic collapse. The initial dose of adenosine is 6 mg; if this has no effect, 12 mg can be administered.

         In patients with WCT of uncertain etiology, the response to vagal maneuvers may provide insight to the mechanism responsible for the arrhythmia. We perform one or more vagal maneuvers in all patients with WCT who are hemodynamically stable, often while preparing for pharmaceutical therapy or cardioversion. However, these interventions are associated with some risk, primarily the potential for hemodynamic deterioration in a borderline unstable patient, and as such should only be performed by experienced individuals in an environment capable of dealing with potential sequelae.

         Vagal maneuvers increase parasympathetic input to the heart, which slows the rate of sinus node impulse formation and slows AV node conduction velocity while simultaneously lengthening the refractory period. The Valsalva maneuver and carotid sinus massage, two of the most commonly performed vagal maneuvers which enhance vagal tone and therefore depresses sinus and AV nodal activity, can be easily and quickly done at the bedside.

         VT is generally unaffected by vagal maneuvers, although these maneuvers may slow or block retrograde conduction. In some cases, this response exposes AV dissociation by altering the sinus rate (or PP intervals). Rarely, VT terminates in response to carotid sinus pressure.

         slows conduction time through the AV node. Arrhythmias that are dependent upon the AV node (eg, AVNRT, AVRT) will frequently be terminated following adenosine administration. Adenosine will usually not terminate other non-AV node dependent arrhythmias; a subgroup of atrial tachycardias may be adenosine sensitive. In addition, some idiopathic VTs (specifically RV outflow tract VT) may terminate with adenosine. If the tachycardia does not terminate, the ventricular response following adenosine administration is often helpful in distinguishing the etiology of the WCT. Not infrequently, adenosine will promote the conversion of SVT to atrial fibrillation (AF). If the patient has underlying Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, this may lead to extremely rapid ventricular rates, and potentially deterioration to VF. Thus, an external defibrillator should always be available. (See

         VT should be suspected in patients with clearly identified AV dissociation, patients with QRS concordance and a right superior axis (or axis shift of greater than 40 degrees from baseline), and in patients with known structural heart disease. VT is typically regular, though slight variation of the RR interval may be seen.

         Significant irregularity in a WCT is most often seen in patients with AF and aberrant conduction, though polymorphic VT is also irregular. Patients with AF should have similar QRS morphologies for every beat, while the QRS morphology varies in polymorphic VT. An important exception is pre-excited AF in patients with WPW syndrome, in which the QRS morphology is variable in width and morphology. (See

         Once the WCT has been established as VT, therapy should be promptly provided. Patients with VT who are hemodynamically stable may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. The choice of initial treatments for hemodynamically stable VT includes electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion. Some of our experts proceed directly to electrical cardioversion, while others prefer to begin with an intravenous antiarrhythmic agent and reserve cardioversion for refractory patients or for those who become unstable.

         If electrical cardioversion with appropriate procedural sedation is the chosen approach, intravenous analgesics or sedatives should be cautiously administered if the blood pressure will tolerate their use. If the QRS complex and T wave can be distinguished, an attempt at emergent synchronized cardioversion can be performed with a synchronized shock of 100 joules using either a biphasic or monophasic defibrillator. If the QRS complex and T wave cannot be distinguished accurately, and a synchronized shock is not possible, we administer an unsynchronized 120 to 200 joule shock from a biphasic defibrillator or a 360 joule shock from a monophasic defibrillator.

         Patients with a permanent pacemaker are subject to the same array of WCTs as patients without a pacemaker. Rarely, however, WCT can result from a pacemaker tracking an underlying atrial arrhythmia or be due to pacemaker-mediated tachycardia. Most patients with WCT involving a pacemaker will be hemodynamically stable, unless the resulting tachycardia exacerbated underlying comorbidities (eg, angina, heart failure, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
         If the WCT is thought to be directly related to the function of the pacemaker, the appropriate therapy is the placement of a magnet over the pacemaker. The magnet will disable all pacemaker sensing, thereby terminating the ability of the pacemaker to track atrial impulses. With the magnet, the pacemaker will function in an asynchronous, fixed-rate mode (ie, VOO or DOO). In this situation, there will be pacemaker stimuli that do not sense the P wave or QRS complex and will occur with a fixed rate (ie, the lower rate limit of the pacemaker). If WCT is due to pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT) or "pseudo PMT" (non-reentrant repetitive VA synchrony), transient magnet application will terminate the WCT, and the underlying rhythm (with pacing, if appropriate) will ensue when the magnet is removed. If the WCT is due to inappropriate tracking of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, the WCT will likely resume once the magnet is removed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with pacemakers may also be subject to WCTs that do not involve the pacemaker, like other patients. In stable patients, the pacemaker programmer can be used to telemeter the intracardiac electrograms from the pacemaker leads. Examination of these electrograms may yield the diagnosis, as in the electrophysiology laboratory.

         Patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) represent a specific high-risk population in whom WCT is far more likely to represent VT. Patients who underwent ICD implantation for secondary prevention have previously experienced a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia or sudden cardiac death, while those who received an ICD for primary prevention were felt to be at increased risk of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. In either case, WCT in patients with an ICD should be treated as VT until proven otherwise. When no ICD therapy has been delivered, and the device cannot be immediately interrogated (due either to lack of equipment or personnel, or patient instability), the initial management should proceed as if no ICD were present.
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of an ICD has a number of unique implications for patients with a WCT. Although the ICD should be programmed to delivery therapies (either antitachycardia pacing or shocks) for a WCT, such therapies are usually delivered within the first minutes of the arrhythmia.

         In a patient with a persistent or recurrent WCT, the ICD may not always provide definitive management if the device has reached the limit of programmed therapies. Patients with a WCT which persists following multiple ICD therapies most likely have either VT storm with an underlying trigger (eg, ischemia, hypokalemia) or an SVT with aberrant conduction which recurs or persists in spite of the ICD therapies.

         Patients with an ICD who receive multiple shocks but do not have a tachycardia most likely have device malfunction, usually related to lead malfunction. In these patients, magnet application can temporarily suspend tachycardia therapy and prevent further inappropriate shocks. Magnet application is also appropriate in patients receiving shocks for narrow complex tachyarrhythmias (SVT, AF, atrial flutter, sinus tachycardia). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/989.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         All modern ICDs also have the capacity to function as a pacemaker. Patients with a single lead ICD (typically an endovascular lead in the right ventricle) cannot sense and track atrial arrhythmias and, as such, are not subject to WCT associated with the device. Conversely, patients with both an atrial and a ventricular lead have the capacity to sense and track atrial arrhythmias and therefore can potentially develop WCT associated with the pacemaker. However, given the risk of WCT representing VT in a patient with an ICD, pacemaker-associated WCT should be considered only after exclusion of other WCT etiologies and following ICD interrogation. Magnet application does not force asynchronous pacing in ICDs and will therefore not terminate PMT in patients with ICDs. As in pacemaker patients, telemetered intracardiac recordings may be helpful diagnostically. (See

         Patients with VT should generally undergo implantation of an ICD. Following ICD implantation, those patients with recurrent symptomatic VT, or those who have received multiple ICD therapies, may require adjunctive antiarrhythmic therapy in an effort to suppress recurrent VT. In some cases, radiofrequency catheter ablation may be an option to reduce the frequency of VT. An important exception is idiopathic VT, which is treated with ablation or pharmacologic therapy, not with ICD. (See

         The acute management of a patient with wide QRS complex tachycardia (WCT) depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient. Urgent or emergency management is required in unstable patients, with management taking precedence over further diagnostic workup until the patient has been stabilized. Following initial management and stabilization of the patient, chronic management of the patient with WCT will be directed by the etiology of the WCT (supraventricular versus ventricular). (See

         All patients with a WCT should have a brief immediate assessment of the symptoms, vital signs, and level of consciousness to determine if they are hemodynamic stable or unstable. An unstable patient will have evidence of hemodynamic compromise, such as hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, or heart failure, whereas a stable patient shows none of these despite a sustained rapid heart rate.

         While the assessment of hemodynamic status is being performed by a clinician, other members of the health care team should administer supplemental oxygen, establish intravenous access, send blood for appropriate initial studies, attach the patient to a continuous cardiac monitor, and obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

         If the WCT is thought to be directly related to the function of pacemaker, the appropriate therapy is the placement of a magnet over the pacemaker. (See

         Chronic therapy for patients with WCT will be driven by the underlying etiology of the WCT, with patients having VT generally considered for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation, while therapy for patients with SVT will need to be tailored to the underlying arrhythmia.
