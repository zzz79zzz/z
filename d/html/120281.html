Initial clinical manifestations include fever, eosinophilia, right upper quadrant pain, and hepatomegaly; these occur 6 to 12 weeks after ingestion of aquatic plants. These symptoms gradually abate as larvae migrate to the biliary tree, where they may cause biliary obstruction. Computed tomography (CT) of the liver may demonstrate characteristic hypodense nodules or tortuous tracks due to migration of the parasite through the liver. In the acute phase, eosinophilia is marked (3000 to 5000/microL) and eggs are not present in stool; the diagnosis is established via serology (serology may be positive before eggs appear in stool). In the chronic phase, eosinophilia is less prominent (500 to 1000/microL) and eggs may be detected in stool, duodenal aspirates, or bile specimens.

Clinical manifestations of opisthorchiasis include fever, abdominal pain, headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and occasional jaundice. Laboratory findings include cholestatic liver enzyme abnormalities with peripheral eosinophilia; the severity of cholestasis correlates with degree of eosinophilia (may be &gt;10,000/microL). CT may demonstrate hypodense lesions in the liver. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Clonorchiasis is endemic to East and Southeast Asia. It is often asymptomatic or with subtle, nonspecific complaints.

Clinical manifestations include abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea along with generalized malaise, urticaria, headache, and fever (incubation period 24 to 48 hours; diagnosis at this stage is rare). Three to four weeks later, larvae may migrate through subcutaneous, visceral, or neural tissues. The diagnosis is usually presumptive; in the setting of subcutaneous nodules, a definitive diagnosis can be established via detection of larvae on skin biopsy.

It has been observed worldwide and is acquired via ingestion of contaminated soil and has an autoinfection cycle. The incubation period is not well understood; clinical manifestations include fever, eosinophilia, and hepatomegaly. The diagnosis may be established by detection of eggs and/or adult worms on liver biopsy; eggs are not passed in the stool.

It is acquired by swimming in fresh water contaminated with cercariae (the infectious form of the parasite). It mostly occurs in Africa but is also found in South America, East Asia, and the Middle East. The incubation period is three to eight weeks. The diagnosis is often made on clinical suspicion and confirmed when serology becomes positive or eggs are visualized in the urine or stool.

Uncommonly, transpulmonary migration of <em>Strongyloides</em> larvae is associated with dry cough, throat irritation, dyspnea, wheezing, and hemoptysis (Loeffler syndrome). A years-long latency period may occur between the initial exposure and development of symptoms. In the setting of chronic infection, eosinophilia may be observed in approximately two-thirds of cases; in the setting of the hyperinfection syndrome, peripheral eosinophilia is usually absent. Diagnostic testing primarily consists of serology and/or stool analysis; however, the sensitivity is limited.

Routine follow-up testing for eosinophilia after empiric treatment is not necessary.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2951814704"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Peripheral blood eosinophilia (≥500 eosinophils/microL) may be caused by numerous conditions, including allergic, infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76434" href="/z/d/graphic/76434.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). A general approach to patients with eosinophilia is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5691.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with unexplained eosinophilia", section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among individuals with eosinophilia, the likelihood of an infectious cause is highest among those with relevant epidemiologic exposure (residence in or travel to areas where infectious causes of eosinophilia are endemic). In addition, infectious causes should be considered in patients with ≥1500 eosinophils/microL. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The clinical history should establish a number of details, including the signs and symptoms, the time of onset, the nature of any relevant epidemiologic exposures, medical history, and medications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76434" href="/z/d/graphic/76434.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An initial approach to laboratory testing for patients with eosinophilia is presented separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5691.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with unexplained eosinophilia", section on 'Laboratory and diagnostic tests'</a>). Stool examination for ova and parasites can be helpful in diagnosing some intestinal and hepatobiliary parasites; however, the test is relatively insensitive, the timing of symptoms often does not correspond with positive stool examination, and many parasites that cause eosinophilia are not found in the stool. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A variety of infections may be associated with eosinophilia; these include helminths (worms), fungi, protozoa, some bacteria, the retroviruses HIV and human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1, and scabies (a mite infestation). Helminths are the most commonly identified infectious causes of eosinophilia; categories include flukes (trematodes), tapeworms (cestodes), and roundworms (nematodes)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef84014" href="/z/d/graphic/84014.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Overview of causes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Components of the clinical approach include consideration of the geographic region(s) of exposure, the duration of exposure (short-term versus prolonged exposure), the presenting signs and symptoms, and the incubation period. The diagnostic evaluation should be targeted to the likeliest possible etiologies based on these factors. (See <a class="local">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A definitive diagnosis is established in about one-third of patients with eosinophilia. For patients with no definitive diagnosis who are clinically stable, a complete blood count may be repeated in one to three months to assess for resolution. (See <a class="local">'Management and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The optimal approach to empiric management of eosinophilia in the absence of definitive diagnosis is uncertain, and there are no clinical trial data to guide the approach (see <a class="local">'Management and follow-up'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with unexplained eosinophilia and relevant epidemiologic exposure for strongyloidiasis (eg, skin contact with contaminated soil in tropical and subtropical regions), we suggest administration of empiric treatment for strongyloidiasis with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8641" href="/z/d/drug information/8641.html" rel="external">ivermectin</a> (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, empiric ivermectin should <strong>not</strong> be administered to individuals who reside or have resided in West and Central African regions endemic for <em>Loa loa</em>, given risk for encephalopathy due to high <em>L. loa</em> microfilarial burden following ivermectin therapy. (See <a class="local">'Management and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with persistent eosinophilia four to six months later as well as relevant epidemiologic exposure for soil-transmitted helminths, we suggest administration of empiric treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9371" href="/z/d/drug information/9371.html" rel="external">albendazole</a> (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">O'Connell EM, Nutman TB.
