         Episcleritis is defined by the abrupt onset of inflammation in the episclera of one or both eyes, typically presenting as redness, irritation, and watering of the eye with preserved vision. Most patients with episcleritis have a mild, isolated problem that responds readily to topical therapy alone and does not pose a threat to vision. Indeed, many patients with episcleritis require no treatment per se since the condition typically resolves over a short course. A small fraction of patients with episcleritis have an underlying systemic disease that signifies a serious health concern and that requires additional therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Episcleritis is only one of many potential causes of a red eye, although other causes can generally be distinguished clinically from episcleritis based upon the medical history and the examination of the eye.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of episcleritis will be reviewed here. The evaluation of the red eye and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of scleritis are discussed separately. (See

         Approximately 70 percent of cases of episcleritis occur in females [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It occurs most frequently in young and middle-aged adults but may affect all age groups. There are no reliable data regarding the true incidence of episcleritis since it is often mistaken for other conditions such as conjunctivitis or "pink eye."
        </p>
        <p>
         Episcleritis is usually classified as either simple or nodular  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76962" href="/z/d/graphic/76962.html" rel="external">
          picture 1

          picture 2
         </a>
         ). Simple episcleritis is usually sectoral, confined to a carefully delimited portion of the episclera, but can also be diffuse, involving the entire surface of the eyeball. Nodular episcleritis is raised and thus usually limited to just one area of the eyeball.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vast majority of episcleritis cases are isolated and are not associated with a known underlying systemic immune-mediated disorder (unlike scleritis, with which the association is much higher). However, episcleritis may be associated with a number of systemic diseases [
         <a href="#rid1">

         Simple episcleritis is observed in association with seronegative spondyloarthritides, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain forms of vasculitis, particularly those associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). (See

         Nodular episcleritis is most frequently idiopathic but may be associated with any of the rheumatic conditions, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis accounts for approximately 6 percent of all cases of episcleritis, but only a small minority of patients with rheumatoid arthritis develop episcleritis [

          PATHOGENESIS

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Episcleritis is a clinical diagnosis that can be produced by a variety of systemic immune and nonimmune mechanisms that incite inflammation. The episclera is a thin and highly vascular connective tissue that lies beneath the conjunctiva but is superficial to the sclera  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62615" href="/z/d/graphic/62615.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Histologic examination reveals widespread vasodilatation, edema, and lymphocytic infiltration [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Immune mechanisms causing episcleritis may involve acute type I hypersensitivity responses caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated degranulation of tissue mast cells. It can also be induced by immune complex-mediated reactions (type III hypersensitivity), as occur in some vasculitic diseases, and by systemic infections, such as syphilis or tuberculosis. In granulomatous diseases, the pathophysiology of episcleritis is thought to be mediated by a type IV delayed-type hypersensitivity response, but the underlying antigens are unknown [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A common cause of episcleritis is dry eye syndrome. Dry eye disease can occur in a wide variety of conditions, some only involving the eyes and others in association with systemic disease such as Sjögren's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or graft versus host disease to name a few. In all of these conditions, the severity of the episcleritis often mirrors the severity of the dry eye disease.

         Episcleritis is commonly acute in onset and may be either localized or diffuse; patients usually complain of the abrupt onset of redness, irritation, and watering of the eye [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,7
         </a>
         ]. Pain is unusual but can be observed with chronic or nodular episcleritis. Vision is not affected.
        </p>
        <p>
         Physical examination reveals bright red episcleral discoloration caused by vasodilatation of the superficial episcleral vessels and edema of the episclera, without edema or thinning of the sclera  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76962" href="/z/d/graphic/76962.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately one-half of cases are bilateral. Bilateral involvement may be associated with an increased likelihood of an underlying inflammatory disease, but not all studies have confirmed this suggestion [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Most attacks of simple episcleritis resolve within three weeks, with or without treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one series of 37 patients with episcleritis, the primary clinical features were as follows [

         The great majority of patients (87 percent) had no ocular complications of their episcleritis. Among the five patients with complications, there were three cases of mild anterior uveitis, one case of uveitis and interstitial keratitis, and one case of elevated intraocular pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         An important point of this study is that none of the ocular complications were associated with reduced visual acuity. This contrasts with a group of 97 patients with scleritis collected over the same time period, among whom 59 percent had ocular complications and 16 percent had decreased visual acuity [

         Patients with episcleritis associated with a systemic illness, but not those with isolated disease, are likely to have extremely high levels of acute phase reactants.

         </span>
         The diagnosis of episcleritis should be strongly suspected in a patient with a history of the abrupt onset of redness, irritation, and watering of the eye, often without pain (except in more chronic disease or with nodular episcleritis), and with normal vision. The diagnosis is confirmed on physical examination, where typical findings include bright red episcleral discoloration caused by vasodilatation of the superficial episcleral vessels and edema of the episclera, without edema or thinning of the sclera  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76962" href="/z/d/graphic/76962.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         A referral to an ophthalmologist should be undertaken, generally within two to three weeks, for a full clinical evaluation, when possible, to minimize chances of a misdiagnosis (eg, labeling an early case of scleritis or an infectious keratitis as episcleritis), which may also require slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Accurate distinction between episcleritis and scleritis is critical. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients should also undergo a thorough history and physical examination at the time of initial diagnosis to determine if symptoms or signs of a related systemic condition may be present, in which case additional evaluation is required. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Recurrent episcleritis or suspected systemic disease'

         The extent of the evaluation for underlying conditions depends upon the presenting history and general examination and whether the patient is experiencing their initial episode or a recurrence. (See

         In a patient with a first episode of episcleritis, the only type of evaluation usually required in addition to a complete eye examination is a thorough general medical history and physical examination.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a patient with a normal general history and physical examination, the patient should be reassured that the disorder is probably benign, and that additional investigations are needed only if episcleritis recurs or new symptoms develop. However, more extensive evaluation is required in patients with recurrent episcleritis, evidence of other ocular disease, or abnormal findings on the general history and physical examination.

         Both routine and specialized serologic assays, a plain radiograph of the chest, and other testing, which may be dictated by specific findings that raise suspicion of particular underlying conditions, are important in the evaluation of patients suspected of having an underlying rheumatic or infectious illness.

         When a systemic disorder is suspected based upon the presence of symptoms or findings in addition to episcleritis, further laboratory testing should be obtained and the patient should be evaluated by their primary care clinician to determine if consultation with a rheumatologist or other specialist is most appropriate and for further evaluation and management (see

          Scleritis

         Episcleritis must also be distinguished from conjunctivitis, a much more common cause of a red eye. Patients with all types of conjunctivitis (bacterial, viral, allergic) complain of morning crusting and daytime redness and discharge. Crusting and discharge (other than tearing from irritation) are not present in patients with episcleritis alone. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In conjunctivitis, the erythema or injection of the eye is diffuse, involving the bulbar (globe) conjunctiva for 360 degrees as well as the palpebral or tarsal conjunctiva (the mucus membrane on the inner surface of the lids)  (

         Episcleritis is not sight-threatening and, in most patients, is an episodic, self-limited process; thus, symptomatic relief should be the goal of therapy. Indeed, many patients with episcleritis require no treatment per se since the condition typically resolves over a short course. For the achievement of symptomatic relief, there are four levels of therapy that we successively employ in the following sequence, depending upon the adequacy of the response to the initial and subsequent intervention:

It is extremely important to emphasize that chronic glucocorticoid use is associated with a significantly increased risk of cataracts, glaucoma, secondary infection, and corneoscleral thinning. The use of topical glucocorticoids should be directed by an ophthalmologist and should be employed only when the patient remains highly symptomatic despite optimal use of other treatments.

         Most patients with episcleritis have a mild, isolated problem that responds readily to topical therapy alone and does not pose a threat to vision, and many patients require no treatment since the condition typically resolves over a short course. A small fraction of patients with episcleritis have an underlying systemic disease that signifies a serious health concern and that requires additional therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although episcleritis does not produce significant ocular complications and does not impair vision, mild complications including corneal infiltrates and low-grade uveitis may rarely occur. (See

         Small peripheral corneal infiltrates, visible only with the slit-lamp biomicroscope, are a rare occurrence, sometimes occurring despite treatment. These infiltrates represent inflammation within the stroma of the cornea. The changes are small, localized, and nonprogressive and do not affect vision. Patients with significant limbal or corneal inflammation should be followed more carefully to ensure that they do not progress to frank scleritis.

Uveitis, defined as intraocular inflammation, is best diagnosed at the slit lamp by an ophthalmologist; however, the onset of photophobia, pain, and decreased vision should alert the clinician that uveitis has complicated a case.

         – Episcleritis is usually classified as either simple or nodular. Simple episcleritis is usually sectoral, confined to a carefully delimited portion of the episclera, but can also be diffuse, involving the entire surface of the eyeball  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76962" href="/z/d/graphic/76962.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). Nodular episcleritis is raised and thus usually limited to just one area of the eyeball  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67740" href="/z/d/graphic/67740.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). Nodular episcleritis is most frequently idiopathic but may be associated with any of the rheumatic conditions. Seventy percent of episcleritis patients are women. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'

         <strong>
          Etiology
         </strong>
         – The majority of patients with episcleritis do not have an underlying infectious or systemic inflammatory disease. The most common association, when one is present, is with a systemic rheumatic disease; inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis, systemic infections, and other conditions may be seen. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Systemic disease associations'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of episcleritis should be strongly suspected in a patient with a characteristic clinical manifestations, including a history of the abrupt onset of redness, irritation, and watering of the eye, often without pain (except in more chronic disease or with nodular episcleritis), and with normal vision. The diagnosis is confirmed on physical examination, where typical findings include bright red episcleral discoloration caused by vasodilatation of the superficial episcleral vessels and edema of the episclera, without edema or thinning of the sclera  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76962" href="/z/d/graphic/76962.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). Approximately one-half of cases are bilateral. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A referral to an ophthalmologist for a full clinical evaluation should be undertaken, when possible, to minimize chances of a misdiagnosis. In a patient with a first episode of episcleritis, the only type of evaluation required in addition to a complete eye examination is a thorough history and physical examination.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Additional investigations beyond the initial clinical evaluation are needed only if episcleritis recurs, if there is evidence of other ocular disease, or if there are abnormal findings on the general history and physical examination. Both routine and specialized serologic assays are important in the evaluation of patients suspected of having an underlying rheumatic or infectious illness. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'

         Episcleritis must be distinguished carefully from scleritis, conjunctivitis, uveitis, and herpetic keratitis, and from other causes of red eye. (See

          Initial management

          Refractory to topical lubricants
         </strong>
         – In patients in whom topical lubricants are inadequate, particularly those with significant discomfort, we suggest a topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID; eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9348" href="/z/d/drug information/9348.html" rel="external">

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). It is important to exclude dry eyes or other ocular surface epithelial disorders before committing patients to topical NSAIDs, given the potential toxicity of these medications to such eyes. (See

         <strong>
          Refractory to topical NSAIDs
         </strong>
         – In patients who remain highly symptomatic despite optimal use of topical lubricants and topical NSAIDs, we suggest topical glucocorticoids (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8463" href="/z/d/drug information/8463.html" rel="external">

          prednisolone

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Chronic glucocorticoid use is associated with a significantly increased risk of cataracts, glaucoma, secondary infection, and corneoscleral thinning; the use of topical glucocorticoids should be directed by an ophthalmologist. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Resistant to lubricants and topical NSAIDs'

          Refractory to topical agents

         – Most patients with episcleritis have a mild, isolated problem that responds to topical therapy alone and does not pose a threat to vision. Ocular complications are uncommon in episcleritis and are usually mild. However, a minority have an underlying systemic disease that requires additional therapy. In some patients, episcleritis is an early presentation of a more severe and destructive ocular immune problem such as scleritis. (See
