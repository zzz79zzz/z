         Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a biologically based neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and social interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities.

         Screening tools for ASD will be reviewed here. The rationale for screening and management of children according to screening test results, and the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of ASD are discussed separately:

         Screening is defined as a brief, formal, standardized evaluation used to identify unsuspected deviations from normal patterns of development. A screening instrument enables detection of conditions/concerns that may not be readily apparent without screening. Screening does not provide a diagnosis; it helps to determine whether additional investigation (eg, a diagnostic evaluation) by clinicians with special expertise in pediatric development is necessary [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Effective screening requires that results from standardized screening tests be considered in conjunction with clinical judgment. Desirable characteristics of developmental and behavioral screening tests are discussed separately. (See

         Screening for ASD is indicated in children with delayed language/communication milestones, in children with a regression in social or language skills, and in children whose caregivers raise concerns regarding ASD at any time. In addition, the

          American Academy of Pediatrics
         </a>
         and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend ASD-specific screening of all children at 18 and 24 months of age because these are critical times for early social and language development, and earlier intervention is more effective for ASD [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2

         First-tier screening is used to identify children at risk for ASD from a general population. Second-tier screening is used to discriminate ASD from other developmental disorders in children with developmental concerns. Second-tier screening tools are appropriate for use in children who have failed general developmental screening or an ASD-specific screening test, depending upon the age of the child and level of concern. Second-tier tools are usually more time consuming and may require more expertise to administer and interpret. (See

         Choosing which tools to use depends upon the risks in the population being screened and resources available in the practice or community setting  (

         </span>
         Early identification of ASD requires the use of ASD-specific screening tools. General developmental screening tools (ie, broadband screeners) are poor predictors of ASD because they assess different domains of developmental concern than autism-specific screening tools [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Studies evaluating the utility of broadband screeners find that they lack specificity and may result in over-referral for ASD diagnostic evaluation [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. However, two-step strategies incorporating use of an autism-specific screener in those who fail general screening may improve identification of children at risk while reducing false positives.

         <strong>
          Limitations of current screening tools
         </strong>
         – Although the available ASD-specific screening tools are more accurate than general developmental screening tools for identifying ASD, they have limited sensitivity (ability to identify young children with ASD) and specificity (ability to discriminate ASD from other developmental disorders, such as language disorders and global developmental delay) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Due to the variability in the natural course of early social and language development, some children who have initial positive screens (suggesting that they are at risk for ASD) ultimately will not meet diagnostic criteria for ASD [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Other children who pass early screens for ASD may present with atypical concerns later in the second year of life and eventually be diagnosed with ASD.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         To optimize early identification of children at risk for autism, sensitivity is more important than specificity for first-tier screens. Thus, first-tier screening tools for ASD may be positive in children with variable (but eventually normal) social and language development and in children with other developmental disorders (eg, language disorders, global developmental delay). Such children will require follow-up and/or second-tier screening to better characterize their developmental concern(s). However, the potential over-referral of children with positive first-tier screens is preferable to missing children at risk for ASD.

         <strong>
          Importance of age
         </strong>
         – Screening tools that are appropriate for toddlers may be less sensitive when used for preschoolers or school-age children. The sensitivity and specificity of the ASD screening tools vary depending upon the age of the child and the severity of symptoms. The behavioral skills assessed to identify young children at risk for ASD (imitation, joint attention, and play) are developmentally sensitive. Older children with ASD and those who have received appropriate intervention can and do acquire these skills. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/627.html" rel="external">
          "Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features"
         </a>

         <strong>
          Validation
         </strong>
         – When choosing a screening tool, it is important to know how well the tool performs (eg, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value) in the population in which it will be used. Many of the screening tools for ASD have been validated in high-risk populations (ie, referral clinic, early intervention) but have not been validated in low-risk populations (eg, primary care, general population, community samples)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71355" href="/z/d/graphic/71355.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Other factors may influence interpretation of scores on various screening tests. Cut-off scores for "failing screening" may differ depending on comorbid developmental concerns such as language or motor delay (eg, the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers [M-CHAT] appears to have low specificity in children who were born before 28 weeks' gestation and have associated motor, cognitive, visual, and hearing impairments [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-12
         </a>
         ]; the Social Communication Questionnaire [SCQ] may be less valid in young children with limited language). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up'

          'Social Communication Questionnaire'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some authors have raised concern regarding the use of a screening measure that relies solely on caregiver report, suggesting that caregivers may report that the child has skills that health professionals were not able to elicit, leading to falsely negative screens [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14

However, the specificity was 46 percent, and the positive predictive value was 58 percent (95% CI 49-67 percent). Thus, the meaning of a positive screen should be carefully explained to caregivers given that approximately one-half of the children who screened positive in this analysis were not diagnosed with ASD at follow-up.

         The Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and Young Children (STAT) is an interactive measure that can be used for screening in children age 24 to 36 months [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26

        </p>
        <p>
         The STAT consists of a 20-minute-long play-based session during which 12 activities in four domains are observed: play (two activities), requesting (two activities), directing attention (four activities), and motor imitation (four activities) [
         <a href="#rid26">

         Researchers continue to search for screening tools that can accurately identify children at risk for ASD as early as possible. The Infant-Toddler Checklist (ITC) is a 24-item questionnaire that is a component of the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile (CSBS-DP). The ITC is a broadband screener for communication delays for children age 6 to 24 months. The ITC and scoring instructions are available free of charge through the Brookes Publishing Company (www.brookespublishing.com/resource-center/screening-and-assessment/csbs/csbs-dp/csbs-dp-itc).
        </p>
        <p>
         The ITC has a sensitivity and specificity of 88.9 percent for identifying toddlers with ASD or other developmental delays [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Although the ITC does not discriminate between ASD and other communication disorders, children with ASD tend to score in the lower 10

          th
         </sup>
         percentile on the communication composite (emotion and use of eye gaze, use of communication, use of gestures). In a study screening 5385 children from a general population, the ITC identified 56 of 60 (93 percent) of children ultimately diagnosed with ASD [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The ITC had a PPV of 71 to 79 percent and negative predictive value of 88 to 99 percent for 9- to 24-month-olds. PPV was poor for six- to eight-month-olds.
        </p>
        <p>
         A prospective study demonstrated the feasibility of using the ITC to screen for ASD, language delay, and developmental delay at the 12-month visit [

          31
         </a>
         ]. Among the 184 children who failed the ITC and were followed until 32 to 36 months of age, the ITC had a PPV of 75 percent. Twenty percent of children were diagnosed with ASD and 55 percent with language delay, developmental delay, or other associated issue. Children were referred for behavioral treatment when the diagnosis was confirmed with standardized testing and clinical judgment. On average, treatment began at approximately 17 months of age. In a subsequent study, digital screening with the ITC at age 12, 18, and 24 months as part of a comprehensive community-wide neurodevelopmental screen-evaluate-treat model was associated with increased detection of ASD and earlier evaluation and referral for treatment [

         In the United States, autism-specific screening is recommended at 18 and 24 months and when concerns are identified. Thus, there are fewer studies of screening in older children and less direct experience with the available screening tools in clinical practice. However, the median age of diagnosis of ASD is still later than four years in many communities [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Because older children spend a significant portion of their day and their peer interactions in the school setting, tools that incorporate observations or ratings from teachers could add useful information to the screening process. Further research is needed to guide clinicians about the best method of screening for ASD in older children.

         </span>
         The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), formerly known as the Autism Screening Questionnaire, was developed from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), the gold-standard diagnostic interview used in research studies. The SCQ is used primarily as a second-stage screen in research; its use as a primary screen is limited by lack of validation in a large community population sample. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/628.html" rel="external">
          "Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Evaluation and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnostic tools'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The SCQ was developed for use in preschool and school-age children (four years and older) [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36,37
         </a>
         ]. The SCQ is a caregiver-report screen that consists of 40 yes/no questions. There are two forms, one for children younger than six years and one for children age six years and older. The SCQ can usually be completed by the primary caregiver in less than 10 minutes and takes less than five minutes to score [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. The SCQ can be ordered through Western Psychological Services (www.wpspublish.com).
        </p>
        <p>
         The SCQ was validated in a high-risk sample of 200 patients ages 4 to 40 years whose caregivers had previously completed the ADI-R; 160 patients had ASD according to the ADI-R [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. A cut-off score of 15 on the SCQ had a sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 75 percent, respectively, for ASD according to the ADI-R.
        </p>
        <p>
         In another study of 151 children (mean age five years) referred for evaluation, a cut-off score of 15 on the SCQ had a sensitivity of 71 percent and a specificity of 79 percent [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. The SCQ missed some children with milder phenotypes and higher IQs. Lowering the cut-off score to 11 improves sensitivity but lowers specificity.
        </p>
        <p>
         In another study of 808 children aged 18 to 48 months referred to community child health or speech and language services, a cut-off score of 15 on the SCQ had a sensitivity of 64 percent and specificity of 75 percent [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Different cut-off scores may be needed for verbal and nonverbal individuals since several items related to verbal language are not included in the final score for nonverbal individuals. In the validation study [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ], the authors concluded that a cut-off score of 15 could be used for verbal and nonverbal subjects without impacting the psychometric properties. However, in a subsequent study with a younger clinic population, researchers found differences between scores in verbal and nonverbal individuals related to missing data (questions left blank) [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Questions remain regarding the optimal cut-off score, whether a shorter version would be more reliable in younger children, and whether scoring needs to be adjusted for items that are omitted (ie, items related to speech in nonverbal children) [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies evaluating the predictive value of the SCQ in a general population sample are lacking. In a study that assessed the SCQ in both a special-needs and general school-age population sample, 4 to 5 percent of the 658 children from the general population sample scored in the ASD range (≥15) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Among those who scored above the ASD cut-off, 90 percent had ASD or a neurodevelopmental disorder (eg, learning difficulty, language delay, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), suggesting that the SCQ may be an appropriate first-tier screen.

         A screening instrument enables detection of conditions/concerns that may not be readily apparent without screening. Screening helps to determine whether additional investigation (eg, a diagnostic evaluation) is necessary. (See
         <a class="local">

         First-tier screening tools are used to identify all children at risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from a general population. Second-tier screening tools are used to discriminate ASD from other developmental disorders in children with developmental concerns. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview'
         </a>

         </span>
         To optimize early identification of children at risk for autism, sensitivity is more important than specificity for first-tier screens. Thus, first-tier screening tools for ASD may be positive in children with other developmental disorders (eg, language disorders, global developmental delay). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Important caveats'
         </a>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The sensitivity and specificity of the ASD screening tools vary depending upon the age of the child and the severity of symptoms. The behavioral skills assessed to identify young children at risk for ASD (imitation, joint attention, and play) are developmentally sensitive. Older children with ASD and those who have received appropriate intervention can and do acquire these skills. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Important caveats'

         </span>
         When choosing a screening tool, it is important to know how well the tool performs (eg, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value) in the population in which it will be used. Many of the screening tools for ASD have been validated in high-risk populations (ie, referral clinic, early intervention) but have not been validated in low-risk populations (eg, primary care, general population, community samples)  (
