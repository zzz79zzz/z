         Venous pulsations can be examined in the external or internal jugular veins. Examination of the jugular veins involves observing the venous pulsations at varying degrees of head and upper body elevation and with maneuvers to determine if there are abnormalities in the jugular venous waveform  (

         Attention to a few key points is essential for proper examination of the jugular veins [

          Position
         </strong>
         – The examiner generally stands on the right side of the bed, as examination of the right side of the neck is generally preferred. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1076.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The patient lies supine upon an examination table or bed that bends in the middle at the hips to allow elevation and lowering of the entire upper body from head to thorax as a unit.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The patient's neck should be extended with sternocleidomastoid muscles relaxed; this is generally achieved with either a thin pillow or no pillow underneath the patient's head. Turn the head away (to the left if examining from the right) slightly (eg, 30 degrees from facing forward) and tip the head and jaw slightly up. This positioning may be guided by gentle pressure of the examiner's fingers on the patient's jaw to lift the jaw and neck upwards.

         <strong>
          Lighting
         </strong>
         – A helpful technique to improve visibility of the venous pulsations is to shine a flashlight tangentially to the skin over the mid portion of the neck  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111973" href="/z/d/graphic/111973.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The external jugular vein is generally visualized as it passes over the sternocleidomastoid muscle. To examine the internal jugular vein, the light is positioned so that a shadow is cast over the small shallow space between the sternal and clavicular attachments of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

         <strong>
          Identifying venous pulsations
         </strong>
         – The upper part of the examination table or bed is raised to elevate the patient's head, neck, and thorax together as a unit with a bend at the hips. The degree of upper body elevation is the angle (0 to 90 degrees) at which the venous pulsations and venous meniscus is best appreciated along the neck. The optimal angle depends upon the level of the jugular venous pressure (JVP). Thus, it may be necessary to move the examination table or bed through various angles of upper body tilt until the pulsation is visible.

         <strong>
          Low JVP
         </strong>
         – Low venous pressures are best seen in or near a supine position (0 degree angle), while high JVPs are seen best with the patient sitting upright (90 degrees).

         <strong>
          High JVP
         </strong>
         – Since it is important to detect a high JVP, we suggest always inspecting the neck with the patient sitting upright at some point during the examination. If the JVP is seen above the clavicle when the upper body is elevated to 90 degrees, the venous pressures are likely elevated [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. A high JVP may be missed in the supine position as the pulsation may be hidden high up (superiorly) in the neck. In patients with a very high JVP, the pulsation can cause the lower part of the ear lobe to pulsate.

         <strong>
          Direction of movement
         </strong>
         – In jugular vein pulsations, the most prominent movement is inward (descent). This is most commonly visible as one or two inward movements per cardiac cycle. In the carotid arteries, there is one outward pulsation per cardiac cycle.

         <strong>
          Palpation
         </strong>
         – The carotid pulsations are palpable, in contrast to the jugular venous pulsations, which are not palpable in almost every scenario. The most common exception is in severe tricuspid regurgitation, when the venous pulse may be palpable.

         Central venous waveforms similar to jugular venous waveforms are obtained by transducing pressure from a central venous catheter with tip in the superior vena cava or right atrium. There is a slight delay in transmission of pressures from the central venous system to the neck veins. (See

         <strong>
          c-wave
         </strong>
         – The x-descent is usually interrupted by the c-wave at the onset of right ventricular systole, reflecting transmission of pressure from bulging of the closed tricuspid valve into the right atrium, as well as from transmission of adjacent carotid artery pulsation.

          x'-descent
         </strong>
         – The x'-descent is caused by continued atrial relaxation and systolic descent of the tricuspid annular plane (the tricuspid valve) during right ventricular systole, causing a decrease in pressure which is the impetus for atrial filling during ventricular systole. The x'-descent coincides with the arterial pulse. The x- and x'-descents are often merged [

          v-wave

         – The v-wave is caused by the rise in right atrial and jugular venous pressure due to continued flow of blood into the right atrium during mid to late ventricular systole while the tricuspid valve is still closed. The peak of the normal v-wave is immediately after ventricular systole, just prior to opening of the tricuspid valve; the v-wave generally coincides with the downslope of the carotid pulse. S2 may be heard during the beginning of the v-wave.

         <strong>
          y-descent
         </strong>
         – The y-descent is caused by the opening of the tricuspid valve and the rapid flow of blood into the right ventricle from the right atrium and the venous system. The initial y-descent occurs during the rapid filling phase of the right ventricle. The right ventricular third heart sound (S3) corresponds to the nadir of the y-wave. The ascending limb of the y-wave occurs during continued inflow of blood to the right ventricle after the rapid filling phase.

        </p>
        <p>
         It is often difficult to distinguish a- and v-waves or x- and y-descents during tachycardia. Not infrequently, only one positive and one negative wave are recognized.

         Abnormally large a-waves occurring with each sinus beat indicate increased resistance (afterload) to right atrial emptying during atrial systole. Increased resistance may occur at the tricuspid valve level or due to decreased right ventricular compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic approach is useful in determining the potential etiology of the large a-wave. A large a-wave in the jugular venous pulse is more likely to occur in the absence of interatrial or interventricular septal defects when atrial contraction can generate higher pressure. Thus, prominent a-waves are uncommon in trilogy and tetralogy of Fallot or in Eisenmenger syndrome.

         Severe tricuspid regurgitation produces an early large v-wave (regurgitant wave or c-v-wave), which occurs with the onset of right ventricular systole; the amplitude of the v-wave depends upon the regurgitant volume and right atrial compliance  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef143081" href="/z/d/graphic/143081.html" rel="external">
          movie 2
         </a>
         ). The v-wave is followed by a steep y-descent, the result of the increased pressure gradient across the tricuspid valve, which allows rapid inflow to the right ventricle and decompression of the right atrium in early diastole.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The regurgitant wave of significant tricuspid regurgitation occurs concurrently with the carotid pulse and can be easily recognized by timing the onset with the carotid pulse upstroke. Associated with tricuspid regurgitation is a pansystolic murmur along the lower right and left sternal border that increases in intensity during inspiration, and systolic pulsation of the liver. (See

         A prominent v-wave is occasionally detected in patients with atrial septal defect without significant pulmonary arterial hypertension and in the absence of tricuspid regurgitation. The mechanism remains unclear. Concomitant systemic venous return and left-to-right shunting during ventricular systole may cause a rapid increase in right atrial pressure and, hence, a prominent v-wave. (See

          Prominent x'-descent
         </strong>
         – A prominent x'-descent occurs when there is vigorous right ventricular contraction. This finding is commonly seen in adults with normal right heart function and pressures and in some patients with atrial septal defect. A prominent x'-descent is also seen in some cases of cardiac tamponade and in some cases of pericardial constriction.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In adults with normal right heart function and pressures, in jugular venous pulsations, the x'-descent is generally more prominent than the y-descent, and the y-descent may not be identified (even though the y-descent is identified in right atrial pressure waveforms). This is because the fall in right atrial volume during right ventricular emptying may not cause an appreciable fall in pressure in the venous system [

         – A slow y-descent may suggest tricuspid valve obstruction, which can be confirmed by auscultatory findings of tricuspid stenosis.

         In constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy, the mean JVP is elevated, and the amplitudes of the a- and v-waves are usually similar. The most striking movement in the jugular venous pulse is the sharp inward y-descent. In some patients with constrictive pericarditis, a steeper x-descent may be present instead of a sharp y-descent. The mechanism of a sharp x-descent is not clear; it is more likely to occur in effusive-constrictive pericarditis.

         However, it is difficult to differentiate between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy at the bedside. A left parasternal diastolic impulse and pericardial "knock" favors constrictive pericarditis; physical findings indicating significant right ventricular systolic and pulmonary arterial hypertension are more common in restrictive cardiomyopathy.

          Distinguishing venous from arterial pulsations
         </strong>
         – Jugular venous pulsations can be distinguished from carotid artery pulsations by the dominant direction of movement (inward for venous pulsations versus outward for arterial pulsations), palpation (only arterial pulsations are palpable), and effects of inspiration, position, and abdominal pressure on jugular venous pulsations (and absence of effect on arterial pulsations).

          Waveform components
         </strong>
         – The jugular venous waveform includes three positive waves (ascents), a, c and v, and three negative waves (descents), x, x', and y  (

         – A prominent v-wave occurs most commonly in the setting of tricuspid regurgitation and rarely in patients with atrial septal defects. In some patients with an arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis, a prominent v-wave is seen due to shunting of blood into the venous system. (See
