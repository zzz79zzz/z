The frequency of these complications was evaluated by a National Inpatient Sample database study of 95,665 adults who underwent pericardiocentesis, of which 7770 were identified as having PH [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Unadjusted rates of in-hospital mortality (13.2 versus 9.5 percent) and postprocedural shock (2.8 versus 1.3 percent) were higher in patients with PH than in those without PH. In adjusted analysis, patients with PH had higher rates of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.40, 95% CI 1.30-1.51) and postprocedure shock compared with patients without PH (aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.30-1.81).

Periprocedural management of these disorders is discussed separately.

For pericardial effusion without tamponade that is managed with elective pericardiocentesis, it is generally preferred to delay the procedure to allow time to hold a direct oral anticoagulant or hold a vitamin K antagonist and allow the international normalized ratio to fall. Periprocedural management of anticoagulant therapy for percutaneous and surgical procedures is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1312.html" rel="external">"Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104830.html" rel="external">"Anticoagulation for prosthetic heart valves: Management of bleeding and invasive procedures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1231265445"><span class="h1">CHOICE OF PERICARDIAL DRAINAGE PROCEDURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pericardial fluid removal can be accomplished by percutaneous pericardiocentesis or by a surgical procedure (open surgical drainage with or without a pericardial window or video-assisted thoracoscopic pericardial window), which are generally highly effective for removal of fluid and relief of symptoms associated with hemodynamic compromise [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The choice of procedure for pericardial fluid drainage is based largely upon whether the pericardial effusion is accessible to percutaneous drainage and whether there is a critical cardiac or aortic bleeding site that requires surgical management  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143187" href="/z/d/graphic/143187.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>In patients with cardiac tamponade, invasive hemodynamic monitoring during the pericardial drainage procedure enables definitive confirmation of cardiac tamponade and recovery with pericardial fluid removal.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3484026293"><span class="h2">Percutaneous pericardiocentesis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Percutaneous pericardiocentesis is the treatment of choice for most patients with an indication for pericardial fluid drainage  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143187" href="/z/d/graphic/143187.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Catheter pericardiocentesis, with echocardiographic guidance, permits the operator to select the best location and angle for puncture, permits precise measurement of hemodynamics, facilitates the diagnosis of effusive-constrictive pericarditis, and requires fewer resources than surgical intervention. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4938.html" rel="external">"Constrictive pericarditis: Diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Effusive-constrictive pericarditis'</a>.)</p><p>Although the pericardial fluid volume is often relatively small in the setting of acute cardiac tamponade complicating invasive cardiac procedure (eg, percutaneous coronary intervention or invasive electrophysiology procedure), patients with this condition can often be safely managed with pericardiocentesis under echocardiographic guidance by experienced interventional cardiologists or electrophysiologists, although surgical backup is required, particularly for high-risk cases. In the setting of acute bleeding, pericardial pressure rises very quickly with small increases in pericardial fluid, resulting in hemodynamic compromise and the need for urgent fluid removal. Pericardiocentesis has a higher associated risk if there is less than 1 cm of effusion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1562.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Perforation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/980.html" rel="external">"Invasive diagnostic cardiac electrophysiology studies", section on 'Complications of invasive cardiac electrophysiology studies'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2150786243"><span class="h3">Team and location for pericardiocentesis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pericardiocentesis should be performed by an experienced team including a cardiac interventionalist, a catheterization laboratory nurse, a monitor technician, and a sonographer.</p><p>When feasible, hemodynamic assessment via cardiac catheterization is performed during the pericardial fluid drainage procedure. If cardiac tamponade is present, the diagnosis is confirmed by identifying typical hemodynamic findings prior to pericardial fluid removal and resolution of hemodynamic abnormalities after drainage. Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is suspected if the right atrial pressure remains elevated after removal of the pericardial effusion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4938.html" rel="external">"Constrictive pericarditis: Diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Effusive-constrictive pericarditis'</a>.)</p><p>The procedure should be performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory or a procedure room with catheterization laboratory capabilities, even if fluoroscopy is not used. This enables invasive hemodynamics to be more readily and accurately monitored and recorded along with continuous standard electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Right heart and pericardial pressures are recorded simultaneously; the catheter is then pulled back to the right atrium, where pressure is monitored during and immediately after the procedure. The appropriate team and setting with continuous hemodynamic monitoring aids in early detection and immediate management should a life-threatening complication arise.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H794718157"><span class="h3">Technique</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Imaging</strong> – For patients undergoing percutaneous pericardiocentesis, we suggest echocardiographic guidance rather than no imaging guidance or only fluoroscopic guidance. Echocardiography offers several advantages over fluoroscopy:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Echocardiography permits identification of the configuration of the effusion, particularly where it is closest to the skin with no intervening vital organs. This allows the operator to select the shortest safe route to the effusion [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Monitoring the position of the needle during the initial puncture is easier and more convenient than with fluoroscopy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients and staff are not exposed to radiation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Agitated <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> with microbubbles, rather than radiopaque contrast, is used to verify that the needle is in the pericardial effusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient position and puncture location</strong> – The patient is commonly positioned in a semirecumbent position of about 30 degrees head-up and slightly rotated leftward to enhance fluid collection along the inferior-anterior aspect of the chest [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The puncture site may be apical, parasternal, subxiphoid, or subcostal. In a series of 1127 therapeutic echocardiographically-guided pericardiocentesis cases, the para-apical location was the most frequently utilized location (68 percent), while the subcostal or subxiphoid was utilized as the ideal location in only 15 percent of cases [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When the apical route is chosen, the needle is directed parallel with the long axis of the left ventricle towards the aortic valve. For parasternal insertion, the puncture is made 1 cm lateral to the sternal edge to avoid both inadvertent puncture of the internal mammary artery when too medial as well as pneumothorax when too lateral.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Drainage</strong> – Once the pericardial space has been accessed, a thin-walled pigtail catheter should be inserted for ongoing drainage. This catheter, with a three-way stopcock attached, may also be used for pericardial pressure measurement. Following catheter insertion and initial pericardial pressure measurement, fluid is then aspirated, and pressures are often remeasured every several minutes to ascertain the hemodynamic result.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pericardial fluid is drained in &lt;1000 mL sequential steps to reduce the risk of pericardial decompression syndrome, as recommended in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, although this is a rare complication [<a href="#rid1">1,10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Complications of pericardial fluid removal'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The procedure is generally continued until pericardial pressure is &lt;5 mmHg, at least during inspiration.</p><p></p><p>Additional discussion regarding the technical aspects of pericardiocentesis is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13823.html" rel="external">"Emergency pericardiocentesis", section on 'Technique overview'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1636068900"><span class="h3">Postprocedure care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following the initial pericardiocentesis, the patient should be observed in a unit equipped to monitor the ECG, the patency of the pericardial catheter, and the rate of drainage into a sealed container under slight negative pressure. In most cases, pericardiocentesis does not completely evacuate the effusion, and active secretion of fluid or bleeding may result in reaccumulation of an effusion. For these reasons, an indwelling catheter is left in the pericardial space for up to five days after pericardiocentesis until fluid return is &lt;25 to 50 mL/day [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For patients with persistent pericardial fluid drainage greater than 50 mL/day after three to five days of drainage, we evaluate for a surgical pericardial window. (See <a class="local">'Management of recurrent pericardial effusion'</a> below.)</p><p>Extended pericardial catheter drainage of pericardial effusions requiring intervention is associated with lower recurrence rates [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. In a study of 157 consecutive patients with pericardial effusion treated with pericardiocentesis, the rate of recurrent pericardial effusions was significantly lower in patients treated with extended (mean 38 hours) catheter drainage (12 versus 52 percent among those without extended catheter drainage) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].
