         A wide variety of lesions occurs on the vulva. Some of the disorders causing these lesions are limited to the vulva, while others also involve skin or mucocutaneous membranes elsewhere on the body. This topic provides a morphology-based classification system that can help clinicians with the differential diagnosis of these lesions after performing a history and physical examination. This classification system is also useful for guiding the choice of diagnostic tests and procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will focus on the differential diagnosis of pigmented vulvar lesions, including black, brown, and blue lesions. Discussion of red, yellow, erosive and ulcerative, and white lesions are presented in related content.

         Based on the authors' experience, clinicians should be aware of the following points when evaluating dermatologic lesions of the vulva:

         <span class="glyph">

         <strong>
          Alternate appearance of vulvar lesions
         </strong>
         – Many skin conditions may appear differently on the vulva than on other parts of the skin as the vulva is so moist and the area is commonly subject to friction.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         <strong>
          Concomitant conditions
         </strong>
         – Concomitant conditions to consider with vulvar lesions include infections, other dermatoses, and neoplasia/cancer. For example, irritant contact dermatitis from the use of caustic soaps or overwashing is commonly seen in individuals with vulvar lichen sclerosus.
        </p>

         </span>
         <strong>
          Impact of topical therapies
         </strong>
         – Vulvar conditions may be significantly altered by the use of topical treatments. The authors ask patients about use of prescription, over-the-counter, compounded, and alternative topical preparations.
        </p>

         </span>
         <strong>
          Role of biopsy
         </strong>
         – Be prepared to perform a biopsy, especially if a vulvar lesion is atypical, bleeding, the patient is immunocompromised, the lesion is not responding to appropriate treatment, or there is concern for a premalignant or malignant condition [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. For any lesions with variable or irregular areas, more than one biopsy may be needed. At times, the biopsy results can be inconclusive. If there are ever concerns or questions about the biopsy report, it is important to speak with the pathologist. Sending a clinical photograph to the pathologist can also aid the diagnosis.

         </span>
         <strong>
          Consider possibility of systemic disease
         </strong>
         – Vulvar lesions can represent diseases that commonly present on the vulva (eg, herpes simplex virus) or systemic diseases that manifest in multiple sites including the vulva (eg, psoriasis). Providers are encouraged to ask patients with vulvar lesions about generalized symptoms and presence of lesions or skin changes on other body parts.

         </span>
         <strong>
          Specialist referral
         </strong>
         – Patients whose symptoms do not respond, or worsen, despite usual treatment should be referred to a gynecologist, dermatologist, family medicine physician, or other health care providers who specialize in vulvar skin disorders.

         After a history, physical examination, and morphologic classification  (

         ) have been performed, the information in this topic can be used to begin a differential diagnosis of the lesion. Diagnostic entities are listed for each morphologic classification and often listed under more than one morphologic classification since many lesions have more than one presentation (morphologic type, color). The complete description of the diagnostic entity is provided only once; for morphologic variants, the entity is noted and linked to its descriptive section.

         This topic is an overview of pigmented dermatologic lesions of the vulva. Detailed text specific to each type of vulvar lesion is available separately, and links are provided throughout the text where available. Brief summaries of pertinent history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests and procedures are provided in this topic. Discussions of the presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of vulvar lesions are described in detail separately.

         Physiologic hyperpigmentation presents as asymptomatic, symmetric, flat, smooth, brown or brown-black patches on the labia majora and outer edge of the labia minora. It is more prominent in women with naturally dark skin color. Endogenous or exogenous sex hormones may lead to further darkening. The diagnosis is clinical and can be differentiated from postinflammatory hyperpigmentation because the latter is not as symmetric and even in color. (See

         Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation may arise at sites of previous inflammation from any cause, including trivial insults such as a scratch, contact dermatitis, or a burn. The color varies from light tan to gray, blue, brown, or black. The pigmentation is flat and usually smooth, but slight scale may be present when the preceding inflammation was related to an eczematous process. The site and pattern will depend on the preceding inflammation. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation resulting from lichen sclerosus typically appears as reticulated or patchy pigmented macules or regular patches along the peripheral edges of the vestibule or perineum  (

        <p>
         A history of a prior inflammatory process or trauma will help to make the diagnosis. When the pattern is black or irregular, vulvar melanosis (lentiginosis) and melanoma must be considered. Several biopsies may need to be taken to make a definitive diagnosis and exclude malignancy. (See

         Melanocytic nevi are common; 90 percent of nevi are the typical, benign type, presenting as symmetric, tan, or brown macules (junctional nevi) or papules (compound or intradermal nevi). The edges are sharply marginated, the color is homogenous, and most are less than 1 cm in diameter. Slight variation in color and outline is normal. They do not change in appearance over time. They are not symptomatic unless rubbed or irritated. They can be congenital or acquired.

Intradermal nevi are usually skin colored or only lightly pigmented. Nevi and, rarely, malignant melanomas can occur within the lesions of lichen sclerosus. Any questionable lesion should have a complete narrow excision or adequate biopsy.

         Seborrheic keratoses are small, benign, warty growths that occur anywhere on the body, but most commonly on the torso. When they occur in the anogenital area, they are restricted to nonmucosal, keratinizing skin. They typically develop after 35 to 40 years of age. The lesions are sharply marginated, tan, brown, or black papules with a warty, stuck-on appearance. Size is variable from 3 mm to over 2 cm, and the surface is elevated 2 to 10 mm above the surrounding normal skin surface. The surface scale can be scraped off with resulting pinpoint bleeding. On high magnification, there may be minute pits or milia-like keratin inclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
         When seborrheic keratoses occur on the vulva, differentiation from HSIL of the vulva can be difficult. HPV lesions are usually small and multiple, whereas seborrheic keratoses are often solitary on the vulva, but there may be a large number elsewhere on the skin. Other pigmented lesions that can mimic vulvar seborrheic keratoses include basal cell carcinoma, dysplastic nevi, and melanoma. A biopsy is diagnostic. (See

         Vulvar melanosis, a benign condition, presents as a large, asymptomatic, hyperpigmented patch. The color is dark and is usually deep brown, or black. Vulvar melanosis accounts for 60 to 70 percent of all vulvar pigmented lesions [

Vulvar melanosis develops in adult women and is most often located along the edges of the labia minora and the vulvar trigone, usually on the modified mucous membranes bilaterally. It may develop within lesions of lichen sclerosus. Vulvar melanosis tends to occur in younger women, whereas vulvar melanoma tends to occur in older women. The differential diagnosis includes postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the vulva, dysplastic nevi, and melanoma [

They are asymmetric (A); have an irregular or scalloped border (B); often black in color (C) or variegate with shades of red, white, or blue; may have a diameter (D) greater than 6 mm; and are evolving (E). Early signs include change in size, shape, and color of a lesion. On rare occasions, melanomas of the vulva can lack pigmentation [

         – Acanthosis nigricans is a rare vulvar condition affecting those with obesity  (

         ), thyroid disease, and, occasionally, metabolic syndrome. It presents as brown areas in the body folds, especially around the neck and in the axillae, but also in the crural folds. The surface is thickened and velvety, which gives the skin a dirty appearance. A biopsy will confirm the clinical diagnosis. (See

         <strong>
          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – For individuals with vulvar lesions, evaluation begins with a history, physical examination, and morphologic classification of the lesion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95851" href="/z/d/graphic/95851.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         <strong>
          Clinical points
         </strong>
         – Based on the authors' experience, clinicians should be aware of alternate appearances of vulvar lesions, concomitant conditions, topic therapies, role of biopsy, and possibility of systemic disease when evaluating dermatologic lesions of the vulva (see
         <a class="local">

         Patients whose symptoms do not respond, or worsen, despite usual treatment should be referred to a gynecologist, dermatologist, family medicine physician, or other health care providers who specialize in vulvar skin disorders.

         <strong>
          Common etiologies
         </strong>
         include physiologic hyperpigmentation, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, squamous intraepithelial lesions, melanocytic nevi, seborrheic keratoses, angiokeratomas, and skin tags (acrochordons). These diagnoses are often suggested by patient history and physical examination, but biopsy may be required for diagnosis and/or exclusion of malignancy. (See

          Less common etiologies
         </strong>
         include lentiginosis or vulvar melanosis, lichen planus, atypical melanocytic nevus, melanoma, and varicosity. With the possible exception of vulvar varicosities, biopsy is generally necessary for these diagnoses.
