(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1800.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p>In children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, there are circumstances, such as acute illnesses, when glucose metabolism is significantly altered, requiring additional monitoring of blood glucose (BG) and ketones and possibly requiring adjustment of the child's daily insulin dose. The school or daycare setting also presents challenges in the management of the insulin-dependent child.</p><p>Managing the child or adolescent with type 1 diabetes in settings with altered insulin requirements and at school or daycare is reviewed here. Other aspects of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5816.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5817.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5818.html" rel="external">"Complications and screening in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16412.html" rel="external">"Management of exercise for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97229.html" rel="external">"Hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">SICK-DAY MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sick-day management includes adequate hydration and adjustments to the insulin dose based on frequent monitoring of blood glucose (BG) and ketones. The goal is to maintain BG concentrations between 70 and 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10 mmol/L) and to maintain or reduce ketones to less than 0.6 mmol/L. The following discussion is consistent with guidelines from the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H702908047"><span class="h2">Indications for seeking urgent medical advice</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The family should seek urgent advice from a specialist for children if any of the following are present before or during home management.

These hormones, which include epinephrine and cortisol, raise peripheral insulin resistance, thereby increasing insulin requirements. Increased insulin resistance persists for a few days to weeks after recovery from the acute illness; this has also been observed following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and COVID-19 vaccination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decreased insulin requirements</strong> may be caused by reduced oral intake of carbohydrates because of decreased appetite, nausea, or vomiting. Thus, a child with type 1 diabetes during an acute illness can develop:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hypoglycemia</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Significant hyperglycemia</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Diabetic ketoacidosis due to inadequate insulin supplementation</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ketosis/ketoacidosis independent of hyperglycemia</p><p></p><p>Sick-day management is directed toward prevention of the above complications and should not be left solely in the hands of the child or adolescent. Parental involvement is imperative to avoid these diabetic complications. Telephone management with the diabetes care team is helpful in the care of these patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1445503528"><span class="h2">Supportive care</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1636140294"><span class="h3">Monitor blood glucose more frequently</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During an illness, BG monitoring should be performed more frequently, eg, every one to two hours, including during the night. The frequency of testing may be decreased to every two or four hours as the child recovers.</p><p>A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) can be particularly useful for sick-day monitoring and management because of the need for frequent monitoring of glucose levels and because the CGM also signals whether glucose levels are rising, falling, or stable. Use of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13028" href="/d/drug information/13028.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>, ascorbic acid, and salicylic acid can interfere with readings on the CGM, with acetaminophen and ascorbic acid falsely raising sensor glucose readings and salicylic acid falsely lowering these readings. Newer models of the CGM perform better in this regard, but higher-than-recommended doses of acetaminophen (eg &gt;1 g every six hours in adults), ascorbic acid (&gt;500 mg/day), and salicylic acid continue to result in inaccurate readings. Further, readings with the CGM may be erroneous when the patient is dehydrated because of poor perfusion. In all such instances, fingerstick glucose testing is advisable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129412.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Continuous glucose monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2468847228"><span class="h3">Monitor ketones frequently</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ketone formation and ketoacidosis can occur even without hyperglycemia if oral intake is poor.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If home testing of blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) concentration is available, we suggest performing this test every two to four hours, in conjunction with the fingerstick glucose test. Home testing of BOHB is the preferred method for monitoring ketones because it permits earlier detection of ketosis compared with tests for urinary ketones, which measure acetone and acetoacetate. Most families find the BOHB blood testing strips easy to use. Blood testing for BOHB is particularly useful for early detection of ketoacidosis in children managed with an insulin pump.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If home testing for BOHB is not available, urinary ketones should be checked with every void, regardless of BG concentration. It is important to recognize that improvement in urine ketones may lag behind improvement in blood ketones during recovery. Also, urine ketone test strips may deteriorate within a few weeks of opening the bottle. For this reason, foil-wrapped ketone strips are preferred.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H264355257"><span class="h3">Maintain hydration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients, maintain hydration by encouraging regular oral fluids. If BG is &lt;250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L), the fluids should include carbohydrates and electrolytes. If hypoglycemia develops, higher concentrations of carbohydrates may be required. If BG is &gt;250 mg/dL (14 mmol/L), carbohydrate-free fluids should be used. (See <a class="local">'Insulin and carbohydrate dosing'</a> below.)</p><p>For all patients with suspected or confirmed ketosis, rigorous oral hydration is essential, in addition to insulin and carbohydrate therapy. To hydrate, administer oral fluids every one to two hours at the rate of 4 to 6 mL/kg/hour or 100 mL/hour.</p><p>If adequate oral hydration cannot be maintained, particularly if ketosis is present, the patient should be evaluated and treated at an appropriate medical facility. These patients may require intravenous fluids and additional insulin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5808.html" rel="external">"Diabetic ketoacidosis in children: Treatment and complications"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1748607100"><span class="h2">Insulin and carbohydrate dosing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adjust the insulin dose as needed, based on frequent measurements of BG and blood or urinary ketones. Insulin requirements may be either increased or decreased during an illness.</p><p>For children with a poor appetite, options for carbohydrates include easily digestible and tolerated foods (such as soft rice, rice cereal, rice and lentil broth, rice porridge, cooked farina, noodles, crackers, and yogurt) and carbohydrate-containing fluids (such as sports drinks, lemonade with sugar and salt, juice, and sugar-containing sodas). The "fizz" in sodas and soft drinks should be allowed to dissipate before administration to reduce flatulence and improve tolerability, particularly when there is associated nausea and vomiting. Fluids containing both carbohydrates and electrolytes (eg, Pedialyte or soups) are preferred to fluids with carbohydrates alone. For children with vomiting and/or nausea, iced popsicles or very cold sugar-containing liquids may be better tolerated than other drinks or soups.</p><p>Administration of both insulin and carbohydrates is necessary to avoid "starvation ketosis." The relative amount of these components depends on the child's BG concentration. Oral fluids with sugar and electrolytes generally meet the immediate needs for carbohydrates, but children with BG concentrations in the low or normal range generally need extra carbohydrates during illness.</p><p>Recommendations for insulin and carbohydrate dosing are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140795" href="/d/graphic/140795.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and detailed in the ISPAD guideline [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The approach depends on the child's BG concentration and severity of ketosis:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3443247048"><span class="h3">Hyperglycemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with hyperglycemia (BG &gt;180 mg/dL [10 mmol/L]) require additional insulin, as well as fluids (with carbohydrates unless BG is ≥250 mg/dL [14 mmol/L]).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Basal dosing</strong> – For patients with persistent hyperglycemia or illness expected to last three or more days, the dose of long-acting or intermediate-acting insulin may be increased by 20 to 30 percent or the basal rate on a pump by 20 to 50 percent. In these situations, the basal insulin requirement is often increased because of illness-associated insulin resistance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Coverage of meals/snacks</strong> – Give rapid-acting insulin (lispro, aspart, or glulisine) boluses based on the insulin:carbohydrate ratio and insulin sensitivity factor (if BG ≥400 mg/dL [22.2 mmol/L], increase to 110 percent of the calculated dose). If rapid-acting insulin is not available, short-acting (regular) insulin may be used instead.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Correction doses</strong> – To manage persistent postprandial hyperglycemia (BG &gt;180 mg/dL [10 mmol/L]), give additional correction doses of insulin every two hours, as outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140795" href="/d/graphic/140795.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), using rapid-acting insulin (lispro, aspart, or glulisine)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61880" href="/d/graphic/61880.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Short-acting (regular) insulin is not preferred in this situation but may be used if rapid-acting insulin is not available (administered at three- to four-hour intervals). Of note, for children who typically have very low insulin needs (eg, during the "honeymoon phase" of diabetes), insulin requirements during sickness may be higher than otherwise expected.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For children on insulin pump therapy with persistent hyperglycemia or hyperglycemia and ketosis, the initial bolus of additional insulin should be given using an <strong>insulin pen or syringe</strong> because malfunction of the pump or infusion set is a very common cause of hyperglycemia and ketosis/ketoacidosis in pump users. Next, functionality of the pump and infusion set or pod should be assessed before using it for subsequent insulin delivery. It is usually wise to replace the insulin pen cartridge and needle, pump cartridge, infusion set, or pod at this time. For children using a hybrid closed-loop system, the setting should be switched to manual mode during sick-day management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring blood sugar</strong> – When using a rapid-acting insulin analog, it is prudent to check BG and ketones after two hours and administer additional doses of supplemental insulin as necessary, rather than waiting longer. These insulins have peak action at one to three hours and effective total duration of action of three to five hours. When BG decreases to the 70 to 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10 mmol/L) range, checking every three to four hours is usually sufficient. If BG is higher, checking every two hours is advisable.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4019410494"><span class="h3">Normoglycemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For children with BG between 70 and 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10 mmol/L), intake of sugar-containing food or liquids should be encouraged to provide extra carbohydrates. For children with vomiting and/or nausea, iced popsicles or very cold sugar-containing liquids may be better tolerated than other drinks or soups. (See <a class="local">'Insulin and carbohydrate dosing'</a> above.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Basal dosing</strong> – Administer basal insulin at the usual pre-illness dose.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Coverage of meals/snacks</strong> – Once the BG rises to ≥90 mg/dL (5 mmol/L), give rapid-acting insulin (lispro, aspart, or glulisine) boluses (or short-acting [regular] insulin if rapid-acting insulin is not available), based on the insulin:carbohydrate ratio and insulin sensitivity factor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Correction doses</strong> – Additional correction doses of rapid- or short-acting insulin may be necessary depending on ketone levels  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140795" href="/d/graphic/140795.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring blood sugar</strong> – Check BG every hour until BG is ≥90 mg/dL (5 mmol/L), after which the frequency of BG monitoring may be reduced to every two to four hours depending on BG and ketone levels.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2203580602"><span class="h3">Hypoglycemia or borderline hypoglycemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For children with hypoglycemia (BG &lt;70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) or borderline hypoglycemia (BG 70 to 90 mg/dL [3.9 to 5 mmol/L]), intake of sugar-containing food or liquids should be encouraged to provide extra carbohydrates and insulin doses may need to be reduced. Oral intake may be insufficient in many of these children because of reduced appetite, nausea, or vomiting. For children with vomiting and/or nausea, iced popsicles or very cold sugar-containing liquids may be better tolerated than other drinks or soups. (See <a class="local">'Insulin and carbohydrate dosing'</a> above.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reducing the basal insulin dose</strong> – Insulin should generally be reduced, rather than stopped, even if the child is not eating. A brief pause in basal insulin may be appropriate, as noted in the bullets below. Complete cessation of insulin administration for a longer period can cause increased ketogenesis, worsening ketosis, and, possibly, ketoacidosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The protocol for reducing the basal insulin dose depends on the insulin regimen used by the patient (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129412.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Insulin preparations'</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Children using an insulin pump</strong> – For children using an insulin pump, the basal infusion can be continued at the usual rate or decreased by up to 20 percent (particularly when ketones are low to absent). Further reductions in the basal insulin infusion rate may be necessary if BG levels are persistently low (&lt;70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) despite the initial dose reduction. In addition to reducing the basal rate, bolus dosing may be reduced by as much as 50 percent. Caregivers of children using a hybrid closed-loop pump must be aware that these pumps may algorithmically maintain glucose in range during illness. However, if there are concerns, it is safest to return pumps to manual mode and monitor and treat altered glucose and ketones accordingly. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129412.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Automated insulin delivery (hybrid closed-loop insulin pumps)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">There are uncommon circumstances when a brief suspension of the insulin infusion may be necessary. For example, if BG persists below 70 mg/dL (&lt;3.9 mmol/L) despite administration of carbohydrates or if the child is unable to consume sufficient oral carbohydrates, basal insulin delivery may be suspended briefly until BG increases to ≥70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). In such situations, intravenous glucose infusion may be necessary to enable insulin administration without incurring hypoglycemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Children using long-acting basal insulin</strong> – For children receiving a long-acting basal insulin via subcutaneous injection, short-term reduction in the dose of basal insulin is not possible. If they are unable to take sufficient carbohydrate by mouth to maintain BG concentrations in the normal range, lower doses of bolus insulin followed by low-dose <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13335" href="/d/drug information/13335.html" rel="external">glucagon</a> may be tried, as described under "additional measures" below.
