During adolescence, children undergo unique anatomic, physiologic, cognitive, and behavioral changes. This topic will discuss the changes of adolescence that affect anesthetic care, preoperative evaluation, and anesthetic management, with a specific focus on those issues that are different between adolescents, adults, and younger children.</p><p>Anesthesia for infants and young children is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106984.html" rel="external">"General anesthesia in neonates and children: Agents and techniques"</a>.)</p><p>Various aspects of anesthetic management in adults are discussed in multiple other topic reviews.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1181555630"><span class="h1">PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES DURING ADOLESCENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During puberty there are significant changes in body size and composition, as well as developmental changes in the brain that appear to be correlated with maturing executive and emotional function. These changes are of significance to the anesthesiologist caring for adolescents.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Growth and metabolism – </strong>There is a growth spurt during puberty (early to mid-adolescence) under the influence of overlapping effects of multiple hormones. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5849.html" rel="external">"Normal puberty", section on 'Growth spurt'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This growth spurt is accompanied by increases in muscle mass and strength, which may play a role in development of negative pressure pulmonary edema, discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Negative pressure pulmonary edema'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There are significant metabolic changes associated with this increase in body mass, which can influence anesthetic management in very specific ways.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>High oxygen consumption </strong>–<strong> </strong>Maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>)<strong> </strong>increases from about 8 years until about 16 years in males and 13 years in females, then plateaus in all adolescents. On average, both values are greater in boys than in girls [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Elevated basal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) results in a linear increase in basal minute CO<sub>2</sub> production, which requires increased minute ventilation to maintain normocarbia during anesthesia. (See <a class="local">'Ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">CO<sub>2 </sub>levels and the need for ventilation may increase even more during procedures that involve CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation (eg, laparoscopy) or in patients who are febrile. Preoperative anxiety can also increase<sub> </sub>VO<sub>2</sub> and<sub> </sub>CO<sub>2</sub> production in fit adolescents because of the increase in endogenous catecholamines, which can explain a high end tidal<sub> </sub>CO<sub>2</sub> at the start of anesthesia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Changing</strong> <strong>systemic vascular resistance</strong> – Unlike infants and young children (&lt;5 years of age), adolescents are more likely to become hypotensive from sympathectomy associated with neuraxial block, similar to adults. [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. The reasons for this difference are not well understood. (See <a class="local">'Regional anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>High cardiac output </strong>–<strong> </strong>Increased VO<sub>2 </sub>is<sub> </sub>associated with increased cardiac output and pulmonary blood flow, which slow induction of anesthesia with inhaled anesthetics. These changes increase uptake of anesthetic agent from the alveoli, delaying establishment of equilibrium between agent concentrations in alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood, thereby slowing inhalation induction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94534.html" rel="external">"Inhalation anesthetic agents: Properties and delivery", section on 'Cardiovascular factors'</a> and <a class="local">'Intravenous versus inhalation induction'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Muscle mass </strong>–<strong> </strong>During adolescent development, the fit teenager has more cardiorespiratory reserve than at any other time in life. Muscle mass and activity level peak at about 12 to 14 years of age, and then decline during adolescence. This increase in muscle mass is associated with concomitant decrease in fat mass in physically active adolescents. This change in body composition is one factor that shifts the volume of distribution of many medications used in anesthesia from that of younger children towards that of adults.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Physical working capacity (ie, the ability to perform maximal work) triples in males and doubles in females linearly between 7 and 17 years of age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6473.html" rel="external">"Exercise testing in children and adolescents: Principles and clinical application", section on 'Normal capacity'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Brain development </strong>–<strong> </strong>Structural and functional changes in the brain occur in parallel during adolescence. Neural connections and myelination develop in various parts of the brain throughout childhood and adolescence and continue until approximately 25 years of age [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Thus, there are developmentally based differences between the brains of adolescents and adults, reflected in the way they behave in emotional situations. Adolescents’ emotional experiences are wired for greater intensity, while they are, at the same time, making progress to the mature executive function more characteristic of adults. They may become excessively dramatic when upset. The physical growth spurt is accompanied by enhanced abstract thought and an emerging perspective on “bigger pictures” and empathy, which happens over the course of adolescence. These changes are frequently accompanied by the tensions of forming a self-identity (as in, separation from parents) yet also fighting with parents and other adults.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Adolescents may need guidance in how to think about anesthesia options presented to them and navigate the boundary between parental desires, concerns, and their own ability to listen to and participate in the decision-making. Straightforward and honest conversation is best; their fears and fantasies about the possibilities are often far worse than the facts clinicians can present to them, and the importance of hope, especially for major operations, is crucial.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pharmacology </strong>–<strong> </strong>Unlike small children, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of intravenous drugs are similar in adolescents and in adults. The pharmacodynamic effects related to hormonal changes, and pharmacogenetic and neurodevelopmental differences are not well understood. Nonetheless, in healthy adolescents, the volume of distribution and end organ maturation do not significantly differ from adults, such that adolescents generally handle anesthetics like adults.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2283983346"><span class="h1">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3138672654"><span class="h2">Medical evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most adolescents are healthy and fit, and preanesthesia evaluation is like other healthy patients. The extent of preoperative evaluation should be determined by physical findings, any comorbidities, and the planned surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94539.html" rel="external">"Preoperative evaluation for anesthesia for noncardiac surgery"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4816.html" rel="external">"Preoperative medical evaluation of the healthy adult patient"</a>.)</p><p>However, the preoperative history and physical examination may require modification due to adolescent psychological and body image issues. As an example, adolescent females may be reluctant to allow auscultation of the chest without appropriate draping, perhaps with a parent or caregiver present or behind a curtain. Considerations for patient modesty and privacy are crucial for adolescents, especially related to gender and culture, and are important even in the exigency of preoperative evaluation.</p><p>In the typically brief preoperative visit, anesthesiologists are challenged with establishing rapport (not only with the adolescent but also with the parents or caregivers), obtaining a complete and truthful history, and finding out about substance use, which can have significant implications for anesthetic planning, emergence, and perioperative recovery.</p><p>Medical conditions and issues that are of particular concern in evaluating adolescents include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Eating disorders</strong> – Eating disorders are important concerns in adolescents. A 2011 study found that the lifetime prevalence of anorexia in adolescents was 0.3 percent in both males and females. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2093.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Anorexia is associated with multiple medical complications that may affect anesthetic care, including atrioventricular (AV) block; QT prolongation; supra- and ventricular tachycardias; electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia and contraction alkalosis with hypochloremia; hypomagnesemia); impaired thermoregulation; and osteoporosis. If arrhythmias occur in patients with anorexia, it is important to consider electrolyte abnormalities. Furthermore, the risk of aspiration should be considered, due to gastroparesis either from electrolyte abnormalities or as a constitutional response to the decrease in metabolism resulting from chronic starvation [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14705.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: Medical complications and their management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The preoperative interview with patients with anorexia and their families or caregivers may be challenging and stressful for the anesthesia clinician. It may be difficult to acquire information. Patients may be defensive and angry when questioned, and denial is common. In this setting, clinicians may unconsciously avoid some in-depth medical questions because patients with anorexia are often composed, poised, and appear fit and healthy. It is important to realize that these patients can become sick and deteriorate quickly.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Obesity </strong>–<strong> </strong>Childhood and adolescent obesity has increased dramatically over time in the United States… Based on data from 2020 to 20212023, 1:3 adolescents were overweight or obese, higher for Latino (43 percent) and Black (40 percent) youth compared to White (27 percent) and Asian/Pacific Islander (25 percent) adolescents [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5874.html" rel="external">"Definition, epidemiology, and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Similar to adults, obesity is an important predisposing factor for difficult mask ventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, hypertension, type II diabetes and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), all of which may affect anesthetic care. Children with obesity have a higher incidence of difficult mask ventilation, airway obstruction, major oxygen desaturation, and overall critical respiratory adverse events [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5869.html" rel="external">"Overview of the health consequences of obesity in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90177.html" rel="external">"Preanesthesia medical evaluation of the patient with obesity"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14932.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for the patient with obesity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Anesthetic considerations for patients with obesity and/or OSA are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14932.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for the patient with obesity"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13517.html" rel="external">"Intraoperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Substance use </strong>–<strong> </strong>Substance use is a common risk-taking behavior among adolescents. During preoperative evaluation, it is important to elicit information about this highly charged topic (eg, cigarette smoking; vaping; substance use, including alcohol or psychoactive drugs; and other risky behaviors). Such discussions may be difficult, particularly with adolescents who are not willing to answer honestly in front of parents or caregivers. In a study that compared the results of questionnaires on illicit substance use completed confidentially by adolescent patients with the same questionnaire completed by parents, patient reported use of substances was much higher than parental reports [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Clinicians should be skeptical about preoperative questionnaires, especially those filled out in the presence of parents, by parents, or over the internet.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The prevalence of substance use in adolescents was reported in a long-term study of substance use and related behaviors in individuals in the United States from 1975 to 2018 [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In 2018, up to 27 percent of adolescents had used an illicit drug (most commonly marijuana) in the previous year. Annual use of illicit drugs other than marijuana (eg, cocaine, opioids, methamphetamine, inhalants, club drugs) was approximately 9 percent among adolescents and varied widely with the individual drug. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101699.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorder in adolescents: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cigarette smoking has been decreasing in adolescents, whereas the use of e-cigarettes (vaping) is increasing. In 2019, 12 percent of high schoolers reported use of a combustible tobacco product (eg, cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah) in the past 30 days [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]; approximately 20 percent of high school students reported current use of e-cigarettes in 2020 [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Epidemiology of smoking among adolescents and anesthetic implications are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14583.html" rel="external">"Prevention of smoking and vaping initiation in children and adolescents", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127216.html" rel="external">"Smoking or vaping: Perioperative management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Anesthetic implications of other types of substance use/misuse are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94581.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for adult trauma patients", section on 'Substance use disorder or acute intoxication'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) </strong>–<strong> </strong>ADHD is one of the most common disorders in childhood, and is associated with depression, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, and learning disabilities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/602.html" rel="external">"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Epidemiology and pathogenesis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While there is a very broad range of behaviors associated with ADHD, some of which can be challenging in the perioperative environment (eg, anger, opposition, and aggression), many adolescents with ADHD can also be cognitively adept, engaging, and funny. Nevertheless, patients with ADHD may have problems following and absorbing the anesthesia preoperative discussion and may exhibit perioperative maladaptive behaviors [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], which may require support and reassurance from parents or caregivers and also sedation in the preoperative care unit. In our experience, most adolescents with ADHD engage well with electronic devices and often a cellphone or tablet is all that is needed to accompany the patient to the operating room. Patients who are chronically treated with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12600" href="/d/drug information/12600.html" rel="external">methylphenidate</a> have been found via neuroimaging studies to have a significant increase of synaptic and extracellular dopamine [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], which may increase the anesthetic dose requirement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Depression </strong>–<strong> </strong>The lifetime prevalence of major depression in adolescents is as high as 11 percent, with a two to one ratio in females compared with males. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1224.html" rel="external">"Pediatric unipolar depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13315" href="/d/drug information/13315.html" rel="external">Fluoxetine</a>, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is commonly used to treat depression in adolescents. SSRIs generally do not require modification of the choice of drugs for anesthesia. However, fluoxetine and some other SSRIs are potent inhibitors of the cytochrome PY2D6 enzyme, which is required to convert <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="91299" href="/d/drug information/91299.html" rel="external">hydrocodone</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13178" href="/d/drug information/13178.html" rel="external">codeine</a>, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12892" href="/d/drug information/12892.html" rel="external">tramadol</a> into active forms. Thus, for patients who require opioids for postoperative analgesia, opioids that are not dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13298" href="/d/drug information/13298.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16024" href="/d/drug information/16024.html" rel="external">morphine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12666" href="/d/drug information/12666.html" rel="external">oxycodone</a>) should be used for effective analgesia (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14675.html" rel="external">"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects", section on 'Drug-drug interactions'</a>). Unless there is a clinical history of bleeding abnormality while taking SSRIs, we do not avoid coadministering nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13402" href="/d/drug information/13402.html" rel="external">ketorolac</a> to patients on SSRIs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients who take serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, the possible adverse end organ effects of chronically elevated catecholamines may include decreases in immune competence, splanchnic perfusion, gastrointestinal motility, and increased insulin resistance [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Evaluation should be determined by a suspicious history as well as physical findings.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2804960449"><span class="h2">Preoperative testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Similar to adults, preoperative testing for adolescents should be performed selectively, based on the patient's medical status, the planned procedure, and the likelihood that test results will help with risk assessment or change management. Apart from pregnancy testing, healthy adolescents do not usually require preoperative laboratory testing for routine procedures with minimal blood loss. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94539.html" rel="external">"Preoperative evaluation for anesthesia for noncardiac surgery", section on 'Selective testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4226696513"><span class="h2">Pregnancy testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most children’s hospitals (including the author’s institution) routinely perform preoperative pregnancy testing in postmenstrual females; reported rates of positive preoperative pregnancy tests are approximately 1 percent [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. At the author’s institution, the average number of HCG tests is 2800 per year, about 150 of which are serum tests due to an inability to void. As of 2022, there has been one false negative result in 25 years and less than five false positive results. There has not been a positive HCG result in over five years, which may be the result of declining risk in adolescent females.</p><p>The American Society of Anesthesiologists states that there is an ethical obligation to offer pregnancy testing, though such pregnancy testing can be refused [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Confidentiality and informed consent'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy in adolescents", section on 'Pretest counseling'</a>.)</p><p>Adults can be offered the choice of pregnancy testing [<a href="#rid19">19</a>] with the reassurance that, as yet, there is no evidence of teratogenicity with the administration of anesthetic medications. Adolescents cannot be counseled the same way. Sexually active adolescents may have difficulty recognizing or accepting the possibility of pregnancy and may be reluctant to discuss or disclose their sexual history, especially in the presence of parents or caregivers.

While nonanesthetized patients increase their minute ventilation to maintain normocarbia, we typically ventilate the anesthetized adolescent with an increase of 10 to 20 percent above middle-aged adult sex-matched patients. Thus, minute ventilation requirements are typically approximately 85 to 100 mL/kg/minute, compared with adult levels of about 70 mL/kg/minute [<a href="#rid26">26,27,30</a>]. Oxygen consumption is higher in males than females because of the influence of androgenic hormones throughout adolescence [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. Procedures utilizing insufflation of carbon dioxide such as laparoscopy or thoracoscopy will further increase the minute CO<sub>2</sub> burden and therefore the minute ventilation required for normocarbia.</p><p>The high lung compliance during adolescence affects the optimal mode of ventilation. Lung-protective strategies for mechanical ventilation (eg, tidal volume 6 mL/kg, low peak inspiratory pressures, use of positive end expiratory pressure [PEEP]) are often used for mechanical ventilation during anesthesia. In healthy anesthetized adolescents in the supine position, generating a tidal volume/compliance curve can facilitate setting the optimal tidal volume and best PEEP.

Routine use of ultrasound guidance for regional anesthesia allows safe performance of regional anesthesia techniques with the patient under general anesthesia, and the majority of our peripheral nerve blocks and some neuraxial blocks are performed this way.

This begins to change between five and eight years of age and by the time of adolescence, neuraxial blockade, unlike in younger children, will result in sympatholysis and decreases in blood pressure, similar to adults.

They are often suspicious of superficial answers about what to expect postoperatively, so a thorough discussion is warranted. Adolescents are often less concerned about intraoperative management, as they know that they will be asleep.</p><p>The degree of postoperative pain for a given procedure will be influenced by the patient’s prior experience with surgery, coping abilities, and anxiety regarding pain. For surgery amenable to regional anesthesia techniques, patients can be presented options. For example, patients may be asked whether they would accept having a numb body part as a result of regional anesthesia, with the benefit of remaining very alert and allowing eating, talking to friends, or gaming, versus an opioid based analgesic regimen with potentially less adequate pain control and some attendant sedation. Regional analgesia and associated sensory changes may be particularly problematic for late maturing adolescents with a fragile body image, and they may need to be reminded that their body part is numb because of the medication administered and that it will wear off (like at the dentist). They should understand these sensory effects as part of shared decision making regarding regional analgesia techniques.</p><p>The pharmacology of analgesic medications is similar in adolescents and adults, but the level of emotional development and maturity of the adolescent are critical factors in successful pain management. Even mature adolescents may regress due to perioperative dependence on family members, caregivers, or nursing staff, and may need help with self-care and pain management.

(See <a class="local">'Negative pressure pulmonary edema'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Regional anesthesia </strong>–<strong> </strong>For adolescents who resist awake placement of regional blocks, peripheral nerve blocks or neuraxial anesthesia procedures can be safely performed with the patient anesthetized, similar to small children. Expectations regarding numb body parts during and after surgery should be explained to the patient. (See <a class="local">'Regional anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Unlike small children (&lt;5 to 8 years of age), adolescents are at risk for hypotension with neuraxial block. Fluid boluses and/or vasopressors may be necessary to prevent hypotension.</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Malina RM, Katzmarzyk PT.
