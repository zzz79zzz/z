         Nontraumatic chest pain is a common symptom in children and adolescents and is a frequent complaint in patients seeking primary, emergency, or subspecialty care [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. Although the etiology is benign in most cases, this symptom may lead to school absences, restriction of activities and causes considerable anxiety in patients and their families or caregivers. A thorough history and physical examination usually can determine the cause and identify patients who require acute intervention and those who can be managed with reassurance and continued follow-up. Laboratory testing is necessary only in a small number of patients [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In the absence of associated symptoms of illness, positive findings on physical examination related to the cardiac or respiratory systems, or symptoms during exertion, a serious organic cause is unlikely.
        </p>

         This topic will discuss the approach to nontraumatic chest pain in children and adolescents. The causes of nontraumatic chest pain in children and adolescents, pediatric thoracic trauma, and the emergent evaluation of respiratory distress in children and adolescents, with or without chest pain, is discussed separately:

         <strong>
          Temporal elements
         </strong>
         – The duration and time course of the onset of chest pain may be a useful distinguishing feature. Chronic pain is unlikely to have a serious underlying cause and often is musculoskeletal, psychogenic, or idiopathic.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Acute pain is more likely to be caused by a medical condition. As examples, pain caused by pulmonary conditions (eg, asthma or pneumothorax) or vascular events (eg, aortic dissection or acute pulmonary embolism) typically has an abrupt onset. However, ischemic myocardial pain, which is unusual in children and is described in greater detail above, may have a gradual onset with increasing intensity over time.

         <strong>
          Quality
         </strong>
         – A description of the quality of the pain may be helpful. The pain associated with costochondritis typically is described as midsternal in location and sharp in quality with minimal radiation. It occurs mainly at rest and lasts for seconds to a few minutes. The pain may increase in intensity with deep inspiration because of stretching of the costochondral junctions or muscle fibers.

         </a>

          Location

         – Pain that localizes to a small area on the chest more likely is of chest wall or pleural origin rather than visceral. Ischemic pain is a diffuse discomfort that may be difficult to localize.

As an example, the pain of myocardial ischemia may radiate to the neck, throat, lower jaw, teeth, upper extremity, or shoulder. Other unusual causes include acute cholecystitis, which can present with right shoulder pain (although concomitant right upper quadrant or epigastric pain is more typical), aortic dissection, which may be associated with chest pain that radiates between the scapulae, or pericarditis that can radiate to the left shoulder.

          Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)

         Significant LVOT obstruction results in a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur that begins slightly after S1 and is heard best at the apex and lower left sternal border. The murmur may radiate to the axilla and base but usually not into the neck. It increases with a Valsalva maneuver.

          Left ventricular outflow obstruction
         </strong>
         – Signs of left ventricular outflow obstruction include a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border and occasionally along the left sternal border. Coarctation of the aorta is associated with elevated blood pressure in the arms and a lower blood pressure in the legs, and frequently with a systolic murmur on the back between the scapulae. If the coarctation is long-standing (present for more than five to seven years), collateral vessels may form that connect the upper and lower portions of the aorta; these vessels create a continuous murmur over the lateral aspect of the ribs. (See

         <strong>
          Arrhythmia
         </strong>
         – An irregular heart rate associated with chest pain increases the likelihood of an underlying arrhythmia. Very rapid tachycardia for age (180 to 240 beats per minute in older children and adolescents) suggests supraventricular tachycardia, including Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Exposure to a variety of sympathomimetic agents, including cocaine, amphetamines, bath salts, and synthetic cannabinoids may cause sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety. (See

          Pericarditis
         </strong>
         – In patients with pericarditis, pain increases when manual pressure is applied to the sternal region. The pain typically improves with sitting up and leaning forward. Signs of pericarditis depend upon the size of the pericardial effusion. Patients with a small effusion typically have an audible pericardial friction rub, caused by rubbing together of the inflamed parietal and visceral pericardial surfaces. The rub often is continuous in systole and diastole. It is easier to hear with the diaphragm of the stethoscope when the patient is sitting and leaning forward.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         A rub will not be heard if the effusion is large because the two pericardial surfaces of the pericardium are not in contact with each other. A large effusion may result in cardiac tamponade, manifested by a narrow pulse pressure, elevated pulsus paradoxus (&gt;10 mmHg), elevated jugular venous pressure, distant heart sounds, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema.

         In patients with suspected pulmonary disorders, a chest radiograph may show infiltrates caused by pneumonia or areas of atelectasis and air trapping caused by aspiration of a foreign body. Hyperinflation typically is seen in patients with asthma. In addition, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pleural effusions can be detected.

          Cardiac troponin
         </strong>
         – Cardiac troponin testing may assist with diagnosis when myocardial infarction or ischemia is suspected. Troponin is a highly sensitive biomarker that aids in the detection of myocardial cell damage, which is often but not always, due to thrombotic obstruction of a coronary artery. Thus, while troponin may be useful to "rule out" a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, the clinician must recognize the limitations of using troponin to "rule in" MI in patients with low clinical likelihood of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) which includes most children and adolescents. While troponin is highly specific for myocardial injury, it is not specific for ACS as the cause. As a result, if troponin testing is applied indiscriminately in broad populations with a low pretest probability of thrombotic disease, the positive predictive value for ACS is greatly diminished. Causes of troponin elevations other than acute coronary syndrome are noted in the table  (

         ) and discussed in detail separately. In children, myocarditis is frequently the cause of an elevated troponin test. (See

         In most pediatric patients, nontraumatic chest pain is not life-threatening. Reassurance is an important component of initial management in these patients. Although the etiology usually is benign, this symptom causes considerable anxiety in patients and their families or caregivers because of the more serious implications of chest pain in adults. Cases with a psychiatric etiology typically need additional counseling and in selected patients, referral to a child psychiatrist.

         Other consultations or referrals may be appropriate depending upon the degree of illness and the specific diagnosis. As an example, children with moderate to severe gastrointestinal symptoms, especially those with dysphagia, weight loss, or hematemesis and children with persistent or recurrent pain with no apparent etiology, warrant referral to a gastroenterologist. Evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract may reveal esophagitis, gastritis, and/or motility disorders such as diffuse esophageal spasm or achalasia. These abnormalities may be detected in some children with significant chest pain but no gastrointestinal symptoms [

          Epidemiology

         – Chest pain is a common symptom in children and adolescents. Its underlying cause is typically benign in this patient population  (

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – A thorough history and physical examination usually can determine the cause and differentiate patients who require further diagnostic studies and acute intervention from those who can be managed with reassurance and continued follow-up. (See
         <a class="local">
          'History'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Most children with chest pain have no history suggestive of life-threatening conditions  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ) and either a normal physical examination or findings consistent with a musculoskeletal etiology. Further investigations are not needed in patients for whom a clear etiology, other than cardiac disease, can be established. Diagnostic studies (eg, ECG, chest radiograph, or echocardiogram) are warranted in patients with abnormal physical findings or with associated symptoms (eg, exertional syncope, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, or chest pain associated with exertion) that suggest underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease  (
