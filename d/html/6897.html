Patients typically present with severe eye pain and a foreign body sensation. Key aspects of clinical evaluation include exclusion of an open globe and hyphema, measurement of visual acuity, penlight and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">fluorescein</a> examination, and lid eversion to assess for a conjunctival foreign body. Treatment of small, uncomplicated corneal abrasions consists of topical antibiotic therapy and either topical or oral pain medication. Most abrasions heal fully within 24 hours.</p><p>This topic will review the etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of corneal abrasions. The management of corneal abrasions, the general approach to a patient with red eye, and the assessment and management of other ocular injuries are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6900.html" rel="external">"The red eye: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6513.html" rel="external">"Open globe injuries: Emergency evaluation and initial management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6570.html" rel="external">"Traumatic hyphema: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95661.html" rel="external">"Traumatic hyphema: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13904.html" rel="external">"Conjunctival injury"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/345.html" rel="external">"Topical chemical burns: Initial evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Corneal abrasion is often used to refer to any defect in the corneal surface epithelium (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90887" href="/d/graphic/90887.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). However, this is an inexact use of the term because it also implies etiology. Many corneal abnormalities are more appropriately called "corneal epithelial defects," while corneal abrasion more strictly refers to a defect in the epithelial surface of the cornea that is caused by mechanical trauma to the surface of the eye. Nevertheless, since "corneal epithelial defect" is not a term in general usage by patients and providers, we will use both terms interchangeably to refer to corneal epithelial defects of all etiologies.</p><p>Corneal abrasions can be classified as traumatic (including foreign body related or contact lens related) or spontaneous as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Traumatic </strong>– Traumatic corneal abrasions are often caused by fingernails, paws, pieces of paper or cardboard, make-up applicators, hand tools, branches, and leaves, or by a foreign body that has lodged under the lid.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Special types of traumatic abrasions include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Foreign body</strong> – Foreign body related abrasions are defects in the corneal epithelium that are left behind after the removal or spontaneous dislodging of a corneal foreign body. Foreign body abrasions are typically caused by pieces of rust, wood, glass, plastic, fiberglass, or vegetable material that have become embedded in the cornea.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Contact lens</strong> – Contact lens related abrasions are defects in the corneal epithelium that are left behind after the removal of an over-worn, improperly fitting, or improperly cleaned contact lens. These eyes have suffered a mechanical insult that is not from external trauma, but rather from a foreign body (contact lens) that is associated with specific pathogens.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spontaneous</strong> – Spontaneous defects in the corneal epithelium may occur with no immediate antecedent injury or foreign body. Eyes that have suffered a previous traumatic abrasion or eyes that have an underlying defect in the corneal epithelium (eg, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy [map-dot-fingerprint dystrophy], Thiel-Behnke dystrophy, or lattice dystrophy) are prone to this problem. Spontaneous corneal abrasions are also known as recurrent erosions.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Corneal abrasions are common, accounting for 8 to 13 percent of eye presentations, depending upon the setting (eg, primary care offices, emergency departments, or dedicated eye emergency departments) [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>].</p><p>Corneal abrasions cause significant morbidity and lost productivity. As an example, a study of eye injuries in a major United States automotive corporation found an annual incidence of 15 eye injuries per 1000 employees [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The eye injuries comprised 6 percent of total injuries, and corneal foreign bodies and abrasions were 87 percent of the eye injuries. One-third of eye injuries resulted in the inability of workers to resume normal duties for at least one day. In another report, most patients with corneal foreign bodies did not take more than one day off work, and up to 30 percent sought treatment outside of working hours to avoid lost time from work [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Almost all of these injuries could have been avoided with the use of safety glasses.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The corneal epithelium is richly innervated with sensory pain fibers from the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V). Thus, patients with corneal abrasions of all types have the same clinical presentation; severe eye pain and reluctance to open the eye due to photophobia and/or foreign body sensation. Often patients are too uncomfortable to work, drive, or read, and the pain frequently precludes sleep. Multiple attempts by the patient to "wash out" the eye can further disrupt the epithelial surface.</p><p>A complaint of eye pain and objective evidence of photophobia and/or foreign body sensation (eg, observation that the patient is keeping the affected eye shut) together are highly suggestive of a pathologic process of the cornea, although no formal studies of the sensitivity and specificity of these findings have been performed. The exception is patients with dysfunction of cranial nerve V due to trauma, tumor, or prior infection with Herpes Simplex or Varicella Zoster (shingles); these individuals may have corneal defects with no pain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The history typically identifies the etiology of the abrasion. (See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with traumatic abrasion have a history of direct trauma to the globe followed almost immediately by severe pain, photophobia, and foreign body sensation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with a foreign body may or may not recall an episode with material falling or flying into the eye, depending upon the type and size of the foreign body. Symptoms of pain and foreign body sensation may not be immediate. Alternatively, the sensation may be immediate, then abate for a while, then recur. If the foreign body entered the eye at high velocity, as may be the case when using a grinding machine or from metal striking metal, the examiner must consider the possibility of a penetrating eye injury and modify the subsequent examination as clinical findings require. (See <a class="local">'Excluding penetrating trauma'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other relevant points of history include whether the episode is associated with contact lens wear or, in the case of apparently spontaneous abrasions, whether there is history of prior traumatic abrasion. Specific historical features include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with contact lens related abrasions frequently report sleeping in their contacts and awakening with eye pain and photophobia. Patients may also report poor hygiene practices (eg, use of improper wetting solutions, improper maintenance of contact lens cases, difficulty with contact lens fit, or exceeding recommended wear time). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6913.html" rel="external">"Complications of contact lenses", section on 'Incidence and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with recurrent erosion syndrome tend to awaken in the middle of the night with searing eye pain, or they develop the pain upon first awakening in the morning with attempt to open the eyes. This description is diagnostic of recurrent erosion syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Eye examination</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14488397"><span class="h3">Preparation and analgesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients may have had severe pain for several hours by the time they seek care. They are visibly uncomfortable, pacing or rocking or rubbing the eye, and they can be disruptive to a waiting room. During the initial triage period, they should be offered a darkened room in which to wait, asked to wait quietly with the eyes closed, and encouraged not to rub the eye.</p><p>Based upon studies in animals, topical anesthetics can be toxic to the epithelium and retard healing which may increase the risk of corneal infection and scarring [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Thus, the eye examination is best performed without topical anesthesia, when the patient can tolerate it. However, in children, topical anesthesia is frequently needed for cooperation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Treatments to avoid'</a> and <a class="local">'Pediatric considerations'</a> below.)</p><p>For the patient who is too uncomfortable to cooperate with examination, a penlight examination to confirm that there is no evidence of penetrating trauma should be performed, and then one drop of topical anesthetic (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9824" href="/d/drug information/9824.html" rel="external">proparacaine</a> 0.5 percent solution) may be instilled to facilitate the measurement of visual acuity and the subsequent examination. The patient will obtain drastic relief within 10 seconds of the instillation and will likely ask for additional doses after the drop wears off in 10 to 20 minutes. In this situation, the clinician should explain the negative effects of repeated administration of topical anesthesia and provide alternative forms of analgesia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Pain control'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Treatments to avoid'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Excluding penetrating trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In adults in whom the history raises the possibility of penetrating trauma, and in children in whom the history may be unreliable, the initial examination must exclude penetrating trauma.</p><p>If the patient is unable to voluntarily open the eye, the lids are gently pulled apart or the upper lid lifted, avoiding pressure on the globe. The pupil should be confirmed to be round and central. On direct inspection with a penlight, the anterior chamber should appear grossly clear, deep, and of normal contour. In corneal abrasion, the pupil is typically small (reactive miosis). Pupillary constriction in response to light may be difficult to detect in the presence of reactive miosis.</p><p>A large nonreactive pupil or an irregular pupil suggests injury to the pupillary sphincter from penetrating trauma with an open globe (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67579" href="/d/graphic/67579.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59152" href="/d/graphic/59152.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) or significant blunt trauma with an associated hyphema (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78964" href="/d/graphic/78964.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). These findings warrant further evaluation and prompt ophthalmologic consultation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral'</a>.)</p><p>The rapid overviews provide key diagnostic findings and initial management for patients with open globes and traumatic hyphemas (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50022" href="/d/graphic/50022.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74146" href="/d/graphic/74146.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6513.html" rel="external">"Open globe injuries: Emergency evaluation and initial management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6570.html" rel="external">"Traumatic hyphema: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95661.html" rel="external">"Traumatic hyphema: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Visual acuity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abrasions within the visual axis and other serious injuries associated with corneal abrasions may significantly impair visual acuity. Acuity should be measured before instillation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">fluorescein</a> drops and <strong>without</strong> the aid of a topical anesthetic, whenever possible, to assess for profound vision loss caused by penetrating trauma. Otherwise, administration of anesthetic drops or fluorescein dye risks further disruption of ocular structures if an open globe is present. On the other hand, a child with an abrasion may not be able to cooperate for measurement of visual acuity without instillation of topical anesthetic; anesthetic drops may be appropriate in this situation if the suspicion for penetrating trauma is low. Patients with impaired visual acuity warrant prompt consultation with an ophthalmologist. (See <a class="local">'Preparation and analgesia'</a> above and <a class="local">'Fluorescein examination'</a> below.)</p><p>Visual acuity may be normal (20/20 feet or 6/6 meters) if the abrasion is away from the visual axis. It might be slightly subnormal, in the 20/25 (6/7) to 20/40 (6/12) range, if the abrasion is in the visual axis, or it might be substantially subnormal (as low as 20/400 [6/120]) if the abrasion is in the visual axis and there is corneal edema.</p><p>Corneal edema tends to develop in abrasions that have been present for more than 12 hours after the patient continually rubs or presses on the eye in response to pain. Corneal edema causes the cornea to have a hazy gray appearance rather than a distinct infiltrate.</p><p>Referral to an ophthalmologist is warranted if the primary care provider is not certain that he or she can distinguish corneal haze from an infiltrate in the patient with an "abrasion" who has substantially reduced acuity; an infectious infiltrate can have sight-threatening consequences if not diagnosed, treated, and monitored properly. A corneal infiltrate may not affect acuity if it is out of the visual axis; thus, acuity alone is not sufficient to distinguish infiltrate from haze. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Penlight examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pupils can be assessed with the penlight examination. However, the pupil is sometimes quite small in a patient with an abrasion, making it difficult to detect a light response. The penlight examination should be completed before instillation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">fluorescein</a> dye. (See <a class="local">'Fluorescein examination'</a> below.)</p><p>The chamber should have a normal contour and the pupil should be round. The penlight examination will reveal mild conjunctival injection if the abrasion is more than an hour or two old; there may be ciliary flush if it is more than several hours old. With ciliary flush, injection is most marked at the limbus (where the cornea undergoes transition to the sclera) and then diminishes toward the equator. There should also be no discharge other than tears, and no infiltrate, corneal opacity (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75303" href="/d/graphic/75303.html" rel="external">picture 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55332" href="/d/graphic/55332.html" rel="external">picture 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53237" href="/d/graphic/53237.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>), or hypopyon (pus in the anterior chamber (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59911" href="/d/graphic/59911.html" rel="external">picture 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62192" href="/d/graphic/62192.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>)). The edges of the abrasion can usually be detected by the disruption that it causes to the corneal light reflex. A foreign body also often can be detected at this time by direct visualization with the penlight. Any patient with a suspected corneal infiltrate, opacity, or pus (hypopyon) in the anterior chamber should also be examined that day by an ophthalmologist. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral'</a>.)</p><p>A flat chamber, a chamber full of blood (hyphema), or an irregular pupil increases suspicion of a penetrating eye injury and warrants prompt ophthalmologic consultation.

Alternatively, the strip is gently swiped against the bulbar or tarsal conjunctiva below the cornea and the patient is allowed to blink to distribute the fluorescein.</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">Fluorescein</a> stains basement membrane, which is exposed in the area of the epithelial defect (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90887" href="/d/graphic/90887.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The affinity is quite high, so very little fluorescein is necessary. The stained abrasion appears yellow with the naked eye. Visualization is enhanced by the use of a cobalt blue filter (available on any ophthalmoscope or slit lamp) or a Wood's lamp. Foreign bodies may not stain, although the exposed edge of epithelium at the edge of the foreign body typically does. Clinicians who are examining with a slit lamp can look for a Seidel sign (streaming of fluorescein caused by leaking aqueous humor), which, if present, indicates penetrating trauma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/259.html" rel="external">"Slit lamp examination", section on 'Fluorescein examination for corneal abrasion'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/259.html" rel="external">"Slit lamp examination", section on 'Seidel's test'</a>.)</p><p>The staining defect can appear linear or geographic depending upon the epithelial defect (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77817" href="/d/graphic/77817.html" rel="external">picture 9</a>). Defects from recurrent erosions have no specific diagnostic appearance. Sometimes a mobile flap of epithelium can be visualized.</p><p>Other causes of corneal epithelial defects may have specific staining patterns as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Retained conjunctival foreign body</strong> – Corneal epithelial defects caused by a retained conjunctival foreign body under the lid may have a characteristic appearance of multiple, parallel vertical lines at the upper edge of the cornea. (See <a class="local">'Eyelid eversion'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Herpes simplex virus infection</strong> – A branching pattern suggests herpes simplex virus infection (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86913" href="/d/graphic/86913.html" rel="external">picture 10</a>). A nearly healed abrasion may have a branching appearance as the defect closes in, but this patient will have resolution of symptoms in 24 hours while the patient with a herpes dendrite will not. A further distinction is that the patient with a herpes dendrite can report no specific antecedent injury, and there may be a history of prior episodes of herpes keratitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6896.html" rel="external">"Herpes simplex keratitis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Skilled ophthalmologists sometimes have difficulty distinguishing a herpes dendrite from a healing abrasion (pseudo-dendrite) and will occasionally monitor for 24 to 48 hours to distinguish the two. An “abrasion” with branching pattern, particularly one that is failing to improve over 24 to 48 hours, warrants prompt ophthalmic evaluation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contact lens abrasions</strong> – Contact lens associated staining defects tend to be round and central, sometimes encompassing the entire cornea. Typically, there is punctate breakdown that has become contiguous. The punctate pattern may be apparent immediately upon instillation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">fluorescein</a>, but will be more difficult to discern as the fluorescein diffuses through the cornea.

Retained foreign bodies typically lodge in the pretarsal sulcus of the upper lid (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90486" href="/d/graphic/90486.html" rel="external">picture 11</a>) and can cause an abrasion with a characteristic appearance of multiple parallel vertical lines at the upper edge of the cornea. However, the inexperienced observer may not be able to distinguish this pattern from that of any other abrasion. If the lid foreign body has been present for several hours or if time has elapsed since the instillation of fluorescein, the parallel lines may become contiguous, confounding even the experienced observer.

However, the history is typically less specific. As an example, an infant who suddenly becomes irritable with symptoms in one eye may have scratched the cornea with a fingernail. Any time a child cannot or will not open an eye, penetrating trauma must be ruled out; a negative history from the child or a caretaker should <strong>not</strong> be relied upon in this situation. However, most cases of penetrating trauma will involve circumstances that suggest the possibility of such an injury (eg, injury involving a projectile, broken glass, etc). (See <a class="local">'Excluding penetrating trauma'</a> above.)</p><p>If there is no evidence of penetrating trauma, an attempt can be made at measuring visual acuity with a technique appropriate to the age of the child. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6261.html" rel="external">"Vision screening and assessment in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p>If the exam is difficult, a single drop of topical ophthalmic anesthetic may be instilled to facilitate the remainder of the exam. The child and the caregivers should be warned that the drops will sting. (See <a class="local">'Visual acuity'</a> above.)</p><p>In children, given that the history is unreliable, it is always important to inspect the lower cul-de-sac and to then flip the upper lid for direct visualization of the mucosal surface. A foreign body can be swept away with a cotton swab. Since a foreign body may be very small or light in color, it may be helpful to wipe the inner surface of the lid with a moistened swab even if no foreign body is visualized. (See <a class="local">'Eyelid eversion'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Foreign body removal'</a>.)</p><p>The remainder of the examination is performed as in an adult, including lid eversion and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">fluorescein</a> staining (see <a class="local">'Eye examination'</a> above).
