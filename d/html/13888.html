Based upon reports from specialty clinics, benign paroxysmal vertigo, vestibular migraine, and head trauma comprise the final diagnosis in about 50 percent of patients [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Middle ear disease (effusion or infection) and motion sickness are other common etiologies. Life-threatening etiologies, such as a brain tumor, stroke, or meningitis, are rare causes of vertigo in children and adolescents [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Dizziness without vertigo is a vague symptom that can be caused by many conditions. It may occur in patients with faintness, lightheadedness, or unsteadiness caused by hypoglycemia, presyncope (orthostatic hypotension), anemia, heat illness, anxiety with hyperventilation, intoxication, pregnancy, and, rarely, ataxia or visual disturbance from central nervous system abnormalities.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3781563"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dizziness describes a disturbed sense of relationship to space [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].

Vertigo (dizziness with an illusion of movement or "spinning" by the patient in the room or the room about the patient) is generally separated from other causes of dizziness and imbalance [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vertigo results from dysfunction somewhere in the vestibular system, which has both peripheral (vestibule and semicircular canals) and central nervous system (brainstem, cerebellum, and vestibulospinal tract) components. Common causes include migraine syndromes, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, head trauma, motion sickness, and middle ear disease (effusion or infection). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126598.html" rel="external">"Causes of dizziness and vertigo in children and adolescents", section on 'Dizziness with vertigo'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Many conditions can cause dizziness without vestibular dysfunction (pseudovertigo). Common causes include anemia, orthostatic hypotension, presyncope, pregnancy, hyperventilation, anxiety, and depression.

These organs send impulses to the central components of the vestibular system, located in the brainstem, cerebellum, and cortex, via the eighth cranial nerve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55465" href="/z/d/graphic/55465.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Efferent impulses travel through the vestibulospinal tract to the peripheral muscles and also within the medial longitudinal fasciculus to cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. Cranial nerve VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve) is responsible for both hearing and vestibular function. A disturbance anywhere in the vestibular system may cause patients to have vertigo and associated signs and symptoms such as hearing loss, perceptual changes in vision (eg, blurry vision), and nystagmus.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2782830464"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of a complaint of vertigo or dizziness depends on whether the patient has dizziness with vertigo or dizziness without vertigo (pseudovertigo)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51313" href="/z/d/graphic/51313.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). For children with vertigo, this differentiation requires the performance of a careful physical examination, including various maneuvers to elicit nystagmus. For immediate consideration, life-threatening causes of dizziness with vertigo include central nervous system infection, head trauma, poisoning or adverse medication effect, stroke, and brain tumor. For dizziness without vertigo, life-threatening considerations include arrhythmia, heat illness, hypoglycemia, and poisoning or adverse medication effect. The causes of dizziness and vertigo in children is discussed in greater detail separately.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6010.html" rel="external">"Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Treatment and prognosis", section on 'Empiric therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5977.html" rel="external">"Acute viral encephalitis in children: Treatment and prevention", section on 'Empiric antimicrobial therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3019030209"><span class="h2">Vertigo versus other dizziness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When evaluating children with dizziness, the clinician must first distinguish vertigo from other forms of dizziness. However, this task can be difficult. Patient description, augmented by caregiver history, is essential to correct categorization. Classically, vertigo has been differentiated from other causes of dizziness (eg, presyncope, nonspecific dizziness, or disequilibrium) by the presence of a "spinning" sensation; patients may also use terms such as "whirling," "tilting," or "moving." However, younger children often cannot accurately describe what they are experiencing, and older children may not describe their vertigo in such vivid terms. In addition, vague dizziness, imbalance, or disorientation can be caused by vestibular pathology. Furthermore, some patients without vertigo may describe a spinning sensation during episodes of presyncope or nonspecific dizziness.</p><p>In individuals with a history that suggests vertigo, physical examination should focus on oculomotor signs (especially the presence of nystagmus), hearing, balance, gait, and the presence of focal neurologic findings to determine whether vestibular dysfunction is present and, if so, to localize the etiology to a peripheral or central vestibular abnormality  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76359" href="/z/d/graphic/76359.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (see <a class="local">'Vertigo'</a> below). Specialty consultation and provocative vestibular testing is indicated when the presence of vertigo is suspected but can't be established by history and physical examination or when there is clinical suspicion for central vertigo.</p><p>Dizziness without vertigo is a frequent complaint in children and adolescents and can be due to a variety of etiologies. In many patients, a careful history and physical examination with selected ancillary studies can identify the underlying cause. (See <a class="local">'Dizziness without vertigo (pseudovertigo)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26102539"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>History is often the essential part of the evaluation that identifies the presence of vertigo and distinguishes it from other forms of dizziness. In young children who cannot describe what they are experiencing, vomiting, irritability, desire to lay still, a history of gait disturbance with falling, or eye twitching (nystagmus) may be findings of vertigo. In older patients, the symptom of "spinning" should be evaluated in the context of all other clinical features to correctly identify the presence of vertigo versus other types of dizziness.</p><p>Characteristic findings of vertigo in children include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute and episodic rather than continuous symptoms</strong> – Vertigo tends to have an acute onset with a self-limited episode of a few days. It is unusual for it to be continuous for more than a few weeks. Even when the vestibular lesion is permanent, the central nervous system adapts to the defect so that vertigo typically subsides over several weeks. A history of recurrent episodes of vertigo suggests migraine headache or any of its variants (eg, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, motion sickness, or paroxysmal torticollis of infancy). Less common causes of episodic vertigo include seizures, perilymphatic fistula, Meniere disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126598.html" rel="external">"Causes of dizziness and vertigo in children and adolescents", section on 'Dizziness with vertigo'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nausea and vomiting</strong> – Nausea and vomiting are typical features of acute vertigo, unless it is mild or very brief (as with BPPV). In addition to headache and aura, vomiting may also be a prominent feature of a vestibular migraine. Vomiting can be severe, causing dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Emesis commonly accompanies vertigo from peripheral causes. However, vomiting associated with meningismus, ataxia, or other cranial nerve abnormalities (eg, facial weakness, visual disturbance) suggests increased intracranial pressure associated with a central nervous system tumor, abscess, or infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Precipitating factors</strong> – Important aggravating or provoking factors suggestive of vertigo or types of vertigo include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Head motion and position</strong> – Most vertigo is made worse by moving the head. This is a useful feature for distinguishing vertigo from other forms of dizziness. Many children in the midst of a vertiginous attack are greatly distressed by head motion and lie very still. If head motion does not worsen the symptom, it is probably another type of dizziness rather than vertigo.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Dizziness with standing or arising from sleep may be caused by positional vertigo or postural presyncope. Positional vertigo is also provoked when rolling over in bed or lying down, which helps to differentiate it from postural presyncope. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126598.html" rel="external">"Causes of dizziness and vertigo in children and adolescents", section on 'Other conditions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Preceding head or middle ear trauma</strong> – Head or middle ear trauma may result in injury to peripheral or central components of the vestibular system. However, dizziness without vestibular injury is also a common component of concussion in children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126598.html" rel="external">"Causes of dizziness and vertigo in children and adolescents", section on 'Other conditions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Change in middle ear pressure</strong> – Coughing, sneezing, or Valsalva maneuvers can provoke vertigo in patients with a perilymphatic fistula. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126598.html" rel="external">"Causes of dizziness and vertigo in children and adolescents", section on 'Other conditions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Occurring during or soon after car, boat, or airplane travel</strong> – Dizziness accompanied by pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, and/or vomiting after travel points to motion sickness or, specifically with airplane travel, to perilymphatic fistula. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126598.html" rel="external">"Causes of dizziness and vertigo in children and adolescents", section on 'Motion sickness'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126598.html" rel="external">"Causes of dizziness and vertigo in children and adolescents", section on 'Other conditions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Other historical findings that help identify the underlying cause of vertigo include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – A history of fever points toward infection of the ear or central nervous system.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Altered mental status</strong> – Mental status changes may occur with meningitis, encephalitis, intracranial abscess, seizures (postictal state), stroke, tumor, or ingestion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6225.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of stupor and coma in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Possible poisoning (young child) or use of recreational drugs (older child or adolescent)</strong> – Any medications in the household should be noted as they could be possible ingestants. Older children and adolescents should be privately questioned about recreational substance use, especially ethanol, barbiturates, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13398" href="/z/d/drug information/13398.html" rel="external">ketamine</a>, and phencyclidine, which can cause nystagmus and vertigo. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126598.html" rel="external">"Causes of dizziness and vertigo in children and adolescents", section on 'Drug overdose and other poisons'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms of brainstem pathology</strong> – Symptoms such as staggering or ataxic gait, vomiting, headache, double vision, visual loss, slurred speech, numbness of the face or body, weakness, clumsiness, or incoordination suggest a posterior fossa process, such as a central nervous system tumor, infection, or inflammation; or a vertebral dissection causing a posterior stroke. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6250.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6214.html" rel="external">"Ischemic stroke in children: Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hearing loss</strong> – Decreased hearing may occur with temporal bone fracture, otitis media, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, perilymphatic fistula, processes that may impinge on cranial nerve VIII, and some medications (eg, aminoglycosides. <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13329" href="/z/d/drug information/13329.html" rel="external">furosemide</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12915" href="/z/d/drug information/12915.html" rel="external">minocycline</a>, and salicylates).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recent upper respiratory tract infection</strong> – Viral infection may precede vestibular neuritis or otitis media.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recurrent episodes of otitis media</strong> – Recurrent otitis media may be associated with mastoiditis or suppurative labyrinthitis and vertigo.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Current medications</strong> – Many medications list dizziness as a possible side effect. Several affect the labyrinth and may cause dizziness with vertigo, including aminoglycosides, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13329" href="/z/d/drug information/13329.html" rel="external">furosemide</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12915" href="/z/d/drug information/12915.html" rel="external">minocycline</a>, and salicylates.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A past medical history of recurrent headaches in the patient or family members</strong> – In children with vertiginous migraines, vertigo may be the sole finding and headache may not be present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3352.html" rel="external">"Migraine with brainstem aura"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Other symptoms that patients may identify as dizziness include presyncopal faintness, disequilibrium, and nonspecific or ill-defined lightheadedness:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presyncope</strong> – Presyncope is the prodromal symptom of fainting or a near faint. Presyncope occurs more commonly than syncope. It usually lasts for seconds to minutes and is often recognized by the patient as "nearly blacking out" or "nearly fainting." When the symptoms are less intense, their description may be less clear. Patients may also report lightheadedness, a feeling of warmth, diaphoresis, nausea, and visual blurring occasionally proceeding to blindness. An observation of pallor and decreased responsiveness by onlookers also supports presyncope. Presyncope usually occurs when the patient is standing or seated upright and not when supine (if the latter, one should suspect a cardiac arrhythmia rather than hypotension). Evaluation of presyncope is the same as for syncope and is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6464.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of syncope in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Disequilibrium</strong> – Disequilibrium refers to unsteadiness with walking. Disequilibrium may occur in children with concussion, peripheral neuropathy (eg, Guillain-Barré), or acute cerebellar ataxia; or after recreational use of substances such as ethanol and benzodiazepines. Patients with dizziness from acute disequilibrium rather than vertigo warrant careful evaluation for serious causes of ataxia, which vary by age, and often warrant additional testing and consultation with a pediatric neurologist  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79383" href="/z/d/graphic/79383.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).

They may simply insist, "I am dizzy." Patients may choose from suggested descriptions to say they are "giddy" or "lightheaded"; however, they may also endorse a fainting or spinning sensation. Nonspecific dizziness may accompany mild presyncope or vertigo, mild head trauma (concussion) or whiplash injuries, hypoglycemia, and exposure to anticholinergic agents (eg, antihistamines, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12875" href="/z/d/drug information/12875.html" rel="external">atropine</a>, or cyclic antidepressants), carbon monoxide, and benzodiazepines.</p><p></p><p>Hyperventilation, depression, or anxiety are important causes of or contributing factors for dizziness.

A careful neurologic examination should be performed because the presence of additional neurologic abnormalities also strongly suggests the presence of a central lesion. A search should be made for cranial nerve abnormalities, motor or sensory changes, dysmetria, or abnormal reflexes.</p><p>Unilateral peripheral vestibular disorders (eg, benign paroxysmal vertigo, otitis media with labyrinthitis, middle ear trauma, cholesteatoma, or vestibular neuritis) generally cause patients to lean or fall toward the side of the lesion. Children may be uncomfortable and reluctant to move because of their vertigo, but they are still able to walk. Romberg testing will demonstrate falling or tilting to one side.</p><p>Patients with an acute cerebellar lesion (eg, posterior fossa tumor) are often unable to walk without falling.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6465.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with acute ataxia"</a>.)</p><p>While the ability to walk and the direction of falling may provide useful clues to the origin of vertigo, in practice, it may be difficult to persuade a patient with severe vertigo to attempt to walk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2113781288"><span class="h3">Tests of vestibular function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients in whom vertigo is suspected based upon routine physical examination warrant further evaluation of vestibular function. When physical examination testing is equivocal, consultation with a pediatric neurologist or otolaryngologist is warranted. If there is high suspicion for cerebellar dysfunction, then neuroimaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), should be performed.</p><p>The head impulse test (or head thrust test) may be helpful for distinguishing vestibular dysfunction from nonvestibular dizziness. The test is performed by instructing the patient to keep his or her eyes on a distant target. If needed, the patient should wear his or her usual prescription eyeglasses. The head is then turned approximately 15° quickly and unpredictably by the examiner. The normal response is that the eyes remain on the target. The abnormal response is that the eyes are dragged off of the target by the head turn (in one direction), followed by a saccade back to the target after the head turn  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52022" href="/z/d/graphic/52022.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>); this response indicates a deficient vestibuloocular reflex on the side of the head turn, implying a peripheral vestibular lesion (inner ear or vestibular nerve) on that side.
