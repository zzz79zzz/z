Specific polyneuropathies are discussed in greater detail in individual topics.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1056516454"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The terms "polyneuropathy," "peripheral neuropathy," and "neuropathy" are frequently used interchangeably but are distinct.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Polyneuropathy is a specific term that refers to a generalized, relatively homogeneous process affecting many peripheral nerves, with the distal nerves usually affected most prominently.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Peripheral neuropathy is a less precise term that is frequently used synonymously with polyneuropathy, but can also refer to any disorder of the peripheral nervous system including radiculopathies and mononeuropathies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neuropathy, which again is frequently used synonymously with peripheral neuropathy and/or polyneuropathy, can refer even more generally to disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system.</p><p></p><p>The polyneuropathies must be distinguished from other diseases of the peripheral nervous system, including the mononeuropathies and mononeuropathy multiplex (multifocal neuropathy), and from some disorders of the central nervous system.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mononeuropathy refers to focal involvement of a single nerve, usually due to a local cause such as trauma, compression, or entrapment. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common example of a mononeuropathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mononeuropathy multiplex refers to simultaneous or sequential involvement of noncontiguous nerve trunks. Used loosely, this term can refer to multiple compressive mononeuropathies. However, in its more specific meaning, it identifies multiple nerve infarcts due to a systemic vasculitic process that affects the vasa nervorum. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8236.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vasculitic neuropathies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diseases of the central nervous system such as a brain tumor, stroke, or spinal cord lesion occasionally present with symptoms that are difficult to distinguish from polyneuropathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5277.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of peripheral nerve and muscle disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Polyneuropathy has a wide variety of causes, ranging from the common, such as diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and HIV infection [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], to the rare, such as some unusual forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. It often occurs as a side effect of medication or as a manifestation of systemic disease. The rate of progression of the polyneuropathy in conjunction with its character (axonal or demyelinating) can help identify its etiology  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54853 graphicRef69751 graphicRef58391" href="/z/d/graphic/54853.html" rel="external">table 1A-C</a>).</p><p>The peripheral nerves are susceptible to a variety of toxic, inflammatory, hereditary, infectious, and parainfectious factors that can impair their health and function, leading to the clinical disorder of polyneuropathy. Unfortunately, there are no simple rules to apply that can reliably distinguish the type of polyneuropathy (eg, demyelinating versus axonal, chronic versus acute, sensory versus motor) produced by these disease categories.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6425345"><span class="h2">Diabetic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diabetic polyneuropathy is generally considered predominantly axonal; however, variable degrees of demyelination are often present, at least electrophysiologically. The mechanism underlying the development of diabetic neuropathy is extremely complex and likely relates to inflammatory, metabolic, and ischemic effects. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5279.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of diabetic polyneuropathy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93179184"><span class="h2">Other systemic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other systemic diseases generally cause predominantly axonal polyneuropathies. Examples of these include the polyneuropathies associated with the following conditions:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Longstanding HIV infection (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3711.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of HIV-associated distal symmetric polyneuropathy (HIV-DSPN)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Critical illness (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5144.html" rel="external">"Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness", section on 'Critical illness polyneuropathy'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>End-stage kidney disease (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1837.html" rel="external">"Uremic polyneuropathy"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Amyloidosis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5589.html" rel="external">"Overview of amyloidosis", section on 'Neurologic abnormalities'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypothyroidism (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7846.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism", section on 'Neurologic dysfunction'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vitamin deficiencies (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5367.html" rel="external">"Overview of water-soluble vitamins"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7155.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency", section on 'Neuropsychiatric changes'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lyme disease (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15247.html" rel="external">"Nervous system Lyme disease", section on 'Peripheral neuropathy'</a>)</p><p></p><p>However, some important exceptions exist. As an example, polyneuropathy associated with monoclonal gammopathies can sometimes be demyelinating. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14174.html" rel="external">"Immune-mediated neuropathies", section on 'Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93179304"><span class="h2">Autoimmune</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most acute autoimmune neuropathies, namely Guillain-Barré syndrome, are predominantly demyelinating, and a variety of clinical and experimental data have implicated both humoral factors and cell-mediated immune phenomena, which damage myelin and/or the myelin-producing Schwann cells. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5137.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>However, axonal forms of this disease also exist. For example, one unusual but well-described variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome is that of acute motor axonal polyneuropathy (AMAN). In this disorder, primary invasion of axons by inflammatory cells has been described [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5137.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6235.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6425488"><span class="h2">Toxic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many toxic neuropathies, such as those due to alcohol, chemotherapy exposure, and most heavy metals, produce a predominantly axonal disorder that can be acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on the level and severity of the exposure. Nonetheless, it is incorrect to simply classify all toxic neuropathies as axonal, since many exceptions exist [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. As an example, n-hexane exposure leads to neuropathy that has a substantial demyelinating component [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Aside from chemotherapeutic drugs, a variety of commonly used medications have been implicated in toxic neuropathies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69751" href="/z/d/graphic/69751.html" rel="external">table 1B</a>). Examples include antimicrobials (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9324" href="/z/d/drug information/9324.html" rel="external">dapsone</a>, fluoroquinolones, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8577" href="/z/d/drug information/8577.html" rel="external">isoniazid</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9646" href="/z/d/drug information/9646.html" rel="external">metronidazole</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9704" href="/z/d/drug information/9704.html" rel="external">nitrofurantoin</a>), antiretrovirals (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9946" href="/z/d/drug information/9946.html" rel="external">stavudine</a>), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/z/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/z/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a>, disulfiram, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9769" href="/z/d/drug information/9769.html" rel="external">phenytoin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9839" href="/z/d/drug information/9839.html" rel="external">pyridoxine</a>, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8984" href="/z/d/drug information/8984.html" rel="external">infliximab</a>), and immune checkpoint inhibitors (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16084" href="/z/d/drug information/16084.html" rel="external">ipilimumab</a>). In many cases, the magnitude of risk is relatively low, and recognition of the adverse effect may require a high index of suspicion, especially for commonly used drugs such as fluoroquinolones. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94976.html" rel="external">"Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy", section on 'Chronic neurotoxicity'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7970.html" rel="external">"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: An overview of adverse effects", section on 'Demyelinating disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/490.html" rel="external">"Fluoroquinolones", section on 'Neurologic'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96368.html" rel="external">"Toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors", section on 'Neurologic'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3711.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of HIV-associated distal symmetric polyneuropathy (HIV-DSPN)", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6425359"><span class="h2">Hereditary</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common forms of hereditary neuropathy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58391" href="/z/d/graphic/58391.html" rel="external">table 1C</a>), namely CMT types 1A, 1B, and X-linked, are all predominantly demyelinating in nature, although substantial coexistent axonal loss is usually also identified. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6220.html" rel="external">"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Other rare hereditary diseases that cause predominantly demyelinating polyneuropathies include those secondary to metabolic diseases of childhood, such as Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, and mitochondrial disorders.</p><p>Peripheral neuropathies associated with mitochondrial disorders most often exhibit an axonal pattern, as occurs with CMT type 2A and the syndrome of neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Other mitochondrial disorders are associated with a demyelinating neuropathy, as occurs with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE).</p><p>Porphyric neuropathy is primarily an axonal motor neuropathy that usually presents in the context of acute neurovisceral attacks, with variable manifestations of neuropathy, abdominal pain, confusion, and other neurologic and systemic symptoms. The acute hepatic porphyrias are inherited disorders caused by partial enzyme deficiencies affecting heme biosynthesis. Neurovisceral attacks are manifestations of four types of hepatic porphyria. The most common of these is acute intermittent porphyria; the others are hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7096.html" rel="external">"Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7100.html" rel="external">"Hereditary coproporphyria"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7126.html" rel="external">"Variegate porphyria"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7095.html" rel="external">"ALA dehydratase porphyria"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6425387"><span class="h2">Environmental</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Environmental factors can also impact nerve health in substantial ways. Neuropathies associated with vibration-induced nerve damage, prolonged cold exposure, or hypoxemia [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] have been well described. These disorders are mainly axonal in nature.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93179221"><span class="h2">Idiopathic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although population-based data are lacking, no specific cause is identified in up to 46 percent of patients with polyneuropathy at referral centers despite extensive investigations [<a href="#rid7">7-11</a>]. A variety of terms have been employed to describe this disorder, including chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP), chronic sensory polyneuropathy, chronic polyneuropathy of undetermined cause, unclassified peripheral neuropathy, and idiopathic neuropathy. Most such cases present in adults ≥50 years of age and progress slowly over months to years. The symptoms are typically sensory, involving paresthesia, numbness, or pain. Electrodiagnostic studies show a primarily axonal polyneuropathy. Proposed but unproven causes include impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and increased oxidative stress [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Polyneuropathy is typically characterized by symmetric distal sensory loss, burning sensations, or weakness. Patients with very mild or asymptomatic polyneuropathy occasionally are identified on detailed sensory examination of the lower extremities. Alternatively, a patient may undergo electrodiagnostic testing for an unrelated problem, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and mild abnormalities suggestive of polyneuropathy are identified. More advanced cases, however, typically present with symptoms suggestive of peripheral nerve disease, which may or may not be supported by findings on physical examination  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73819 graphicRef50878 graphicRef62629" href="/z/d/graphic/73819.html" rel="external">table 2A-C</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The presentation of patients with polyneuropathy varies significantly depending upon the underlying pathophysiology.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic axonal polyneuropathies (eg, due to diabetes mellitus or uremia) are the most common of the polyneuropathies. Injury tends to be related to axon length; thus, longer axons are affected first, resulting in symptoms that begin in the lower extremities. Sensory symptoms usually precede motor symptoms. Patients typically present with slowly progressive sensory loss and dysesthesias such as numbness, a burning sensation and pain in the feet, and mild gait abnormalities. As the syndrome progresses, mild weakness of the lower legs and hand symptoms may begin, resulting in the classic "stocking and glove" distribution of sensory loss. The numbness may continue to extend proximally in severe cases, affecting the intercostal nerves (the next longest nerve fibers after the arms) and causing sensory loss over the sternum. The top of the head may be affected with further progression.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In acute axonal polyneuropathies, such as that produced by toxic exposures or porphyria, patients may present with similar but much more fulminant symptoms. Pain is often a predominant component, although it can be distinctly absent. The polyneuropathy tends to worsen over two to three weeks, plateau, and then recover over months. Although often dose related, some toxic neuropathies can occur within days of drug exposure and appear to be idiosyncratic, as in fluoroquinolone-associated neuropathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/490.html" rel="external">"Fluoroquinolones", section on 'Neurologic'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with acute demyelinating polyneuropathies, primarily Guillain-Barré syndrome, the presentation is often quite distinct from that of most axonal polyneuropathies. Guillain-Barré syndrome tends to affect predominantly motor nerve fibers; thus, weakness rather than sensory loss typically is one of the earliest signs of the disease. Eventually, however, most patients will complain of some dysesthesias distally in the legs or arms. Gait difficulties or hand clumsiness secondary to reduced proprioception are also common complaints.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weakness and generalized sensory loss are often present simultaneously in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5264.html" rel="external">"Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with hereditary polyneuropathies generally do not complain of positive symptoms such as paresthesias or pain. Often neither patients nor their families appreciate marked neurologic deficits or atrophy since the progression of the disease is slow and insidious [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p>The history is important for distinguishing between polyneuropathy and mononeuropathy multiplex. Occasionally patients with the former will have symptoms that begin in one foot shortly before the other or are more pronounced in one foot. Mononeuropathy multiplex, in its acute form, usually presents with multiple mononeuropathies with involvement of entirely unrelated nerves, such as the median nerve in the arm and the sciatic nerve in the leg. However, patients may occasionally present with more symmetric sensory and motor symptoms affecting both legs that can be difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds from a severe subacute polyneuropathy. On detailed examination, relative preservation of one nerve (eg, posterior tibial) compared with another (eg, peroneal) may be identified.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abnormalities on physical examination are similarly dependent upon the type of polyneuropathy (axonal versus demyelinating) and which classes of nerve fibers are most involved (motor versus sensory).</p><p>In patients with an axonal polyneuropathy, motor examination may disclose wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the feet or lower leg; similar findings are evident in the hands in more severe cases. Distal loss of sensation to pin prick, light touch, vibration, cold, and proprioception may also occur.

(See <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Laboratory testing</strong> – We recommend selective use of laboratory tests in patients with polyneuropathy, based upon the history, clinical features, and results of electrodiagnostic tests  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77479" href="/z/d/graphic/77479.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64055" href="/z/d/graphic/64055.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).
