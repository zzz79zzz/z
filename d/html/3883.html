         The evaluation of illness in returned travelers should focus on the possible infections given the patient's clinical findings, travel geography, administration (if any) of vaccinations and malaria chemoprophylaxis, the nature and timeframe of potential exposure(s), and the incubation period(s) of the relevant possible infections  (

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Good resources that provide current information about the infections that occur in various geographic areas are essential [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website includes an online version of Health Information for International Travel under Travelers' Health and updates on travel-related infections [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The World Health Organization website also has regularly updated information about outbreaks.

         General medical information (including vaccination history, past medical history, and medications) – If malaria chemoprophylaxis was taken, the clinician should inquire as to the drug, the dose, the intervals between doses, and the duration of therapy prior to arrival and following departure from the transmission area.

         Physical findings that signal severe illness warranting prompt intervention include hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress, hemorrhagic manifestations, and neurologic findings such as confusion, lethargy, stiff neck, or focal deficits. The physical examination should also include evaluation for skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, retinal or conjunctival changes, enlargement of liver or spleen, genital lesions, and neurologic findings.

         The initial laboratory evaluation for travelers with fever should include complete blood count and differential, liver enzymes, blood cultures and blood smears and rapid diagnostic test for malaria (if there was exposure to an area with malaria transmission), and/or rapid diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses. Additional studies depend upon exposures and other factors  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with exposure to an area with malaria transmission should have diagnostic tests performed promptly (on the day of the encounter). Because parasites may be sequestered in the deep vasculature in patients with falciparum malaria, few parasites may be visible on a peripheral smear even in severe infection. Therefore, if the initial smear is negative, additional smears should be evaluated over the subsequent 24 to 72 hours. Rapid diagnostic tests should be used if available. (See

         Malaria is characterized by fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, myalgia, and anemia. Any patient with fever who has spent time in a region where malaria is endemic should be evaluated for malaria, even if afebrile at the time of evaluation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72797" href="/z/d/graphic/72797.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Fevers in malaria wax and wane; ≥40 percent of patients may not have fever at the time of the initial evaluation, and physical examination can be normal [

         Malaria is transmitted by
         <em>
          Anopheles
         </em>
         mosquitoes. The incubation period of malaria due to
         <em>
          P. falciparum
         </em>
         is usually 7 to 30 days (but may be longer). The incubation period of non-falciparum malaria is 9 to 14 days. The diagnosis of malaria is established by visualization of parasites on peripheral smear. (See

         The efficacy of various malaria chemoprophylactic regimens varies by geographic region; even in areas where no resistance has been reported, malaria chemoprophylaxis is not 100 percent effective. Use of chemoprophylaxis may delay the malaria symptom onset, and most chemoprophylactic regimens do not prevent relapse of vivax malaria [

Classic manifestations include relative bradycardia, pulse-temperature dissociation, and "rose spots" (faint salmon-colored macules on the trunk and abdomen). Hepatosplenomegaly, intestinal bleeding, and perforation may occur, leading to secondary bacteremia and peritonitis.

It is transmitted via exposure to animal urine, contaminated water or soil, or infected animal tissue; outbreaks in endemic areas are associated with increased rainfall or flooding. The disease is widespread in South America. The incubation is 2 to 29 days. The diagnosis is established via serology, PCR, or culture of blood or urine. (See

          West Nile virus

         – West Nile virus infection is characterized by fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia, and anorexia; neuroinvasive illness can present as encephalitis, meningitis, or an acute asymmetric flaccid paralysis. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and occurs in Africa, the Middle East, parts of Europe and the former Soviet Union, South and Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Americas. The incubation period is 2 to 14 days. The diagnosis is established via serologic testing in serum and spinal fluid. (See
