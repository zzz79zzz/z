Ventilatory strategies vary according to the clinical scenario, and to provide optimal care, emergency clinicians must understand the fundamental concepts of mechanical ventilation.</p><p>This topic review will discuss management of mechanical ventilation in the ED, including ventilator settings, modes of mechanical ventilation, complications of mechanical ventilation, management of ventilated patients in distress, general and disease-specific ventilation strategies, and weaning from ventilatory support [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. Although useful guidelines are provided, clinicians will need to individualize mechanical ventilation strategies based on the clinical scenario. Tracheal intubation and other aspects of airway management are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/270.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence intubation in adults for emergency medicine and critical care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6390.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in children for emergency medicine: Approach"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OBJECTIVES AND OVERVIEW OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians place patients on mechanical ventilation to accomplish any of the following goals, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To secure the airway</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To improve pulmonary gas exchange (ie, reverse hypoxemia or acute respiratory acidosis)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To relieve respiratory distress (ie, decrease oxygen consumption or address respiratory muscle fatigue)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To assist with airway and lung healing</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To permit appropriate sedation and neuromuscular blockade</p><p></p><p>The ventilator simulates four stages of breathing:</p><p>1. The ventilator or the patient triggers the initiation of inspiration.</p><p>2. The ventilator provides a breath, determined by preset variables (ie, pressure, volume, and flow rate).</p><p>3. The ventilator halts inspiration when a preset parameter, such as tidal volume, inspiratory time, or airway pressure, is reached.</p><p>4. The ventilator switches to expiration, and the breath is completed. Expiration occurs when the expiratory valve opens and generally involves a passive mechanism generated by the recoil of the chest wall, lungs, and diaphragm.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">VENTILATOR SETTINGS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To manage patients requiring mechanical ventilation, emergency clinicians must be familiar with the ventilator apparatus in use at their hospital and understand the various settings that can be modified. In this section, we describe basic ventilator settings of importance to the emergency clinician. More detailed discussions of mechanical ventilation settings are found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation"</a>.)</p><p>Ventilator settings are adjusted to provide adequate minute ventilation (MV) to meet metabolic demand while minimizing the risk of iatrogenic complications. MV equals tidal volume (TV) multiplied by respiratory rate (RR) (MV = TV x RR). Normal MV ranges from 5 to 10 L/min. The basal ventilatory rate is selected by the clinician. TV is generally based on predicted body weight (PBW) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/141068.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) and varies according to the ventilation mode chosen. The TV based on PBW for males and females is provided in the tables and calculator  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87507" href="/d/graphic/87507.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87147" href="/d/graphic/87147.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/141067.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Modes of ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Breath types</strong> – Mechanical ventilators can deliver different kinds of breaths. A mandatory breath is started, controlled, and ended by the ventilator, which does all the work. An assisted breath is initiated by the patient but controlled and ended by the ventilator. A spontaneous breath is initiated, controlled, and ended by the patient; the volume of the breath delivered by the ventilator is determined by the patient’s effort, pulmonary compliance, and physiologic reserve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit", section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Triggers</strong> – An assisted breath can be triggered by either pressure or flow. The pressure trigger requires a demand valve, which senses a negative airway pressure deflection when the patient initiates a breath. A trigger sensitivity threshold of -1 to -3 cmH<sub>2</sub>O is common. When the threshold is reached, the ventilator delivers a breath. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit", section on 'Trigger sensitivity'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The flow trigger uses a circuit of gas that flows continuously past the patient. A preset change in flow rate, created when the patient initiates a breath, triggers the ventilator to deliver a breath. A basal flow rate of 10 L/minute is common, and a trigger sensitivity threshold of 2 L/minute is frequently used.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Regardless of the trigger mechanism, the threshold must be appropriate. If it is too low, the ventilator will "auto-cycle" (ie, deliver a continual series of breaths), resulting in respiratory alkalosis; if it is too high, the patient will be "locked out" from ventilator-supported breaths while expending considerable energy. In both conditions, the mechanically ventilated patient will appear to be in respiratory distress, and the work of breathing will increase.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Respiratory rate</strong> – The clinician determines the minimum number of breaths per minute (ie, respiratory rate) given to the patient by the ventilator. The rate can be adjusted according to the disease process. (See <a class="local">'Disease-specific ventilatory management'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit", section on 'Ventilator rate'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inspiratory-to-expiratory (I:E) ratio</strong> – Inspiratory time (I time) is equal to TV divided by flow rate (I time = TV/FR). Decreasing the TV or increasing the flow rate decreases the inspiratory time and decreases the I:E ratio. The normal I:E ratio is 1:2 or 1:3.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinicians often reduce the I:E ratio to 1:4 or 1:5 in the presence of obstructive airway disease, which requires greater time for expiration. An inverse I:E ratio may be necessary in states of low lung compliance, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Inverse-ratio ventilation may improve oxygenation in ARDS without elevating peak alveolar and inspiratory plateau pressures that can lead to further lung injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation", section on 'Inverse ratio ventilation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Flow</strong> – Flow rates and waves represent additional inspiration variables. Flow rates of 60 L/minute are standard. Higher flow rates (up to 100 L/minute) may be required in certain conditions, such as obstructive airway disease (OAD) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In OAD, higher flow rates deliver the desired TV more rapidly, allowing for increased expiratory time. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation", section on 'Volume-limited ventilation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cycling</strong> – Ventilator "cycling" refers to the mechanism by which a breath changes from inspiration to expiration. Common methods for cycling a ventilator are volume, flow, and time. Volume-cycled breaths transition from inspiration to expiration after a preset volume of gas is delivered. This is the most common form. Flow-cycled inspiratory breaths transition after a preset airway pressure is reached and flow decreases to a particular rate. Time-cycled inspiratory breaths transition after a predetermined inspiratory time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Inspiratory hold can also be included in the cycling mechanism. This function keeps air in the lungs at end-inspiration for longer intervals to maximize gas exchange.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)</strong> – Applied or extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPe) can be provided by the ventilator to prevent premature airway closure and alveolar collapse at end expiration. PEEPe allows for improved oxygenation by increasing functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume at which pressure from elastic recoil equals PEEPe. By improving oxygenation, PEEPe can help clinicians reduce the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) being provided to the patient. PEEPe is often initially set with a minimum of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, a level thought to be equivalent to physiologic PEEPe. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1642.html" rel="external">"Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong><strong>)</strong> – FiO<sub>2</sub> is typically set at 1.0 (ie, 100 percent) when mechanical ventilation is initiated. As soon as possible, clinicians should reduce the FiO<sub>2</sub> to nontoxic levels (generally 0.6 or less), provided that an oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of 90 percent or greater can be maintained (PaO<sub>2</sub> above 60 mmHg). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1622.html" rel="external">"Adverse effects of supplemental oxygen"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">MODES OF VENTILATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The emergency clinician should be familiar with the following modes of mechanical ventilation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assist-control ventilation (ACV)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pressure support ventilation (PSV)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Positive-pressure noninvasive ventilation (NIV)</p><p></p><p>ACV is used most frequently in the emergency department (ED) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. A brief description of the modes of ventilation of greatest relevance to emergency practice is provided here. There is no evidence that either mode of ventilation is superior to the other in terms of patient outcomes. More detailed discussions of the modes and advanced alternative modes of mechanical ventilation are found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1639.html" rel="external">"High-frequency ventilation in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assist-control ventilation (ACV) – With ACV, every breath is fully supported by the ventilator, regardless of whether the breath is initiated by the patient or the machine. The clinician determines a base ventilatory rate, but the patient is able to breathe faster than this preset rate. ACV provides the patient with increased ventilatory support and reduces the work of breathing. Potential dangers include diminished cardiac output and inappropriate hyperventilation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1628.html" rel="external">"Clinical and physiologic complications of mechanical ventilation: Overview"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">ACV may be volume- or pressure-cycled. In volume-cycled (ie, volume-targeted) ACV, the clinician determines the tidal volume (TV), inspiratory flow rate, flow waveform, sensitivity to the patient's respiratory effort (ie, trigger), and basal ventilatory rate. When the patient breathes faster than the preset basal ventilatory rate, auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) causing excessive peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and subsequent lung injury may result unless limited by a pressure alarm and "pop-off" valve.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In pressure-cycled (ie, pressure-targeted) ACV, the clinician determines the ventilator's sensitivity to the patient's respiratory effort (ie, trigger) and the basal ventilatory rate. Unlike volume-controlled ACV, however, the clinician determines pressure levels and inspiratory time. TV is not set by the ventilator and is dependent upon airway pressures and the compliance of the lung and chest wall. While this mode allows the clinician to minimize PIP (and associated pressure-induced lung injury), specific TV is not guaranteed and will vary based upon the patient’s airway resistance and lung compliance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) – In SIMV mode, the patient is allowed intermittent spontaneous breaths between the mandated, preset number of ventilator-supported breaths. Spontaneous breaths above the preset ventilatory rate are not supported by the ventilator. Either the patient or the ventilator can trigger the ventilator-supported breaths.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">SIMV creates less interference with normal cardiovascular function by decreasing auto-PEEP, lowering mean airway pressures, and preserving respiratory muscle function. However, it does increase the patient’s work of breathing compared with ACV. SIMV also creates the risk of dyssynchrony between patient effort and ventilator-supported breaths. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1628.html" rel="external">"Clinical and physiologic complications of mechanical ventilation: Overview"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">With volume-cycled (ie, volume-targeted) SIMV, the tidal volume, inspiratory flow rate, flow waveform, sensitivity, and basal ventilatory rate are determined by the ventilator. With pressure-cycled (ie, pressure-targeted) SIMV, airway pressures, inspiratory time, sensitivity, and basal ventilatory rate are determined by the ventilator.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">SIMV is almost always combined with PSV in order to reduce the amount of work during intermittent spontaneous breaths. Generally, the set respiratory rate should allow 80 percent of breaths to be provided by the ventilator in order to minimize the work of breathing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pressure support ventilation (PSV) – With PSV, each breath must be patient-triggered, so the patient must possess intact respiratory drive. PSV is pressure-cycled and designed to reduce the patient’s work of breathing by partially supporting spontaneous breaths. A minimal amount of pressure support is necessary to compensate for the inherent resistance of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and ventilator circuit; the smaller the ETT diameter, the higher the pressure support required. Most modern ventilators automatically compensate for this increased resistance, even when the PSV is set at zero. PSV is used primarily during stable ventilatory support periods and for weaning patients from ventilatory support. It is contraindicated in paralyzed and heavily sedated patients who cannot initiate a spontaneous breath.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Positive-pressure noninvasive ventilation (NIV) – NIV includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel-positive airway pressure (BPAP), which is CPAP plus PSV. Positive-pressure NIV is delivered through a nasal or facial mask or a helmet, rather than an endotracheal or tracheotomy tube. CPAP is the noninvasive equivalent of continuous PEEP; BPAP is the noninvasive equivalent of ventilator-supported breathing. Contraindications to NIV include the need for a definitive airway, high aspiration risk, and inability to tolerate mask ventilation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60442" href="/d/graphic/60442.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). In select patients with acute respiratory distress, NIV has reduced the need for conventional mechanical ventilation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1636.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mechanical ventilation is associated with a number of pathophysiologic derangements that can lead to injury. Among these are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diminished cardiac output and hypotension</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pulmonary barotrauma (eg, pneumothorax)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP; ie, intrinsic PEEP)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated intracranial pressure</p><p></p><p>These complications are discussed in detail elsewhere but are briefly described below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1628.html" rel="external">"Clinical and physiologic complications of mechanical ventilation: Overview"</a>.)</p><p>Hypotension and VALI, including barotrauma, are among the more important problems that occur after the institution of mechanical ventilation. Hypotension most often results from a combination of sedation, decreased venous return from elevated intrathoracic pressure, and diminished intravascular volume. These complications are often observed immediately after endotracheal intubation; hence, close monitoring during the post-intubation period is imperative. Barotrauma results from elevated pulmonary pressures. Clinicians can reduce the risk of barotrauma by minimizing plateau airway pressures. Reduced airway pressures, as well as reduced tidal volumes (TVs), also help minimize the risk of VALI. Clinicians need to be aware that some abnormalities, such as an elevated PaCO<sub>2</sub>, need not be corrected immediately to achieve physiologic norms or the patient’s baseline, and that attempts to do so may increase the risk of VALI.</p><p>Pneumonia is a well-described complication of mechanical ventilation. Clinicians can reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) by elevating the head of the patient’s bed by at least 30 degrees, either by inclining the head of the bed upwards, inclining the entire bed upwards (ie, reverse Trendelenburg), or by placing the patient in a semirecumbent position (ie, not lying flat). Other strategies for reducing the risk of VAP are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6995.html" rel="external">"Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO VENTILATORY MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">General principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no single optimal mode of mechanical ventilation [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>].

The RSBI measurement consists of a one-minute trial of unassisted breathing with a PEEPe of 0 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and pressure support of 0 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. At the end of one minute, the average respiratory rate (RR) is divided by the average tidal volume (TV) to obtain the RSBI (ie, RSBI = RR/VT). A number less than or equal to 105 has been found to be most predictive of successful extubation.

There are three ways to perform an SBT: putting the patient on minimal pressure support and PEEPe, assessing respiratory parameters (so-called “performing mechanics”); using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alone; or using a T-piece trial, which requires the patient to breathe through the endotracheal tube for a preset period of time with oxygen but without ventilatory support. Institutional approaches vary, but any of the methods described are acceptable.
