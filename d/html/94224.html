         Extubation at the end of anesthesia may be associated with complications, including loss of the airway and the need to reintubate. It is important to keep in mind that extubation is always elective, and should be performed only when physiologic, pharmacologic, and contextual conditions are optimal. Similar to the requirement for a strategy when planning intubation, a specific individualized plan for extubation should be created, beginning with risk stratification.
        </p>
        <p>
         The topic will review risk stratification for extubation, and strategies for extubations based on predicted risk. Other aspects of airway management for anesthesia are discussed separately. (See

         Extubation of the trachea during emergence from anesthesia can cause arterial and venous hypertension, tachycardia, coughing or bucking, and agitation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3

         ]. Coughing, bucking, breathholding and straining during extubation also cause increases in intracranial [

          4
         </a>
         ] and intraocular pressure. Most healthy patients will tolerate these transient physiologic effects, but certain patients are at greater risk of serious consequence. Examples include patients with significant cardiac or cerebrovascular disease, preexisting raised intracranial or intraocular pressure, patients who undergo neck surgery, neurosurgery, and some plastic or ocular surgical procedures.

          table 5
         </a>
         ). When considering reintubation, anatomical challenges may relate to the reasons why initial intubation was difficult, or changes that have occurred since that initial intubation. Initial intubation may have provided a poor laryngeal view, required multiple attempts or laryngoscopists, or involved an advanced technique such as an awake intubation. An easy intubation accomplished under controlled elective conditions does not assure that an emergency reintubation will be equally easy, but a difficult initial intubation will almost certainly be more difficult under emergency conditions.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         During emergency reintubation, the view of the airway may be compromised by blood, secretions, or stomach contents, airway trauma, or swelling. There may also be limited or suboptimal access to the airway if the cervical spine is unstable or immobilized, the jaws are clenched or wired shut, or other factors have changed. After tracheal resection, cervical extension may be deliberately restricted by a "guardian suture" between the chin and sternum.

          Physiological challenges –
         </strong>
         Physiological abnormalities at the time of emergency reintubation may render patients less tolerant of delays and persistent or prolonged intubation attempts. Patients may be hypoxic, hypercapnic, acidotic or hemodynamically unstable.

         – The emergency nature of a reintubation may result in insufficient information, medication, equipment, qualified personnel, suitable positioning, or access to the airway. Other human factors such as operator fatigue, situation awareness, stress, and urgency may interfere with an organized, appropriate, and well-executed approach to managing the airway [

         The true incidence of extubation associated complications is unknown and may be under-reported in the literature. The physiological complications described above are rarely reported as extubation failures. In addition, although reintubation is more clearly seen as a complication of extubation, there is no consensus on the length of time between extubation and the need for reintubation that would define failed extubation.

         Minor complications are common following extubation; major complications are rare but these can be catastrophic. Examples of studies on the incidence of extubation complications include the following:

         National Audit Project (NAP4) in the United Kingdom found that major airway complications following extubation were responsible for approximately one-third of the reported cases relating to anesthesia, and all reported complications during emergence or recovery were due to airway obstruction [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>

         For each patient intubated for anesthesia, an extubation strategy should be created, starting with a risk assessment. The outcome of this risk assessment will allow a tailored extubation strategy. The algorithms in the Difficult Airway Society Guidelines for the management of tracheal extubation incorporate a more dichotomous estimate of risk (low versus "at risk") (

        <p>
         The risk assessment should be completed prior to intubation, as the resulting strategy for extubation may then affect choices made at the time of intubation. For example, if it is anticipated that the strategy may involve deferring extubation at the end of the procedure, it will be prudent to choose a tracheal tube that can be safely left in-situ in the intensive care unit. If the anticipated strategy involves the use of an AEC, a discussion with the patient regarding this prior to the induction of anesthesia, may help improve tolerance of the AEC following extubation. This risk assessment should be repeated prior to considering extubation, to allow for factors that have changed during the procedure.

          Obesity
         </strong>
         – Patients with obesity may fail extubation because of difficulty with oxygenation, ventilation, or airway obstruction. This may be attributable to increased supraglottic adipose tissue, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or central hypoventilation syndrome. Subsequent management of their extubation failure may also be problematic; both face mask ventilation and reintubation may be more difficult than in patients of normal weight. Obesity or associated physical features are risk factors for difficulty with all forms of airway management (

         This disorder does not confer any special difficulty with respect to intubation, but these patients are difficult to extubate, due to the much higher risk of airway obstruction. The safest method of managing their extubation has not been studied, but it probably involves extubating in the least stimulating manner. Deep extubation is one reasonable option if there are no contraindications, or by substituting a tracheal tube for a supraglottic airway (SGA) under deep anesthesia (see

         For this type of extubation, after ensuring adequate reversal of neuromuscular block, the pharynx is carefully suctioned while the patient is still deeply anesthetized. As the level of anesthesia lightens, spontaneous ventilation is established, and the patient is allowed to waken without any form of stimulation, including that which typically occurs around the time of emergence (eg, patient transfer from operating table to the bed, removing tape and adhesive pads, suctioning through the endotracheal tube). Extubation is performed once the patient responds to their name and opens the eyes and mouth on request, assuming other criteria are satisfied.

         Low-risk extubations are those in which both the predicted risk of intolerance of extubation and the predicted risk of difficulty with reintubation are low. During emergence from anesthesia, patients should be extubated when either deeply asleep or when awake and appropriately responsive to instructions, not between these two states. Most adults are extubated awake.

         A routine extubation will usually be performed with the patient awake, to allow return of respiratory drive, airway tone, and protective airway reflexes. A typical sequence for routine awake extubation is as follows (

         The Bailey maneuver (substitution of an ETT with an SGA while the patient is still deeply anesthetized), is an alternative method of deep extubation that maintains airway control, if successful. This technique may be beneficial in patients who are more susceptible to airway reactivity, as an SGA is generally better tolerated than an ETT during emergence from anesthesia. However, a failed technique could convert a controlled airway to a lost airway. This technique requires practice in non-critical airways and has been considered an advanced extubation technique [

         Extubation should be postponed if the risk of failure can be reduced by doing so. This risk reduction might be due to anatomical factors (ie, reduction in airway swelling) physiological factors (improved respiratory reserve or hemodynamic stability) or contextual factors (optimized time of day, location or personnel). If the decision to postpone extubation results in a transfer of this responsibility to someone else, clear communication is of the utmost importance, particularly if the airway management had been difficult.

         This test has been used to assess the adequacy of airflow around the tracheal tube and is used for patients who are at risk for airway edema (eg, patients with significantly positive fluid balance, prolonged Trendelenburg or prone positioning, maxillofacial or neck surgery). Qualitative and quantitative versions of this test have been evaluated [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52

         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. After suctioning the pharynx, the cuff is slowly deflated and the tracheal tube is progressively occluded. A spontaneously breathing patient should be able to breathe in and out around the tube. To the extent that this cannot be accomplished, it may reflect either insufficient respiratory power or airway swelling. However, presence of a leak does not rule out the possibility of subsequent airway obstruction or extubation failure of a nonobstructive cause.

         Most airway guidelines recommend the use of an AEC when extubating a patient with a difficult airway [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-17,47
         </a>
         ]. We use an AEC as part of an extubation strategy for higher risk extubations to assist with reintubation, should that be required. The device is inserted through the ETT and left in place with the tip in the trachea after extubation. If reintubation is necessary, the ETT is reinserted over the AEC.
        </p>
        <p>
         When properly inserted and secured, AECs are generally well-tolerated without a need for sedation or topical anesthesia. Patients can generally talk, cough, and breathe around the device. Intolerance most often indicates that the catheter has been advanced too deeply or has not been adequately secured in the midline of the mouth.

         AECs have a high success rate when used to guide reintubation. In a retrospective review of 354 patients with difficult airways who had an AEC left in situ after extubation, 51 patients required reintubation while the AEC was in place, and 36 required reintubation after the AEC was removed [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Of those with the AEC in situ, 47 of 51 patients were successfully reintubated, 87 percent on the first attempt, compared with a 14 percent first-attempt success without the AEC. Those reintubated with the AEC were also less likely to experience SpO

         </sub>
         &lt;70 percent, heart rate &lt;40, three or more attempts at intubation, esophageal intubation, or require a rescue airway technique. This study was carried out in an intensive care unit (ICU; with an attending anesthesiologist managing or supervising the management). Importantly, only 41 percent of the reintubations occurred within the first two hours, suggesting that, at least in the ICU, AECs are frequently removed prematurely. There were failures with this technique, most occurring as a result of the inadvertent withdrawal of the catheter during the attempted reintubation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The success rate of reintubation over an AEC can be further improved using indirect (video) laryngoscopy. In a retrospective study including 51 intubated patients who required reintubation and had no view of the glottis with direct laryngoscopy, indirect laryngoscopy was attempted to visualize reintubation over an AEC [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. First attempt success was reported in 47 of the 49 patients (96 percent). Videolaryngoscopy facilitated correct manipulations while avoiding arytenoid, vocal cord, and commissural impingement or inadvertent buckling of the AEC.

         The most commonly used AEC is the Cook AEC, which is available with outer diameters (OD) of 8, 11, 14 and 19 Fr. These are intended for exchange of ETT with inner diameters (ID) of at least 3, 4, 5 and 7 mm, respectively (

         The Cook AEC was licensed for use as an exchange catheter and not intended to remain in situ for use should reintubation be required [
         <a href="#rid57">

          picture 2

         ). This set consists of an Amplatz guidewire (outer diameter of 0.038 inch, length of 160 cm) that can be passed through and appropriately positioned via the working channel of a flexible intubating scope (FIS) or more simply, aligned with the depth markings on the tracheal tube about to be removed. The guidewire can be secured in situ. If reintubation is required, a 14 Fr tapered AEC is passed over the guidewire and the new tracheal tube (ID &gt;5 mm) is advanced over the AEC. There is limited literature on this device and what has been published is not very reassuring [

         If reintubation is required over the AEC, select the best sized ETT such that the outer diameter of the AEC and the internal diameter of the ETT are closely matched, to avoid difficulty passing the ETT. A gap between the AEC and the ETT can create a lip of ETT that may impinge on the arytenoids or vocal cords as the ETT is passed. The suggested technique is as follows:

         In some circumstances, it may be unsafe to remove a tracheal tube even if this is postponed for hours or days. This may be a consequence of a bulky intraoral flap, an obstructing or otherwise tenuous airway, significant swelling, or bleeding in or around the airway. If significant short-term improvements are not anticipated in a patient with a critical airway, an elective tracheostomy should be considered when planning extubation. Such a decision should take into account the likely chance of success in securing a compromised airway on an emergency basis.

          Extubation strategy

         – For each patient intubated for anesthesia, a strategy should be created for safe extubation, starting with an estimate of the degree of risk. This strategy should be created at the time of intubation, as it may affect the choice of tracheal tube, route of insertion of the tracheal tube (oral vs nasal) and the discussion with the patient prior to induction of Anesthesia. The plan may be revised due to changes that occur during the surgical procedure (

         Patients at higher risk of extubation failure should be reassessed prior to extubation for optimization of cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, and neuromuscular status; extubation should be postponed if the risk of failure can be reduced by doing so (

         Extubation can cause physiological effects, including hypertension, tachycardia, coughing or bucking, and increases in intracranial and intraocular pressures. Strategies to avoid these effects include administration of

          Use of airway exchange catheter (AEC)
         </strong>
         – The decision to use an AEC should be based on the perceived risk of difficulty with reintubation. For the patient with a higher risk extubation due to potential difficulty with reintubation, in whom no further benefit will be derived from deferring extubation, we use an airway exchange catheter (AEC). The AEC is left in place with the tip in the trachea and can be used to guide reinsertion of an endotracheal tube (ETT) over the AEC (

          Elective tracheostomy
         </strong>
         – Elective tracheostomy may be performed rather than extubation for patients who will require prolonged intubation or who are likely to have a persistent risk of airway obstruction. (See
