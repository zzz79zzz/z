         Patients with severe and acute myocardial infarction (ie, ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) require rapid diagnosis and treatment to reduce the risk of death and permanent myocardial injury [

         Aspects of management that typically arise in the hours to days after revascularization are discussed in a separate topic. (See

         </span>
         The primary goal of STEMI management is to reduce the risk of death and the extent of permanent cardiac injury associated with MI. Because therapy for patients with STEMI becomes less effective with each minute its delivery is delayed  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53374" href="/z/d/graphic/53374.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ), another goal of therapy is to rapidly treat patients with STEMI before treatment becomes ineffective.

         </span>
         All patients with chest pain (acute coronary syndrome [ACS]) should have an initial assessment (ie, electrocardiogram [ECG], history, physical examination) to rapidly confirm or exclude the diagnosis of STEMI and to identify other conditions that would change management.

         The rapid diagnosis of STEMI only requires the presence of symptoms suspicious for an ACS (eg, chest discomfort, dyspnea, sudden death) and a confirmatory ECG; it does not require evidence of elevated cardiac biomarkers such as troponin. Thus, patients with suspected ACS should undergo a focused history, physical, and ECG within ten minutes of hospital arrival to identify the key findings of STEMI  (

Patients with shock require specific management of shock as well as appropriate and timely reperfusion. The clinical manifestations and causes of shock, including the mechanical complications of STEMI, are discussed separately. (See

          Aortic dissection

         – Aortic dissection is a rare cause of STEMI but should be considered in all patients with STEMI. The signs and symptoms of aortic dissection include severe pain or tearing located in the chest or back, asymmetric upper extremity pulses or pulse deficits, new aortic valve murmurs, and widening of the mediastinum on chest radiograph. Patients with STEMI caused by aortic dissection require management that is different from the typical management of STEMI. (See

          Coagulopathy and/or thrombocytopenia
         </strong>
         – The management of patients with STEMI typically requires treatments that increase the risk of bleeding. Thus, all patients with STEMI should be assessed for chronic use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, history of bleeding or coagulation disorders (eg, uremia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), and the presence of abnormal coagulation studies or thrombocytopenia. The approach to assessing the risk of bleeding in patents with ACS can be found elsewhere. (See

         The initial management of patients with STEMI requires rapid selection and administration of reperfusion therapy. Patients with STEMI should also receive treatments that prevent further coronary artery thrombosis, minimize myocardial injury, and treat the symptoms of MI.

         For patients diagnosed with STEMI, the primary goal of acute management is to rapidly restore blood flow to the acutely occluded coronary artery (ie, culprit artery) with a reperfusion therapy (ie, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], fibrinolysis)  (

         ). Thus, a reperfusion strategy should be chosen within minutes of arrival. After a reperfusion strategy is chosen, local STEMI protocols should be initiated without delay; these protocols mobilize the key personnel (eg, interventional cardiologist, pharmacist) and resources (eg, interhospital transfer) required to deliver reperfusion therapy as quickly as possible.

          Initial assessment

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         All patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should have an initial assessment to rapidly confirm or exclude the presence of STEMI and to identify other conditions that would change management  (

          Rapid diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The rapid diagnosis of STEMI only requires the presence of symptoms suspicious for an ACS and a confirmatory ECG; it does not require evidence of elevated cardiac biomarkers such as troponin. (See
