When considering neuraxial anesthesia, the assessment should include a focus on medical conditions that may alter the physiologic response to neuraxial anesthesia or increase the risk of complications (eg, coagulopathy, systemic and local infection, spine abnormalities, neurologic disease). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89517.html" rel="external">"Overview of neuraxial anesthesia", section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Airway assessment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2738347959"><span class="h2">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In anticipation of neuraxial anesthesia, we review prenatal laboratory results, and order further testing selectively, as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cerclage </strong>–<strong> </strong>Testing according to comorbidities (eg, complete blood count [CBC] if there is a history of thrombocytopenia).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>External cephalic version </strong>–<strong> </strong>Laboratory testing is the same as for cesarean delivery, in case cesarean delivery is planned or emergency cesarean delivery becomes necessary.

However, the incidence of aspiration is low, and the need for pharmacologic prophylaxis for aspiration should be assessed on an individual basis depending on patient- and anesthesia-related factors. This issue is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6775.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for nonobstetric surgery during pregnancy", section on 'Preoperative aspiration mitigation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pregnant patients at term have a high incidence of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which may increase the risk of aspiration.

For prophylaxis we administer a gastrointestinal prokinetic agent (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9642" href="/z/d/drug information/9642.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a> 10 mg IV bolus 60 minutes prior to induction of anesthesia), a histamine-2 receptor blocker (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8436" href="/z/d/drug information/8436.html" rel="external">famotidine</a> 20 mg IV 60 to 90 minutes prior to induction or 20 mg orally the night prior to surgery and again the morning of surgery), and nonparticulate antacid (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9930" href="/z/d/drug information/9930.html" rel="external">sodium citrate-citric acid</a> 30 mL orally just prior to induction).

For general anesthesia, the plan for airway management must take into account not only pregnancy, but also assessment of the other risk factors for difficulty with airway management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The reported incidence of failed intubation is much higher in obstetric patients (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16690.html" rel="external">"Airway management for the pregnant patient", section on 'Incidence and consequences of airway problems'</a>). In addition, the consequences of difficulty with airway management (ie, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, cardiac compromise) are greater in pregnant patients and their fetuses. Desaturation occurs more rapidly during apnea with increasing oxygen consumption and decreasing functional residual capacity as pregnancy progresses.</p><p>Difficulty with airway management may increase over the course of pregnancy, as weight gain and upper airway edema occur. As an example, in one study of airway assessment during pregnancy, the incidence of Mallampati grade 4 airway assessments increased by 34 percent between 12 and 38 weeks gestation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4788.html" rel="external">"Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Dyspnea and other physiologic respiratory changes", section on 'Physiologic pulmonary changes in pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2194804890"><span class="h1">CERVICAL CERCLAGE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical cerclage is a procedure performed to decrease the incidence of preterm delivery in women who have cervical insufficiency (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6737.html" rel="external">"Transvaginal cervical cerclage"</a>). The procedure can either be performed on an elective basis in women who have a history of cervical insufficiency, or on an urgent basis for patients with cervical insufficiency found by ultrasound or on physical examination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6737.html" rel="external">"Transvaginal cervical cerclage", section on 'Goal'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6774.html" rel="external">"Cervical insufficiency", section on 'Cerclage placement and use of progesterone supplementation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3813187015"><span class="h2">Timing of cerclage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The timing of cerclage during pregnancy determines the extent of the physiologic changes of pregnancy that may affect anesthetic care. Elective transvaginal history-indicated cerclages are usually performed between 12 and 14 weeks of gestation. At this stage of pregnancy, airway edema and weight gain are usually minimal and left uterine displacement is not typically necessary. However, ultrasound-indicated and physical exam-indicated cerclage is performed up to 23 weeks of gestation, at a stage of pregnancy in which physiologic changes are of more concern. Transabdominal and laparoscopic cerclage may be performed preconception, or in the late first trimester to early second trimester of pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6739.html" rel="external">"Transabdominal and laparoscopic cervicoisthmic cerclage", section on 'Issues with preconception placement'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6739.html" rel="external">"Transabdominal and laparoscopic cervicoisthmic cerclage", section on 'Issues with placement during pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2132127597"><span class="h2">Transvaginal cerclage</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H509184696"><span class="h3">Tocolytics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8559" href="/z/d/drug information/8559.html" rel="external">Indomethacin</a> (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID]) may be administered for prophylactic tocolysis. NSAIDs can be used in patients who receive neuraxial anesthesia, without an increase in risk of spinal or epidural hematoma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14930.html" rel="external">"Neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia techniques in the patient receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication", section on 'Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6737.html" rel="external">"Transvaginal cervical cerclage", section on 'Prophylactic pharmacotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4200413517"><span class="h3">Fetal heart rate monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At a minimum, the fetal heart rate should be documented pre- and postoperatively, regardless of gestational age. For viable fetuses (greater than 23 to 24 weeks of gestation), continuous fetal heart rate monitoring during the procedure should be individualized and discussed with the obstetrician and patient before the procedure. This issue is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121990.html" rel="external">"Nonobstetric surgery in pregnant patients: Patient counseling, surgical considerations, and obstetric management", section on 'Fetal heart rate monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3486269335"><span class="h3">Choice of anesthetic technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transvaginal cerclage can be performed with neuraxial or general anesthesia. The choice of anesthetic technique should be based on patient factors and patient choice. For patients who undergo cerclage in whom either general anesthesia or neuraxial anesthesia would be appropriate, we suggest neuraxial anesthesia, and prefer single-shot spinal or combined spinal-epidural (CSE) if the procedure is expected to take longer than usual.</p><p>Neuraxial anesthesia avoids the need to manage the patient's airway, minimizes fetal exposure to anesthetic drugs, and is associated with less nausea and vomiting and sedation than general anesthesia. Time for block regression may delay discharge compared with general anesthesia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1058048925"><span class="h4">Single-shot spinal and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sensory blockade to T8 to T10 is necessary for transvaginal cerclage to anesthetize the cervix (T10 to L1) and the vagina (S2 to S4). Our usual single-shot spinal drug combination includes 7.5 mg <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/z/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a> (1 mL of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine or 1.5 mL of 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine) plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8441" href="/z/d/drug information/8441.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a> 15 mcg intrathecally. For procedures that are expected to be longer, we increase the dose of bupivacaine to 9 to 10.5 mg (eg, 1.2 to 1.4 mL of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine) or insert an epidural catheter for possible extension of the block (ie, perform a CSE).</p><p>If neuraxial anesthesia is used for a patient with a dilated cervix or bulging membranes, we position the patient in the lateral decubitus position rather than sitting to perform the neuraxial procedure, and maintain Trendelenburg position throughout to minimize gravitational pressure on the cervix. If the patient is in a very steep Trendelenburg position and there is concern for a high block, isobaric (plain) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/z/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a> is an option in this setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105456.html" rel="external">"Spinal anesthesia: Technique", section on 'Positioning for spinal procedure'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105456.html" rel="external">"Spinal anesthesia: Technique", section on 'Baricity'</a> and <a class="local">'Positioning'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3587399732"><span class="h4">General anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The principles for management of general anesthesia for transvaginal cerclage are similar to those that are used for cesarean delivery (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4480.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for cesarean delivery"</a>). The appropriate strategy for airway management may depend on the gestational age at the time of the procedure, with increasing risk of passive regurgitation (and aspiration during anesthesia) as pregnancy progresses. For patients whose pregnancy is ≥18 weeks gestational age, or who have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), we perform rapid sequence induction and intubation for general anesthesia. For patients &lt;18 weeks gestational age, without symptoms of GERD, we place a supraglottic airway (SGA) for airway management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16690.html" rel="external">"Airway management for the pregnant patient", section on 'Choice of airway devices'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16690.html" rel="external">"Airway management for the pregnant patient", section on 'RSII versus routine intubation'</a>.)</p><p>General anesthesia with volatile inhalation agents may be used to provide uterine relaxation and allow replacement of bulging membranes. Alternatively, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">nitroglycerin</a> (50 to 200 mcg intravenous [IV]) can be administered to relax the uterus during general or neuraxial anesthesia, if indicated.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3110686436"><span class="h3">Positioning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient is positioned in lithotomy, with left uterine displacement if &gt;20 weeks gestation (or earlier gestation if evidence of supine hypotension). The operating table may be positioned head down (ie, Trendelenburg) to optimize surgical access, and may be tipped steeply down to facilitate replacement of prolapsed fetal membranes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6737.html" rel="external">"Transvaginal cervical cerclage", section on 'Replace prolapsed membranes, if present'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H167922695"><span class="h3">Hemodynamic management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood pressure goals and the use of vasopressors in pregnancy have generally been studied in women undergoing cesarean delivery; these goals for physiologic parameters are also applicable for women having other types of surgery during pregnancy.</p><p>We aim to maintain the patient's baseline blood pressure throughout the procedure with administration of vasopressor boluses as required. A prophylactic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9768" href="/z/d/drug information/9768.html" rel="external">phenylephrine</a> infusion, which is usually administered during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery, is not routinely required for patients who are not at or near term in pregnancy. In patients who become symptomatic with nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness, or if the fetus shows signs of distress on fetal heart rate monitoring, hypotension should be evaluated as the primary etiology. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4480.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for cesarean delivery", section on 'Hemodynamic management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3156165861"><span class="h3">Postoperative analgesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postoperative pain is usually mild after cerclage, and is usually effectively managed with oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>.

The spinal level is somewhat unpredictable in the presence of any residual epidural block. Unlike anesthesia for cesarean delivery, in the postpartum patient the risk of high spinal is much lower with a single-shot spinal or CSE, as the cephalad spread of intrathecal medication is less after delivery. Prior to a cesarean delivery, a full dose spinal (eg, 1.6 mL of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine) should not be administered after a failed neuraxial technique (with any evidence of a block), as a high or total spinal could result.

(See <a class="local">'Preparation for anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p><strong>Airway concerns</strong> — Difficulty with airway management may increase over the course of pregnancy, and the incidence of failed intubation is higher in pregnant patients. Neuraxial anesthesia is preferred when possible during pregnancy, primarily to avoid the need to manage the airway. (See <a class="local">'Airway concerns'</a> above.)</p><p><strong>Cervical cerclage</strong></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transvaginal cerclage can be performed with neuraxial or general anesthesia. For patients in whom either neuraxial anesthesia or general anesthesia would be appropriate for cerclage, we suggest neuraxial anesthesia (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>), and prefer single-shot spinal or combined spinal-epidural (CSE). (See <a class="local">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For neuraxial anesthesia for transvaginal cerclage, sensory blockade to T8 to T10 is necessary.

For patients at &lt;18 weeks gestational age and without risk factors for aspiration, we use a supraglottic airway (SGA) for airway management. For other patients, we perform rapid sequence induction and intubation and administer pharmacologic aspiration prophylaxis. (See <a class="local">'General anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transabdominal cerclage may be performed prior to conception, or during early pregnancy. For pregnant patients, principles of anesthetic management are similar to transvaginal cerclage. For neuraxial anesthesia, a sensory level from sacral levels to T8 is required.

We base neuraxial drug doses for ECV on the plan for obstetric management, patient factors, and the likelihood of successful ECV. In general, we increase the dose of intrathecal local anesthetic (LA) for patients at higher risk of cesarean birth, and/or higher risks associated with general anesthesia if it is required, and/or patients who will undergo cesarean birth following unsuccessful ECV.
