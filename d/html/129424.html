         The incorporation of genetic information into the practice of medicine is increasing at a rapid pace, and an understanding of the basic principles underlying chromosomal organization and segregation is often useful in patient care.
        </p>
        <p>
         The basic principles of chromosome organization and segregation are reviewed here, along with the types of genomic disorders that can occur and tools available to evaluate them.

         Chromosome structure facilitates packaging of a massive amount of DNA (nearly two meters in length if stretched end-to-end) into the cell nucleus, a compaction to nearly one 1-millionth of the original length [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The highly regulated organization of this compaction allows selective accessibility of the transcription machinery to certain genes or regulatory regions, without the need to completely decondense and unwind an entire chromosome.

         Genomic DNA is organized into higher-order structures, beginning with nucleosomes, which consist of 147 base-pair stretches of double-stranded DNA wrapped around a core of eight histones [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. These nucleosomes in turn are further organized into chromatin, which contains additional regulatory proteins that facilitate tighter packaging or unwinding, to allow access to transcription factors and other protein complexes  (

         Chromatin is further packaged as chromosomes, recognizable by their characteristic banded appearance on mitotic chromosome spreads  (

         <strong>
          Centromere
         </strong>
         – The centromere is the site of attachment of paired chromosomes to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Centromeric DNA is largely comprised of repetitive DNA sequences that bind to histones and other proteins that form the kinetochore, which facilitates chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate and segregation during anaphase. On a chromosome spread, the centromere appears as a constriction, not necessarily at the midpoint of the chromosome arms. During anaphase, chromosomes are pulled apart by microtubules attached to the centromeres. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mitosis'

         <strong>
          Chromosome arms
         </strong>
         – The chromosome arms are the regions on either side of the centromere. The short arm is designated as "p" (from the French "petite" – small), and the long arm as "q" (the next letter after p). Gene positions can be described with reference to the chromosome number, arm, region, band, sub-band, and secondary sub-bands. For example, the hemoglobin beta locus (
         <em>
          HBB
         </em>
         ), which encodes the beta globin chain, resides on a chromosome 11q15.4 (read "eleven – Q – one five point four"; not "15 point four").

         <strong>
          Telomeres
         </strong>
         – Telomeres are regions at the ends of chromosomes that protect the ends from loss of genetic material or fusion to other chromosomes. Telomeres shorten with successive cell division, and enzymes such as telomerase are required to maintain adequate telomere length. Telomere disorders such as dyskeratosis congenita can occur when telomere length is not sufficiently maintained. (See

         Chromosomes are numbered in order of decreasing length (ie, chromosome 1 is the longest, followed by chromosome 2). Exceptions are chromosome 21, which is approximately 3 million base pairs shorter than chromosome 22, and the X and Y chromosomes (X is large, Y is very small).

         Germ cells (egg and sperm) are haploid, containing one set of 23 chromosomes (22 autosomes and one sex chromosome, either X or Y). The egg can only provide an X chromosome because it is derived from cells with two X chromosomes; the sperm can provide X or Y because it is derived from cells with an X and a Y chromosome.

         Megakaryocytes represent a physiologically normal exception to diploidy. These cells are large platelet-producing cells in the bone marrow; typically they have a ploidy of 32n or 64n, due to multiple rounds of DNA replication without cell division. (See

         DNA replication creates an identical copy of the cell's nuclear genome. It begins with the separation of DNA strands (denaturation), a process facilitated by DNA helicase  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73442" href="/z/d/graphic/73442.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). The weakness of the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases on opposite strands allows denaturation to occur at physiologic temperatures. Replication occurs throughout the genome, converting one complete genome to two complete genomes allows a cell to divide into two daughter cells, each of which has an identical genetic sequence with conservation of sequence information and maintenance of the diploid (2n) DNA content.
        </p>
        <p>
         Topoisomerases play a critical role in the proper unwinding of DNA during the replication process. Inhibitors of topoisomerase such as

        <p>
         DNA synthesis creates a new strand of DNA, which is assembled in the 5' to 3' direction. DNA polymerase binds to the 3' end of single strand template DNA and moves in a 3' to 5' direction, adding nucleic acids that are complementary to the template (eg, adding A where there is a T on the template and C where there is a G), joining the bases in the nascent (growing) strand to each other by phosphodiester bonds.
        </p>
        <p>
         Both strands of the double helix serve as templates. However, because they are antiparallel, one strand has its 3' end exposed and the other has its 5' end exposed:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The orientation of the antisense strand (3' to 5') is amenable to generation of a continuous new DNA strand that grows in a 5' to 3' direction. This strand is referred to as the leading strand.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The orientation of the sense strand (5' to 3') is opposite of the direction that the polymerase moves. Thus, messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis occurs discontinuously, in short fragments (referred to as Okazaki fragments) that are synthesized in a 3' to 5' direction and then joined together by DNA ligase. This strand is termed the lagging strand.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Each newly formed strand base-pairs with its template to produce a new double helical molecule. Thus, each new DNA molecule contains one old and one newly synthesized strand. This is referred to as semi-conservative replication. Special modifications of the original DNA molecule allow the cell to recognize which strand is new, which facilitates correction of errors introduced during the replication process [
         <a href="#rid3">

         ].

        <p>
         DNA replication in eukaryotes occurs with high fidelity, with an estimated error rate of 1 in 10
         <sup>
          9
         </sup>
         to 1 in 10
         <sup>
          11
         </sup>
         (can vary by location in the genome). These low error rates reflect the low intrinsic DNA polymerase error rates of 1 in 10
         <sup>
          5
         </sup>
         along with the actions of cellular proofreading machinery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite this high degree of fidelity, DNA replication is not perfect, and variations from the template can occur. Errors in DNA replication tend to produce sequence variants, some of which are clinically impactful and others that do not appear to have a deleterious or advantageous effect. (See

Disease variants in these homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes compromise the ability of cells to repair double-strand DNA breaks, increasing risks for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.

         Asymmetric divisions create two daughter cells with different properties or different fates. This can occur when cellular contents are partitioned unequally (eg, one daughter cell receives more organelles or a different membrane compartment than the other) or if a stochastic process (random chance) results in divergent fates.

         Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that produces haploid (1n) daughter cells to form the gametes (egg and sperm), which in turn combine with the gametes of a genetically distinct individual to produce offspring that are genetically different from both parents.

         Meiosis starts similarly to mitosis, with DNA replication followed by chromosome condensation, pairing, synapsis (alignment of homologous chromosomal regions), and recombination, followed by segregation to two daughter cells. This first step, which separates homologous chromosomes, is referred to as meiosis I (MI). MI involves the critical step that results in reduction of chromosome number, making meiosis distinct from mitosis. While mitosis ends with the production of two diploid daughter cells, in meiosis there is a second cell division without an intervening DNA replication step, producing four haploid daughter cells  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61539" href="/z/d/graphic/61539.html" rel="external">
          figure 7

         ). This second stage in which sister chromatids are separated is referred to as meiosis II.

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Another major difference from mitosis is that in meiosis, chromosomal segments are exchanged between the sister chromatids via the process of recombination (also called meiotic crossing over) during meiosis I. Homologous chromosome regions from the maternally derived and paternally derived chromosomes are traded, and the new material is incorporated  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59656" href="/z/d/graphic/59656.html" rel="external">
          figure 8
         </a>
         ). This results in new haplotypes (combinations of genes on a single chromosome) that were not present in the maternal or paternal cells.

         </span>
         Independent assortment, where pairs of homologous chromosomes are divided randomly so the haploid cell contains a mixture of the organism's maternal and paternal chromosomes and genes, is another critical part of meiosis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52882" href="/z/d/graphic/52882.html" rel="external">
          figure 9A

         ). Recombination further enhances diversity as pieces of the DNA are broken and then recombined. Errors can happen if this recombination has a breakpoint across a gene. The closer two alleles or genes are, the lower the recombination rate is. When there are two or more loci that do not appear to randomly associate, they are said to be in linkage disequilibrium. (See

         During oocyte formation, cell division is asymmetric, such that only one of the resulting cells becomes an oocyte; the three other cells become polar bodies that eventually degenerate. The hormonal and anatomical regulation spermatogenesis is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7474.html" rel="external">

         Recombination coupled with independent assortment of chromosomes yields further variation in the final genotype of the gametes. Together with sexual reproduction, these forces ensure genetic diversity in the population.

        <p>
         However, errors in the fidelity of these processes can cause structural variations that may be present in the offspring. Examples include trisomies due to nondisjunction of paired sister chromatids, or duplications or deletions due to defective recombination events. (See

         A chromosomal translocation occurs when a portion of one chromosome becomes fused with a portion of a non-homologous chromosome (a chromosome other than the paired sister chromatid)  (

          figure 10

         ). Balanced translocations are not associated with any net gain or loss of chromosomal material; unbalanced translocations can be associated with gains or losses of chromosomal material.
        </p>
        <p>
         Translocations can result in an inappropriately positioned regulatory sequence and aberrant gene expression, or juxtaposition of two coding sequences, to produce novel fusion genes. A commonly used example of the latter is the translocation associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This is a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)(q34;q11)], referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome  (

         Ring chromosomes can form when the two ends of a chromosome become fused, creating a circular structure. This can occur following chromosome breakage and loss of material at the ends of both the 'p' and 'q' arms of the same chromosome, which then become joined together.

         A copy number variant (CNV) refers to a nucleotide sequence, typically of greater than 1000 bases to millions of bases in length, which varies in copy number between different individuals. A deleted region is termed a loss; regions that are duplicated one or more times are termed duplications or gains. CNVs may cause clinically relevant phenotypic effects related to changes in gene expression, or they may be clinically silent. (See

          Array CGH
         </strong>
         – Array comparative genome hybridization (array CGH, also referred to as chromosomal microarray) is a method of assaying for copy number variations (CNVs) that uses hybridization of patient DNA to an array of normal or control DNA. The size of the probes on the array can be modified to assay small changes (as small as single nucleotides) to larger regions of DNA. Most microarrays are also performed with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis that enables detection of regions of loss of heterozygosity and uniparental isodisomy; these are referred to as SNP arrays.

          Basic biology
         </strong>
         – Chromosome structure facilitates packaging of a massive amount of DNA (nearly two meters in length if stretched end-to-end) into the cell nucleus, a compaction to nearly one 1-millionth of the original length. Each chromosome has a central constriction (the centromere) flanked by two arms (p [the short arm] and q [the long arm]). Telomeres are the regions at the end of the chromosome arms that protect them from loss of chromosomal material or fusion with another chromosome. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Chromosome organization'

          Ploidy
         </strong>
         – Most somatic cells are diploid (2n), containing two sets of 23 chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes (44 autosomes and two sex chromosomes). The germ cells (egg and sperm) are haploid. Examples of normal (physiologic) and pathologic increases in chromosome number are provided above. (See

          DNA replication
         </strong>
         – DNA is replicated during the S (synthesis) phase of the cell cycle. Both strands of the double helix serve as templates. The fidelity of DNA replication is extremely high. (See

          Mitosis
         </strong>
         – Cellular components, including replicated chromosomes, are partitioned to daughter cells during mitosis. Mitosis proceeds in phases regulated by a series of checkpoints that ensure each step is completed before the next one begins  (

          Chromosomal variation
         </strong>
         – Categories of large-scale chromosomal variations include aneuploidies, deletions, inversions, translocations, and copy number variants. Abnormalities of chromosome segregation in the germline can lead to autosomal trisomies such as trisomy 21 or sex-chromosome abnormalities such as Turner syndrome or Klinefelter syndrome. Abnormal chromosome number or structure affecting somatic cells is characteristic of many cancers. (See
