         The dome-shaped diaphragm is the chief muscle of inspiration and the most powerful of the inspiratory muscles [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. The diaphragm also serves as a mechanical barrier and maintains the pressure gradient between the abdominal and thoracic cavities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diaphragm paralysis can be unilateral or bilateral. Although less commonly encountered, bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is a severe form of respiratory muscle weakness that needs prompt evaluation and management. The causes and diagnostic evaluation of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in adults will be reviewed here. The evaluation of respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease, the evaluation and management of unilateral diaphragm paralysis, and the management of bilateral diaphragm paralysis are reviewed separately.

          ETIOLOGY

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The causes of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are similar to those of unilateral involvement  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef135019" href="/z/d/graphic/135019.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). However, the proportional likelihood of each of the causes is different.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common causes of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are conditions that affect the spinal cord and motor neurons (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), systemic conditions associated with generalized weakness (eg, Guillain Barré, myasthenia gravis), and primary myopathies (eg, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, muscular dystrophy) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-7
         </a>
         ]. Some cases are idiopathic. While in most settings, the underlying systemic illness is evident, sometimes, the diaphragm is the initial or only muscle involved [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ].

         <strong>
          Spinal cord disease
         </strong>
         – Permanent diaphragmatic paralysis occurs in patients with destructive processes involving the cervical spine (C3 through C5), such as large tumors and spinal cord transection due to trauma. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5119.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Motor neuron disease
         </strong>
         – The degree of diaphragm paralysis or paresis with motor neuron disease is generally in proportion to the degree of generalized muscle weakness (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). (See

         <strong>
          Neuropathy
         </strong>
         – A number of neuropathies are associated with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, including post-polio syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome, post-viral neuropathy, and thyroid and autoimmune diseases [
         <a href="#rid10">

         Severe decompensation due to post-polio syndrome is unusual. However, some patients with post-polio syndrome do not develop new respiratory symptoms until many years after the initial infection. It is unclear whether such progression is due to motor neuron damage or reflects an axonal process. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5143.html" rel="external">

         </span>
         In patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, the consequences of diaphragmatic paralysis are often magnified by the coexistent weakness of other ventilatory muscles, but the condition is often reversible. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5137.html" rel="external">

         Thyroid disease (hyper- and hypothyroidism) can cause reversible respiratory muscle weakness through both neuropathic and myopathic mechanisms. (See

         In some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, the radiographic appearance of an elevated diaphragms, called the "shrinking lung syndrome," may be due to phrenic nerve involvement, although the precise etiology of this clinical disorder remains unknown and may be multifactorial. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4681.html" rel="external">

         Rare causes include critical care neuromyopathy where diaphragmatic weakness may be disproportionately worse than peripheral weakness and other rare neuropathic disorders. (See

          Neuromuscular junction disease

         Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myopathy comprise the inflammatory myopathies, which can all be associated with diaphragmatic weakness. Diaphragmatic weakness is generally in proportion to the degree of skeletal muscle weakness. However, occasionally the diaphragm is disproportionately affected. (See

          Orthopnea
         </strong>
         – Patients with chronic bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis typically present with dyspnea that worsens in the supine position (ie, orthopnea). In most patients it is an anticipated presentation associated with the presence of a known underlying disease while less commonly, it is the primary manifestation of an underlying disease [

         Orthopnea is frequently misinterpreted as a sign of heart failure. However, the onset of orthopnea from bilateral diaphragm paralysis is dramatic, occurring within minutes of recumbency, and associated with tachypnea and rapid shallow breathing. In contrast, orthopnea due to heart failure usually develops more gradually over the course of the night. (See

          Examination
         </strong>
         – Close observation of the breathing pattern typically shows tachypnea, short shallow breathing, and paradoxical abdominal wall retraction (instead of normal protrusion) during inspiration; the latter is due to elevation of the anterior rib cage by accessory muscles, best appreciated when the patient is supine. Air entry is limited in both lung fields and dullness to percussion may be noted at the lung bases.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The appearance of respiratory distress and accessory muscle use may be variable, depending on the severity of paralysis and co-existence of accessory muscle weakness. As an example, patients with severe paralysis and involvement of accessory muscles may not be able to generate sufficient respiratory rate or tidal volume to give the appearance of distress; therefore, the threshold to obtain arterial blood gas analysis should be low. (See
         <a class="local">

         Care must be taken in assessing abdominal wall motion in patients who are actively exhaling. In these individuals, contraction of the lateral oblique abdominal muscles during expiration and subsequent relaxation of these muscles during inspiration may give the appearance of outward motion of the anterior abdominal wall during inspiration. To observe this phenomenon, we palpate under the costal margins to look for poor or no caudad (ie, downward) motion of the upper quadrant organs during inspiration.

         In patients with suspected bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, we obtain an upright, inspiratory, anteroposterior and lateral chest radiograph and chest computed tomography (CT) to assess the position and contour of the diaphragm and to exclude parenchymal lung processes that might be causing the patient's symptoms. We also perform sniff testing to look for diaphragm movement with inspiration. However, these tests are less useful than in patients with unilateral disease. (See

In patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, smooth elevation of both hemidiaphragms and small lung volumes is usually seen. The costophrenic sulci are deep and narrow. The lateral view confirms a smooth contour and elevated diaphragmatic position with deep and narrow and costovertebral sulci. Plate-like atelectasis may also be present, usually at the lung bases  (

         Diaphragmatic paralysis leads to atrophy of the diaphragmatic crus which can be appreciated on CT. Measurement of the crus at the level of the L1 vertebra on CT has been shown to be helpful in the detection of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis but there is limited information on its potential role in the diagnosis of bilateral paralysis [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

        </p>
        <p>
         CT also helps to exclude other competing diagnoses that are associated with elevation of the diaphragm including sub-diaphragm or sub-pulmonic processes (eg, bilateral pleural effusion or thickening, ascites, bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, lobectomy, or pneumonia). (See

         This test involves fluoroscopic imaging of the diaphragm during a sniff maneuver. During rapid inspiration, no movement of the paralyzed hemidiaphragms supports the diagnosis of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, fluoroscopic sniff testing can be misleading in this population because accessory muscle use during inspiration may result in the cephalad (upward) movement of the ribs to give the false appearance of caudad (downward) displacement of the diaphragm [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,21

         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         seen in unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, where the sniff fluoroscopy test is positive in over 90 percent of cases. Thus, while a test that shows no caudad (ie, downward) movement of the diaphragm during inspiration is helpful, one that shows some movement does not rule of the possibility of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         While ultrasonography during the sniff maneuver allows assessment of diaphragm movement (and thickness) in patients with bilateral diaphragm weakness, the same limitation as that listed for fluoroscopic sniff testing exists. In addition, the field of view may be limited, and the technique requires operator expertise. However, it may provide useful in patients who are intubated or severely impaired who cannot co-operate with fluoroscopic testing. (See

          22,23
         </a>
         ]. This is due to cephalad (ie, upward) displacement of abdominal contents without the normal concomitant increase in diaphragmatic tone that occurs during supination.

         Many patients are diagnosed with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis with standard testing including history and examination, plain chest radiography, chest computed tomography (CT), sniff testing, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), tests of respiratory muscle strength, and arterial blood gas analysis. However, in patients with equivocal findings in whom a diagnosis cannot be confidently made, we perform specific diaphragmatic testing that is targeted at measuring diaphragm function and innervation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Specific diaphragmatic tests'

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with suspected bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are more likely to require specific diaphragmatic testing compared with patients with suspected unilateral disease because noninvasive tests are less helpful diagnostically in the setting of bilateral disease. Furthermore, patients with bilateral disease are more likely to be evaluated for diaphragmatic pacing, for which preoperative diaphragmatic testing is mandatory. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5117.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Magnetometers or inductance plethysmographic coils placed around the abdomen and chest may also provide diagnostic insight by revealing paradoxical chest wall motion during the respiratory cycle, although this technology is rarely used outside a research setting  (

         Specific diaphragmatic tests include transdiaphragmatic pressure measurement (Pdi), diaphragm electromyography (EMG), and phrenic nerve conduction studies (PNCS).
        </p>
        <p>
         These tests are more specific for the diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis but are not routinely performed since the diagnosis can frequently be made without them, they are generally more invasive and therefore come with risk (eg, pneumothorax, lung or esophageal perforation), and their performance can be technically difficult, requiring significant expertise, which is not universally available.
        </p>
        <p>
         If indicated, in many patients, specific diaphragmatic tests can be combined with each other to provide complimentary information regarding diaphragm contraction and innervation and to help distinguish neuropathic from myopathic causes of paralysis  (

          Technique
         </strong>
         – This test is performed via the transnasal placement of two thin-walled balloon-tipped catheters. One is placed in the lower third of the esophagus above the diaphragm to assess changing pleural pressure (Ppl); the location is adjusted to avoid cardiac contraction signals that can modify the tracing [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The second balloon is placed in the stomach, to reflect changing abdominal or gastric pressure (Pga)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80120" href="/z/d/graphic/80120.html" rel="external">
          waveform 1
         </a>
         ). In adults, the distance between the nostril and the tip of the balloon is approximately 35 to 40 cm for the esophageal balloon and 50 to 60 cm for the gastric balloon [
         <a href="#rid27">

         <strong>
          Interpretation
         </strong>
         – The Pdi is the difference between Pga and Ppl (Pdi = Pga – Ppl). The Pdi is generally measured during tidal breathing (Pdi) at end inspiration and is negative in patients with bilateral diaphragm paralysis, but positive if the diaphragm is working normally  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80120" href="/z/d/graphic/80120.html" rel="external">
          waveform 1
         </a>
         ). Thus, a negative value with a paradoxical downward displacement of the gastric wave (ie, negative deflection) provides support for the diagnosis of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. There are no reference values and Pdi cannot distinguish right- from left-sided involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Pdi can also be measured at rest, during tidal breathing at end expiration, as well as with voluntary maneuvers such as a deep breath [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ], a sniff maneuver (sniff Pdi) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,29
         </a>
         ], or a maximal inspiratory force maneuver with airflow limited by a partially closed shutter, that guarantees no airflow (Pdi-max) [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Additionally, Pdi can be measured independent of the patient's effort by electrically stimulating the phrenic nerve (eg, at the level of the neck) and measuring the Pdi (twitch Pdi) [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         The phrenic nerve can be stimulated (eg, at the level of the neck where it passes over the scalene muscle) using percutaneous noninvasive stimulation (typically preoperatively) or using invasive stimulation techniques (typically intraoperatively); the latter is more accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Following stimulation, the ability of the phrenic nerve to conduct a signal (eg, amplitude and duration) and induce diaphragm contraction is assessed. Reduced amplitude and prolongation of phrenic nerve conduction may support a neuropathy while normal amplitude and conduction time supports a myopathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         PNCS can be combined with diaphragmatic EMG, fluoroscopy, ultrasonography, direct visualization, and Pdi to assess the contractile response to stimulation. Further data on nerve conduction studies are provided separately. (See

         Patients with bilateral diaphragmatic weakness who are mechanically ventilated often present with failure to wean rather than other findings discussed above. (See

         In patients who are mechanically ventilated, we adopt a diagnostic approach that is, in principle, similar to that in patients who are spontaneously breathing (see
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic evaluation in spontaneously breathing patients'

         above). However, we modify or delay testing (provided partial or full recovery is expected [eg, pneumonia]) or make a presumptive diagnosis based upon a constellation of clinical findings. In addition, interpreting abnormal test results should take into account the potential impact of mechanical ventilation itself on reducing diaphragm function. The diagnostic value of this approach has not been rigorously studied.

         The sniff maneuver may not be easily performed with fluoroscopy in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting since transport is generally required but may be performed using bedside ultrasonography, provided expertise is available. The sniff maneuver should not be performed during mechanically delivered or pressure-supported breaths to avoid false positive testing. In addition, the patient should be alert enough to follow commands needed for the maneuver. (See

         Performing a full set of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in the supine and sitting position and comprehensive respiratory muscle strength testing are not feasible in a ventilated patient. As an alternative, a hand-held bedside spirometer can be used to obtain a rudimentary forced vital capacity.

         Specific diaphragm studies (eg, transdiaphragmatic pressure, diaphragmatic electromyography, phrenic nerve conduction studies) may be feasible in intubated patients. However, the same limitations as in spontaneously breathing patients exist and the interpretation is hindered by many interfering signals and neuromechanical uncoupling. For example, measurements of transdiaphragmatic pressure should not be taken during a ventilator-delivered breath. (See

         In many patients with neuromuscular disorders known to be associated with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, there is sufficient information from the clinical history, chest radiography, sniff testing, spirometry, arterial blood gas analysis, and respiratory muscle strength testing that a diagnosis can be confidently made without further testing. However, further testing may be needed for the following:

         For patients in whom the diagnosis is in doubt (eg, equivocal test results) or in whom surgery is planned, we typically require specific diaphragm testing to make the diagnosis. A negative value for transdiaphragmatic pressures (Pdi) at end inspiration and an absent signal on diaphragm electromyography (EMG) support the diagnosis of bilateral diaphragm paralysis. Bilateral phrenic nerve conduction studies (PNCS) can further support the diagnosis and may help distinguish a neuropathic (abnormal PNCS) or myopathic (normal PNCS) reason for diaphragmatic paralysis.

         For patients in whom other etiologies of elevated hemidiaphragms or conditions that mimic respiratory neuromuscular weakness need to be confidently excluded, we perform additional testing (eg, chest computed tomography for interstitial lung disease, echocardiography for heart failure, polysomnography for sleep disordered breathing).

         In patients who are intubated and in whom only limited testing can be performed, we sometimes make a provisional diagnosis of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis based upon an appropriate clinical setting (eg, transection of the cervical cord, Guillain Barré syndrome, and acute myasthenia gravis) together with one or more rudimentary bedside tests (ultrasonography, spirometry, negative inspiratory pressure [NIF]) and an inability to wean from mechanical ventilation.

         In many patients with bilateral paralysis (particularly those who have manifestations of sleep disorder while on mechanical ventilation), we perform polysomnography to look for sleep disordered breathing that can complicate paralysis, so that the specific disorder can be identified and treated accordingly.

         Since most patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are at risk of or have clinical manifestations of sleep disordered breathing and need ventilatory support (eg, noninvasive ventilation), we typically obtain overnight polysomnography  (

         ) prior to or at the same time as initiating noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Additional rationale for polysomnography is that ventilatory support during sleep may require an alternative approach than that required during the day (eg, continuous positive pressure during sleep and bilevel positive pressure during the day).

         We do not perform overnight pulse oximetry since it is not an adequate test to screen for or diagnose sleep-disordered breathing in these patients, as it underestimates the degree of hypoventilation and sleep disturbance.

          Etiology
         </strong>
         – The diaphragm is the most powerful of the inspiratory muscles. The most common conditions associated with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are those that affect the spinal cord and motor neurons (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and systemic conditions (eg, Guillain Barré, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, muscular dystrophy); some cases are idiopathic  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). While in most settings, the underlying systemic illness is evident, sometimes, the diaphragm is the initial or only muscle involved and an underlying cause may not be apparent. (See

         Reasonable exclusion of other etiologies that can cause bilateral diaphragm elevation (eg, obesity, subpulmonic or subdiaphragmatic disorders, diaphragm eventration, pleural adhesions) or mimic respiratory muscle weakness (eg, restrictive lung disorders, poor effort, heart failure, disorders associated with hypercapnia). Further testing including chest computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography may be needed to distinguish these conditions. (See

          Diagnosis in doubt or considering diaphragm pacing
         </strong>
         – For patients in whom the diagnosis is in question or in whom diaphragm pacing is being considered, we perform specific diaphragm testing that is targeted at measuring diaphragm function and innervation. This includes transdiaphragmatic pressure measurement (Pdi), diaphragm electromyography (EMG), and phrenic nerve conduction studies (PNCS). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic evaluation in spontaneously breathing patients'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         These tests are generally more invasive and therefore come with risk (eg, pneumothorax, lung or esophageal perforation), and their performance can be technically difficult, requiring significant expertise, which is not universally available.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In many patients, these tests can be combined with each other by providing complimentary information regarding diaphragm contraction and distinguishing neuropathic from myopathic causes and left-sided from right-sided disease.

          Patients who are intubated
         </strong>
         – In patients who are invasively mechanically ventilated, we adopt a diagnostic approach that is similar to that in patients who are spontaneously breathing. However, ventilator-dependence may interfere with the performance and interpretation of standard tests that are typically used to make the diagnosis. Modifying testing (eg, use of bedside ultrasonography, spirometry, and negative inspiratory forced maneuver) or delaying testing (ie, resolution of pneumonia) or making a presumptive diagnosis based upon a constellation of clinical findings are reasonable alternatives.

         <a class="local">

          Follow-up
         </strong>
         – For those in whom an underlying etiology is unknown, we advise additional further testing directed by the suspicion for an underlying disorder. We also typically obtain overnight polysomnography prior to or at the same time as initiating nocturnal noninvasive ventilation (NIV), since patients with ventilatory disorders may have coexistent sleep disturbances that require an alternate therapeutic approach  (
