         Pain of the Achilles tendon commonly affects both competitive and recreational athletes as well as the sedentary patient. The largest tendon in the body, the Achilles tendon, endures strain and risks rupture from running, jumping, and sudden acceleration or deceleration. Overuse, vascular diseases, neuropathy, and rheumatologic diseases may cause tendon degeneration. The hallmarks of Achilles tendon problems seem to be damaged, weak, and inelastic tissue.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will discuss the mechanism, diagnosis, and management of Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture. A general discussion of treatments for tendinopathy is provided separately. (See

         "Tendonitis," "tendinosis," "tendinopathy," "paratendinitis," "enthesopathy," and "insertional tendonitis" are among the terms used to characterize acute or chronic tendon pain. The common term "tendonitis" is confusing because inflammation is often not seen on histopathology. Throughout this review, we will use the term "tendinopathy" to refer to acute and chronic pain associated with an Achilles tendon injury other than tendon tear or rupture. (See

         Achilles tendinopathy affects competitive and recreational athletes as well as people who are not active [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of Achilles tendon rupture in the general population is approximately 5 to 10 per 100,000, but may be higher in some regions and populations, and is increasing overall [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5
         </a>
         ]. Over 80 percent of ruptures occur during recreational sports. Approximately 10 percent of patients who sustain an Achilles tendon rupture had preexisting Achilles tendon problems [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Observational data suggest that competitive athletes have a lifetime incidence of Achilles tendinopathy of 24 percent, with 18 percent sustained by athletes younger than 45 years [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Tendon rupture occurs in 8.3 percent of competitive athletes. Among competitive runners, the lifetime incidence of Achilles tendinopathy may be as high as 40 to 50 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Competitive athletes with a high lifetime incidence of tendon rupture include sprinters (18 percent), decathletes (17 percent), soccer players (17 percent), track and field jumpers (12 percent), basketball players (12 percent), and ice hockey players (9 percent) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Achilles tendinopathy in recreational runners, although less likely to involve rupture, accounts for 6 to 17 percent of all running injuries [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Military recruits develop tendinopathy at a rate of 6.8 percent [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although evidence is limited, a number of conditions may be associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendinopathy [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Cold-weather training is associated with higher rates of tendon pain generally and Achilles tendinopathy specifically [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. A prior history of tendinopathy, foot misalignment, poor running mechanics (eg, excessive supination, inadequate dorsiflexion), inappropriate footwear, weakness in plantarflexion, and leg-length discrepancy are associated with Achilles tendinopathy [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Age, male sex, and obesity are risk factors for Achilles tendon problems  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81284" href="/z/d/graphic/81284.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The peak age for rupture is 30 to 40 years for both men and women; this may be when degenerative changes and occasional high stress from sports coincide. Rupture is four to five times more common in men than women [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. As participation in recreational sports has increased over the past 50 years, so has the rate of tendon rupture [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are rarely associated with Achilles tendinopathy or tendon rupture [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,15
         </a>
         ]. A study of 46,776 patients treated with fluoroquinolones found 3.2 cases of tendon problems for every 1000 years of exposure [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. According to a large case-control study, the incidence of tendon rupture associated with fluoroquinolone therapy is estimated at 12 per 100,000 treatment episodes (odds ratio [OR] 1.3; 95% CI 1.0-1.8) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. The risk of suffering an Achilles tendon rupture is increased threefold during the first 90 days among patients taking a fluoroquinolone for the first time [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The mechanism remains unknown. According to a questionnaire study of 42 patients, symptoms typically develop within one week of initiating treatment (median 6 days; range 1 to 510 days), while the majority (85 to 93 percent) of patients report symptoms within one month [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Among symptomatic patients without tendon rupture, most reported recovery within two months of discontinuing the fluoroquinolone, but in approximately one quarter pain and disability persisted. Age older than 60 years and concurrent use of systemic glucocorticoids appear to compound the risk [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,20-22
         </a>
         ]. Past fluoroquinolone use does not appear to confer future risk. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/490.html" rel="external">
          "Fluoroquinolones", section on 'Tendinopathy'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Oral glucocorticoids alone increase the risk of tendinopathy, although studies estimating the precise risk in primary care populations are lacking. Local glucocorticoid injection causes tendon damage in animal models, and there are case reports in humans of tendon rupture following glucocorticoid injection [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In women, hypertension is associated with Achilles tendinopathy [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Other diseases associated with tendinopathy include psoriasis and ankylosing spondylosis [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Heel pain is rarely the presenting symptom in patients with these systemic diseases [

         The soleus and gastrocnemius muscles converge to form the Achilles tendon, which inserts posteriorly on the calcaneus  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58376" href="/z/d/graphic/58376.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

          figure 3
         </a>
         ). Contraction of these muscles, along with the actions of the tibialis posterior and peroneus longus and brevis, causes the foot to plantarflex. The subcutaneous and subtendinous (or retrocalcaneal) calcaneal bursae cushion the insertion area anteriorly and posteriorly. Most pain and tendon ruptures occur where the blood supply of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle complex is poorest, 2 to 6 cm above the insertion point. A peritendinous sheath of connective tissue allows the tendon to slide relative to surrounding tissue.

          MECHANISM OF INJURY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Acute Achilles tendon pain generally develops when athletes abruptly increase their activity (eg, runners who start training for a marathon). Chronic tendon pain (&gt;3 months) may result from sustained stress, poor running mechanics (eg, supination, heel misalignment), or improper footwear [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,26
         </a>
         ]. Some experts claim a role for excessive pronation in Achilles tendinopathy among runners, but others dispute this.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recurrent microtrauma causes degeneration of the Achilles tendon [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,27
         </a>
         ]. The relative hypovascularity of the tendon 2 to 6 cm from its insertion point may prevent adequate healing. Although inflammation is often not seen on histopathology, clinical signs similar to those seen with inflammation (such as swelling, warmth, and pain) may occur. Damaged tendons become calcified, thickened, inelastic, and fibrotic. Abnormal neovascularization of tissue may be seen on ultrasound. Aging and vascular disease decrease collagen density, break collagen cross-links, and reduce the elasticity of the tendon sheath and tendon itself. Rupture occurs when a sudden shear stress (eg, cutting during a basketball game) is applied to an already weakened or degenerative tendon. The pathophysiology of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         Patients with Achilles tendinopathy typically complain of pain or stiffness 2 to 6 cm above the posterior calcaneus. They are likely to be casual or competitive athletes who have increased their training regimen beyond their tendon's ability to heal the microtrauma from repetitive stress, or who have been training rigorously for a long time. A history of excessive supination, increased speed work or hill training, or improper or worn out footwear may be found.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pain is usually described as burning. The pain is worse with activity and may be relieved after a period of rest.

         Tendon rupture occurs when sudden forces are exerted upon the Achilles tendon during strenuous physical activities that involve sudden pivoting on a foot or rapid acceleration (eg, stop-and-go sports such as tennis, basketball, or softball). Many patients feel as if they were struck violently in the back of the ankle. Some hear a "pop" and experience severe, acute pain, although the absence of pain does not rule out rupture. As an example, a small case series found that one-third of patients with tendon rupture did not report pain [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. In contrast to ankle sprains, where injury occurs with landing, symptom onset with tendon rupture generally occurs as the patient is pushing off with their foot.

         Examination of the Achilles tendon is usually straightforward because the tendon is easily identified and palpated. However, potential pitfalls exist  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70182" href="/z/d/graphic/70182.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Of note, a sizable minority of patients with complete tendon rupture are able to ambulate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients should be examined lying prone with their feet hanging off the end of the examination table. Inspect the region of the Achilles tendon for bruising (blood tracking beneath the malleolus suggests fracture, sprain, or tendon rupture), swelling, and foot misalignment. Assess patients for signs of peripheral artery disease, such as decreased pulsations, decreased capillary refill in the heel or toes, loss of hair, increased skin pigmentation, or edema.
        </p>
        <p>
         Palpate the Achilles tendon for tenderness, thickening, or a defect, recognizing that edema or a hematoma may mask such a defect. Palpation has a sensitivity of approximately 73 percent and a specificity of 89 percent in detecting a partial tendon tear [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Comparison to the unaffected side is useful.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with tendinopathy typically have localized tenderness 2 to 6 cm proximal to the insertion of the tendon  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91862" href="/z/d/graphic/91862.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). By comparison, tenderness around the insertion point near the heel suggests either subcutaneous calcaneal bursitis or enthesopathy (pathology of tendon at its insertion) [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Warmth and tenderness localized to the soft tissue anterior to the area where the Achilles inserts suggests subcutaneous bursitis, although this condition is uncommon. Focal tenderness of the tendon itself in the area where it inserts suggests enthesopathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The tendon should be palpated as the patient dorsiflexes and plantarflexes the foot, as well as when the ankle is stationary in a neutral position. The presence of crepitus with motion suggests tendinopathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Isolating the subtendinous bursa (ie, retrocalcaneal bursa) and palpating it for tenderness may identify bursitis. We perform this examination as follows: Grasp the Achilles tendon with the fingers of one hand and move the tendon side to side. Bursitis should not cause pain when only the tendon is palpated. Next, with the index finger on the opposite hand, apply gentle pressure deep to the tendon. Continue to grasp the tendon with the other hand to be certain you are palpating the bursa and not the tendon. Local warmth and tenderness deep to the tendon with light pressure suggests that the subtendinous (or retrocalcaneal) bursa is inflamed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Examine the patient's footwear, looking for signs of excessive breakdown (eg, disproportionate wear on the inner or outer edge) or other evidence of poor running mechanics. Examine the architecture of the patient's foot. The presence of flat feet (pes planus), heel malalignment, high arches (pes cavus), or leg-length discrepancy can contribute to poor running mechanics [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. If possible, assess the patient's gait or running stride, looking for abnormalities or asymmetry.

         ). To perform the test, the patient either lies prone, with their feet hanging off the end of the examination table, or kneels on a chair. The clinician squeezes the gastrocnemius muscle belly while watching for plantarflexion. The absence of plantarflexion when squeezing the gastrocnemius muscle marks a positive test, indicative of rupture.
        </p>
        <p>
         The calf squeeze test is a more reliable indication of tendon rupture than the inability to plantarflex, since patients may be able to plantarflex the foot using accessory muscles (eg, tibialis posterior, peroneals). Achilles tendon ruptures can be missed at the initial visit because the clinician was falsely reassured by the patient's ability to plantarflex or walk.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a series of 174 patients with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral complete Achilles tendon tear and 28 patients with unilateral suspected (but no actual) Achilles tendon tear, the Thompson test had a sensitivity of 96 percent and a specificity of 93 percent, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound as a gold standard [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. A negative test can miss up to 10 percent of ruptures (assuming a 75 percent pretest probability of rupture). Thus, confirmatory testing such as diagnostic ultrasound or MRI is useful when the Thompson test is negative but clinical suspicion remains high.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Matles test is another means of assessing Achilles tendon rupture. To perform the test, the patient lies prone with knees flexed to 90 degrees. Observe whether the affected foot is dorsiflexed or neutral (both are abnormal) compared with the uninjured side, where the foot should appear plantarflexed. The sensitivity and specificity of the Matles test was 88 percent and 85 percent, respectively, in the above study [

         Achilles tendinopathy (without rupture) is a clinical diagnosis. Imaging is generally not necessary except to rule out other conditions, such as a stress fracture or tendon rupture.
        </p>
        <p>
         Plain radiographs are generally unhelpful in the assessment of Achilles tendon pathology but may reveal a heel spur or bony bump (called a Haglund's deformity or "pump bump") consistent with both tendinopathy and calcaneal bursitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ultrasound imaging is increasingly used to assess tendon appearance and function [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Ultrasound may reveal normal tendon, tendon thickening  (

         ), or signs of more significant tendon pathology, such as neovessels, hypoechogenicity, disordered fibers, tissue gaps, and fluid  (

         <a href="#rid32">
          32,33
         </a>
         ]. In addition to midportion Achilles tendinopathy, ultrasound can reveal enthesopathy or avulsion injuries at the distal portion of the tendon  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef121511" href="/z/d/graphic/121511.html" rel="external">
          image 3
         </a>
         ). Ultrasound can also help to distinguish between Achilles tendon injury and other pathology  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91863" href="/z/d/graphic/91863.html" rel="external">
          image 4
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Achilles tendon rupture may be diagnosed solely by clinical examination, but ultrasound enables rapid bedside confirmation of the diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,32
         </a>
         ]. Although published data are limited, in experienced hands, ultrasound appears to be an accurate tool for diagnosing Achilles tendon tear and distinguishing between partial and complete tears. As an example, ultrasound was reported to have 100 percent sensitivity, 83 percent specificity, and 92 percent accuracy for distinguishing between partial and full thickness Achilles tendon tears, using surgical findings as the gold standard [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. In addition, dynamic ultrasound can demonstrate whether tendon fragments come into contact during active plantarflexion or separate further during passive dorsiflexion. It is important to perform the ultrasound evaluation in two planes, atypically involving sagittal and transverse views. Visualized lack of continuity of tendon fibers is an indication for surgical repair.
        </p>
        <p>
         Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used to assess musculoskeletal complaints and is the study of choice when tendon rupture is suspected and high-quality diagnostic ultrasound is unavailable. MRI provides greater anatomic detail and greater accuracy in detecting partial Achilles tendon tears [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. With tendinopathy, MRI may demonstrate an increased T2-weighted signal in the tendon or an increased tendon diameter [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. In addition, MRI may reveal alternative explanations for patient symptoms, such as enlarged calcaneal bursae [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Neither ultrasound nor MRI findings appear to correlate closely with clinically significant chronic Achilles tendinopathy. In one small prospective study, ultrasound detected abnormal morphology in 37 of 57 symptomatic Achilles tendons, while MRI detected abnormalities in 19 of 34 (MRI was performed in a subset of 25 consecutive patients) [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Better baseline MRI appearance was associated with a successful return to sport and symptomatic benefit after 12 months, but baseline ultrasound findings were not. Further study of these diagnostic tests is needed to determine their appropriate role in the management of Achilles tendinopathy.

         Apart from Achilles tendinopathy, pain arising from the region between the posterior calcaneus and the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle complex may be caused by several other conditions  (

         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Differentiating the two can be difficult. In contrast to ankle sprains, where injury occurs with landing, symptom onset with tendon rupture generally occurs as the patient is pushing off with their foot. Do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         assume rupture is absent because the patient can plantarflex their ankle or walk. The tibialis posterior and peroneus longus provide significant strength in plantarflexion and compensate partially for a ruptured Achilles tendon. (See

         Calcaneal bursitis (subcutaneous or subtendinous) typically occurs in middle-aged or older adult patients. Patients may complain of pain where the back of a hard shoe, heel cup, or strap rubs against the heel at the Achilles tendon insertion point. Sports in which athletes wear hard-backed footwear or repeatedly strike their heels against walls (eg, indoor soccer, hockey) may cause bursitis. Bursitis generally resolves with basic measures: heel lifts or posterior padding, avoiding bothersome footwear, rest, ice, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Heel pain may also stem from an injury or strain at the Achilles tendon insertion (ie, enthesopathy).

         Calcaneal apophysitis (ie, Sever disease) is an overuse injury in young athletes aged 8 to 15 years. Patients with calcaneal apophysitis have activity-related pain in the posterior aspect of the heel, which may be unilateral or bilateral. Tenderness is localized to the calcaneal apophysis, usually 1 to 2 cm distal to the Achilles tendon insertion. Symptoms generally resolve within three to six weeks with conservative treatment. (See

         All complete tendon ruptures merit referral for orthopedic consultation. The patient should be evaluated by the surgeon within approximately a day or two of the injury. It is best to discuss the case with the consulting orthopedist as soon as the injury is diagnosed.

        <p>
         A systematic review of treatments for "Achilles tendinitis" published in 2001 identified three small controlled trials comparing oral NSAIDs to placebo [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Although there is no compelling evidence that NSAIDs enable patients to return to full activity sooner [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ], these drugs are a reasonable choice for short-term pain relief in patients with acute Achilles tendinopathy. The role of oral and topical NSAIDs in the treatment of tendinopathy is reviewed separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         A subsequent systematic review of studies looking at the effect of various injections, including glucocorticoids, for the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy found that the studies were of low quality overall, but the results suggest little (if any) benefit from such therapy [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. This conclusion is consistent with studies of glucocorticoid injection for other tendinopathies. In addition, there are case reports of Achilles tendon rupture after glucocorticoid injection in patients with chronic tendinopathy [

          23

        <p>
         Once acute healing has begun, most patients begin some form of rehabilitation. Basic therapy regimens, including such interventions as physical therapy, deep-friction tissue release, and ultrasound, may reduce symptoms over several weeks [

          42

         Chronic Achilles tendinopathy exists when pain persists beyond three months. In addition to the basic interventions for acute exacerbations described above, the treatment of chronic midportion Achilles tendon pain should include a rehabilitation program that emphasizes resistance exercises using heavy loads.

         We suggest that patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy be treated with a rehabilitation program that emphasizes resistance exercises using heavy loads, such as weighted heel raises. Programs that emphasize the eccentric portion of exercise movements or both the eccentric and concentric movements may be used. Tables describing a heavy slow resistance rehabilitation program (emphasizes both concentric and eccentric movement)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103058" href="/z/d/graphic/103058.html" rel="external">
          table 4

        </p>
        <p>
         Concentric exercise involves a muscle shortening while working against a load; eccentric exercise involves a muscle lengthening while working against a load. As an example, when a person raises their body to the bar during a pull-up the biceps muscles are working concentrically, and when the person lowers their body to the ground the biceps muscles are working eccentrically.
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies of rehabilitation programs for chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy that emphasize the eccentric portions of resistance exercise using heavy loads have found this approach to be an effective nonsurgical treatment [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45

          44,45
         </a>

Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies performed during the long-term follow-up of patients who participated in rehabilitation programs involving heavy resistance training of either type (eccentric or combined concentric/eccentric loading) show normalization of tendon tissue [

         Surgical consultation should be obtained for all complete Achilles tendon ruptures. The optimal management of Achilles tendon rupture is controversial. Traditionally, surgical treatment was favored due to the low rates of re-rupture. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that surgery does not lead to better long-term functional outcomes than nonoperative management and is associated with higher rates of some short-term complications (eg, infection), although re-rupture rates are lower [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79,80

         Non-athletes, older adults, and other patients who are not able to participate in early mobilization or accelerated functional rehabilitation may forego surgery and elect to be treated with immobilization. This is done for six to eight weeks using either a short-leg cast starting with the ankle in plantarflexion or a functional brace with a heel lift  (

         Additional high-quality trials comparing treatment approaches for acute Achilles tendon rupture are needed. These trials should include assessments of long-term functional status, including the ability to resume pre-injury work and sports activities, complication rates, and patient satisfaction using validated instruments. Approaches such as minimally invasive surgery merit strong consideration based on a systematic review and meta-analyses that showed equivalent functional outcomes and rerupture rates and a number of advantages [

         The efficacy and safety of surgery compared with nonsurgical management for Achilles tendon rupture is a subject of ongoing debate and research. A growing body of evidence supports a nonoperative approach for appropriately selected patients. A basic rehabilitation program for patients who choose to be treated with functional rehabilitation is provided  (

         A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials (949 Achilles tendons) of good overall quality, with most performing follow-up at 12 months, reported a re-rupture rate of 3.5 percent (n = 17) in the surgery group and 12.1 percent (n = 57) in the non-surgery group (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.18-0.50), with complication rates (excluding re-ruptures) of 18.5 percent (n = 37) in the surgery group and 7.1 percent (n = 4) in the non-surgery group [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84
         </a>
         ]. Episodes of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism were uncommon in both groups, but infections occurred significantly more often in surgical patients (5.6 percent of cases). Some early studies suggested that there was an increased risk of sural nerve injury with minimally invasive surgery [
         <a href="#rid85">
          85
         </a>
         ], but this has not been borne out in subsequent trials [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a well-conducted multicenter trial performed after the meta-analysis, 526 patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture were randomly assigned to nonoperative management, minimally invasive surgical repair, or open surgical repair [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80
         </a>
         ]. The results of this trial were largely consistent with the meta-analysis: While no significant difference was found in functional outcomes overall (determined primarily with the Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score), patients managed nonoperatively did have a higher re-rupture rate (6.2 percent [11 re-ruptures] versus 0.6 percent [1 re-rupture] for each surgical treatment) at 12-month follow-up. The higher re-rupture rate occurred despite following a well-designed, dynamic physical therapy program.

        <p>
         For patients treated with surgery, two to three months off from work that requires ambulation is generally required. Athletes typically return to sport by three to six months, once they have regained adequate strength and mobility. However, additional time is often required to achieve full function [
         <a href="#rid86">
          86
         </a>

According to a systematic review of 10 studies involving 570 patients, the combination of early ankle mobility exercises and early weightbearing was associated with better functional outcomes without differences in major complications compared with the conventional approach to postoperative immobilization [

         operative management of a complete Achilles tendon rupture has involved immobilization in a cast for several weeks. While a well-made cast provides excellent protection and immobilization for healing, it may increase the risk for muscle atrophy, loss of ankle mobility, deep vein thrombosis, and chronic disability. Immobilization in a removable, functional brace is a viable alternative that allows for early use of mobility and strength exercises, as appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         When the clinician and patient opt for nonoperative management of an Achilles tendon rupture, we believe functional bracing is a good treatment approach for highly compliant patients. We hesitate to use a functional brace in a young, active athlete or anyone else likely to stress the tendon before it has healed sufficiently. We generally prefer surgery for such patients. Of note, for functional bracing to work effectively, the elevation of the heel must be systematically lowered about every two weeks. This prevents the tendon from shortening excessively during healing. (See

         In a multicenter randomized trial of 540 patients (the large majority middle aged and healthy) with acute Achilles tendon rupture, there were no statistically or clinically significant differences in the Achilles Tendon Rupture Score, a well-validated outcome score, or tendon re-rupture at nine months [

         The clinical diagnosis of partial Achilles tendon tear or rupture is imperfect, and studies to determine optimal management are lacking.

         Although no studies demonstrate the benefit of eccentric exercise in the prevention of acute Achilles tendon injury, we suggest that patients continue to perform these exercises once rehabilitation has been completed and symptoms have resolved.

         Several interventions may reduce the risk of developing new or recurrent Achilles tendinopathy and other injuries of the lower extremity. Such interventions are discussed in detail separately. Interventions and studies of special relevance to preventing tendinopathy and tendon rupture of the Achilles are described below. (See

         Before engaging in any vigorous exercise, it is important to perform an appropriate dynamic warm-up. Although few studies have assessed the Achilles tendon specifically in this regard, the findings of a prospective, observational study of infantry recruits suggest that performing such a warm-up and avoiding cold-weather training reduces the risk of Achilles tendinopathy [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         ]. Additional support may be helpful for some patients as they resume activity  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical studies evaluating the impact of stretching specifically upon Achilles tendinopathy are lacking. Nevertheless, many clinicians believe imbalances in muscle strength or flexibility predispose some athletes to injury. We believe it is reasonable to include stretching following exercise or a warm-up as part of an Achilles injury prevention regimen. Typical techniques include stretching the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles while bracing one's hands against a wall. Stretches are performed both with the knee bent and straight. The stretch can be performed by standing on the edge of a step and letting the heel descend gradually, or by dorsiflexing the foot using a stretch band. It may be helpful for patients to undergo assessment by an athletic trainer, physical therapist, or sports medicine specialist to identify imbalances in flexibility or strength and to receive instruction in appropriate training techniques.

         Although high body mass index (BMI) is associated with tendon problems, no studies clearly show that weight loss prevents such problems.

          Epidemiology and mechanism of injury
         </strong>
         – Acute Achilles tendon pain generally develops when athletes abruptly increase their training intensity. Chronic tendon pain (&gt;3 months) may result from sustained stress, poor running mechanics, or improper footwear. Rupture occurs when a sudden shear stress is applied to an already weakened or degenerative tendon. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology and risk factors'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Pain arising from the region between the posterior calcaneus and the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle complex may be caused by a number of conditions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76217" href="/z/d/graphic/76217.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Ankle sprain is the most common misdiagnosis when tendon rupture is the actual cause of pain. Do not assume rupture is absent because the patient can plantarflex or walk  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70182" href="/z/d/graphic/70182.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Patients with Achilles tendinopathy typically experience pain or stiffness 2 to 6 cm above the posterior calcaneus. They are likely to be casual or competitive athletes who have recently increased their training intensity. Pain increases with activity and diminishes with a period of rest.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Tendon rupture occurs when sudden forces are exerted upon the Achilles during strenuous activities that involve sudden pivoting on a foot or rapid acceleration. Patients may hear a "pop" and experience severe, acute pain, although the absence of pain does not rule out rupture. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical presentation'

         <strong>
          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – Examination should include palpation of the tendon for tenderness, thickening, or a defect. Note that edema or a hematoma may mask a defect. Patients with tendinopathy typically have localized tenderness 2 to 6 cm above the tendon insertion. Pain at the insertion point suggests calcaneal bursitis or possibly enthesopathy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Physical examination'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The calf squeeze (ie, Thompson compression) test provides an accurate means of detecting complete Achilles tendon rupture  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74412" href="/z/d/graphic/74412.html" rel="external">
          picture 2

         ). A sizable minority of patients with complete tendon rupture are able to ambulate. (See

          Diagnostic imaging
         </strong>
         – Achilles tendinopathy (without rupture) is a clinical diagnosis. Imaging is often unnecessary. Plain radiographs are generally unhelpful. Musculoskeletal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are accurate tests that can be used to aid in the diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture, particularly if examination findings are unclear but clinical suspicion remains high.

          Indications for surgical referral
         </strong>
         – All complete tendon ruptures merit surgical consultation. Partial tendon tears and chronic tendinopathy that fail to improve with three to six months of conservative treatment may benefit from consultation with a specialized runners' clinic, sports medicine specialist, physical therapist, or orthopedic surgeon. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Management of tendinopathy
         </strong>
         – Acute Achilles tendinopathy is treated in standard fashion with rest, ice, and tendon support (eg, heel lift). For chronic midportion tendinopathy (&gt;3 months symptoms), we suggest using a rehabilitation program that emphasizes resistance exercise using heavy loads  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61034" href="/z/d/graphic/61034.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). Rehabilitation protocols that emphasize concentric and eccentric movements or only eccentric movements are both reasonable approaches. Exercise programs and other possible interventions for chronic Achilles tendinopathy are discussed in the text. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Acute tendinopathy'

         <strong>
          Management of tendon tear
         </strong>
         – Surgical consultation should be obtained for all patients with a complete Achilles tendon rupture. The management approach selected will vary based on the patient’s comorbidities, goals, and preferences:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         For active patients who place a high value on regaining preinjury levels of activity quickly and are willing to accept a higher rate of treatment complications (primarily infection), we suggest that Achilles tendon rupture be treated with surgical repair (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). Minimally invasive surgical repair may reduce postoperative complications (eg, infection) without increasing the risk of re-rupture compared with open repair. For some active patients, nonoperative management with accelerated functional rehabilitation may be a reasonable alternative. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Complete tendon rupture'
         </a>
         above.)

          •
         </span>
         Inactive patients and those unwilling to accept the higher complication rates of surgery may opt for nonoperative management with either casting or a brace. For highly compliant patients, treatment with a removable, functional brace allows for earlier performance of progressive mobility and strength exercises, and ultimately earlier weightbearing, without increasing the risk of re-rupture.

          table 6

         ), we suggest that treatment include early mobilization and accelerated functional rehabilitation, regardless of whether they undergo surgery or opt for nonsurgical management (
