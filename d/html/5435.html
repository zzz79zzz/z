CPP is a symptom that can represent pathology in a somatic structure or viscera, central sensitization of pain, or both. After completing an evaluation, identified potential causes of CPP (eg, endometriosis or adnexal mass) are treated with therapy targeted to the specific problem. However, some women will have no identified cause of pain and others will have persistent pain despite treatment of presumed etiologies. Notably, many women will carry a clearly defined diagnosis such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, or surgically documented endometriosis, but have pelvic pain that is not related to their bowel, bladder, or uterine function. Regardless of whether they have met minimum diagnostic criteria for known overlapping pelvic pain conditions, patients who describe persistent CPP that does not respond to syndrome-specific management may benefit from multimodal treatments of CPP of undefined cause. A major goal of treatment is to improve function. </p><p>This topic will present the treatment of the adult woman with residual or undefined CPP. Topics on the causes and evaluation of CPP in adult women, as well as the evaluation of children and adolescents, are presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5490.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in nonpregnant adult females: Causes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5467.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111.html" rel="external">"Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3257382077"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1668368572"><span class="h2">Is there a probable versus unidentified cause of CPP?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The optimal approach to the management of CPP of unclear etiology is not known, in part because the field of CPP lacks well-designed, large-volume trials with appropriate longitudinal follow-up to validate existing treatments, and in part because pain is an end symptom of diverse etiologies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112656" href="/z/d/graphic/112656.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Therefore, the management of CPP is largely based on clinical experience and studies evaluating treatments for other types of chronic pain syndromes (eg, fibromyalgia, back pain, migraine).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Women with CPP associated with a probable etiology</strong> – Initial treatment of pain from a likely etiology is aimed at addressing the presumed cause  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112656" href="/z/d/graphic/112656.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). It is important to note that multiple treatments can be used simultaneously to address the patient's collection of symptoms and dysfunction. There is no one single approach that treats all women with CPP. In our practice: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We offer hormonal therapy to women who have a cyclic component to their pain. (See <a class="local">'Specific role of empiric hormonal therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We offer procedural treatments such as a peripheral nerve block or consider surgical release to women with suspected focal nerve pain from nerve impingement or entrapment. (See <a class="local">'Importance of identifying, classifying, and treating neuropathic pain'</a> below and <a class="local">'When to reverse prior procedure'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We offer a combination of pharmacologic treatment, nonpharmacologic therapy, and procedures to women with myofascial or musculoskeletal pain. The treatment is ordered to address the most severe or bothersome symptoms first. (See <a class="local">'Importance of identifying, classifying, and treating neuropathic pain'</a> below and <a class="local">'Baseline nonsurgical interventions'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5429.html" rel="external">"Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in females: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>When the patient's history and physical examination suggest endometriosis that is either undertreated or has likely recurred (especially deep infiltrating disease), we consider laparoscopic excisional therapy. Key signs that might point to recurrence include a new persistent pelvic mass, tender nodules in the cul de sac, or periuterine tenderness, including the vaginal fornices, especially when associated with new imaging or pelvic examination evidence suggesting restriction or tethering of the pelvic tissues. Similarly, we will consider performing hysterectomy when there is a predominant uterine pain component by history and/or examination and the patient has exhausted a large number of other multimodal treatments. We also caution patients that hysterectomy may not relieve pain, may only partially relieve pain, and, in some cases, can worsen pain or cause a new pain that did not previously exist. (See <a class="local">'Targeted therapies: Surgical'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients whose pain resolves after targeted therapy require no further treatment. Those whose pain persists despite focused treatment are then treated as below. (See <a class="local">'Baseline nonsurgical interventions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>For women with no identified cause or women whose symptoms do not resolve with targeted treatment</strong> – We consider CPP as originating from a somatic structure (eg, muscles, bone) or visceral organ (eg, uterus, ovaries, bladder, bowel) or as a pain amplification syndrome (ie, pain processing issue or neuropathic pain) in women with no identifiable peripheral cause or unresolved CPP in women whose pain does not improve despite therapies that target peripheral pain generators. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Some key principles that we and others follow in treating women with CPP of an undefined cause or persistent CPP despite treatment targeted to pain generators include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ensure a thorough differential diagnosis, based on a detailed history and physical examination, has been developed prior to treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112656" href="/z/d/graphic/112656.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112657" href="/z/d/graphic/112657.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). This step is important to ensure that all potential relevant causes of a woman's pain have been explored.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5467.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Evaluation", section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5467.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Evaluation", section on 'Targeted evaluation based on initial findings'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Avoid the reflexive use of surgical exploration prior to medical or nonpharmacologic therapy. Potential exceptions include women with acute unrelenting pain with signs of peritonitis, poorly controlled pain with a large adnexal mass or high suspicion for deep infiltrating endometriosis with obstructive symptoms, and women seeking to become pregnant imminently [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Some patients, when given the option of initial surgical therapy versus nonsurgical treatment, may express preference for surgery first; patient input is incorporated in choosing the initial therapy. Repetitive surgery for CPP is typically not helpful and could, in some cases, worsen the problem. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5467.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Evaluation", section on 'Role of laparoscopy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Treat pain with a goal of regaining function. Similar to how we approach chronic musculoskeletal pain as described above, we generally employ a multimodal approach to the treatment of nonspecific CPP, as detailed below, that includes nonpharmacologic treatments such as physical therapy, use of medications in a tiered approach, targeted nerve blocks or cutaneous treatments, and empiric therapy with neuromodulators while incorporating principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and psychoeducational approaches [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. We often will use both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies simultaneously. Each treatment approach is tailored to the goals of the individual patient and considers additional factors such as treatment cost and availability. Selective management of comorbid bladder and bowel issues (eg, bladder pain syndrome or irritable bowel syndrome) may be necessary as well. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8087.html" rel="external">"Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome: Management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2631.html" rel="external">"Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Preserve a positive outlook about each patient's prognosis. In our experience, positive expectations on the part of the clinician positively influence the treatment effect. In addition, protective associations have been demonstrated between positive patient affect and experimental pain sensitivity (ie, positive affect has been associated with reduced pain response) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1987126610"><span class="h2">Importance of identifying, classifying, and treating neuropathic pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The International Association for the Study of Pain defines neuropathic pain as "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system" [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Commonly used symptom descriptions include "electric shock," "dull," "itching," and "burning." However, as sensory nerve function can also be altered in the absence of an identifiable lesion or disease, clinical guidelines suggest grading a presentation as "definite," "probable," or "possible" [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. While the intensity of symptoms or categorization of the likelihood that pain is neuropathic does not translate to a validated, stepwise approach to treating these conditions, a reasonable strategy is to identify whether neuropathic pain is suspected to be acute versus chronic. The treatment of presumed neuropathic pain can be done in conjunction with the other treatment modalities discussed in this review.</p><p>We take the following approach:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute neuropathic pain</strong> – Acute neuropathic pain should be suspected when a patient has pain in the distribution of a sensory nerve following a surgery or acute injury. While there is no data-driven definition of acute neuropathic pain, most women present within days to weeks of the inciting event. In these cases, we aim to reduce the pain symptoms while resolving the underlying nerve insult, if possible. One goal of treatment is to prevent the development of cortical changes that perpetuate pain expression and become chronic neuropathic pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For women who have undergone an index surgical procedure and have severe symptoms strongly suggestive of a specific peripheral nerve injury or irritation, the risk-benefit balance generally favors a rapid return to the OR to attempt to remedy a nerve injury. One example is releasing the lateral lower quadrant laparoscopic fascial closure suture(s) following prior surgery performed in the ilioinguinal or iliohypogastric distributions (L1-2). Some clinicians will perform a steroid block (ie, nerve block) for pain in the pudendal nerve distribution following uterosacral vaginal vault suspension, and then proceed to surgery if the patient does not significantly improve in 48 to 72 hours. (See <a class="local">'When to reverse prior procedure'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2882.html" rel="external">"Nerve injury associated with pelvic surgery"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For women with mild symptoms following a procedure, or symptoms without an antecedent procedure, we typically prescribe centrally-acting neuromodulator agents (ie, antiepileptics, tricyclic antidepressants, or serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) along with anesthetic injections or topical anesthetics, such as a <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> patch. Any of the centrally acting agents listed below are appropriate choices for acute pain relief and are titrated to effect. (See <a class="local">'Neuromodulators'</a> below and <a class="local">'Adjuvant therapies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic neuropathic pain</strong> – If the pain is more chronic in nature, such as three to six months duration or longer, we generally begin with a combination of nonpharmacologic therapy, a neuromodulator and possibly a nerve block. In addition, given the often refractory nature of long-standing neuropathic pain, modest improvement that is meaningful may be achieved by encouraging regular movement and mindfulness to avoid patient fixation on the pain site, which is akin to the approach in the trauma literature [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Evidence supporting late nerve release surgery for chronic neuropathic pain is lacking. (See <a class="local">'Baseline nonsurgical interventions'</a> below and <a class="local">'Interventions for central sensitization or neuropathic pain'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2160573777"><span class="h1">BASELINE NONSURGICAL INTERVENTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For women with CPP of unidentified cause or that has not responded to targeted therapy, we offer pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment simultaneously. We may employ these prior to offering a surgical treatment, or afterwards, based on the response. In some cases, treatment may be used for years, if not decades, if they improve quality of life. The rationale is that the optimal treatment or treatment combination for CPP is not known and this approach addresses the multifactorial nature of pain. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H810598250"><span class="h2">Initial pharmacologic treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder, which was developed to guide treatment of cancer pain in adults, suggests initial treatment of chronic pain with nonopioid medications [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. We also use this approach as a baseline intervention in women with CPP because these medications are generally well tolerated, have few side effects and reasonable safety profiles, and are low cost. However, limited data are available in women with CPP, and many patients will have already attempted over-the-counter self-administration without meaningful response. We caution patients about exceeding recommended total daily doses to avoid acute gastritis and kidney or liver damage. In addition to the WHO analgesic ladder, we will often use muscle relaxants as initial therapy as well.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</strong> – NSAIDs are often used in the treatment of chronic pain as they are generally well tolerated, have a safer risk profile than opioid medications, and are low cost. In a meta-analysis of 13 trials assessing the impact of NSAID treatment on low back pain, NSAID use was more effective than placebo at reducing pain intensity scores as measured on a visual analog scale (VAS; mean difference -6.97, 95% CI -10.74 to -3.19, on a 0 to 100 VAS) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. NSAID use is well established in treating pelvic pain related to endometriosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7383.html" rel="external">"Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain", section on 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although many of our patients have tried an NSAID with insufficient response, we still discuss NSAID treatment to ensure that they have had an adequate trial of these medications, defined as an appropriate dose and frequency to achieve a treatment effect. Detailed reviews of the use and adverse effects of NSAIDs are presented elsewhere:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7993.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7989.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pharmacology and mechanism of action"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7991.html" rel="external">"Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7968.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">Acetaminophen</a><strong> </strong>– While acetaminophen is indicated for the treatment of minor aches and pains, such as backache and muscular aches, it does not appear to be helpful for chronic pain syndromes [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. That said, anecdotally, some women find acetaminophen use enhances the pain reduction achieved with other medication(s), such as NSAIDs (the drugs can be alternated). We educate patients about appropriate acetaminophen dosing to minimize risk of medication-induced hepatotoxicity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126633.html" rel="external">"Pharmacologic management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults", section on 'Acetaminophen'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Topical analgesics</strong> – Although supporting data are mainly limited to studies of musculoskeletal injuries, joint pain, and postherpetic neuralgia, one small retrospective review reported at least some pain reduction in 11 of 13 patients (85 percent) using topical combination <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8605" href="/z/d/drug information/8605.html" rel="external">amitriptyline</a> (1-2 percent) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8588" href="/z/d/drug information/8588.html" rel="external">ketamine</a> (0.5 percent) for treatment of rectal, genital, or perineal pain [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. The only adverse effect, occasional local irritation, was reported by one patient. Additionally, meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9348" href="/z/d/drug information/9348.html" rel="external">diclofenac</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8590" href="/z/d/drug information/8590.html" rel="external">ketoprofen</a>, and high-dose topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8840" href="/z/d/drug information/8840.html" rel="external">capsaicin</a> have reported efficacy for some chronic pain conditions, including osteoarthritis, postherpetic neuralgia, HIV-neuropathy, and diabetic neuropathy, but data on the treatment in women with CPP are lacking [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126633.html" rel="external">"Pharmacologic management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults", section on 'Acetaminophen'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Muscle relaxants</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9306" href="/z/d/drug information/9306.html" rel="external">Cyclobenzaprine</a> is a skeletal muscle relaxant that is pharmacologically similar to tricyclic antidepressants. Use of cyclobenzaprine in women with CPP is based mainly on studies in patients with fibromyalgia. One systematic review reported improved sleep and pain symptoms and one small trial reported improved fatigue, tenderness, sleep and pain symptoms for cyclobenzaprine compared with placebo [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].

In our practice, we offer empiric hormonal suppression for women who have a cyclic exacerbation to their CPP. Continuous use of these agents is an effective therapy for menstrual cramping and pain as well as dysmenorrhea and may also alter how estrogen/progesterone circulating levels trigger inflammation or mediate sensitized pain pathways. They may also decidualize small superficial peritoneal endometriosis implants, if present.

For patients with symptoms that likely stem from a peripheral source, we offer therapies targeted at reducing pain generation, including physical therapy (PT), trigger point injections, nerve blocks, and surgical management. However, as central pain processing deficits can exist concurrently with peripheral pain generators, we address both peripheral and central sources of pain in women in whom targeted treatment alone is inadequate or ineffective.

In addition to the somatic intervention, physical therapists play an important role in comprehensive treatment of CPP because therapists often integrate pain education and cognitive-behavioral techniques such as mindfulness strategies alongside manual therapy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5491.html" rel="external">"Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in females: Pelvic floor physical therapy for management"</a>.)</p><p>Despite its widespread utilization as a primary mode of therapy for CPP, formal studies that evaluate the efficacy of PT for the treatment of CPP remain limited and are difficult to compare due to significant heterogeneity in therapy techniques and study design. Much of the presumed positive effect of PT is extrapolated from studies on other types of pelvic pain. In an observational cohort study of 374 men and women with myofascial pelvic pain syndrome (MPPS), 22 percent fewer patients reported using any pain medication at six months following treatment after learning to perform internal myofascial trigger point release using a therapy wand [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In a trial of 81 patients with painful bladder syndrome comparing pelvic floor PT with global therapeutic massage, patients receiving pelvic floor PT demonstrated a greater reduction in pain, urinary urgency, and frequency [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In a retrospective chart review of 124 patients with coccydynia, treatment with PT was associated with decreased mean average pain ratings (from 5.08 to 1.91) and mean highest pain ratings (from 8.81 to 4.75) on a 10-point visual analog scale [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116196.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of chronic non-cancer pain in adults", section on 'Pain severity and impact'</a>.)</p><p>We believe that patients most likely to benefit from pelvic PT include those whose pain is reproducible on palpation or contraction of the pelvic floor or abdominal wall. We recommend referral to a physical therapist with expertise in pelvic floor PT for pelvic pain, as improved outcomes have been associated with therapists with specialized expertise [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The referral should specify that CPP is the indication for treatment and provide as much detail as possible regarding the suspected etiology of pain (eg, pelvic floor myofascial pain, low back pain, etc). Since many pelvic floor physical therapists focus their practice on the treatment of incontinence and prolapse, which often includes treatments to strengthen the pelvic floor, ideally the referring clinician should confirm the therapist is comfortable with the unique therapies necessary for the successful treatment of chronic pain conditions, since the treatments used for incontinence and prolapse can exacerbate pelvic pain.</p><p>Prior to initiating treatment, we advise women that PT may cause a temporary increase in pain, but this should decrease over the course of treatment. Individuals with a persistent increase in pain should be reevaluated for new conditions that may have developed since the last evaluation. We also discuss that PT often involves internal (vaginal) manipulation. Since not all patients feel comfortable with this approach, an experienced therapist can gradually address this issue and build up to this intervention as the clinician develops rapport and a therapeutic relationship with the patient. Finally, patients should expect to perform home exercises and stretches, and we discuss that adherence to the home therapy program increases the probability of long-term improvement in pain [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2401857729"><span class="h3">Trigger point injection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Trigger points are focal, hypersensitive nodules within muscles that are markedly painful to firm palpation and may be focal pain generators. Trigger points are frequently identified in abdominal wall or pelvic floor muscles in patients with CPP and are often associated with referred pain, motor dysfunction, and, occasionally, autonomic symptoms [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. While these are a poorly understood and understudied cause of chronic pain, limited evidence suggests that trigger points are caused by abnormal neuromuscular depolarization [<a href="#rid26">26-30</a>] and are a common cause of myofascial pain conditions [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Evidence also suggests that trigger points may also directly contribute to the subsequent development of central pain amplification [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5480.html" rel="external">"Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in females: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Trigger points'</a>.)</p><p>A common treatment for trigger points is injection with local anesthetics. Successful treatment is considered to be improvement in pain that substantially outlasts the anesthetic's duration of action. Multiple studies support modest efficacy of trigger point injections for patients with CPP, often from myofascial pelvic pain [<a href="#rid31">31-39</a>]. We believe that patients most likely to benefit from trigger point injections are those with a relatively small focal area of pain, which is reproduced with palpation. Trigger point injections, in our experience, seem less effective in patients with widespread, diffuse pain, and clinicians should try to limit performing numerous, chronically repeated injections on a patient. Although there is no consensus regarding type or amount of anesthetic used in injections, the majority of studies have used either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/z/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a>. Our clinical practice is to use 1 to 2 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine at each injection site using a 25 gauge needle. Some studies have added corticosteroids in injections, but this does not appear to improve outcomes [<a href="#rid40">40</a>] and is associated with risk for local muscle necrosis. Similarly, some practitioners will use dry-needling and attempt to mechanically alter muscle dynamics without any pharmacologic agent. Botulinum toxin injection, which is detailed below, may have a role in refractory cases as well; further details of trigger point injections are presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5429.html" rel="external">"Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in females: Treatment", section on 'Trigger point'</a>.)</p><p>Based on our clinical experience, we find the following issues worth considering when planning or performing trigger point injections:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We consider patient habitus when choosing needle length, as it is important to inject past the fascia and into the muscle, but not into the abdominal cavity. Some obese women may require a spinal needle to reach the trigger point. However, in thin women, it is theoretically possible to injure intraabdominal visceral or vascular structures if using long (spinal) needles. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the area of pain is adequately anesthetized but pain improvement does not last for at least one day, in our experience, repeated injections are not likely to be beneficial. If the patient reports at least modest improvement with initial injection that lasts at least a few days to a week, we will often repeat injections in two to four weeks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When possible, injections should be repeated shortly after patient notes return of focal pain, with the goal of less frequent injections as pain improves. There are no evidence-based guidelines as to how often injections can be repeated or the maximum number of times injections can be performed. In our practice, we consider repeating injections in two to four week intervals up to a total of four to six injections if needed. If the patient has recurrence of pain, but had significant improvement for at least three months, (30 to 50 percent reduction), it is reasonable to offer a repeat series of injections. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H672067206"><span class="h3">Nerve block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) are widely-used for surgical anesthesia as well as for both postoperative and nonsurgical analgesia. PNBs can also be used for diagnosis and treatment of nerve pain. In a patient with presumed nerve-related pain, a PNB that greatly reduces the pain supports the diagnosis and provides pain relief. For women with significant pain symptoms, PNBs can be combined with neuromodulators, although supporting data are limited. Peripheral nerve blocks are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/397.html" rel="external">"Overview of peripheral nerve blocks"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1177999542"><span class="h3">Photobiomodulation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A transvaginal near-infrared light therapy device (15 W diode laser that emits 810 and 980 nanometer wavelengths) has been approved for use in reducing muscle and nerve dysregulation in pelvic pain states, which may reduce the burden of physical therapy visits. The exact mechanism of photobiomodulation is not fully clear but may have to do with the energy transmission altering cellular nitric oxide concentrations. A multi-site uncontrolled case series of treatments using this therapy in females with a variety of pelvic pain conditions (mean age 44.3 ± 15.1 years) reported clinically meaningful reduction in pelvic pain in 59 percent of women who received at least five brief treatment sessions [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].

Examples of such causes may include severe deep infiltrating endometriosis, a reversible process iatrogenically caused by a prior procedure (such as pain following hysteroscopic permanent contraception [eg, Essure], IUD placement, endometrial ablation, vaginal mesh procedures for urogenital prolapse, or loop electrosurgical excisional therapy), focal pain that is reproduced with palpation of a leiomyoma, chronic adnexal pathology, or a stable longstanding uterine pain disorder, including refractory dysmenorrhea. In a retrospective review of 54 women with CPP who underwent surgery for suspected ovarian remnant syndrome or ovarian retention syndrome, approximately 40 percent of women reported at least 50 percent reduction in their pain [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Of note, women who reported a 30 percent or greater pain decrease had fewer additional diagnoses that were associated with pain compared with women who did not have such a pain reduction. The optimal timing to perform such procedures has not been established despite calls for research [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. In addition, most available studies provide short-term information on pain relief, with only a few studies reporting more than a year's worth of follow-up data related to specific surgical intervention [<a href="#rid44">44-46</a>]. </p><p>At times we consider performing surgery on women who do not have symptoms associated with the above pathology if multiple noninvasive therapies have not improved the pain. As an example, we have occasionally seen women with dramatic responses to simple myomectomy of small leiomyoma after two to three years of ineffective trials of empiric neuromodulator therapy and PT. In addition, select women with refractory chronic perineal (not pelvic) pain unresponsive to medical therapy, local injections, or PT may benefit from surgical pudendal nerve release. Candidates for this surgery, which is only offered by a small number of centers worldwide, generally are selected following the Nantes criteria, which need further validation [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].

Challenges in studying the impact of ERAS programs include that outcomes are often institution specific and depend on the level of commitment given by the various teams in the pathway. In our practice, for almost all patients undergoing surgery, we use several preemptive medications to potentially reduce pain sensitization and the need for perioperative opioid administration.

In our practice, we consider procedure reversals for women whose pain is reproducible on examination and correlates with the prior procedure and who have not responded to medical and nonpharmacologic therapy. However, we counsel women regarding the high rates of pain persistence despite procedure reversal or implant removal. </p><p>The efficacy of doing a procedure to remove a possible sensitizing foreign object for pain has only been described in uncontrolled small case series, with approximately 50 percent of women responding to conservative removal [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. For women with synthetic mesh-related neuropathic pain, some authors suggest performing a full excision of the mesh if conservative treatments are ineffective, but these studies generally lack control groups and the total degree of pain improvement varies [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>]. Studies are needed to determine the optimal candidates for surgical therapy, preoperative factors that predict successful surgical outcomes (eg, patient response to preoperative hypogastric nerve block or paracervical nerve block), and the necessary extent of surgery (eg, radical versus conservative surgery). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17175.html" rel="external">"Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Management of exposure and pain following pelvic surgery"</a>.)</p><p>Pain associated with a foreign body may represent a nerve injury or sensitization. Examples include unexplained pain that develops following synthetic mesh insertion (such as for prolapse or incontinence) or following hysteroscopic insertion of tubal micro-inserts (commercial name Essure). Women with a history of prior chronic pain problems, including pelvic pain, low-back pain, headache, and fibromyalgia, appear to be at increased risk for persistent postprocedure pain [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. It is unclear if this postprocedure pain represents persistence of preexisting pain versus new postoperative pain. Nerves that are particularly at risk for injury during gynecologic surgery include the ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric, genitofemoral, and the pudendal nerves. Localized pain that is reproducible on examination, particularly in the procedure/surgical region (eg, in the uterus or in the uterosacral ligaments), can be one clue when such history exists.

Potential procedures include presacral neurectomy, lysis of adhesions, and hysterectomy. Data supporting a role of these surgeries for the treatment of CPP are limited. For each of these surgeries, we counsel women about the risk of continued pain, and new postsurgical pain, in addition to the standard surgical risks. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presacral neurectomy</strong> – Resection of the sympathetic nerves of Cotte triangle (over the sacral promontory) has been thought to block transmission of visceral afferent signals from the pelvic organs and thereby reduce pain. The main trial supporting this approach compared combined presacral neurectomy and surgical treatment of endometriosis with laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis alone for women with dysmenorrhea, and reported improved pain control with the combined approach (12 month cure rate: 86 versus 57 percent) [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. Anecdotally, very few surgeons seem to employ this measure since it is primarily indicated for treating isolated central dysmenorrhea or chronic midline pelvic pain without associated symptoms of lateralized or pelvic floor pain. Having only central dysmenorrhea is relatively rare in our experience. Postoperative complications include a modest risk of chronic constipation and possible urinary retention [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lysis of adhesions</strong> – Routine lysis of adhesions does not appear to be helpful in treating CPP and therefore is not advised [<a href="#rid18">18,54</a>]. Although adhesions are commonly part of the differential diagnosis of CPP, the exact structural relationships (eg, connecting pelvic organs, entrapping specific nerve bundles) or mechanisms (eg, organ tethering) that would cause adhesions to contribute to cyclic or continuous pain are not well established. A trial of 100 patients (majority women) with chronic abdominal pain comparing laparoscopic adhesiolysis with sham laparoscopy reported similar reduction in pain scores for both groups (reduced approximately 20 out of 100 points at one year) [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Selective adhesiolysis, such as in the setting of a specific scar around an ovary or causing a hydrosalpinx that is consistent with the patient's pain pattern, may be appropriate but needs further study before being recommended routinely. We rarely perform adhesiolysis alone without a concomitant procedure. If, at the time of laparoscopy for other indications, such as during excision of endometriosis, we encounter an obliterated cul-de-sac, we will lyse adhesions in an attempt to normalize anatomy and will consider oophoropexy or uterine suspension to minimize the chance of the same scar recurring. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16673.html" rel="external">"Endometriosis: Surgical management of pelvic pain", section on 'Adhesiolysis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hysterectomy</strong> – We have proposed the phrase "chronic uterine pain" to describe individuals with the repeated finding of uterine tenderness on examination that does not respond to medical therapy and is not caused by endometriosis [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. Certainly in some cases, symptomatic leiomyoma or adenomyosis, even when not markedly distorting the uterus, may be ultimately contributing to symptoms as well. We view these patients, where the diagnosis is not clearly defined by palpable pathology, as having a functional condition analogous to painful bladder syndrome or irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hysterectomy for pain indications</strong> – For those who have completed childbearing, hysterectomy can be a reasonable treatment option but may not alleviate all pain.

In a prospective cohort study of 176 patients with pelvic pain, 12 percent of patients reported &lt;50 percent improvement in pelvic pain six months after hysterectomy [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. Every one-point increase in preoperative centralized pain score was associated with a 27 percent increase in the odds of persistent pelvic pain (odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.03-1.57) six months after surgery [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Overall benefit of pain reduction</strong> – It is important to note that even among the patients with high degrees of centralized pain prior to hysterectomy, most reported substantial improvement in their pain. Thus, we feel that the presence of central sensitization or other risk factors for persistent pain should not preclude surgeons from offering hysterectomy for the treatment of pelvic pain, but should be used to inform counseling on the risk of persistent pain, ensuring that treatments for other pain generators are maximized and planning for additional perioperative management strategies that target central sensitivity after hysterectomy if pain persists.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Surgical considerations when performing hysterectomy</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Surgical route – We prefer laparoscopic hysterectomy when possible because it is associated with shorter recovery, less postoperative pain, and less blood loss (compared with open surgery), yet allows for intraabdominal evaluation and treatment of concomitant pathology, such as endometriosis. Additionally, the surgeon can evaluate for anatomic relationships that may have been distorted by prior surgery, such as the course of the ureters or the vesicouterine peritoneal fold. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Bilateral oophorectomy – Concomitant ovary removal is generally only indicated in the setting of severe bilateral adnexal pathology (such as larger bilateral ovarian endometriomas) or genetic predisposition to cancer. Ovarian preservation avoids the long-term sequelae of surgical menopause [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Even among patients with endometriosis, bilateral oophorectomy may not sufficiently alleviate pain. For example, in population-based retrospective cohort study of nearly 4500 patients aged 19 to 50 years undergoing hysterectomy for endometriosis, patients who underwent bilateral oophorectomy had a lower rate of reoperation compared with those who had conservation of at least one ovary. However, the majority of reoperations in those with ovarian preservation were subsequent oophorectomy or lysis of adhesions. Furthermore, there was little difference in number of physician visits for endometriosis and pelvic pain, opioid use, and use of hormonal suppression medications after hysterectomy when comparing patients with ovarian preservation versus concomitant bilateral oophorectomy [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. These findings suggest that persistent pain after hysterectomy may not differ significantly based on ovarian conservation status in most patients with endometriosis.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4276411109"><span class="h2">Less studied targeted treatments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is some evidence supporting the use of vaginal anxiolytics and botulinum toxins for pelvic floor pain syndromes.

It is important to emphasize that the patient should continue to explore nonpharmacologic treatments that improve symptoms while simultaneously progressing through the various drug classes below. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H173163942"><span class="h2">Neuromodulators</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H488992397"><span class="h3">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In our practice, treatments for CPP include anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) because of their demonstrated efficacy in treating other neuropathic pain syndromes, tolerability, and relatively safe side effect profile [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. This list reflects our experience as well as the available literature and is not meant to be applicable to all women with CPP. We suggest beginning treatment with one anticonvulsant, tricyclic, or SNRI, the dose of which is slowly increased to a therapeutic range until the patient achieves consistent pain relief across the day. The choice of initial medication class is tailored to the patient's symptoms and other medical history. As an example, TCAs have simple, once daily dosing that makes them a good choice for patients who benefit from a simple dosing schedule. However, TCAs can be associated with constipation and cardiac side effects (tachycardia, arrhythmias) and thus are avoided in women with these issues or who develop these symptoms. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. </p><p>If the patient does not achieve pain reduction at a therapeutic dose, then we move on to the next class of drugs. Muscle relaxants can be used in combination with these medications for breakthrough pain. We select the drug that the patient is likely to best tolerate based on the medication's side effects. Subsequent changes are based on patient tolerance of any side effects and the impact of these side effects on lifestyle. For example, as all of these agents might cause dizziness, somnolence, or fatigue, they are not ideal for heavy machinery operators, and driving should be carefully monitored until levels are stable and the patient reports minimal to no somnolence or dizziness on the therapeutic dose.</p><p>Plans for pregnancy are an important consideration; these agents may not be the best choice for patients desiring to conceive. Anticonvulsants and TCAs cross the placenta and have been associated with adverse effects. The SNRIs have been associated with nonteratogenic effects in the newborn.

CBT can be highly effective therapy for multiple chronic pain conditions [<a href="#rid102">102-105</a>], and research regarding CBT for the treatment of CPP suggests a positive impact, although the body of evidence is limited [<a href="#rid106">106</a>]. In our experience, patients tend to have either a significant response or none at all. However, as CBT carries low risk and nearly every patient with chronic pain can benefit from some aspect of CBT, we recommend this treatment to any patient who reports CPP of long duration and/or those who report substantial mood symptoms, disrupted sleep patterns, dysfunctional relationships, or avoidance of physical activity or work due to pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14612.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychotherapies", section on 'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126111.html" rel="external">"Approach to the management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults", section on 'Psychological therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Based on our experience, we discuss the following with women whom we refer to CBT:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is very important that the provider explain why this treatment is recommended. Many patients with CPP feel that providers who recommend CBT think that their pain is "all in their head." We educate patients that chronic pain frequently has a negative impact on mood, sleep, activity, and other aspects of quality of life, and reassure them that CBT helps to modify the thoughts and behaviors that exacerbate pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cognitive behavioral therapists that specialize in chronic pain are not widely available, often have long wait times for new patients, and their services are often not covered by many health care plans. We suggest clinicians caring for women with CPP contact social workers and psychiatrists in their community, as these providers may have referral recommendations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If in-person CBT is not available or feasible, we discuss that internet-based or app-based CBT programs may be helpful, as these programs may be more accessible to the patient. A systematic review of 15 internet-based psychological therapy programs for chronic pain conditions concluded that the internet-based programs were equally effective as traditional CBT [<a href="#rid107">107</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2747054024"><span class="h3">Exercise</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise interventions appear to be helpful for a variety of chronic pain conditions [<a href="#rid108">108</a>], including CPP [<a href="#rid109">109-111</a>] and dysmenorrhea [<a href="#rid112">112-115</a>]. Improvements have been reported in pain, quality of life, physical function, mood, sleep, and self-efficacy. Nearly every patient can benefit from exercise, regardless of baseline health status, etiology of CPP, or comorbid pain or medical conditions. Physical activities that are beneficial are varied, and may include walking, aerobic, strength training, yoga, Pilates, and swimming. In a small trial including 60 women with CPP comparing conventional therapy with conventional therapy plus yoga, the women in the yoga group reported a decreased in pain intensity and increase in quality of life after 8 weeks of intervention [<a href="#rid110">110</a>]. Similarly, in a meta-analysis of 12 trials comparing yoga with no exercise in patients with chronic low-back pain, the yoga group had improvement in back-related function, and possibly reduced pain at three and six months of follow-up [<a href="#rid116">116</a>]. </p><p>We encourage any activity that a patient enjoys and can adapt to her individual schedule and lifestyle. We advise women to pace themselves and set reasonable expectations (ie, "start low, go slow"). In addition, we counsel patients to utilize a regimen that begins with a regular, low-intensity, short-duration activity. Intensity and duration can then slowly increase as the patient develops more strength and endurance. We also advise women to avoid starting with a high-intensity exercise regimen as this approach is likely to exacerbate pain and is often not-sustainable, thus increasing the probability that patients abandon exercise altogether.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2109621140"><span class="h3">Nonpharmacologic therapies of less clear benefit</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acupuncture</strong> – Acupuncture includes needling, auricular point manipulation, and moxibustion (warm acupuncture) [<a href="#rid117">117</a>]. While the available evidence is mainly limited to one study in women with endometriosis-related pelvic pain, acupuncture was associated with reduced dysmenorrhea [<a href="#rid118">118</a>]. In a systematic review that included 134 studies of acupuncture or dry needling (no anesthetic injection) for management of myofascial trigger point pain, there was a trend toward treatment efficacy, but major differences in study design, quality, and size limited the ability to analyze combined data [<a href="#rid119">119</a>].

Use of these modalities for women with CPP is mainly extrapolated from data on other pain syndromes. In our practices, only a small handful of patients are referred for neuromodulation when they have high-intensity pain that is refractory to traditional therapy; the data for peripheral neuromodulation in treating CPP are limited and mostly from other types of pain disorders. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">TENS has been associated with reductions in myofascial and low-back pain [<a href="#rid121">121,122</a>].

Interestingly, one of these studies demonstrated sustained efficacy for at least six months after therapy [<a href="#rid125">125</a>]. SNM is considered a third-line treatment for overactive bladder by the American Urologic Association [<a href="#rid123">123</a>] and has off-label use as a fourth-line treatment of bladder pain syndrome (BPS) [<a href="#rid126">126</a>].

In this trial, the dietary protocol consisted of limited nutritional intake (range 1600 and 2000 calories per day) in addition to vitamins (B6, A, C, E), minerals salts (Ca, Mg, Se, Zn, Fe), VSL3 lactic ferments (<em>Bifidobacterium breve</em>, <em>Bifidobacterium longum</em>, <em>Bifidobacterium infantis</em>, <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus</em>, <em>Lactobacillus casei</em>, <em>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</em>, <em>Streptococcus thermophilus</em>), and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (fish oil), individualized to each woman based on her BMI, physical activity level, and type of job.

(See <a class="local">'Is there a probable versus unidentified cause of CPP?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Probable etiology</strong> – For females with CPP associated with a probable peripheral etiology, initial treatment is aimed at addressing the presumed cause (eg, treatment of endometriosis, pelvic floor dysfunction, painful bladder syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112656" href="/z/d/graphic/112656.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Individuals whose pain resolves require no further treatment. (See <a class="local">'Is there a probable versus unidentified cause of CPP?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Unidentified cause or persistent pain</strong> – For females with CPP without an identified cause or that persists despite targeted therapy, we view CPP as originating from a somatic structure (eg, muscles, bone) or visceral organ (eg, uterus, ovaries, bladder, bowel), or as a pain amplification syndrome (ie, pain processing issue or neuropathic pain). We consider treatment of central pain amplification, simultaneously offering therapy that may include both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. (See <a class="local">'Is there a probable versus unidentified cause of CPP?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Baseline treatments</strong> – For females with CPP of unclear etiology or whose CPP persists despite targeted treatment, baseline nonsurgical treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>, topical analgesics, muscle relaxants, and, in some cases, empiric hormonal therapy. Treatments may be used for years, if not decades, if they improve quality of life. The rationale for this approach is that the optimal treatment or treatment combination for CPP is not known, and this approach addresses the multifactorial nature of pain. (See <a class="local">'Baseline nonsurgical interventions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subsequent targeted interventions</strong> – For women whose pain persists despite baseline interventions, subsequent therapy includes both nonsurgical and surgical treatments targeted at peripheral pain generators, if such pain generators are identified during the history and physical examination. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent targeted interventions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Nonsurgical</strong> – Targeted nonsurgical treatments include physical therapy, trigger point injections, and nerve blocks. (See <a class="local">'Targeted therapies: Nonsurgical'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Surgical</strong> – Targeted surgical treatment is reasonable when there is a high clinical suspicion for conditions that will likely respond to surgery. Examples include suspicion for deep infiltrating endometriosis, a reversible process iatrogenically caused by a prior procedure, focal pain that is reproduced with palpation of a leiomyoma, chronic adnexal pathology, or a stable longstanding uterine pain disorder, including refractory dysmenorrhea. (See <a class="local">'Targeted therapies: Surgical'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Additional treatment modalities</strong> – There is some evidence supporting the use of vaginal anxiolytics and botulinum toxins for pelvic floor pain syndromes. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal approach to therapy and degree of efficacy before these treatments are routinely used. (See <a class="local">'Less studied targeted treatments'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interventions aimed at central sensitization of pain</strong> – For CPP that is unresponsive to targeted therapy or that is nonspecific, the field of pain medicine accepts a hypothetical significant role for altered central pain processing (ie, central sensitization), and widely employs medications (ie, neuromodulators) that alter circulating levels of neurotransmitters thought to underlie that imbalance. It is important to emphasize that the patient should continue to explore nonpharmacologic treatments that improve symptoms while progressing through the various drug classes below. (See <a class="local">'Interventions for central sensitization or neuropathic pain'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Common medications</strong> – In our practice, neuromodulator treatments include anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) because of their demonstrated efficacy, tolerability, and relatively safe side effect profile. This list reflects our experience as well as the available literature and is not meant to be applicable to all women with CPP. We suggest beginning treatment with one anticonvulsant, tricyclic, or SNRI, the dose of which is slowly increased to a therapeutic range until the patient achieves consistent pain relief across the day. The choice of initial medication class is tailored to the patient's symptoms and other medical history.

Physical therapy in some individuals, even without targeted findings, may promote better movement with some benefit. These also may have roles in improving dysregulated pain processing systems.

We advise further evaluation of these treatments in women with CPP before routine use. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant therapies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Avoidance of opioids</strong> – As opioid therapy has not been clearly demonstrated to improve neuropathic pain and carries the risk of addiction, we do not prescribe opioid medication for long-term maintenance therapy in women with CPP. We will prescribe brief courses of opioids postoperatively or to use as a bridge to surgery for women with significant pain symptoms and resultant loss of function in whom a likely cause has been identified (eg, deep infiltrating endometriosis, leiomyoma, or adnexal pathology).
