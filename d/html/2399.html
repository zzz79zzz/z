         The diagnosis of a food allergy requires consideration of the details of an individual's history, knowledge about the epidemiology of different food allergies, and specific test results. When these elements do not clearly confirm or refute an allergy, the clinician, typically an allergy specialist or sometimes a gastroenterologist, may perform a clinician-supervised oral food challenge (OFC) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-6
         </a>
         ]. OFCs may also be used to determine if a food allergy has resolved. In addition, they can be undertaken to define other adverse reactions to foods, such as intolerance.
        </p>
        <p>
         OFCs generally consist of a gradual feeding of the test food under close observation. The test usually results in a definitive conclusion about whether the food was tolerated.
        </p>
        <p>
         An OFC is preceded by a period of dietary elimination, performed either therapeutically (because the food was already suspected or known to have caused a reaction) or for diagnostic reasons (to determine if elimination of the suspect food resulted in amelioration of symptoms).
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will present the role of diagnostic elimination diets, the selection of patients for OFCs, different types of OFCs, and a general approach to performing an OFC. Other related food allergy topics are covered separately. (See

         Elimination diets are undertaken prior to an OFC. Elimination diets are used diagnostically to determine if symptoms, usually chronic in nature, resolve after the suspected food(s) is removed from the diet. Elimination diets are discussed in greater detail in another topic review, and avoidance of a food allergen once the allergy is diagnosed is presented separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2396.html" rel="external">

         There are three types of elimination diets:

         A patient may be instructed to avoid several potential causal foods if a reaction suggesting an IgE-mediated disorder (eg, urticaria) occurred suddenly after a meal, but a single causal food allergen could not be identified by testing or history. It is improbable that more than one food in a given meal would cause a reaction.

         </span>
         Elimination of multiple foods may be indicated for patients with certain chronic inflammatory diseases. For example, atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases are associated with food allergy that is usually non-IgE mediated or mixed IgE and non-IgE mediated [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,4
         </a>
         ]. History, testing, and epidemiologic considerations may yield an extensive list of suspect foods. Thus, elimination of multiple foods is typically needed to determine if the disorder is food responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
         A provisional diagnosis of food allergy is given if symptoms resolve, as documented by history, symptom diaries, and/or physical examination. However, OFCs are still needed to confirm the causal foods. Elimination diets can sometimes result in acute allergic reactions to foods that were previously in the diet when these foods are reintroduced. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk of reaction'

         In children with known food allergies, OFCs are commonly performed to determine the safety of adding foods back into the diet when it is suspected that the allergy has resolved. Variables to consider when trying to determine if a food allergy has resolved include specific IgE tests, age of the individual, time since the last reaction, and the outcomes after recent accidental exposures, if any.

         There is generally no clinical reason to perform a diagnostic OFC if there has been recent, severe anaphylaxis to an isolated ingestion with a positive test for specific IgE antibody to the causal food. In addition, an OFC may not be relevant when the food or food family being eliminated is not important to the allergic individual's diet and can be simply avoided (eg, a rarely ingested fruit).
        </p>
        <p>
         OFCs may not accurately reflect reactions outside of the challenge setting, because OFCs use a gradual administration of the tested food and the challenge is discontinued if symptoms occur [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Thus, OFCs should not be undertaken solely to document severity.

         Medical and patient factors must be considered when determining if it is appropriate to undertake an OFC (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). Patient preferences and concerns are important to consider and should be discussed with the patient/caregiver(s). OFCs should only be performed when the food is expected to become part of the diet since recurrence of food allergy after a negative challenge, although uncommon, is associated with continued avoidance or infrequent ingestion of the challenge food [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. Based upon a study of young children with hen's egg, cow's milk, or peanut allergy, OFCs resulting in reactions were not associated with increases in food-specific IgE or skin test responses, so this concern should not deter performing the diagnostic procedure [
         <a href="#rid12">

         The medical history, skin test results, and in vitro test results may be used to estimate the risk of current allergy. Data are conflicting as to whether increasing concentrations of food-specific antibodies and size of reactions on skin testing correlate with the severity of a reaction during a challenge, possibly because of additional factors affecting severity including dose ingested and comorbid conditions such as asthma [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,13-16

        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, a patient with an egg allergy had a reaction a few months ago after an accidental exposure. The in vitro test for food-specific IgE to egg is now negative. However, the prior probability that this patient is still allergic to egg is high given the relatively recent reaction. A clinician may decide to proceed with the challenge if the skin test to egg is negative as this indicates a lower likelihood of reacting during the challenge. Conversely, a challenge may be deferred if the patient has a large positive reaction on skin testing [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         OFCs performed after a period of elimination have resulted in acute and severe reactions, even though the food was previously associated only with chronic symptoms [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,17-19
         </a>
         ]. This occurs most commonly when there is a positive specific IgE test for the food. This risk must be considered prior to trial diagnostic elimination diets and during OFCs. As an example, in a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to a tertiary care allergy clinic with a concern for food-triggered atopic dermatitis, 19 percent with food-triggered atopic dermatitis and no prior acute allergic reactions to the eliminated food experienced immediate reactions on reexposure. Of these reactions, 30 percent were anaphylaxis [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].

         </span>
         Agreement upon the correct time to undertake a food challenge requires shared decision making by the clinician and the patient/caregiver(s). Some clinicians typically offer food challenges for young children when risks of having a reaction to the challenge are approximately 50 percent [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21
         </a>
         ]. Others suggest challenges when the risk is higher, on the grounds that avoidance, especially of staple foods, is a significant burden [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, some patients/caregivers may prefer to wait until there is a greater chance of tolerating the food (a negative challenge).
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, the caregivers of a two-year-old child with a 90 percent risk of peanut allergy may not consider an OFC worthwhile because the food is easily avoided and the chance of tolerating it may improve with time [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, it may be useful to perform on OFC in a teenager with the same 90 percent risk to determine with certainty whether the patient needs to continue avoidance since teenagers are more prone to risk taking and may otherwise try the food on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
         Caregivers may decline an offered OFC based upon incorrect assumptions. As examples, they may not understand the benefit of adding that particular food to the diet, may assume a reaction is likely or fear a reaction, or may plan to attempt home introduction, which could result in reactions [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>
         ]. These are best addressed in anticipatory guidance.

         Food challenges may be indicated to allow expansion of the diet, despite poor odds of tolerance, in a child whose nutritional status is negatively impacted because of the avoidance of multiple foods [

         A child with fear of eating because of past severe reactions may warrant psychological treatment prior to OFC to reduce the risk that a reaction during OFC would increase food avoidance behaviors. Some studies suggest that an OFC, whether showing tolerance or allergy, may result in improved quality of life and may even decrease, rather than increase, anxiety [

         </span>
         An open OFC involves gradually feeding the tested food in its natural state (eg, peanut butter) to patients who know that they are eating the food being tested. This method is potentially prone to patient and observer bias because of expectations of a reaction, but it is easy to perform since no special preparation is needed. There is little concern about bias if the patient tolerates the ingestion of the food. However, bias must be considered when symptoms develop, especially if they are subjective.
        </p>
        <p>
         Open challenges are a good option for screening when several foods are under consideration or there is minimal concern about observer or patient bias. The test can be repeated with blinding and controls if there is a reaction to an open challenge and there is concern that the reaction may have been anxiety related rather than physiologic. Open feeding is also used to follow a double-blind, placebo-controlled OFC (DBPCFC) to ensure a meal-sized portion of the food is tolerated in its natural state. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Single-blind OFC'

         Single-blind challenges require that the food be masked in taste by adding it to another food. This procedure helps to alleviate some patient bias. However, the single-blind OFC does not remove observer bias.
        </p>
        <p>
         The single-blind challenge may be performed with a placebo arm, or the operator may decide to use initial placebo doses to observe for subjective symptoms prior to proceeding with the challenge.

         The DBPCFC is considered the gold standard for diagnosing food allergy and is preferred for research purposes [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. The tested food is hidden in another food. Bias is reduced because there are at least two feedings and neither patient nor operator knows which challenges contain the food being tested.
        </p>
        <p>
         The procedure for DBPCFC is more labor intensive than the open- or single-blind challenge, but it can still be carried out in an office setting if the required materials and personnel are available. The aid of a third party is needed to prepare the challenges. A coin flip can be used by the third party to randomize the order of administration. It is sometimes difficult to provide a meal-sized portion of a food in its natural state because the food is masked.
        </p>
        <p>
         The false-negative rate for DBPCFCs is 0.7 percent, and the false-positive rate is 2.8 to 3.2 percent, based primarily upon studies in children with atopic dermatitis [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-34
         </a>
         ]. Worsening eczema was the most frequent clinical reaction in one series, and reactions to placebo were more common in children ≤1.5 years of age compared with older children (4 versus 1.5 percent) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Augmentation factors such as illness, alcohol, exercise, use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and sleep deprivation can reduce the threshold dose that triggers a reaction [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. (See

          "History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The placebo arm and active arm may be performed in a single day in patients with a history of IgE-mediated reactions. There should be several hours between challenges. The practice of interspersing placebo and active food proteins during a single challenge (ie, random ordering of sequential doses of placebo and suspected allergen) should be discouraged because it may be difficult to differentiate whether a reaction following a placebo dose was due to the placebo or other factor or was a delayed reaction to the suspected allergen.
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, an open feeding of a meal-sized portion of the tested food prepared in its usual manner may be recommended as a follow-up to a negative DBPCFC [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,31
         </a>
         ]. A DBPCFC may need to be repeated using larger doses or different methods of food preparation if such an open feeding induces a reaction. Although DBPCFCs typically include only two separate challenges (a single placebo and only one active feeding component), increasing the number of challenges to both placebo and active allergen helps to diminish the possibility of a reaction due to chance rather than true allergy; however, this approach is very labor intensive [

         Informed consent should be obtained from the patient or guardian and documented prior to beginning the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients should avoid the suspected food(s) for at least two weeks before the OFC for suspected IgE-mediated allergy and several weeks longer for non-IgE-mediated reactions. Patients should not eat or drink for at least two hours prior to challenge.

        <p>
         Antihistamines, beta agonists, beta adrenergic blockers (including eye drops), and other medications that may either alter symptoms of a reaction or interfere with its treatment should be discontinued for at least five half-lives (specific to each medication) prior to challenge. Patients should be instructed to bring their autoinjectable

         Patients are advised to cancel the OFC if they are experiencing acute allergic symptoms or are otherwise ill at the time of their appointment. Patients with asthma should be symptom free and be stable on current therapy with no recent exacerbations. Spirometry may be performed to ensure a good baseline. Infrequently, hospitalization may be necessary to treat severe or acute allergic disease and establish a stable baseline prior to challenges.

         OFCs are almost always performed under direct medical supervision either in a clinic or hospital setting. Options for location include clinician offices, outpatient centers designed for procedures, inpatient hospital units, and monitored intensive care units. In unusual circumstances, foods may be gradually added back into the diet at home, possibly with telehealth supervision [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. This may be undertaken when specific IgE tests are negative or trivially positive, symptoms are mild or chronic, and there is little concern for potential anaphylaxis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5745.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Selection of an appropriate setting requires clinician judgment about risks and availability of advanced treatment of anaphylaxis. Oral challenges can elicit severe anaphylactic reactions in any setting [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. The clinician must have appropriate training and be prepared with emergency medications and equipment to promptly treat such a reaction [

          1,5,6,15,40
         </a>

         The rate and severity of reactions to OFCs depends upon many factors, including the criteria used to decide whether to proceed with the challenge (eg, blood and/or skin test results, severity of prior reactions, time since the last reaction) and comorbidities such as asthma (see
         <a class="local">
          'Risk of reaction'

        <p>
         Opaque capsules have been used but are now in disfavor because they pose several potential problems. Some patients, especially young children, are unable to ingest enough capsules or even swallow them at all. In addition, capsules can bypass oral contact, which would normally provide the earliest symptoms/clues of a clinical response. Finally, slow degradation of capsules may result in overlapping doses (ie, administration of a subsequent dose before the previous dose was fully released). This can lead to unintended administration of a higher-than-needed dose to elicit symptoms and to more severe reactions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, allergenic foods may be mixed into masking foods. Equipment used for food preparation includes paper plates, cups, disposable utensils, mixing bowls, scale, mortar/pestle, blender, and a microwave. Suggestions for masking foods are shown in the table (

         No single approach to dosing and timing is universally established for food challenges. Dose amounts and timing between doses should be adjusted to match the patient's history (eg, if days of ingestion are needed to elicit symptoms) or concerns about heightened sensitivity (eg, starting with minimal doses spaced out over longer periods of observation).
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, a child with a history of atopic dermatitis flaring over days with milk ingestion who carries positive IgE tests to milk and has been avoiding this protein for a year may have an acute allergic reaction on the day of challenge or may experience a flare over days of ingestion. A graded OFC under clinician supervision on the first day would evaluate the risk of an acute reaction and, if tolerated, following the child's symptoms over the following days with milk added to the diet, would evaluate for delayed responses.
        </p>
        <p>
         The general approach is to select a regimen that is unlikely to result in a severe acute reaction by cautiously and gradually increasing the amount ingested (with the target cumulative dose of a meal-sized portion) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,6
         </a>
         ], while also considering time constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with past food reactions that occurred immediately after ingestion, doses are generally administered at 15- to 30-minute intervals over approximately 90 to 120 minutes, followed by a larger, meal-sized portion of food a few hours later.

          1,52

         ] is to administer a total of 8 to 10 grams of the dry food or 100 mL of wet/liquid food (double amount for meat/fish; eg, 20 grams). Dry forms of peanut (flour), milk, and egg are often used. The grams used may not match the protein content of ingested foods in their natural form. Powdered forms with a weight of 8 to 10 grams are approximately equivalent to 105 mL skim milk, 1.2 eggs, and 21 mL of peanut butter. Open OFCs for routine clinical purposes often aim for a cumulative consumption of a serving size portion for age [

         The starting dose should be low enough that it does not trigger a reaction in most patients. Estimation of a starting dose may differ based on estimation of the risk of reaction based on history and testing. Starting doses in the 1 to 3 mg range are generally safe and unlikely to elicit severe reactions [

         According to one workgroup report, the challenge may begin with 0.1 to 1 percent of the total challenge food, which may represent 1 to 5 mg of the food protein and 8 to 10 mg of the whole food, depending on the type of food and its preparation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology proposed starting doses as follows (shown as protein weight or liquid volume): peanut 0.1 mg, milk 0.1 mL, egg 1 mg, cod 5 mg, wheat 100 mg, soy 1 mg, shrimp 5 mg, hazelnut 0.1 mg [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53

         Starting doses of 100 mg or less are recommended in part based upon results from a series of 513 positive challenges to six common allergenic foods in children with atopic dermatitis [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. In this series, starting doses ranged from 100 to 500 mg. Neither prick skin test size nor specific IgE antibody concentration was predictive of the dose required to trigger a reaction. Eleven percent of the reactions that occurred on first dose were severe. The following results were reported:

         One could argue for starting doses that begin under the thresholds reported to induce reaction, especially in patients who have a history of reacting to trace amounts of a food [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. However, threshold data are not available for most foods, and the thresholds that are published vary logarithmically. Reactions are usually not reported under 0.25 mg of protein for peanut (1 mg of peanut, an amount about the size of the head of a pin), 0.13 mg for egg (similar to the weight and volume of peanut butter), and 0.6 mg for milk (approximately 0.02 mL) [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55,56
         </a>
         ]. These doses are difficult to measure accurately with typical office equipment. Single-dose, low-dose challenges may be used to confirm that a patient is not reactive to low doses [

         Labial food challenge (LFC) or lip dose challenge (LDC), which involves placing the food on the lower lip for two minutes and observing for local or systemic reactions in the ensuing 30 minutes [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ], has been suggested by some as a starting point before an OFC. However, we do not perform an LFC, due to concerns about diagnostic accuracy and validity of the test. An online survey of registered pediatric allergy clinics in the United Kingdom found that 80 percent of allergy specialists were still performing an LFC, although there was a wide variation in the performance and interpretation of this test [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. In addition, one-third of respondents made the diagnosis of food allergy on the basis of subjective symptoms with the LFC without confirming the diagnosis with an OFC. In a separate prospective study of 198 children undergoing "low-risk" OFCs with an LFC as the first step, the LFC was estimated to have a sensitivity of only 32 percent, with the majority of patients with a negative test going on to develop symptoms with subsequent oral doses [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59

         Patients should be examined carefully prior to an OFC to determine their baseline and to confirm that they do not have any current significant allergic signs/symptoms or an illness that would interfere with assessment and/or treatment of a reaction during the challenge. Vital signs and signs and symptoms are assessed and recorded at baseline, prior to each dose, and at set intervals after the final dose. Assessments are made for symptoms affecting the skin, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (

         Children may become suddenly quiet or assume a fetal position prior to exhibiting more objective symptoms. Children with atopic dermatitis may display an eczematous flare. Early indications of a reaction can include subtle signs, such as moving the tongue in the mouth to rub an itchy palate or ear pulling as an indication of pruritus. Oropharyngeal pruritus or pain often precedes objective symptoms [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61,62

         Challenges are terminated when a reaction becomes apparent (eg, new objective symptoms or an increase in objective symptoms over baseline). Expert judgment is needed about whether or not to discontinue a challenge if symptoms are not clear. Generally, a challenge is discontinued if subjective symptoms are repetitive or prolonged.

         Following a negative OFC in which the allergen was administered in a form not normally eaten (eg, peanut flour or powdered egg), an open challenge with a meal-sized portion of the food in the state in which it is normally ingested (eg, peanut butter or boiled egg) is recommended. This is done to ensure that the processing of the allergenic food for challenge did not alter the allergen and to confirm the negative result.

         Acute abdominal pain is a frequent manifestation of IgE-mediated food reactions and can be prolonged and difficult to manage. Beta-2 receptor agonists relax visceral smooth muscle and have been used to treat other causes of visceral pain. In a retrospective case-control study of 26 patients with peanut allergy who had a positive DBPCFC and were treated with salbutamol (

         <a href="#rid64">
          64

Patients and caregivers should be counseled that delayed reactions or reactions to a normal serving size of the food eaten all at once can occur, usually within a few days of the challenge, but they should also be reassured that these reactions are rare. As noted above, avoidance or infrequent exposure may result in resensitization to the allergen. It is therefore important to encourage normal incorporation of the food into the diet. Patients should be asked at subsequent visits about regular ingestion of the former allergen. A repeat challenge may be required in patients who have continued to avoid the food.

         Patients who have had a negative OFC to one allergen may have remaining food allergies. These patients must be cautioned specifically about cross-contamination by foods that are commonly associated with the food that they are now able to ingest.

         – Oral food challenges (OFCs) are a means to determine definitively if an allergy or other adverse reaction is related to a food and to determine if an identified food allergy has resolved. These challenges are typically undertaken by allergy specialists and occasionally by gastroenterologists. (See

          Elimination diets

          Types of OFCs
         </strong>
         – OFCs may be performed as open feedings, single-blind, or double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The potential for bias will determine the type of OFC to be performed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Types of food challenges'

         OFCs are generally performed by gradually feeding the test food under supervision, with personnel and emergency treatments available in the event of anaphylaxis.

         Dosing amount and regimen, location of challenge (eg, in a clinic, hospital, or monitored unit), and preparation of the patient with intravenous access is determined by assessment of various risk factors.

         A successful OFC requires ingestion of a meal-sized portion of the tested food prepared in its usual state. It is uncommon for subsequent reactions to occur if the feeding was tolerated. (See
