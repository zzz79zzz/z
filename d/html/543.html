         The "classic" signs and symptoms of asthma are intermittent dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. Although typical of asthma, these symptoms are nonspecific, making it sometimes difficult to distinguish asthma from other respiratory diseases. The definitive diagnosis of asthma requires the history or presence of respiratory symptoms consistent with asthma, combined with the demonstration of variable expiratory airflow obstruction [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Tools used in the diagnosis of asthma include history, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, and other laboratory evaluations. This topic review describes these tools, followed by several specific strategies for making the diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults.

         While asthma is readily recognized in its classic presentation, with intermittent cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath brought on by characteristic triggers and relieved by bronchodilating medications, it is difficult to provide a definition that distinguishes asthma from similar and overlapping conditions. In the absence of a definitive laboratory test or biomarker, asthma has defied precise definition, one acceptable to all disciplines (including clinicians, physiologists, and pathologists). Clinically, its symptoms are non-specific. Physiologically, asthma is characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, the tendency of airways to narrow excessively in response to a variety of stimuli that provoke little or no bronchoconstriction in persons without airway disease, but bronchial hyperresponsiveness is not unique to asthma. Pathologically, asthma may be described broadly as "a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways" [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, this description omits the characteristic waxing and waning of airflow obstruction in asthma and fails to distinguish asthma from other inflammatory airways disorders, such as chronic bronchitis or bronchiolitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         More precise definitions combine the central roles of inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness with the characteristic clinical symptoms.

         – Asthma has been defined by the Expert Panel 3 of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program as "a common chronic disorder of the airways that is complex and characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and an underlying inflammation. The interaction of these features of asthma determines the clinical manifestations and severity of asthma and the response to treatment" [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. This definition is descriptive of key features of the disease, but it lacks utility for patients and clinicians.

         – The Global Initiative for Asthma defines asthma as follows [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]: "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation."
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of the features described above for asthma overlap with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Sometimes the distinction between asthma and COPD is clear: chronic exercise limitation and persistent airflow obstruction in a middle-aged or older person with a history of more than 20 pack-years of cigarette smoking point to a diagnosis of COPD. In COPD, pre- and post-bronchodilator pulmonary function testing may confirm little or no reversibility of the airflow obstruction. At other times, however, the distinction is less clear, such as when patients with COPD exhibit episodic symptoms and a large reversible component to their airflow obstruction. Recognition of these overlapping features of both asthma and COPD in some patients has led to description of the condition, asthma-COPD overlap, discussed below. (See

        <p>
         "Reactive airways disease" and "reactive airways" are imprecise terms that have been used to describe transient symptoms of cough and wheeze when confirmation of a diagnosis of asthma is lacking. Although it may be appropriate as a description of intermittent wheezing in very young children in whom a diagnosis of asthma cannot yet be definitively ascertained, it should be avoided in adolescents and adults in whom additional testing is available to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of asthma [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, "reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS)" refers to an airway disorder resulting from an intense exposure to an inhaled chemical irritant or noxious gas. It is characterized by asthma-like features of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airflow obstruction. (See

         Asthma may develop at any age. While it is a common disease in childhood, many children experience a remission of asthma symptoms around the time of puberty, with potential recurrence years later. Adolescents and adults who present with "new" asthma symptoms may have a history of asthma symptoms or diagnosis in childhood [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. However, some studies suggest that asthma is late-onset in around half of adults with asthma, with differing clinical characteristics and risk factors from early-onset asthma [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ], though no difference in level of severity [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Other specific subtypes such as occupational asthma, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (aspirin-sensitive asthma), and eosinophilic asthma are distinct syndromes that typically have their onset in adulthood. (See

         A pattern of respiratory symptoms that occur following exposure to triggers (eg, allergen, exercise, viral infection) and resolve with trigger avoidance or asthma medication is typical of asthma. Some patients will report all four of the classic symptoms of asthma, while others may report only one or two:

        <p>
         "Wheezing" does not have a standard meaning for patients and may be used by those without a medical background to describe a variety of sounds, including upper airway noises emanating from the nose or throat. Cough may be dry or productive of clear mucoid or pale yellow sputum (made discolored by the presence of eosinophils). Asthma is a potential cause of unexplained chronic cough. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1460.html" rel="external">
          "Causes and epidemiology of subacute and chronic cough in adults"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients describe chest tightness, a band-like constriction, or the sensation of a heavy weight on the chest. In contrast, sharp chest pain is rarely used to describe the sensation of asthma.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the symptoms of asthma are also seen in several other respiratory diseases, it is difficult to be certain of the diagnosis of asthma based upon history alone [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,10
         </a>
         ]. However, certain historical features heighten the probability of asthma:

          Episodic symptoms
         </strong>
         – Asthmatic symptoms characteristically come and go, with a time course of hours to days, resolving spontaneously with removal from the triggering stimulus or in response to anti-asthmatic medications. Patients with asthma may remain asymptomatic for long periods of time. Report of symptoms that occur or worsen at night is often a feature of asthma.

          Characteristic triggers
         </strong>
         – Respiratory symptoms triggered by exercise, cold air, and exposure to inhaled allergens (aeroallergens) are suggestive of asthma. A list of questions that can help elicit a history of asthma triggers is provided in the table  (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Exercise-triggered symptoms typically develop 5 to 15 minutes
         <strong>
          after
         </strong>
         a brief (eg, five minutes) period of exertion or about 15 minutes into prolonged exercise and resolve with rest over approximately 30 to 60 minutes. This time-course is distinct from simple exertional dyspnea, which typically begins shortly after the onset of exertion and abates within five minutes of stopping exercise. In asthma, exercise-induced symptoms occur more commonly and are more intense when the inhaled air is cold. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/533.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Allergens that commonly trigger asthmatic symptoms include dust mites, molds, furry animals, cockroaches, and pollens  (

         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The acute onset of lower respiratory tract symptoms reliably precipitated by exposure to a cat or dog is virtually pathognomonic of asthma. In taking a history we typically ask patients about specific home exposures, for example if they have pets, if the home has carpeting or drapes (dust mite exposure), water damage, visible mildew, damp or musty basement (mold exposure), or known rodent or cockroach infestations. Allergenic foods very rarely cause isolated asthma symptoms without other simultaneous allergic manifestations, such as angioedema, urticaria, hypotension, or gastrointestinal distress. Symptoms brought on by irritant-type exposures (eg, cigarette smoke, strong fumes, changes in weather, airborne chemicals or dusts) are non-specific and do not favor a diagnosis of asthma over other respiratory diseases. Viral infections are common triggers for asthma, although they can provoke exacerbations in other chronic respiratory conditions as well. Moreover, acute viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections in the absence of asthma may at least transiently cause respiratory symptoms that mimic asthma, including a whistling-sounding cough, wheezing, and mucus production. Unique to asthma is the onset of cough, wheeze, and/or chest tightness 30 to 120 minutes following ingestion of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">

          Work-related exposures
         </strong>
         - It is estimated that as many as 10 percent of cases of new-onset asthma in the adult are due to workplace-related exposures (occupational asthma). The diagnosis may be suspected based on a characteristic history of asthmatic symptoms temporally associated with work-related exposures, especially in occupations in which there is exposure to known sensitizing agents. The diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstration of variable airflow obstruction before and after a work shift, and in some cases the diagnosis is supported by identification of IgE-specific antibodies in the blood to the offending sensitizer [

          History of asthmatic symptoms as a child

         – Recollection of childhood symptoms of chronic cough, nocturnal cough in the absence of respiratory infections, or a childhood diagnosis of "recurrent bronchitis" or "wheezy bronchitis" favors asthma but may also be reported in someone with bronchiectasis or simply frequent childhood respiratory infections. A history of childhood asthma that abated in late childhood or early adulthood combined with “new onset” of asthmatic symptoms in adulthood favors a diagnosis of recurrent asthma.

         Lack of improvement following anti-asthmatic medications – Patients who have tried an inhaled bronchodilator (with proper inhaler technique) and obtained no relief of their symptoms are less likely to have asthma. Similarly, lack of dramatic improvement with a course of oral glucocorticoids suggests a diagnosis other than asthma. (See

         Widespread, high-pitched, musical wheezes are a characteristic feature of asthma, although wheezes are not specific for asthma and are usually absent between asthma exacerbations. Wheezes are heard most commonly on expiration but can also occur during inspiration. Asthmatic wheezing usually involves sounds of multiple different pitches, or "polyphonic," starting and stopping at various points in the respiratory cycle and varying in tone and duration over time. It is different from the monophasic wheezing of a local bronchial narrowing (eg, due to an aspirated foreign body or bronchogenic cancer), which has single pitch and repeatedly begins and ends at the same point in each respiratory cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
         Expiratory noises transmitted from the upper airway (eg, larynx, pharynx) can mimic wheezing and are often described as wheezing by patients. They are often audible without the use of a stethoscope. However, these upper airway noises are typically loudest over the neck and greatly diminished over the chest in contrast to true wheezes that are typically louder over the chest. Patients may be able to identify respiratory noises as inspiratory rather than expiratory, a description generally favoring an etiology other than asthma. Clinicians can usually distinguish the low-pitched wheezes (also called "rhonchi") that clear with cough, a sign of increased airway secretions as may be seen in bronchitis or bronchiectasis, from the typical high-pitched expiratory wheezes of asthma. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/563.html" rel="external">

         Physical findings that suggest
         <strong>
          severe
         </strong>
         airflow obstruction in asthma include tachypnea, tachycardia, prolonged expiratory phase of respiration (decreased I:E ratio), poor air movement or a "quiet" chest, and a seated position with use of extended arms to support the upper chest ("tripod position") [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,4
         </a>
         ]. Use of the accessory muscles of breathing (eg, sternocleidomastoid) during inspiration and a pulsus paradoxus (greater than 12 mmHg fall in systolic blood pressure during inspiration) are usually found only during severe asthmatic attacks. However, these signs are insensitive manifestations of severe airflow obstruction; their absence does not exclude the possibility of a severe asthmatic attack. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1077.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, the presence or absence of wheezing on physical examination is a poor predictor of the severity of airflow obstruction in asthma. Wheezing may be heard in patients with mild, moderate, or severe airway narrowing, while widespread airway narrowing may be present in individuals without wheezing. Thus, the presence of wheezing alerts one to the likely presence of airway narrowing, but not its severity.

Since aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity) is uncommon in childhood, the finding of nasal polyps in an adolescent with lower respiratory tract symptoms should lead to consideration of alternative diagnoses, specifically cystic fibrosis.

         The laboratory evaluation of a patient with suspected asthma is predominantly focused on pulmonary function testing.

Asthma may be distinguished from these other conditions by the capacity for a "large" increase in FEV
         <sub>
          1
         </sub>
         or FVC. The definition of a large bronchodilator response is not standardized; investigators generally classify a large response as at least 15 or 20 percent. However, there is no precise cutoff value that defines an "asthmatic" bronchodilator response.

         The peak expiratory flow (PEF) is measured during a brief, forceful exhalation, using a simple and inexpensive device (approximately $20). We typically use PEF measurements to monitor patients with a known diagnosis of asthma or to assess the role of a particular occupational exposure or trigger, rather than as a tool for the primary diagnosis of asthma [

          1

          Technique

         – The PEF maneuver can be performed sitting or standing. Proper technique involves taking a maximally large breath in, putting the peak flow meter quickly to the mouth, sealing the lips around the mouthpiece, and blowing out as hard and fast as possible into the meter. For PEF, the effort does not need to be sustained beyond one to two seconds. The maneuver is performed three times and the highest of the three measurements is recorded  (

          Interpretation of PEF –
         </strong>
         A single peak flow determination made in the doctor's office at the time that a patient is experiencing respiratory symptoms, if reduced from the normal predicted value, is suggestive of asthma. However, it is not diagnostic because a reduced peak flow is not specific for airflow obstruction and can be seen with other pulmonary processes. On the other hand, a reduced peak flow that improves by more than 20 percent approximately 10 to 20 minutes after administration of a quick-acting bronchodilator (eg, inhaled
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9396" href="/z/d/drug information/9396.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Even with careful measurements, PEF may vary as much as 10 to 15 percent from one measurement to the next. PEF results that vary little over time (less than 10 percent of the maximal value) despite the presence of symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath argue against the diagnosis of asthma. In contrast, PEF values that repeatedly fall by more than 20 percent when symptoms are present and return to baseline as symptoms resolve are consistent with asthma.

         The measurement of nitric oxide in a patient's exhaled breath can aid in the diagnosis of asthma in combination with other tests, but a normal level does not exclude asthma. The test is based on the observation that eosinophilic airway inflammation associated with asthma leads to up-regulation of nitric oxide synthase in the respiratory mucosa, which in turn generates increased amounts of nitric oxide gas in the exhaled breath. The concentration of nitric oxide (fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FENO]) in the exhaled breath of some persons with asthma is elevated above the levels found in normal individuals. An elevated FENO (≥40 to 50 parts per billion) can help “rule in” asthma, although potentially confounding respiratory diseases (eg, allergic rhinitis, eosinophilic bronchitis) must be excluded. Treatment with oral and/or inhaled glucocorticoids reduces airway inflammation and levels of exhaled nitric oxide. The measurement of FENO and its potential role in asthma diagnosis and monitoring are discussed separately. (See

         No blood tests are available that can determine the presence or absence of asthma or gauge its severity. However, a complete blood count (CBC) with differential white blood cell analysis to screen for eosinophilia or significant anemia may be helpful in certain cases. We typically obtain a CBC and differential when asthma symptoms are severe, the patient presents to the hospital with an exacerbation, nasal polyposis is present, the chest radiograph is abnormal (eg, suggestive of eosinophilic pneumonia or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Churg Strauss syndrome]), or a parasitic infection is suspected.

         Allergy tests are not useful for the diagnosis of asthma, but they can be helpful to confirm sensitivity to suspected allergic triggers of respiratory symptoms and to guide on-going management of asthma. We usually perform allergy testing in selected patients with a history of symptoms that occur upon exposure to particular aeroallergen(s)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80507" href="/z/d/graphic/80507.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), persistent symptoms and suspicion of exposure to relevant allergens in the home environment (eg, pet animals, dust, mold, cockroaches, or mice), and/or moderate-to-severe asthma symptoms despite conventional therapies. In addition to the peripheral blood eosinophil count mentioned above, the main tests for allergy are the total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) level and tests for specific allergic sensitization, which include blood testing for specific IgE antibody to inhalant allergens and skin testing with extracts of inhalant allergens.
        </p>
        <p>
         Measurement of total serum IgE levels is indicated in patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma when considering treatment with anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (

         </a>
         ) or when allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is suspected on the basis of eosinophilia, a positive skin test to aspergillus, or radiographic evidence of mucus plugging or central bronchiectasis. An elevated total IgE level may occur in the absence of asthma (eg, in allergic rhinitis or eczema), and allergic asthma may be present in the absence of an elevated total IgE level, which may not fully reflect the levels of mast cell-bound IgE in airway tissue. Very high total IgE levels (&gt;1000 IU/mL) are typically found in persons with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, certain parasitic infections, and sometimes eczema. Rare causes of very high serum IgE levels include hyperIgE syndrome (Job syndrome), Hodgkin Disease, and IgE myeloma. (See

         Allergic sensitivity to specific allergens in the environment can be assessed using either of two methods: blood tests for allergen-specific IgE or allergy skin tests.

         Blood tests for allergen-specific IgE most commonly utilize enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to measure minute quantities of IgE antibody specifically directed at particular allergens (as opposed to the total serum IgE discussed above). This type of blood test is often referred to as RAST, although the radioallergosorbent assay method has been replaced with a non-radioactive detection reagent, called an immunoassay. Based on the aeroallergens in the patient's geographic location and household, a panel of immunoassays is ordered. Aeroallergens (eg, house dust mite antigen [
         <em>
          Dermatophagoides farina
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus
         </em>
         ], cat and dog danders, cockroach antigen, mouse and rat antigens, pollens, and mold spores) are the types of allergens most commonly implicated in asthma. Orally ingested food allergens rarely cause isolated asthmatic symptoms; inhaled food particles (eg, fish cooking, peanut dust in a closed space) occasionally trigger asthma symptoms. By asking relatively few specific questions, clinicians can often elicit a potential relationship between allergen exposure and asthmatic symptoms that will guide the choice of which antigens to assess by immunoassay  (

          table 1

         ). When ordering these blood tests, one can select specific antigens for testing or choose among pre-grouped panels of antigens. The technique and accuracy of immunoassays are discussed separately. (See

         Allergy skin tests are performed to a panel of indoor and outdoor aeroallergens. The negative predictive value of skin testing (using prick and intradermal techniques) is very high, such that skin testing can exclude allergy with relative certainty. Skin testing should be performed by a trained allergy technician and interpreted by an allergy specialist. The indications, contraindications, technique, and interpretation of allergy skin tests are presented in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The advantages of in vitro testing over skin testing are that no trained technician is needed to apply the test, antihistamines and other medications do not interfere with the results, and there is no risk of adverse reactions (eg, inducing asthmatic reactions or anaphylaxis). The disadvantages are the greater cost and somewhat lesser sensitivity of immunoassays compared with skin testing and lack of the immediate and often powerful visual feedback for the patient that occurs with a positive skin test reaction.

         In the absence of comorbid illness, the chest radiograph is almost always normal in patients with asthma. However, many clinicians, including ourselves, obtain a chest radiograph for new-onset, moderate-to-severe asthma in adults over age 40 to exclude the occasional alternative diagnosis that may mimic asthma (eg, the mediastinal mass with tracheal compression or heart failure). The cost-effectiveness of this approach has not been evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, chest radiographs are routinely recommended when evaluating severe or "difficult-to-control" asthma and when co-morbid conditions (eg, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, eosinophilic pneumonia, or atelectasis due to mucus plugging) are suspected based on history, physical examination, and/or other laboratory data.
        </p>

         A history of intermittent symptoms typical of asthma plus the finding on physical examination of characteristic musical wheezing (present in association with symptoms and absent when symptoms resolve) strongly points to a diagnosis of asthma. Confirmation of the diagnosis of asthma is based on two key additional elements [

         Spirometry is the primary method for confirming variable airflow limitation. Variability may be demonstrated by testing before and after bronchodilator, from one office visit to another, or before and after bronchoprovocation challenge. Use of pulmonary function testing in this manner helps to prevent both over- and under-diagnosis of asthma [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,19,20
         </a>
         ]. The importance of confirming reversible airflow limitation was illustrated by a study of 701 randomly selected adults with a physician diagnosis of asthma in the previous five years [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Upon careful review by a panel of experts, the diagnosis of asthma was excluded in 33 percent and among these, less than half had had previous testing to confirm airflow limitation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pulmonary function testing'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The results of initial spirometry are used to guide the diagnostic approach, as described in the following sections.

         A symptom pattern suggestive of asthma AND airflow limitation on initial spirometry, which completely reverses to normal following bronchodilator, virtually clinch the diagnosis of asthma. Likewise, typical symptoms and a large reversibility of airflow obstruction on spirometry (increase in FEV
         <sub>
          1
         </sub>
         &gt;15 percent) generally confirm the diagnosis of asthma. (See

         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, reversible airflow obstruction in the patient with chronic cough but without other chest symptoms or wheezing on examination would assist in making the correct diagnosis of asthma. On the other hand, in a patient with characteristic symptoms of asthma and the presence of airflow obstruction on spirometry, the finding of little or no reversibility on a single test does not necessarily exclude asthma, as the airflow limitation can be caused by concomitant airway inflammation that will only reverse with anti-inflammatory medication (eg, inhaled or oral glucocorticoids) or removal from exposure to an aeroallergen. However, incomplete or absent reversibility should raise the possibility of an alternate diagnosis. (See

          1
         </sub>
         or PEF and record readings obtained twice a day for two weeks or with and without symptoms. The diagnosis of asthma is confirmed by a reliable series of recordings that document more than 20 percent variability in FEV
         <sub>
          1
         </sub>
         or PEF over time (especially when these reductions are associated with asthmatic symptoms). Individuals who experience little variability (10 percent or less) in their PEF, even when respiratory symptoms are present, likely do not have asthma [

         Similar data collection can take place in the clinician's office by recording spirometry or PEF at each patient visit. This method is less dependent on the reliability of the patient independently making self-measurements, although multiple visits may be required.

         In some instances, the history and clinical course are strongly suggestive of asthma, and a treatment trial is initiated as part of the diagnostic process. The combination of a typical presentation (eg, repeated episodes of typical symptoms triggered by typical stimuli), musical wheezes on auscultation, and a prompt response to anti-asthma medication may be used to make a presumptive diagnosis, as might occur for new-onset asthma presenting in an acute care setting. However, we agree with the NAEPP and GINA guidelines that the clinical diagnosis of asthma should be validated with objective data, whenever possible [

         Cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, while characteristic of asthma, are also symptoms of a number of other respiratory diseases affecting both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Some of these diseases can also result in airflow obstruction on spirometry. In addition, certain non-respiratory conditions (eg, heart failure, gastroesophageal reflux) may mimic asthma, and several common conditions (eg, chronic rhinosinusitis, laryngopharyngeal esophageal reflux) may coexist with asthma and increase its severity.

          Wheeze
         </strong>
         ─ Wheezing may be generated by luminal narrowing anywhere along the respiratory tract, including nares, pharynx, glottis, trachea, and bronchi. Inspiratory upper airway sounds, including stridor, are usually distinguishable from asthma. Expiratory wheezes emanating from the upper airway (eg, vocal cord dysfunction syndrome, also called paradoxical vocal fold motion disorder or inducible laryngeal obstruction) are often readily audible without a stethoscope but sound distant on auscultation of the lower chest. However, at times these upper airway sounds may be transmitted widely throughout the chest, making differentiation from asthma difficult. A focal, monophonic wheeze (eg, bronchogenic carcinoma or foreign body aspiration) should not be confused with asthma. The full spectrum of disorders that can cause wheezing is presented elsewhere.

          COPD
         </strong>
         typically presents in patients with a substantial smoking history (eg, &gt;20 pack years). The symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and cough with or without sputum production can mimic adult-onset asthma. Note that in persons with asthma and normal or near-normal lung function, airflow obstruction occurs
         <em>
          after
         </em>
         a 5- to 10-minute period of exercise (postexercise bronchoconstriction), distinct from the exertional dyspnea experienced immediately with strenuous exercise in persons with chronic airflow obstruction. Variable airflow obstruction over time and an improvement on postbronchodilator spirometry can be seen in COPD, similar to asthma, although the improvement in postbronchodilator spirometry is generally less pronounced in COPD and does not achieve normal values.

          Asthma and COPD overlap (ACO)

         is characterized by persistent airflow limitation (may be partially reversible) in patients with features of both asthma (atopy and large variability in airflow limitation) and COPD (history of cigarette smoking and a component of irreversible airflow obstruction) [

         , a condition of abnormal widening of the bronchi due to airway wall injury associated with chronic or recurrent infection, shares many clinical features with asthma, including inflamed airways, obstruction to airflow, and exacerbations characterized by increased dyspnea and sputum production. Bronchiectasis is suspected on the basis of prominent symptoms of cough with mucopurulent sputum production, recurrent chest infections, and sometimes hemoptysis. The diagnosis is usually established radiographically based on characteristic findings of bronchial wall thickening and luminal dilation seen on chest computed tomographic (CT) scans. (See

          Constrictive bronchiolitis
         </strong>
         , also known as bronchiolitis obliterans, is characterized by submucosal and peribronchiolar cellular infiltration and fibrosis that causes concentric narrowing and sometimes complete obliteration of the bronchiolar lumen. Constrictive bronchiolitis is most commonly seen following viral illness, inhalation injury, transplantation (eg, bone marrow, lung), or in the context of rheumatoid lung or inflammatory bowel disease  (

Pulmonary function tests show a progressive and irreversible airflow limitation. Findings on CT scan may include centrilobular bronchial wall thickening, bronchiolar dilation, tree-in-bud nodularity, and a mosaic pattern of attenuation of lung tissue density. (See

          Central airway obstruction
         </strong>
         can be caused by numerous benign and malignant processes and can mimic asthma with dyspnea on exertion that may progress to dyspnea with minimal activity. Monophonic wheezing or stridor may be present. Symptoms are minimally, if at all, improved by inhaled bronchodilator. A high index of suspicion is needed as conventional chest radiographs are rarely diagnostic. Flow-volume loops can show the characteristic changes of flow limitation due to upper airway obstruction  (

Dynamic chest CT scan with comparison of images collected at end inspiration and during forced expiration can be used to diagnose tracheobronchomalacia. The gold standard for diagnosis of central airway obstruction is direct visualization via bronchoscopy. (See

         Asthma develops as a result of a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. However, the important influence of social determinants of health on asthma prevalence and morbidity is being increasingly recognized. As defined by the US Department of Health and Human Services, social determinants of health are "the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks" [

         Poor-quality housing, increasing the likelihood of mold or rodent exposures, and neighborhoods with higher indoor and outdoor pollution are some of these factors that significantly affect patients with asthma [

          32
         </a>
         ]. Among adults in the United States, underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities and people living below the poverty level have a higher prevalence of asthma compared with other groups [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33,34

          35

         Consultation with an asthma specialist, either a pulmonologist or an allergist, is warranted when the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain, when the asthma is difficult-to-control, medication side effects are intolerable, or when a patient has frequent exacerbations. Pulmonologists may be most helpful if alternative pulmonary diseases are suspected or if further pulmonary testing or bronchoscopy may be needed. Referral to an allergist may be most helpful if allergic triggers need further evaluation or if concomitant nasal and ocular allergy symptoms are difficult-to-control.

          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – Asthma may develop at any age, although the majority of people with asthma are diagnosed in childhood. Obtaining the clinical history in an adult should include questions about the presence of symptoms earlier in life. Other historic clues that are highly suggestive of asthma include recurring, episodic symptoms, the presence of typical triggers (especially exercise, exertion in cold air, or allergen exposure), and a personal or family history of allergic disease  (

         <strong>
          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – The physical examination may be normal in asthma. The presence of abnormal findings (such as wheezing) is suggestive of asthma, although not specific. Asthmatic wheezing is typically composed of multiple high-pitched sounds audible most prominently during expiration. Nasal examination with an office otoscope should be included to check for the pale, swollen mucosa of associated allergic rhinitis and for nasal polyps, which raise the possibility of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.

         <strong>
          Pulmonary function testing
         </strong>
         – The pulmonary function tests most helpful in diagnosing asthma are spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator, bronchoprovocation testing (usually with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9622" href="/z/d/drug information/9622.html" rel="external">
          methacholine
         </a>
         ), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring. Expiratory airflow obstruction with a reversible reduction in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV
         <sub>
          1
         </sub>
         ), heightened sensitivity to bronchoprovocative agents such as methacholine or exercise, and variability over time of &gt;20 percent in PEF are findings consistent with asthma. (See

         <strong>
          Laboratory tests
         </strong>
         – Laboratory studies are sometimes indicated to identify potential asthma triggers and exclude alternative diagnoses, including blood tests (eg, complete blood count with white blood cell differential, total serum immunoglobulin E, and allergen-specific immunoassays), skin testing for environmental allergies, and a chest radiograph. (See
         <a class="local">

          Imaging
         </strong>
         – A chest radiograph is not routinely recommended as part of the diagnostic evaluation. However, many clinicians, including ourselves, obtain a chest radiograph in patients with atypical features (eg, chronic purulent sputum production, persistently localized wheezing, inspiratory crackles, fever, clubbing) and for new-onset, moderate-to-severe asthma in adults over age 40.

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of asthma is based upon the presence or history of symptoms consistent with asthma (most commonly episodic cough, wheezing, or dyspnea provoked by typical triggers) combined with the demonstration of variable expiratory airflow obstruction. The strategies for using pulmonary function testing vary based on the results of initial spirometry. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator (preferred)
         </strong>
         – The preferred approach to the diagnosis of asthma is the use of spirometry to identify reversible airflow obstruction. An obstructive pattern with an increase in FEV
         <sub>
          1
         </sub>
         or FVC of &gt;10 percent relative to the predicted value following administration of two to four puffs of a quick-acting bronchodilator is suggestive of asthma, especially if postbronchodilator spirometry is normal. (See

         <sub>
          1

         or PEF over time at home or in the office. Patients can track the results in a peak flow diary  (

          figure 4
         </a>
         ). A variability of &gt;20 percent that corresponds to symptoms is strongly suggestive of asthma. PEF measurement can be combined with a therapeutic trial of inhaled bronchodilator. (See

          History-based diagnosis
         </strong>
         – For clinical settings in which neither spirometry nor serial peak flow measurement is available, a diagnosis of

          probable
         </strong>
         asthma can be made based upon history alone, provided the patient has typical symptoms that respond promptly and completely to therapy. History-based diagnosis is also appropriate for urgent care settings when patients respond to asthma therapies as expected. Peak flow measurements are appropriate in these office-based and urgent care settings to supplement history and exam. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The differential diagnosis of asthma includes respiratory and non-respiratory conditions that may cause similar symptoms, wheezing on examination, and/or an obstructive pattern on spirometry. Evaluation should include assessment for conditions that may co-exist with asthma and worsen its severity. (See

         <strong>
          Social determinants of health –
         </strong>
         Asthma prevalence and morbidity are influenced by social determinants of health, and in the United States these factors have a disproportionate effect on certain populations. Consideration of these factors is important in the evaluation of the asthma patient. (See
