Among adults in resource-abundant settings, diarrhea is often a "nuisance disease" in the healthy individual.</p><p>Most cases of acute diarrhea in adults are of infectious etiology, and most cases resolve with symptomatic treatment alone. When clinicians care for adults with diarrhea, two important decision points are when to perform stool testing and whether to initiate empiric antimicrobial therapy. Our approach to adults with acute diarrhea will be reviewed here and generally focuses on distinguishing those infectious etiologies for which treatment is beneficial from other causes  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68348" href="/z/d/graphic/68348.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>In the United States, expert guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute diarrhea include guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] and the American College of Gastroenterology [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Links to these and other guidelines can be found elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.) </p><p>The evaluation of persistent and chronic diarrhea, which is often of a noninfectious etiology, and specific causes of acute diarrhea and chronic diarrhea are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2689.html" rel="external">"Causes of acute infectious diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-abundant settings"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2591.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p>Diarrhea in travelers in or returning from resource-limited settings and the approach to diarrhea in residents of resource-limited settings are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2709.html" rel="external">"Travelers' diarrhea: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99648.html" rel="external">"Travelers' diarrhea: Treatment and prevention"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13954.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3559493706"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diarrhea is defined as the passage of loose or watery stools, typically at least three times in a 24-hour period [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. It reflects increased water content of the stool, whether due to impaired water absorption and/or active water secretion by the bowel. </p><p>The following definitions have been suggested according to the duration of symptoms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute – 14 days or fewer in duration</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent diarrhea – More than 14 but fewer than 30 days in duration</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic – More than 30 days in duration</p><p></p><p>Invasive diarrhea, or dysentery, is defined as diarrhea with visible blood or mucus, in contrast to watery diarrhea. Dysentery is commonly associated with fever and abdominal pain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most cases of acute diarrhea are due to infections and are self-limited. The major causes of acute infectious diarrhea include viruses (norovirus, rotavirus, adenoviruses, astrovirus, and others), bacteria (<em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Clostridioides difficile</em>, and others), and protozoa (<em>Cryptosporidium</em>, <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cyclospora</em>, <em>Entamoeba</em>, and others)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097" href="/z/d/graphic/116097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p>Taken together, most cases of acute infectious diarrhea are likely viral, as indicated by the observation that stool cultures are positive in only 1.5 to 5.6 percent of cases in most studies [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Among those with severe diarrhea, however, bacterial causes are responsible for more cases. As an example, in a study of 173 healthy adults with severe acute community-acquired diarrhea (defined in this study as ≥4 fluid stools per day for more than three days), a bacterial pathogen was identified in 87 percent of cases [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Protozoa are less commonly identified as the etiologic agents of acute gastrointestinal illness.</p><p>Updated information on outbreaks may be found on websites maintained by the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ffoodnet%2Freports%2Findex.html&amp;token=R4Uiw8%2FbmPVaqNHRDqpXLP%2F2QvaEIA4SKO0gOEuf1VgY0YkeS8eQxq4ypPiI8NSzyeT%2FmnPtuFxMsoc8brVKag%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2717" target="_blank">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Ffood%2Frecalls-outbreaks-emergencies%2Foutbreaks-foodborne-illness&amp;token=RnGqCfYGTGgdz5387EFWwvy4g0FBsVH2%2F8GNTYjMB5LrJLowNdHBE3AHH5VQdHvjZEGstInrU%2FzZFkdijUOFBBVMo%2FciHvaLQZ9RU37rpBQ%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2717" target="_blank">US Food and Drug Administration</a>. The United States Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) conducts active population-based surveillance for laboratory-diagnosed enteric infections; in 2021, there were 8 percent fewer infections than the average during 2016 to 2018, which may reflect an effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Noninfectious etiologies become more common as the course of the diarrhea persists and becomes chronic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2591.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p>Exact data on the frequency of different causes of acute diarrhea vary according to the definition used, the diagnostic technology available, and the population studied. In addition, the prevalence of an identifiable infectious agent is probably grossly underestimated since many patients do not seek medical attention and testing is often not performed when patients do contact their clinician. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2689.html" rel="external">"Causes of acute infectious diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Most common causes overall'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H220331177"><span class="h2">General principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most adults with acute diarrhea do not present to medical care, since symptoms are often mild and/or transient. </p><p>Clinical evaluation for acute diarrhea is warranted for individuals with persistent fever, bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, symptoms of volume depletion (eg, dark or scant urine, symptoms of orthostasis), or a history of inflammatory bowel disease. Hospitalization may be warranted in the presence of such concerns, in particular if there is a complex medical history of immunosuppression (eg, because of treatment for malignancy, history of transplantation, or advanced human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) or significant vascular or cardiovascular disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3208048399"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation of patients who present to medical care with acute diarrhea should include a careful history to determine the duration of symptoms, the frequency and characteristics of the stool, and associated symptoms. Additionally, there should be an attempt to elicit evidence of extracellular volume depletion (eg, dark yellow or scant urine, decreased skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension). Questioning about potential exposures, such as food history, residence, occupational exposure, recent and remote travel, pets, and hobbies, can also provide further diagnostic clues. These historical elements can be helpful to suggest the potential causative pathogens  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097" href="/z/d/graphic/116097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), which in turn can inform additional work-up and the decision to use empiric antibiotic therapy. (See <a class="local">'Stool tests for bacterial pathogens'</a> below and <a class="local">'Additional testing in specific circumstances'</a> below and <a class="local">'Empiric antibiotic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Character of symptoms</strong> – In addition to informing the severity of disease, details on the frequency and nature of the stool can suggest whether the diarrhea is originating in the small or the large bowel, and thus can suggest certain pathogens  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81945" href="/z/d/graphic/81945.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Diarrhea of small bowel origin is typically watery, of large volume, and associated with abdominal cramping, bloating, and gas [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Weight loss can occur if diarrhea becomes persistent. Fever is rarely a significant symptom and occult blood or inflammatory cells in the stool are rarely identified. In contrast, diarrhea of large intestinal origin often presents with frequent, regular, small volume, and often painful bowel movements. Fever and bloody or mucoid stools are common, and red blood cells and inflammatory cells can be seen routinely on stool microscopy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These inflammatory signs associated with large bowel infection (fever, bloody or mucoid stools) suggest invasive bacteria (eg, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, or <em>Campylobacter</em>), enteric viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV] or adenovirus), <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>, or a cytotoxic organism such as <em>C. difficile</em> [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Visibly bloody acute diarrhea is relatively uncommon and raises the possibility of Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em> (STEC) (eg, <em>E. coli </em>O157:H7) infection. Other bacterial causes of visibly bloody diarrhea are <em>Shigella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, and <em>Salmonella</em> species. Bloody diarrhea can also reflect noninfectious etiologies such as inflammatory bowel disease or ischemic colitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2689.html" rel="external">"Causes of acute infectious diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Diarrhea'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Syndromes that begin with diarrhea but progress to fever and systemic complaints, such as headache and muscle aches, should raise the possibility of other etiologies, including a typhoidal illness (particularly in travelers from resource-limited settings) or infection with <em>Listeria</em> monocytogenes (particularly if a stiff neck is also present or the patient is a pregnant woman).</p><p></p><p>Other details that can provide clues to the microbiological diagnosis include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097" href="/z/d/graphic/116097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Food history</strong> – Consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, raw or undercooked meat or fish, or organic vitamin preparations may suggest certain pathogens.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2709.html" rel="external">"Travelers' diarrhea: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Occupation in daycare centers has been associated with infections with <em>Shigella</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>Giardia</em>. Rotavirus is a potential consideration, but in countries that routinely immunize infants against rotavirus, infection due to rotavirus has decreased substantially.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medical history</strong> – It is also important to ask about recent antibiotic use (as a clue to the presence of <em>C. difficile </em>infection), other medications (such as proton pump inhibitors, which can increase the risk of infectious diarrhea), and to obtain a complete past medical history (eg, to identify an immunocompromised host or the possibility of nosocomial infection). As examples of medical history informing the likelihood of various pathogens, pregnancy increases the risk of listeriosis following consumption of contaminated meat products or unpasteurized dairy products approximately 20-fold, cirrhosis has been associated with <em>Vibrio</em> infection, and hemochromatosis has been associated with <em>Yersinia</em> infection. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1957910733"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The examination focuses on evaluating volume status and identifying complications. </p><p>Volume depletion can be suggested by dry mucous membranes, diminished skin turgor, postural or frank reductions in blood pressure, and altered sensorium. These signs can be mild or absent with early hypovolemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2298.html" rel="external">"Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The abdominal examination should evaluate for findings that can suggest ileus or peritonitis, including abdominal distension, pain with gentle percussion, abdominal rigidity, or rebound tenderness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/290.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with nontraumatic abdominal or flank pain in the emergency department", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H659511455"><span class="h2">General laboratory tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laboratory tests are not routinely warranted for most patients with acute diarrhea. If substantial volume depletion is present (suggested by signs or symptoms such as dark and concentrated urine), a basic metabolic panel should be performed to screen for hypokalemia or renal dysfunction. The complete blood count does not reliably distinguish bacterial etiologies of diarrhea from others but may be helpful in suggesting severe disease or potential complications. A low platelet count may prompt concern for the development of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and a leukemoid reaction is consistent with the diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em> infection. Blood cultures should be obtained in patients with high fevers or who appear systemically ill. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Stool tests for bacterial pathogens</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H406269883"><span class="h3">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients who do not have severe illness or high-risk comorbidities, it is reasonable to continue expectant management for several days without microbiologic stool testing (either stool cultures or multiplex molecular panel tests) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>We pursue microbiologic stool testing for patients with acute community-acquired diarrhea and the following features  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68348" href="/z/d/graphic/68348.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,3,9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe illness </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hypovolemia </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Passage of &gt;6 unformed stools per 24 hours </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Severe abdominal pain</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other signs or symptoms concerning for inflammatory diarrhea</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bloody diarrhea </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Passage of many small volume stools containing blood and mucus</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Temperature ≥38.5ºC (101.3ºF)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High-risk host features</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age ≥70 years </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Comorbidities, such as cardiac disease, which may be exacerbated by hypovolemia or rapid infusion of fluid</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Immunocompromising condition (including advanced HIV infection)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Inflammatory bowel disease</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pregnancy </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptoms persisting for more than one week</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Public health concerns (eg, diarrheal illness in food handlers, health care workers, and individuals in day care centers)</p><p></p><p>The main reason for microbiologic stool testing in these patients with acute diarrhea is to identify a potential bacterial pathogen that would inform the potential for complications and treatment decisions. </p><p>We typically perform stool cultures for microbiologic stool testing, which can identify the most common bacterial causes of diarrhea. Many laboratories are also adopting multiplex molecular panels to perform microbiologic stool testing. These issues are further discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Stool culture'</a> below and <a class="local">'Multipathogen molecular panels'</a> below.) </p><p>If patients have exposures associated with certain other bacterial pathogens, special culture work-up may be warranted, as below.

A routine stool culture will identify <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, and <em>Shigella</em>, the three most common causes of bacterial diarrhea in the United States. <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 can be isolated on sorbitol-MacConkey plates or identified with antigen testing or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of stool (see <a class="local">'Bloody diarrhea'</a> below). A stool culture that is positive for one of these pathogens in a patient with acute diarrheal symptoms can be interpreted as a true positive.

The spectrum of parasites associated with persistent diarrhea can vary based on exposures or populations. In general, <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>E. histolytica</em> are the most common parasitic pathogens in patients with persistent diarrhea. Persistent diarrhea following travel to certain locations, such as Russia, Nepal, or mountainous regions, is associated with <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, or <em>Cyclospora</em>. Persistent diarrhea with exposure to infants in daycare centers has been associated with <em>Giardia</em> and <em>Cryptosporidium</em>. Microsporidium should be a consideration in immunocompromised patients with persistent diarrhea.</p><p>Most of these pathogens can be diagnosed by microscopy for ova and parasites. Three specimens should be sent on consecutive days (or each specimen separated by at least 24 hours) for ova and parasite examination since parasite excretion may be intermittent. Routine microscopy does not detect cryptosporidia spores; if suspected, the laboratory should be alerted to the potential diagnosis, and specific stains (eg, modified acid fast or trichrome stains) for the organisms should be requested. <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>Entamoeba</em> can also be detected by antigen or molecular testing.

Furthermore, there continues to be some concern that antimotility agents can prolong the duration of fever, diarrhea, and excretion of the organism in some types of dysenteric illnesses (eg, <em>Shigella</em>) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>], and so are avoided in such cases. </p><p>When compared with placebo, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="101044" href="/z/d/drug information/101044.html" rel="external">bismuth subsalicylate</a> significantly reduced the number of unformed stools and increased the proportion of patients free of symptoms at the end of treatment trials [<a href="#rid30">30-32</a>]. However, in studies that compared bismuth subsalicylate with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9571" href="/z/d/drug information/9571.html" rel="external">loperamide</a>, loperamide brought significantly faster relief [<a href="#rid30">30,33,34</a>]. A role for bismuth subsalicylate may be in patients with significant fever and dysentery, conditions in which loperamide should be avoided. If used, the total dose of bismuth salicylate should be monitored, especially in pregnant women, to prevent salicylate toxicity. </p><p>If available, racecadotril, an enkephalinase inhibitor, has been demonstrated in several studies to reduce the output and duration of diarrhea, and in some studies, leads to more rapid improvement with fewer adverse effects compared with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9571" href="/z/d/drug information/9571.html" rel="external">loperamide</a> [<a href="#rid35">35-37</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H268444605"><span class="h2">Dietary guidance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The benefit of specific dietary recommendations other than oral hydration has not been well established in controlled trials. However, adequate nutrition during an episode of acute diarrhea is important to facilitate enterocyte renewal [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]; if patients are anorectic or have nausea and vomiting, a short period of consuming only liquids will not be harmful. Boiled starches and cereals (eg, potatoes, noodles, rice, wheat, and oat) with salt are indicated in patients with watery diarrhea; crackers, bananas, soup, and boiled vegetables may also be consumed [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Foods with high fat content should be avoided until the gut function returns to normal after a severe bout of diarrhea.</p><p>Dairy products (except yogurt) may be difficult to digest in the presence of diarrheal disease. This is due to secondary lactose malabsorption, which is common following infectious enteritis and may last for several weeks to months. Thus, temporary avoidance of lactose-containing foods is reasonable.

Overall, most cases of infectious diarrhea are likely viral; however, bacterial causes are responsible for most cases of severe diarrhea. (See <a class="local">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>History and physical examination</strong> − Most adults with acute diarrhea do not present to medical care because of the mild or transient nature of the symptoms. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For those who present to medical care, the initial evaluation should assess for extracellular volume depletion (eg, dark yellow urine or scant amount of urine, decreased skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension) and determine the duration of symptoms, the frequency and characteristics of the stool, and associated symptoms (eg, fever and peritoneal signs). (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Diagnostic clues</strong> − Inflammatory features (eg, fever, or bloody or mucoid stool) suggest infection of the large bowel, which is associated with pathogens distinct from small bowel infection  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81945" href="/z/d/graphic/81945.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Potential exposures, such as food history, residence, occupational exposure, recent and remote travel, pets, and hobbies, can also provide further diagnostic clues as to potential microbiologic etiology  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097" href="/z/d/graphic/116097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indications for stool testing</strong> − We obtain a stool sample for testing (stool culture and/or multiplex molecular testing) in the following circumstances  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68348" href="/z/d/graphic/68348.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>): </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Severe illness (fever ≥38.5°C [101.3°F], hypovolemia, ≥6 unformed stools per 24 hours, severe abdominal pain, or hospitalization)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Features of inflammatory diarrhea (bloody diarrhea, small volume mucous stools, fever)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>High-risk host features (age ≥70 years, cardiac disease, immunosuppression, inflammatory bowel disease, pregnancy)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Symptoms persisting &gt;1 week</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Public health concerns (eg, diarrheal illness in food handlers, health care workers, and individuals in day care centers)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For most other patients, it is reasonable to continue expectant management for several days without performing stool testing.

Grossly bloody diarrhea warrants testing for Shiga toxin (to identify Shiga toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> [STEC]) and fecal leukocytes or lactoferrin, if available. Testing for <em>Clostridioides</em> <em>difficile</em> should be performed in cases of recent antibiotic use or health care exposure. Testing for parasites is not warranted in the majority of patients with acute diarrhea. It is useful, however, in patients with persistent diarrhea, in men who have sex with men, in immunocompromised hosts, during a community waterborne outbreak (associated with <em>Giardia</em> and <em>Cryptosporidium</em>), or with bloody diarrhea with few or no fecal leukocytes (associated with intestinal amebiasis). Parasitic tests include microscopy for ova and parasites as well as antigen or molecular testing for specific organisms.
