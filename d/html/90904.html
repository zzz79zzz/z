         The treatment of asthma is based upon assessment of severity and, in those already on therapy, upon assessment of asthma control. This topic provides a general outline of assessing initial asthma severity in children younger than 12 years of age, determining when to start daily controller therapy, and assessing and monitoring control to determine if therapy modifications are needed.

         ]. The severity is determined by the most severe category detected. As an example, a child who has symptoms approximately four days per week, uses short-acting beta agonists approximately three days per week, has minor limitations in normal activities, and has had only one course of oral glucocorticoids for an exacerbation in the past year (all categorized as "mild") but has had nighttime awakenings four times a month (categorized as "moderate") is considered to have asthma of moderate severity. Asthma severity does not predict the severity of exacerbations. Even children with mild asthma can have severe exacerbations. (See

         Initial assessment of patients who have confirmed asthma begins with a severity classification because selection of the type, amount, and scheduling of therapy corresponds to the level of asthma severity. This assessment is made immediately after diagnosis or when the patient is first encountered, generally before the patient is taking any form of long-term controller medication. If the assessment is made during a visit in which the patient is treated for an acute exacerbation, then asking the patient to recall symptoms and short-acting beta agonist use in the period before the onset of the current exacerbation will suffice to determine impairment until the following visit.

         The degree of severity while not on long-term controller medications determines which "step" or level of initial therapy is needed. Other factors, including the risk of developing persistent asthma, are also taken into consideration in children under five years of age. (See

         It is more useful to assess degree of asthma control rather than severity in patients who are already on daily controller asthma treatment. Thus, the Joint Task Force of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society also recommend defining asthma severity as the degree of difficulty in achieving asthma control while on daily controller treatment, in addition to the components of severity discussed above [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. (See

          'Assessment of control'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Severity may be influenced by the underlying phenotype, environmental and social factors (including smoking, fine particulate matter from pollution, stress, and violence), adherence to treatment, drug delivery technique, and comorbidities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with severe asthma can include those who are untreated, who are difficult to treat, and who are maximally treated but resistant to therapy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. As an example, children are considered to have severe asthma if they are poorly controlled on several daily medications or if they are well controlled but require three controller medications to maintain asthma control.

         The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) recommends defining asthma control as the extent to which therapy reduces or eliminates the manifestations of asthma [

This tool assesses impairment of asthma control (symptom burden, activity limitations, and rescue use of bronchodilators) and is the first to also assess risk (oral glucocorticoid use in the past 12 months) [

         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The questionnaire collects information on "actionable items," such as asthma triggers, treatment adherence, inhaler technique, and patient/parent/caregiver perception of response to treatment, in addition to assessment of control. The Asthma APGAR system was found to similarly assess asthma control compared with the ACT. It appears to be a promising tool that provides additional guidance to aid clinicians in improving asthma care, although further study of this system is needed before it is used routinely in clinical care. The PACCI is useful in identifying children with uncontrolled asthma and has both an English and a Spanish version available.

         Patients should be reevaluated after initiation of controller therapy to determine its effectiveness. A reasonable interval is two to four weeks for patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma and four to six weeks for children with mild persistent asthma since two- to six-week intervals are usually necessary to adequately assess the response to a given intervention  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78322 graphicRef64986" href="/z/d/graphic/78322.html" rel="external">

          table 1A-B
         </a>
         ). Patients with well-controlled asthma typically follow-up every three months to assess response to treatment, but this may be more or less frequent depending upon asthma severity. In contrast, those with not well-controlled asthma or very poorly controlled asthma should follow up in two to six weeks and two weeks, respectively, to evaluate their response to step-up therapy.

         Step-down therapy is considered when asthma control has been achieved for at least three months  (

         </a>
         ). Factors that affect this decision include severity of asthma, how difficult it was to attain control, and potential triggers. A longer period of control is often preferred before decreasing therapy in a patient with more severe asthma. Step-down therapy is more commonly attempted in the summer but may be delayed at the start of the school year or the onset of the winter viral respiratory infection season. The step-down approach may also proceed more slowly in patients with ongoing exposures to potential triggers such as tobacco smoke or unavoidable pet exposure (eg, home, grandparent's home, daycare, etc) in a child with an animal dander allergy. Patients who have had a reduction in therapy should be reassessed in one to two months. Attempts should be made to reduce the regimen as tolerated in patients who remain in good control.

          Initial assessment of asthma severity
         </strong>
         – Asthma severity is the intrinsic intensity of disease. Initial assessment of patients who have confirmed asthma begins with a severity classification because selection of the type, amount, and scheduling of therapy corresponds to the level of asthma severity. This assessment is made immediately after diagnosis or when the patient is first encountered, generally before the patient is taking some form of long-term controller medication. Assessment is made on the basis of components of
         <strong>
          current impairment
         </strong>
         and
         <strong>
          future risk
