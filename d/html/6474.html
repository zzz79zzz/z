This information can be used by clinicians to counsel children and families regarding the development of an overall physical fitness program that includes strength training. Strength training for adults is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/115880.html" rel="external">"Strength training for health in adults: Terminology, principles, benefits, and risks"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116613.html" rel="external">"Practical guidelines for implementing a strength training program for adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the discussion below, the terms "child" and "children" refer to boys and girls who have not yet developed secondary sex characteristics (Tanner stages 1 and 2, ie, preadolescence). Adolescence refers to the period of time between childhood and adulthood (Tanner stages 3 and 4). The term "youth" broadly refers to both children and adolescents.

A panel convened by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that school-age children participate in at least 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (most of which should be aerobic activity) that is age and developmentally appropriate and enjoyable [<a href="#rid1">1,8-12</a>]. As part of the 60 minutes or more of daily physical activity, children and adolescents should include muscle- and bone-strengthening activities on at least three days per week [<a href="#rid10">10,12</a>]. However, a surveillance study published by the CDC in 2017 found that only 26 percent of adolescents met suggested guidelines for aerobic activity, 51 percent for muscle-strengthening exercise, and 20 percent for both [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Duration'</a> below.) Screening children for appropriate types and duration of physical activity is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2872.html" rel="external">"Screening tests in children and adolescents", section on 'Physical activity assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Increased levels of physical activity and fitness during childhood and adolescence are associated with reduced risk of disease in adulthood (eg, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, selected cancers, and musculoskeletal conditions) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. However, these benefits usually are not the motivating factors for physical activity among children and adolescents. Children and adolescents participate in exercise or strength-training programs to improve physical fitness, performance, body composition, and body image, or to alleviate boredom and to socialize [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2786.html" rel="external">"The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise", section on 'Benefits of exercise'</a>.)</p><p>The CDC recommends multifaceted approaches to promote physical activity among young people [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Their guidelines suggest that health care providers, schools, the community, and the fitness industry cooperate to provide safe environments and facilities for developmentally appropriate physical activity, as well as appropriate instruction, supervision, and role models for youth. Although physical activity guidelines for adults have been updated several times over the past two decades, recommendations specific to children and adolescents have remained consistent [<a href="#rid10">10,16,17</a>]. The CDC has developed a <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhealthyschools%2Fphysicalactivity%2Fguidelines.htm&amp;token=THyRbO5M0oq1VBwk4TJo4SmQalIMTHNU5emB6C3bkW8hN4sDbdsHCQfeOKrzn0loEGTQEXccfnpCL87zwqbBR6h25nZwJZCyj3exNWWpCQ0%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6474" target="_blank">Youth Physical Activity Guidelines Toolkit</a> that can be used to promote youth physical activity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Duration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children should be encouraged to participate in regular physical activity to establish healthy lifestyle habits at an early age. Portions of a child's free time should be devoted to participation in play, recreation, sports, and other physical activities that improve each of the components of physical fitness.</p><p>A panel convened by the CDC recommends that school-age children participate in at least 60 minutes per day of MVPA that is developmentally appropriate and enjoyable [<a href="#rid8">8,11</a>]. The activity may occur in the context of play, games, sports, work, transportation, recreation, physical education, or planned exercise [<a href="#rid1">1,8</a>]. Examples of moderate physical activity include hiking, skateboarding, and brisk walking; examples of vigorous physical activity include jumping rope, running, and sports such as soccer, basketball, and ice or field hockey [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. As part of the 60 minutes per day of MVPA, muscle-strengthening (eg, climbing ropes or jungle gym, bodyweight exercises [push-ups, pull-ups], weightlifting) and bone-strengthening activities (eg, jumping rope, running, skipping) are recommended three days per week [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Longitudinal data collected from accelerometers in the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (2000 to 2006) indicate that virtually all nine-year-old children met the CDC guideline for MVPA, engaging in an average of approximately three hours of MVPA per day (as measured by an accelerometer) [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. However, by 15 years of age, MVPA declined to an average of 50 minutes per day on weekdays and 37 minutes per day on weekends, with only 32 and 18 percent of 15-year-olds meeting the CDC guidelines for MVPA on weekdays and weekends, respectively. According to the 2010 National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey, only 15 percent of high school students participate in ≥60 minutes of aerobic physical activity per day [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Reduced physical activity during adolescence predicts reduced physical activity in adulthood, which has potential long-term health implications [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. In a large prospective observational study of physical activity in United States adolescents and young adults (10<sup>th</sup> grade through post-high school), less than 9 percent of study participants met the recommended minimum of 60 minutes of daily moderate-intensity physical activity [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. This study found that males tend to be more physically active than females and youth are more physically active on weekdays than on weekends. Subsequent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 2007 to 2016) show that 88 percent of boys and 78 percent of girls 12 to 17 years of age self-report some moderate or vigorous physical activity [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Among the subjects in this study reporting any activity, females generally reported less than the recommended daily amount. </p><p>Overall, the data collected on physical activity suggest that the percentage of youth who meet physical activity recommendations remains relatively low, females participate in less physical activity than males, physical activity levels among youth appear to be related to race and income, and physical activity levels decline as youth move into young adulthood. This decline in physical activity as youth transition into adulthood is associated with an increase in body mass index (BMI) and related medical problems. Exercise in adults is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2786.html" rel="external">"The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107636.html" rel="external">"Exercise for adults: Terminology, patient assessment, and medical clearance"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120020.html" rel="external">"Exercise prescription and guidance for adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Benefits of regular physical activity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several systematic reviews have identified a wide range of benefits derived from regular physical activity in school-age children, although the strength of the evidence supporting these findings is variable [<a href="#rid8">8,14,24,25</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced adiposity in overweight youth [<a href="#rid26">26-28</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduction of blood pressure in youth with mild essential hypertension [<a href="#rid26">26,29,30</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduction in cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels in youth with high cholesterol or obesity [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improved bone health [<a href="#rid32">32-34</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improved aerobic fitness [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>] and cardiometabolic health [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improved muscular strength and endurance [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improved psychosocial well-being [<a href="#rid38">38-42</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced risk of depression [<a href="#rid11">11,37</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improved cognitive performance [<a href="#rid43">43-46</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improved academic performance [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]</p><p></p><p>Development and maintenance of muscle strength and endurance is important in the performance of activities of daily living but also may improve performance in recreational or competitive activities [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Strength training is a safe and effective method of developing muscular strength and endurance in youth, provided that the program is well designed and supervised and participants are trained in proper techniques [<a href="#rid2">2,3,48,49</a>]. The program should be tailored to the individual with respect to maturation, duration of training, motor skill competency, technical proficiency, and existing strength [<a href="#rid2">2,38,50,51</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Strength training: Safety and benefits'</a> below and <a class="local">'Principles of training'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to their immediate benefits, improvements in aerobic fitness achieved during childhood are associated with better health during adulthood [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. The health benefits of regular physical activity for adults are well established and discussed in detail separately [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2786.html" rel="external">"The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise", section on 'Benefits of exercise'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Organized programs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An increasing number of children are participating in organized sports. The younger the participant, the greater are the concerns about safety and benefits.</p><p>Young participants are often enticed by the success of professional athletes. The reality is that very few high school senior athletes will be drafted to play professional sports [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. In addition, college scholarships can motivate young athletes (and parents) to commit to specialized training at an early age. Nonetheless, youth, particularly children, should be encouraged to participate in regular physical activity and exercise for the sake of enjoyment and not merely competition. Emphasis should be given to increasing habitual physical activity.</p><p>Chronological age; physical, cognitive, and social maturity; and developmental physiology must be taken into consideration when developing and implementing physical activity and exercise programs for youth. Children have different physiologic responses to exercise than do adults and require different programs to acquire health benefits, develop fitness, and/or improve performance [<a href="#rid54">54-56</a>].</p><p>Participation need not begin with competitive sports. Participation may evolve from preparatory physical activity, recreation, or conditioning programs [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. It is thought that participation in strength-building activities before sports participation may prevent, reduce the risks of, or lessen the severity of sports-related injuries, but there is no conclusive evidence to support this [<a href="#rid49">49,57,58</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Injury prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Safe and effective organized activities and sports for children have age- and developmentally appropriate objectives, which include [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acquisition of basic motor skills</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing physical activity levels</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Learning social skills (eg, working as a team, good sportsmanship)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Having fun</p><p></p><p>Participation in organized activities and sports provides an opportunity for children to learn to follow age- or skill-appropriate rules and to develop self-discipline, self-esteem, and leadership [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].</p><p>Organized programs also should teach youth about their bodies, promote injury prevention, and provide education about health-related topics (eg, proper nutrition, hydration, and substance abuse, such as ergogenic aids or anabolic steroids). These programs should contribute to the overall development of the child and the adoption of lifelong exercise behaviors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Components</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>General physical conditioning should be part of every organized sports program. Physical fitness should be improved to safely and enjoyably participate in a sport. A well-designed exercise program may increase the likelihood that a child will participate in other activities and develop positive physical activity behaviors [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Broadly based participation in a variety of skills and activities is related to increased participation and success in sports later in life [<a href="#rid59">59,60</a>].</p><p>A general strength-training program is beneficial as one component of an overall conditioning program, adds variety to the exercise program, and increases adherence. (See <a class="local">'Strength training: Safety and benefits'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Role of the primary care provider</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most youth visit their primary care clinician at least once per year. Thus, the health care system provides a promising opportunity to promote physical activity in youth. Because of the focus on prevention services during annual visits, primary care providers are in a unique position to promote physical activity. Primary care providers can reassure their young patients and their parents that, with proper supervision and equipment and realistic expectations, strength-training programs designed for children and adolescents are safe and effective.</p><p>Overall, the primary care clinician has several roles in promoting physical fitness for their young patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Encouraging daily physical activity in all children and youth and, for those who are interested, promoting a well-rounded general conditioning program to improve or maintain all of the components of physical fitness</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Helping parents determine the readiness of their child to participate in organized sports or a strength-training program (see <a class="local">'Readiness to participate'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Performing the pre-participation examination (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6472.html" rel="external">"Sports participation in children and adolescents: The preparticipation physical evaluation"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identifying contraindications and limitations to participation and defining modifications to participation and training</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Providing education and anticipatory guidance regarding nutrition, hydration, ergogenic aids, or performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic steroids (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2866.html" rel="external">"Dietary recommendations for toddlers and preschool and school-age children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120019.html" rel="external">"Nutritional and non-medication supplements permitted for performance enhancement"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15454.html" rel="external">"Prohibited non-hormonal performance-enhancing drugs in sport"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7475.html" rel="external">"Use of androgens and other hormones by athletes"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Educating families on how to select experienced and qualified fitness or strength and conditioning specialists (see <a class="local">'Choosing a coach'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The National Prevention Strategy recommends that clinicians conduct physical activity assessments, provide counseling, and refer patients to allied health care or health and fitness professionals [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]</p><p></p><p>In addition, primary care providers can work with sports administrators and coaches in the community to share relevant information on injury prevention, injury assessment, rehabilitation, first aid, safety, and guidelines for returning to full activity following an injury.

However, improper training loads and lifting techniques, and poor supervision, contributed to most of the injuries reported in the literature at that time. Two reports using data from injury surveillance systems for weight training-related injuries from 1990 to 2007 [<a href="#rid68">68</a>] and from 2003 to 2005 [<a href="#rid69">69,70</a>] found that child injuries during weightlifting most often involved the hands and feet and were due to accidents, such as dropping weights. Thus, the majority of injuries are preventable with proper supervision and compliance with safety guidelines.</p><p>Mature, responsible coaching and supervision is the key to preventing strength training-related injuries in youth. Most physical activities entail some degree of risk for musculoskeletal injury. However, most injuries are not related exclusively to strength training and may occur in any activity or sport [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. A well-supervised strength-training program poses no greater risk (and often less risk) to youth than does participation in many other recreational activities or sports [<a href="#rid2">2,49,67</a>]. A review of strength training programs in schools found no evidence of a higher prevalence of injury due to strength training when following a well-designed strength program [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].</p><p>Strength training poses a small risk of injury to the skeleton and soft tissues. The traditional concern in children is the potential for damage to the epiphyseal (growth) plate. However, an appropriate frequency of strength training using recommended loads, sets, and repetitions typically does not impose excessive stress on the physes and does not impair growth. Prolonged periods of repetitive impact activities, as seen in gymnastics or tumbling in cheerleading or with high volumes of endurance training, pose a greater risk of epiphyseal injury [<a href="#rid48">48</a>].</p><p>The risk of growth plate injury is minimal if children are taught correct principles of strength training and a gradual and appropriate progression of load is applied under the supervision of competent adults [<a href="#rid48">48,49,72,73</a>]. The case reports of epiphyseal plate fractures occurring during strength training have been attributed to misuse of equipment, improper lifting technique, lifting inappropriately heavy weight, or training in unsupervised settings [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Principles of training'</a> below.)</p><p>Repetitive soft tissue injuries and injuries to the lower back are additional concerns for children participating in strength training. Overuse injuries result from repetitive microtrauma to structures that do not have the strength to withstand continual or repetitive forces of activity. The prevalence of overuse injuries is difficult to determine since they may not result in emergency department or clinician visits. The likelihood of such injuries may be increased by emphasizing sport-specific skills rather than overall fitness [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Injuries to the lower back are often a result of using unsafe training devices, improper lifting technique, or lifting inappropriately heavy weight.</p><p>With appropriate supervision, strength training may have a favorable influence on bone growth and development during childhood and adolescence [<a href="#rid49">49,51,74</a>].

Such gains have been noted in children following relatively short periods (8 to 12 weeks) of a well-designed strength-training program. Strength gains of 30 to 50 percent have been reported in comparative trials [<a href="#rid78">78-83</a>].</p><p>Children and adolescents participating in a well-designed strength-training program make similar relative gains in strength, although adolescents make greater absolute gains [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. The difference between the response to strength training in children and adolescents may be related to differences in circulating androgen levels, but other factors appear to contribute [<a href="#rid80">80,84,85</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In adolescents – The ability of strength training to increase strength in adolescents is well established [<a href="#rid86">86</a>]. Increases in strength in adolescents are due to the combined effects of neural adaptations and increases in muscle mass (hypertrophy) [<a href="#rid66">66,87</a>]. A 2018 meta-analysis of studies of resistance training in females between 8 and 18 years found a dearth of evidence, particularly when compared with studies of male youth, but reported that such training is effective, more so among older females [<a href="#rid88">88</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In children – Multiple meta-analyses provide evidence that strength gains are possible in children [<a href="#rid85">85,88-90</a>]. The benefits of strength training are not sex-specific: girls and boys both benefit from strength training. The training-induced strength gains observed in children are due to neural adaptations rather than hypertrophy [<a href="#rid50">50,80,81,84</a>]. The focus of strength training during pre-pubescence should be on neuromuscular development (ie, quality of movement) [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Strength training in children likely improves the coordinated recruitment of motor units, increases the number of motor units recruited, and improves the firing rate or firing pattern of activated motor neurons [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. Improvements in strength also have been attributed to improved coordination [<a href="#rid91">91</a>]. Increased neural response and improved coordination may facilitate injury prevention in other sports and activities of daily living [<a href="#rid92">92</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Injury prevention'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As muscular strength is an essential component of motor skill performance, incorporating strength training into an activity or training program for a boy or girl can build competence and confidence when participating in various physical activities.

Performance in a specific sport is affected by many variables. When assessing the impact of strength training on performance, it is important to distinguish among sport performance, performance on motor skill tests, and athletic ability. Improved strength does not necessarily improve sport-specific performance, although it often does, particularly as athletes reach adolescence [<a href="#rid90">90</a>]. Following participation in a strength-training program, improvements in motor skills (eg, agility, height of vertical jump, sprint speed) may be more noticeable than improvement in performance [<a href="#rid73">73,94-98</a>]. Certain resistance exercises that more closely approximate the movements involved in specific sports may serve as useful adjuncts to traditional strength training and enhance the transfer of strength gains to sports performance.</p><p>Regardless of the potential benefits of strength training, children and adolescents should participate in an overall conditioning program that develops all the components of health- and sports-related physical fitness and sport-specific skills as part of an individual or team training program. Improvements in physical fitness (including strength) increase a youth's ability to participate in a variety of activities, including work, play, recreation, and sport. (See <a class="local">'Physical activity'</a> above.)</p><p>One strategy used by some coaches to optimize performance and fitness is concurrent training of muscular strength and cardiorespiratory fitness [<a href="#rid99">99</a>]. Concurrent training is efficient and may enhance both strength and endurance; however, concurrent training may produce inferior improvements in each attribute compared with training strength and endurance independently [<a href="#rid100">100</a>]. Interference between the two modes of training is likely due to differences in metabolic signaling and the resulting muscle adaptations: increased hypertrophy versus increased capillarization and oxidative capacity. Such interference effects may be minimized or eliminated if strength and endurance training are performed on alternate days [<a href="#rid101">101</a>].</p><p>Of note, our understanding of the effects of physical training comes predominately from research in adults, the results of which may not apply to children, and concurrent training may be an example. In a meta-analysis of 15 studies of limited quality, concurrent training was found to be slightly better than endurance or strength training alone for improving selected measures of athletic performance and fitness in children and adolescents [<a href="#rid99">99</a>]. Among youth, concurrent training lends itself to participation in a more well-rounded physical training program than does isolated training. In addition, by reducing the total time spent engaged in endurance and strength training, concurrent training may increase the time available for recovery and the development of sport-specific skills. Reduced training volume and increased recovery time may also reduce the risk of injury.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Injury prevention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of injury increases with participation in sport. However, children and adolescents who follow age-appropriate strength-training recommendations have a relatively low risk of injury while performing resistance exercises [<a href="#rid73">73,77</a>]. In addition, adolescents who take part regularly in a well-designed strength-training program appear to be at lower risk of acute and overuse injuries when participating in other sports [<a href="#rid102">102</a>]. Participation in a general overall conditioning program may also reduce the risk or lessen the severity of sports-related injuries and likely reduces the risk of injury during non-sport and non-leisure physical activities [<a href="#rid49">49,57,58,72,103-106</a>].</p><p>Children and adolescents can be encouraged to participate in a conditioning program prior to or in the early stages of a sports program. An overall conditioning program that includes strength training may help to prepare unconditioned youth for the demands of sports practice and competition [<a href="#rid51">51,107,108</a>]. Such training increases the strength of the muscles, tendons, and ligaments and increases joint stability. Resistance exercises that develop strength through a full functional range of motion also maintain mobility [<a href="#rid5">5,48,49,72</a>]. Each of these effects potentially contributes to a reduced risk of injury [<a href="#rid109">109</a>].</p><p>A small number of well-performed randomized trials support the contention that participation in a well-designed and properly implemented neuromuscular training program that includes appropriate resistance exercises can reduce the risk of injury among adolescents. The effectiveness of the former intervention is seen in a cluster-randomized trial, involving 230 Swedish football (soccer) clubs and 4564 female players ranging in age from 12 to 17, where players whose teams participated in a neuromuscular training program (intervention group) sustained seven anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears compared with 14 among players whose teams did not (control group) [<a href="#rid110">110</a>].

All other aspects of training and match play were identical. Players in the strength-training group sustained four significant injuries (effects lasted longer than three days) over seven months (including one ankle sprain and no acute non-contact muscle injuries) compared with 13 significant injuries among non-participating athletes (including three ankle sprains and six acute non-contact muscle strains).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H714252568"><span class="h2">Weight management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Including strength training as part of an exercise program can help with weight management or improved body composition [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>].

The development of strength should complement, and not neglect, other components of physical fitness and well-being.</p><p>Team sports tend to result in less specialization, while individual sports tend to have higher levels of specialization as well as higher training volumes. Athletes also tend to specialize at a younger age when involved in individual sports as opposed to team sports [<a href="#rid115">115</a>]. However, there is greater development and transfer of motor skills when youth participate in a variety of activities and sports. Despite the common belief that early focus on a single sport is advantageous to achieving a high level of performance, a single-sport emphasis may be detrimental to the overall physical development of the child and increase the risk of injuries [<a href="#rid115">115</a>]. In addition, youth who participate in a single individual sport have higher training volumes and greater rates of overuse injuries compared with youth involved in a single team sport. Youth (and their parents) should be encouraged to pursue a reasonable variety of participation in activities, sports, recreation, and training.</p><p>Serious injury may occur if proper guidelines are not followed.

Clinicians, parents, coaches, teachers, and program directors can help each participant to meet his or her unique needs effectively and safely. To increase adherence and compliance, the child should be actively involved in the selection and development of an exercise program that meets his or her personal, physical, and social needs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25"><span class="h3">Warm-up/cool-down</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Every bout of exercise should begin with a 5- to 10-minute active warm-up that includes dynamic mobility exercises, aerobic exercise, and repetitions of light resistance to prepare the body for the specific activity that will be forthcoming. Warm-up activities stimulate metabolism and increase body temperature and blood flow to active musculature.</p><p>Each exercise session should be followed by a 10- to 15-minute active cool-down period that includes light aerobic exercise and stretching. Cool-down activities maintain blood flow to active muscles during recovery and enhance the quality and effectiveness of the recovery period.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26"><span class="h3">Specificity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The training stimulus (overload) must be effectively applied to a specific physiological system for the expected neuromuscular adaptations to take place. Training adaptations are specific to the type and mode of training and the total overload.</p><p>A well-rounded general strength-training program can meet the needs of most youth. Such a program can increase muscular strength and endurance, speed, and power. Athletic performance, on the other hand, is optimized by matching the demands of the sport with the training program: training the appropriate metabolic systems and duplicating sport-specific joint velocities and angular movements.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27"><span class="h3">Overload</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For neuromuscular adaptation (training effect) to occur, the training stimulus must be greater than that to which the participant is normally accustomed. A strength-training overload is applied through the choice and order of exercises, load, sets, repetitions, rest periods, and frequency of training. The load can be applied through various forms of resistance (eg, free weights, machines, body weight, elastic bands). The type of load may influence the benefit of strength training. In a meta-analysis, anisometric (also called isotonic) training programs had a greater effect than isometric training programs, but the effect sizes did not reach statistical significance [<a href="#rid85">85</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice and order of exercises</strong> – When choosing exercises, it is important that the child fits the equipment and that the skills and technique to perform the exercise are properly taught. Six to eight exercises total that involve all the major muscle groups (chest, shoulders, back, arms, legs, abdomen, lower back) should be selected with appropriate balance across joints (ie, flexors and extensors) as well as between upper- and lower-body muscle groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Participants should be encouraged to train all the major muscle groups rather than a limited number (eg, chest and arms). Because of the potential for lower back injuries during strength training, exercises that strengthen the core (ie, abdomen and lower back) should be included in all training programs [<a href="#rid3">3,5,50</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Injury prevention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most exercises should be performed through the full, functional range of motion to properly develop strength and prevent loss of mobility [<a href="#rid5">5,48,49,72</a>]. Exceptions include exercises that place undue stress on joint capsules or have extreme ranges of motion, such as bar dips and supine dumbbell flies. These exercises should be performed only to the point of the upper arm being parallel to the ground  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65981" href="/d/graphic/65981.html" rel="external">picture 9</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61592" href="/d/graphic/61592.html" rel="external">picture 10</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Common practice is to perform multijoint exercises before single-joint exercises, complex movements before simple movements, and large muscle groups before small muscle groups. Performing exercise in this order helps to prevent training plateaus, increase training efficiency, and decrease injury potential. In some cases, it may be beneficial to perform exercises that focus on movement patterns and involvement of the entire kinetic chain as opposed to isolating single muscle groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Load</strong> – Load is the measurable amount of resistance. Load should be selected so that the predetermined number of sets and repetitions can be completed with some fatigue (not failure). Fatigue is the participant's perception that the repetitions are too hard or that form and technique cannot be maintained. Failure is the inability to complete the repetition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Strength training should begin with lighter loads that allow more repetitions and progress to the use of heavier loads as strength and technique are developed. When starting a strength-training program, the participant can select loads that allow the completion of at least 10 repetitions without excessive fatigue or failure. If the beginning participant fails to complete at least 10 repetitions per set with a given weight, the weight is too heavy and should be reduced [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When learning new movements, no-load repetitions can be used to develop balance and control. Load can be increased <strong>gradually</strong> as the movement is learned, but increments in load should not exceed the participant's ability to maintain balance, control, and proper technique.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Opinions vary on whether youth should lift maximal weights. Some organizations recommend that strength-training programs for children and adolescents exclude lifting maximal amounts until they attain physical and skeletal maturity [<a href="#rid2">2,114</a>]. It is reasonable to use maximal lifts to evaluate the effectiveness of a strength-training program when the maximal lifts are supervised and performed correctly following an adequate, gradual progression of loading [<a href="#rid120">120</a>]. However, there is no support for the continuous use of maximum-resistance training in youth. Instead of continually lifting maximum loads, participants should be encouraged to use submaximal loads to develop form and technique in a variety of exercises.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Strength-training programs for children should not rely on one form of resistance exercise (eg, free weights) [<a href="#rid49">49,114</a>]. Programs should be designed to include a variety of physical activities and training methods that develop muscular strength, rather than "specializing" in one strength-training method. Different methods of applying a resistance, such as use of body weight, free weights, weight machines, rubber tubing, and medicine balls can be used in strength-training programs for youth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Body weight (eg, pull-ups, bar dips, or push-ups  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118065" href="/d/graphic/118065.html" rel="external">picture 11</a>)) should not be used as a form of resistance when working with sedentary or obese children who lack the strength to safely and successfully perform the exercise.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Free weights  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118778" href="/d/graphic/118778.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) are a viable alternative to weight machines when child-size equipment is not available or when working with large children who have difficulty getting in and out of machines. Light-weight or unloaded bars should be used initially to develop proper technique and movement patterns.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rubber tubing or other forms of resistance bands can be used by many children who are not ready to use free weights or machines. Since the resistance increases further into the range of motion, children should be encouraged to move through a full range of motion while maintaining proper body alignment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medicine balls of various sizes can be used to develop upper-body and abdominal strength.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sets</strong> – A set is the completion of a given number of repetitions. Single-set protocols are often completed in the first several weeks of training when skill development and conditioning is low. Most youth are encouraged to begin a strength-training program using one to two sets.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Repetitions</strong> – Repetition is the number of times the load is lifted in a given set. Once movement patterns are established, it is recommended that youth perform sets using loads that permit 5 to 15 repetitions without failure and with good form [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rest periods</strong> – A rest period is the amount of rest between sets or between exercise sessions. The length of rest periods between sets contributes to the overall overload since shorter rest periods decrease the recovery of energy-producing metabolic pathways and affect performance on subsequent sets.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One to three minutes of rest between sets is generally adequate; shorter rest periods are used to emphasize hypertrophy, and longer rest periods to maximize strength. Most youth have difficulty resting more than one to two minutes between sets.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Frequency of training</strong> – Muscle groups should be given at least 24 hours of rest between exercise sessions. Thus, strength training in youth should be limited to two to three nonconsecutive days per week. Older adolescents who are highly motivated can strength-train four days per week, provided that major muscle groups are not trained on consecutive days. In a meta-analysis of resistance training in children and adolescents, increased frequency of training was associated with increased strength gains [<a href="#rid85">85</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28"><span class="h3">Adaptation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adaptation is the primary reason for engaging in any activity, exercise, or conditioning program. The neuromuscular adaptations to strength training in youth include increased numbers and coordination of recruited motor units and improved firing rate or firing pattern of activated motor neurons [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. Initial improvements in strength from resistance training in pre-adolescent boys and girls result from neural adaptation. However, depending on the trainee’s stage of development, adolescents may experience an increase in muscle mass. (See <a class="local">'Strength'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, regular physical activity, including a well-designed strength-training program, helps to increase bone mass. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5355.html" rel="external">"Bone health and calcium requirements in adolescents", section on 'Physical activity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29"><span class="h3">Progression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The progression of an exercise program is critical to safely and effectively meet the individual's goals and objectives. As strength increases, the original absolute resistance represents a lower workload relative to capacity. The overload must be increased to provide an effective stimulus for adaptation to continue.</p><p>The overload can be changed by increasing the resistance, the number of sets or repetitions, the frequency of training, or the number of exercises performed for each muscle group.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Before increasing the number of sets or resistance, participants should be able to demonstrate proper technique.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Resistance can be increased when the desired number of repetitions can be performed, when 20 repetitions become "easy," or when the participant can complete three sets of 20 repetitions [<a href="#rid5">5,50</a>]. Resistance can be increased in increments of 5 to 10 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The addition of exercises for each muscle group adds variety to a program, emphasizes the overall objective of conditioning, and introduces new movement patterns and motor skills. Addition of new exercises should include the use of single-joint and multijoint exercises. Multijoint exercises are beneficial for the development of neuromuscular coordination and skill technique and require more balance and stabilization [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>]. Participants should not be allowed to perform more complex exercises until less complex exercises are mastered [<a href="#rid5">5,49</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Progression to performing two to three exercises per muscle group for one to three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, performed three days per week, or three to four sets of six to eight repetitions, has been recommended [<a href="#rid5">5,50,72</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30"><span class="h3">Maintenance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The maintenance phase is the longest portion of any conditioning program. Eventually, the participant is satisfied with the adaptations, training effect, and new level of physical fitness, health, or performance, and increases in overload (progression) are no longer needed. Less total overload is necessary to maintain adaptations than to achieve the desired outcome. Duration of training can influence the benefit of strength training, since training interventions of longer duration are more beneficial than similar training programs of shorter duration [<a href="#rid85">85</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31"><span class="h3">Reversal</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Youth participation in sports and conditioning programs is often spontaneous and sporadic. It is likely, therefore, that many youth will undergo periods of reduced training and activity. Following a significant reduction or cessation of strength training, strength and other related adaptations regress to pretraining levels [<a href="#rid81">81,121</a>]. This phenomenon is often referred to as "detraining" and occurs in children as well as adults.</p><p>In children, the effects of detraining are confounded by the concomitant growth-related increases in strength. The precise nature of the detraining response in children and adolescents remains uncertain. However, changes in neuromuscular function probably play a significant role in the observed changes in strength or motor performance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H32"><span class="h2">Olympic-style lifting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The snatch  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef120670" href="/d/graphic/120670.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) and the clean-and-jerk  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef127207" href="/d/graphic/127207.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>) are the two lifts included in the sport of weightlifting (often referred to as Olympic weightlifting). In the snatch, a barbell is lifted from the ground to an arm's-length position overhead in one continuous movement. In the clean-and-jerk, the barbell is lifted from the ground to the shoulder and then to an arm's-length position overhead in a two-part movement. Both lifts are performed rapidly and require power and expert technique.</p><p>Olympic-style weightlifting movements can be used as an effective training modality to improve strength, power, and coordination [<a href="#rid50">50,122-125</a>]. The AAP suggests that children and adolescents avoid competitive weightlifting and power lifting until they reach physical and skeletal maturity [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Others suggest that such lifts are appropriate for youth who demonstrate the maturity and desire to learn proper technique before using significant amounts of weight [<a href="#rid50">50,122,124,126</a>]. The time and effort required to learn and practice these techniques can vary among participants.</p><p>With proper training and technique, weightlifting is safer than many other sports in which teenagers regularly participate [<a href="#rid122">122,124</a>]. The forces to which children are exposed in other sports and activities are often greater in duration and magnitude and typically occur in uncontrolled settings. The snatch and the clean-and-jerk are complex movements and require knowledgeable coaching and supervision. When technical mastery is emphasized, the risk of injury is decreased.</p><p>Olympic-style lifts should not be attempted without proper training and supervision; this point cannot be overemphasized. The training program should include other lifts and forms of conditioning to provide overall training. The techniques for the snatch and clean-and-jerk should be learned using a wooden pole, polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe, or light weight-training bar. Resistance should not be increased until the child has developed the necessary neuromuscular coordination and skill to perform the lift correctly. Light to moderate intensities (less than 75 percent of the one-repetition maximum) are recommended for youth.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H33"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Goals of participation</strong> – Children should be encouraged to participate in regular physical activity in order to establish good health habits at an early age.
