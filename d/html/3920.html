         The complement system is a major component of innate immunity and a "complement" (from which its name is derived) to antibody-triggered responses [

         ]. It consists of nearly 60 plasma and membrane proteins that form three distinct but overlapping activating pathways, as well as a common terminal lytic cascade and a network of regulators and receptors [

         This topic review will discuss the functions of the complement system, the pathways involved, the measurement of complement activity, and the clinical significance of abnormally low or high complement tests.

         Complement was initially recognized in the 1880s as "a lytic substance in blood," although the biochemical complexity of the system was not appreciated until the 1960s and 1970s.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is recognized that complement has three major functions:

         These proinflammatory processes require tight control to avoid damage to host tissues. Thus, nearly one-half of complement proteins function to regulate (control) the system.

         Complement components were commonly named as they were identified, leading to some inconsistencies in terminology. An updated nomenclature has been suggested [

         Components of the classical pathway are designated by the capital letter "C" combined with a number (eg, C1, C2, C3, and C4). This scheme is also used for components of the membrane attack complex (MAC) (C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9). The numbers are in order of reactivity, except that C4 is activated before C2 and C3 in the classical and lectin pathways.

         Upon proteolytic activation, a liberated smaller fragment is designated by a lowercase letter (such as C3a or Ba). The larger fragment attaches to a target and is then listed with a "b," as in C3b or Bb.

         Receptors are variably defined by their function (eg, immune adherence receptor), order of discovery (eg, complement receptor type 1 [CR1]), ligands to which they bind (eg, C3b/C4b receptor), or via their "cluster of differentiation" (CD) assignments (CR1 is CD35). Receptors have a more limited expression pattern (ie, usually expressed only by hematopoietic cells).

         Membrane regulators are widely expressed, including by hematopoietic cells, and are named via the same designations as indicated above (eg, the designation of decay-accelerating factor [DAF] as CD55 or membrane cofactor protein [MCP] as CD46). Plasma regulators, on the other hand, are synthesized primarily by the liver, such as factors H and I and C4b binding protein (C4BP).

          PATHWAYS AND ACTIVATING CONDITIONS

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         There are three major divisions or pathways of complement activation: the classical, lectin, and alternative cascades  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56374" href="/z/d/graphic/56374.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Each is triggered in a distinct manner, yet all lead to the activation of C3 and its deposition on a target as C3b, which is the major goal of complement [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6

         <strong>
          Classical
         </strong>
         – The classical pathway is triggered by antibodies. It becomes engaged when immunoglobulin M (IgM) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies bind to antigens (such as viruses, bacteria, or autoantigens). The C1q subcomponent of the C1 complex attaches to the Fc portion of antibody. In complex with C1q are the two proteases C1r and C1s. Upon C1q engagement by antibodies, C1r autoactivates and cleaves C1s, which subsequently cleaves C4 and C2, the next two proteins in the cascade. IgG subclasses 1 and 3 efficiently fix complement. IgG2 fixes complement, although less efficiently than IgG1 or IgG3. IgG4 does not activate the complement system. In addition to antibodies, C-reactive protein and a few other plasma proteins can engage the classical pathway. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3964.html" rel="external">
          "IgG subclasses: Physical properties, genetics, and biologic functions", section on 'Biologic functions'

         <strong>
          Lectin
         </strong>
         – The lectin pathway is specialized for the prompt recognition of repetitive carbohydrate patterns on the surface of microbial pathogen targets. The activation scheme of the lectin pathway is similar to the classical pathway, except that the initiating antibodies are replaced by lectins (ie, carbohydrate-binding proteins). While C1q is the major pattern recognition molecule (PRM) of the classical pathway, the list of PRMs for the lectin pathway has been growing since the discovery of mannose-binding lectin (MBL, also called mannan-binding lectin) and include ficolin-1, ficolin-2, ficolin-3, collectin-10, and collectin-11 [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Also associated with the large PRMs (such as MBL) are serine proteases (ie, MBL-associated serine proteases [MASPs]), which are structurally and functionally similar to the classical pathway subcomponent proteases of C1 (ie, C1r and C1s). Also, like C1s in the classical pathway, the MASPs activate C4 and C2 by proteolytic cleavage [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>

         <strong>
          Alternative
         </strong>
         – The alternative pathway is an ancient surveillance system and represents the original extracellular complement system. It does not require the presence of antibodies or lectins to become activated. It is continuously turning over (so called "tickover") at a low level due to the presence of a labile thioester bond in C3. This may result in deposition of C3b on a target and engagement of the alternative pathway's feedback loop mechanism. C3 "ticks over" at approximately 1 percent per hour in blood. If this form of C3 lands on healthy self-tissues, it is rapidly inactivated by host regulators. If it engages cell debris or a pathogen, it is amplified by the feedback loop of the alternative pathway. If it does not engage a target, within a few microseconds, it is hydrolyzed and altered by plasma (fluid-phase) regulators to facilitate removal from the circulation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         All three pathways lead to C3b deposition on a target and then the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC perturbs cell membrane integrity and in organisms such as gram-negative bacteria, results in lysis of the microbe. Also, each pathway promotes the inflammatory response by releasing proinflammatory peptides known as anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a). While C3a and C5a are well-recognized anaphylatoxins with known receptors, C4a also has been found to be a ligand for protease-activated receptors 1 and 4 (PAR1 and PAR4), with effects on cellular activation and endothelial permeability [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. A more detailed discussion of each pathway is available. (See

         The primary goal of the complement system is the elimination of microbes and secondarily, other particulates of biological debris. The process requires the covalent deposition of C3b on a target. Targets can include microbes, immune aggregates, apoptotic cells, and necrotic tissue. The process of coating of targets with complement molecules to promote their elimination is known as opsonization. Opsonization occurs rapidly. In less than five minutes, several million C3b fragments may be deposited on a single bacterium.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once a target is coated with C3b, it can then be recognized by host cells bearing complement receptors. The process of C3b on a target engaging its receptors is known as the immune adherence reaction. It is commonly followed by ingestion by phagocytic cells or transfer from erythrocytes (that express the C3b/C4b receptor, complement receptor type 1 [CR1]) to tissue macrophages in the liver and spleen. Further, CR1 converts C3b to iC3b and C3dg fragments, thereby facilitating transfers to CR2, CR3, and CR4.
        </p>
        <p>
         Opsonization also facilitates the adaptive immune response, including antigen presentation and retention by immune cells, as well as immunologic memory and costimulation of B lymphocytes through the antigen receptor. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3975.html" rel="external">
          "The adaptive humoral immune response", section on 'Antigenic stimulation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on this host defense profile, it becomes apparent why infections and autoimmunity are two major consequences of a defective complement system.

         Programmed cell death (apoptosis) followed by rapid phagocytic clearance is a common mechanism, whereby organisms dispose of dead and dying cells. The process of apoptosis results in alterations in the architecture of the cell membrane, as well as loss of host regulators. These changes expose sites for binding by lectins and natural antibodies and induce complement activation and immune clearance [

         Activation of the complement system leads to the release of peptides of approximately 10 kDa, which are potent mediators of inflammatory and immune responses. These fragments, known as "anaphylatoxins," bind to their respective receptors on cells to initiate inflammation and vasodilation that in turn activate many cell types [

          Angiogenesis

         – Complement activation leads to the generation of the proinflammatory anaphylatoxins. They, in turn, cause release of mediators, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sVEGFR1) from multiple cell types, including monocytes and macrophages [

         Although complement is involved in these and other processes, complement-deficient humans develop two major problems: bacterial infections and autoimmunity (primarily systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]). Therefore, the two main functions of the complement system are host defense against pathogens and prevention of autoimmunity to nuclear constituents. C3-deficient humans are
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         known to have developmental problems, defects in hemostasis or angiogenesis, or problems with wound healing, which suggests that the role of complement in these processes may be less critical.

         While the complement system is engaged in these common diseases of aging humans, its role in pathogenesis is uncertain.

         New links between complement components and schizophrenia have been suggested. In particular, complement component C4 and CSMD1 (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1) variation each has been linked to the development of schizophrenia [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31,32

         ]. C4 is a duplicated gene and 1 of approximately 300 human genes that feature copy number variation. Increasing copies of the C4A gene were shown to be associated with the development of schizophrenia. C4 localized to neuronal synapses may trigger runaway pruning of the communications infrastructure. Additionally a single nucleotide polymorphism in
         <em>
          CSMD1

         The total hemolytic complement (THC or CH50) assesses the ability of serum to lyse sheep erythrocytes optimally sensitized with rabbit immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody. All nine components of the classical pathway (C1 through C9) are required to give a normal CH50. CH50 is therefore a useful screening tool for detecting a deficiency of the classical pathway, resulting from either an inherited defect of a single component or from activation of a pathway, leading to lowered levels of several components. It does not assess the entire alternative pathway, because factors B and D and properdin are not required for the classical pathway activation. They are early components of only the alternative pathway.

        <p>
         A normal CH50 value/titer ranges from 150 to 250 units/mL in a commonly employed functional (hemolytic) assay system. The titer is the reciprocal of the dilution of serum required to lyse 50 percent of the antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes (eg, a CH50 titer of 200 units means that the human test serum lysed 50 percent of the erythrocytes at a dilution of 1:200).

Less dramatic reductions in CH50 are seen in pathologic processes secondary to immune complex formation. It is the classical pathway that is most commonly involved in these autoantibody-mediated diseases. The underlying problem is the production of the autoantibody. In this case, the complement system is responding as it was intended to do.

         A child presents with recurrent pyogenic bacterial infections in the setting of a normal white blood cell count and normal gamma globulin levels. An extremely low CH50 value (eg, ≤10 units/mL) is consistent with a homozygous deficiency of a classical pathway component. C1q, C4, C2, or C3 deficiency could present this way. If the infecting organism is a Neisserial species, then C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9 deficiency should also be considered. If the child is male with a family history of Neisserial infections and the CH50 is normal, diagnosis of properdin deficiency should be considered.

         Less dramatic reductions in the CH50 are characteristic of activation of the classical pathway (as may be seen in systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), reflecting consumption by immune complexes more rapidly than the components can be replaced by the liver. CH50 is also moderately reduced in neonates, as it takes several years to reach adult levels. (See

         A common cause of a low CH50 is improper specimen handling. The CH50 assay requires appropriate collection, processing, and storage of specimens, since several complement proteins are unstable. C3 and C4 antigenic levels will be normal in this situation, but they will lack functional activity. Serum samples should be assayed the day of collection or immediately frozen for subsequent analysis. A very low CH50 should be checked on a separately obtained sample.

         CH50 or individual proteins, such as C3 or C4, may increase up to 50 percent of baseline values as part of the acute-phase response. Beyond this, an elevated CH50 has no specific clinical significance. This is an expected part of the host's response to infection and injury. High levels in themselves do not lead to tissue damage, as the proteins are not in their activated state, and regulators tend to increase in parallel.

         Cytokines, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), are typically released at sites of inflammation and then travel via the circulation to the liver, where they increase hepatic synthesis of complement proteins.

         alternative pathway activation. It can be performed in referral laboratories. The most common indication for obtaining an AH50 is the evaluation of certain renal diseases in childhood, especially those featuring a thrombotic microangiopathy or glomerulonephritis. Additionally, a very low or undetectable AH50 occurs in patients with factor B or factor D deficiency who almost always present with Neisserial infections. Note that properdin, a positive regulator of complement, is not assessed in some AH50 assays, while in others, it is required. Further, the gene for properdin is on the X chromosome. Thus, males are affected, and there is commonly a positive family history. As noted, the alternative pathway's AH50 and the classical pathway's CH50 will be very low or undetectable in C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9 deficiency, since the terminal cascade is common to both pathways.

         Antigenic levels of C3 and C4 are commonly used in clinical practice and are accurately performed by clinical laboratories. They are usually measured by nephelometric immunoassays. The antigenic and functional levels of other complement proteins can also be assessed, although such testing is usually performed by specialized laboratories. Tests of specific complement components are indicated to evaluate a very low CH50 and determine which component is deficient or dysfunctional. In most cases, the antigenic level of a component accurately reflects its functional capacity. (See

         The measurement of C3 and/or C4 can assist in the diagnosis of certain diseases (especially SLE), as well as in monitoring the course of the disease. Other diseases featuring autoantibodies leading to immune complex formation are the antiphospholipid syndrome, mixed cryoglobulinemia, Sjögren syndrome, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Low C4 and C3 or low C3 alone can indicate the presence of any of these disorders. On the other hand, increasing levels indicate a response to treatment.

         Lupus is the prototypic disease for which the most clinical information is available, relative to interpreting and following C3 and C4 levels. A typical scenario is the following: a 20-year-old female presents with pleurisy, pericarditis, thrombocytopenia, and nephritis. The antinuclear antibody (ANA) is positive with a high titer, and DNA antibodies are present. The C4 is low at 8 mg/dL, and the C3 is low at 60 mg/dL, indicating classical pathway activation due to immune complexes. Treatment is initiated with glucocorticoids and a cytotoxic agent. Over the next three months, the C4 and C3 levels return to normal values. These are then followed subsequently to help define clinical status. Normalization of complement values is a good prognostic sign. (See

         There are assays for the activation or cleavage fragments of certain components, such as the anaphylatoxins (C5a and C3a), iC3b and C3d, Ba and Bb, or soluble C5b-9. Increased levels reflect ongoing activation of the complement system. However, because the interpretation of these tests is problematic and their role in evaluating a variety of human diseases has not been firmly established, these tests are uncommonly used or required for routine clinical practice. Complement activation products are being increasingly measured, particularly in patients with SLE [

         The measurement of proteolytically-derived complement component fragments (split products) of C3, C5, C2, and factor B is technically difficult and expensive, although they can be helpful in the setting of normal or persistently low complement levels. Some companies are promoting tests of complement split products and of complement fragments bound to cells. Their role in routine clinical practice, such as for monitoring SLE, remains to be established. The measurement of split products has two advantages over the measurement of whole components. Split products are not affected by the acute-phase response, since they are only produced by complement activation. In addition, split products appear to be more sensitive markers for
         <strong>

         complement activation. However, these tests are uncommonly pursued for the reasons noted above, as well as their possible generation following blood drawing.

         There does not appear to be significant maternal transfer of complement proteins across the placenta. Term infants have high variability in both classical and alternative pathway activity, secondary to reduced levels of individual components of the complement system. Thus, variable decreases in alternative and classical pathway hemolytic activity (AH50 and CH50) may be observed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Preterm infants have a more consistent decrease in these measurements and in levels of C3 and C4, when compared with term infants. Complement levels increase after birth and reach adult levels between 6 to 18 months of age.

         Complement activation accompanies many infectious and inflammatory processes. The pattern of complement abnormalities can provide diagnostic clues to the underlying disease process  (

         Classical pathway activation is commonly indicated by low levels of C4 and C3. Another pattern seen with classical pathway activation is low C4 and normal C3.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are three common explanations for how levels of C4 can be reduced in the setting of normal C3:

          ●
         </span>
         The basal concentration of serum C3 is three to six times higher than that of C4. Thus, classical pathway activation may lower the C4 out of the normal range, while the amount of C3 is reduced but remains within normal limits. The clinician is unlikely to recognize this point initially, since a patient's predisease C3 concentration is rarely known. To illustrate, a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient could have a predisease C3 level of 150 mg/dL, which decreases to 100 mg/dL at clinical onset of disease. Thus, C3 remains in the "normal range," despite considerable C3 consumption, while C4 is below the normal range.

         In hereditary angioedema, C1 excessively cleaves C4 and C2 in plasma because of a deficiency of the C1 inhibitor. However, a C3 convertase does not form efficiently in plasma (fluid phase) because the complement system is designed to work on a biologic membrane. Thus, patients with hereditary angioedema have very low C4 but normal C3. A similar phenomenon may occur in syndromes involving excessive soluble immune complexes, such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, SLE, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. In this situation, the C3 convertase would form on a soluble immune complex, and this is inefficient in developing C3 convertases.

         The third mechanism by which C4 can be reduced in the setting of normal C3 is genetic partial deficiency of C4. This is discussed separately. (See

         Therefore, the finding of low C4 and normal C3 should prompt consideration of SLE, mixed cryoglobulinemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis types I and III, and hereditary or acquired angioedema. The combination of a low C4, normal C3, and a positive test for cryoglobulins should prompt further investigation for the presence of hepatitis B and C. (See

         Alternative pathway activation is indicated by decreased factor B and C3 and normal levels of C4  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Complement activation via alternative pathway activation is uncommon in clinical medicine. However, the combination of low C3 and normal C4 in a patient with an inflammatory/vasculitic disease process, especially with kidney involvement, almost always indicates alternative pathway activation. This can be further confirmed by measuring factor B and/or an AH50. Both factor B and the AH50 should be low. However, tests for factor B and the AH50 are not widely available and will need to be sent to a commercial laboratory. Usually, this is not necessary for diagnosis.

         Alternative pathway activation is observed in several types of pediatric renal disease, especially in association with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and the C3 glomerulopathies. Many of these patients have a C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF) (autoantibody that stabilizes the alternative pathway C3 convertase), while a more limited subset have mutations in C3 or one of its regulators (factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein [MCP]).

         An occasional patient with lupus will also demonstrate activation via the alternative pathway instead of the classical pathway. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses 2 and 4 do not efficiently activate the classical pathway. However, upon binding antigens, they can provide a protected (from regulators) site to allow for activation of the alternative pathway. A second point is that two antibody molecules (possibly up to six) need to be in close proximity to bind the C1q subunit of the C1 complex [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

Also, most patients with complement-mediated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) are haploinsufficient for a complement regulator, thus leading to excessive alternative pathway activation. Theoretically, eculizumab could be efficacious in any humoral antibody syndrome in which complement is activated, and C5a or the membrane attack complex (MAC) mediates tissue damage. It has also been used in delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction [

          Biologic roles of complement
         </strong>
         – The complement system is important in the defense of host against microbes, particularly bacteria. It also serves as a mechanism to identify and clear injured tissue and cellular debris. Thus, it is a major player in innate immunity and an effector arm of the humoral immune system. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Pathways
         </strong>
         – The three well-recognized divisions of the complement system are the classical, alternative, and lectin cascades  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56374" href="/z/d/graphic/56374.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Each pathway is activated by a different mechanism. The major goal of all three cascades is the deposition of substantial quantities of C3b on a target (opsonization), which marks it for elimination. Engagement of each pathway also leads to the release of proinflammatory anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathways and activating conditions'

         <strong>
          Functions of complement
         </strong>
         – In pathologic conditions featuring autoantibodies and immune complexes, complement activation contributes to cell and tissue damage. In acute injury states (membrane damage, apoptosis, necrosis) and with deposition of debris (lipids, proteins, pigments, crystals), the system plays an important role in the host's response to altered self. Failure of this clearance role predisposes to autoimmunity, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Functions of the complement system'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Assessing complement function
         </strong>
         – Complement levels can be evaluated either by antigenic or functional assays. The CH50 is a functional assay that requires all nine components of the classical pathway (C1 through C9) for a normal result. A homozygous deficiency of classical pathway components is indicated by an extremely low CH50 value (≤10 units/mL). Less dramatic reductions in CH50 are seen in pathologic processes secondary to immune complex formation. A low CH50 can also result from laboratory error and "cold activation." (See
         <a class="local">
          'CH50'

         <strong>
          C3 and C4
         </strong>
         – The measurement of C3 and/or C4 can assist in the diagnosis of certain diseases (especially SLE), as well as in monitoring the course of the disease. Other diseases featuring autoantibodies leading to immune complex formation are the antiphospholipid syndrome, mixed cryoglobulinemia, Sjögren syndrome, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Low C4 and C3 or low C3 alone can indicate the presence of any of these disorders. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Serum C3 and C4 levels'

          Complement deficiencies
         </strong>
         – Genetic deficiencies (usually haploinsufficiency of complement inhibitory proteins) leading to excessive activation of the alternative pathway have been identified in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), C3 glomerulopathy, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Genetic variation in the copy number of C4 genes in the brain is associated with increased risk of schizophrenia. (See
