         Pancreatic insufficiency is the most common gastrointestinal complication of cystic fibrosis (CF), affecting approximately 85 percent of patients at some time in their lives [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The major consequences of pancreatic insufficiency are due to fat malabsorption, which is caused by decreased production of pancreatic enzymes. As a result, patients are at risk for steatorrhea, malnutrition, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of pancreatic insufficiency in children with CF will be discussed here. The nutritional consequences of this disorder and other gastrointestinal complications of CF are discussed separately:

         Traditionally, patients with CF have been categorized as pancreatic-sufficient (10 to 15 percent of patients) or pancreatic-insufficient (the remainder) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. It is now clear that pancreatic function in CF varies along a spectrum from normal to severely deficient. Patients with normal or near-normal pancreatic function tend to have less severe lung disease, and their nutritional status is better than their counterparts who have more severe pancreatic dysfunction. Pancreatic function also varies with the age of the patient; it tends to worsen over time. Approximately 60 percent of infants with CF have pancreatic insufficiency at birth, and 75 to 90 percent have developed pancreatic insufficiency by one year of age [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5

         Pancreatic function correlates strongly with genotype in patients with CF. Pancreatic insufficiency generally develops within the first few months of life in patients who have two "severe" mutations of the
         <em>
          CFTR
         </em>
         gene (CF transmembrane conductance regulator), including F508del, N1303K, G542X, and G551D  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99734" href="/z/d/graphic/99734.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. These severe mutations usually are in the functional mutation groupings known as class I (defective CFTR protein synthesis), class II (defective CFTR protein processing), or class III (defective regulation/gating of the CFTR channel). By contrast, the presence of at least one "mild" mutation such as R117H or A445E usually is associated with pancreatic sufficiency [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9
         </a>
         ]. These mild mutations tend to be from functional class IV (decreased CFTR channel conductance) or class V (reduced synthesis or trafficking). Of note, this genotype association is stronger for the pancreatic insufficiency phenotype and much weaker for the pulmonary disease phenotype. (See

         Defective functioning of the
         <em>
          CFTR
         </em>
         gene (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) leads to impaired transport of chloride, sodium, and bicarbonate. As a result, water does not diffuse out of the cell into the mucus layer, leading to viscous epithelial secretions. The resultant protein-rich, viscous exocrine fluid becomes inspissated in the proximal pancreatic ducts, leading to their obstruction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pancreatic duct obstruction begins during fetal life, as early as the second trimester of gestation. The functioning acinar cells are gradually replaced with adipose tissue and, later, with fibrotic tissue. Patients with pancreatic insufficiency have decreased or absent levels of pancreatic amylase, lipase, colipase, and phospholipases. However, they have increased or normal production of salivary and brush border amylases, lingual lipases, and possibly brush border peptidases, which account for increased monosaccharide absorption and some residual lipolysis, respectively [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Because of the CFTR protein dysfunction, patients with CF also have decreased amounts of bicarbonate in their pancreatic secretions, which may further contribute to the deficiency of enzymatic activity since the remaining enzymes may not function optimally in an acidic environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, patients with CF may have primary abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism, as have been noted in biopsies of CFTR-expressing tissues [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. These changes, which result in increased tissue levels of arachidonic acid, are also present in the mouse model of CF.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Approximately two-thirds of infants with CF have pancreatic insufficiency at birth due to progressive pancreatic injury in utero [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. If CF is not diagnosed through newborn screening, it will usually be diagnosed because of growth faltering or protein-calorie malnutrition, typically presenting before the age of one year and in patients with pancreatic insufficiency [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Among individuals with relatively normal pancreatic function at birth, most will ultimately develop pancreatic dysfunction and insufficiency, but clinically apparent protein and fat deficiencies do not occur until over 90 percent of pancreatic function is lost.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with pancreatic insufficiency characteristically have frequent, bulky, foul-smelling stools that may be oily. Older children may also report that their stools float or stick to the toilet bowl (reflecting their high fat content). These features may not be as evident in infants, since they have wide variation in stool patterns at baseline [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Abdominal distention may also be present [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. These characteristics, all suggestive of fat malabsorption, are not specific to pancreatic insufficiency due to CF; they can also be seen in patients with small bowel mucosal disease or in other non-CF causes of pancreatic insufficiency. Moreover, these symptoms are subjective and nonspecific, so laboratory testing should usually be performed to determine if fat malabsorption is present. Fat malabsorption can develop at variable time points in the course of CF. As a result, patients with CF may require repeat testing and modification of their therapy as the disease progresses. (See

         CF-related diabetes – Individuals with CF involving the pancreas are at risk for developing CF-related diabetes due to progressive destruction of the pancreatic tissue and loss of its endocrine function; this is most common in those with underlying pancreatic insufficiency. (See

         Because a variety of factors can contribute to growth failure and abdominal symptoms, we suggest an objective assessment of pancreatic insufficiency (eg, fecal elastase testing or fecal fat collection) to document the need for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT).
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is particularly appropriate for patients identified by newborn screening programs because at least three-quarters of these infants will develop pancreatic insufficiency within the first year of life [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,15
         </a>
         ]. Patients who are pancreatic-sufficient initially should be retested annually and more frequently if there is diminished growth, poor weight gain, or abnormal stooling.

          Lower suspicion of pancreatic insufficiency
         </strong>
         – For patients with normal growth and genotype associated with pancreatic sufficiency, pancreatic function should be evaluated periodically, usually by measuring fecal elastase, as described below. For these patients, we typically check fecal elastase every 12 months, or more frequently if there is poor weight gain, evidence of malabsorption (steatorrhea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies), or recurrent pancreatitis. For these patients, PERT should not be started empirically. (See

         For the initial diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency in CF, our preferred approach is to measure fecal elastase because it is practical and easy for routine screening. Quantitative measurement of fat in the stool is more sensitive but more difficult to perform accurately. Pancreatic function also can be measured directly by performing a

         To determine the need for PERT, our preferred initial approach is to measure fecal elastase, which serves as an index of pancreatic exocrine function [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The test does not require discontinuation of PERT and can be performed on a single stool sample that requires no special storage. Fecal elastase values less than 200 mcg/g indicate pancreatic insufficiency [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,15
         </a>
         ]. Note that this test is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         useful as a measure to monitor the effectiveness of PERT or for dose adjustments, because it is a measure of intrinsic pancreatic function and not a measure of fat malabsorption [

         Fecal elastase testing has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting severe pancreatic insufficiency in children with CF [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,16-18
         </a>
         ]. However, the test performs less well for detecting mild or moderate pancreatic insufficiency and also displays variability with repeat testing in this type of patient [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20

         – Measurement of fecal fat can be used for initial diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency but is challenging to perform.

         Historically, pancreatic insufficiency in CF is irreversible and requires lifetime treatment with pancreatic enzymes. Preliminary evidence suggests that CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators may be effective at preventing, delaying, or possibly reversing pancreatic insufficiency when begun in early childhood; this evidence is discussed in a separate topic review.

         The mainstay of treatment for pancreatic insufficiency in CF is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). Pancreatic enzymes are extracts of porcine pancreas containing varying amounts of lipase, protease, and amylase. PERT clearly improves fecal fat absorption in most patients with pancreatic insufficiency. This was demonstrated by a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric and adult patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency, in which PERT decreased fecal fat excretion (45.4 versus 4.1 g/day) and increased the coefficient of fat absorption, as well as decreased stool frequency [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The effectiveness of PERT in an individual patient may be limited by variations in the pH of the gastrointestinal tract in CF from patient to patient and also varies over time in the same patient [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Several studies suggest that suppression of gastric acid improves the efficiency of PERT in CF, but most of the evidence is of low quality [

         </span>
         Most pancreatic enzyme preparations consist of capsules containing microspheres. Older children and adults generally swallow the capsule whole. For younger children and infants, enzymes are administered by opening the capsule and sprinkling the microspheres on food. The food should be soft so that it does not require chewing and should be relatively acidic to avoid dissolving the enteric coating (eg, applesauce, gelatins, pureed apricot, bananas, or sweet potatoes).
        </p>
        <p>
         PERT should generally be administered at the beginning of meals; some clinicians advise giving part of the dose halfway through the meal. Administering PERT following a meal is clearly not as effective.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dosing of pancreatic enzymes is based upon the units of lipase determined as a function of patient weight or dietary fat intake.

         <span class="glyph">

         The weight-based method can generally be used at any age. The starting dose for children less than four years of age is 1000 lipase units/kg body weight per meal; for children older than four years of age, the starting dose is 500 lipase units/kg body weight per meal [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35,37
         </a>
         ]. Smaller doses (eg, one-half to three-quarters of the mealtime dose) usually are given for between-meal snacks that contain fat. The PERT dose is increased based upon symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency to a maximum of 2500 lipase units/kg body weight per meal. (See
         <a class="local">

         The fat-based method is useful for infants who take a known amount of formula or in patients who receive tube feedings. The dose starts at approximately 2000 lipase units/120 mL of formula or per breast feeding (approximately 1600 lipase units/g of fat ingested per day). The dose can be adjusted up to no more than 2500 lipase units/kg body weight per feeding, with a maximum daily dose of 10,000 lipase units/kg [

         A new device (Relizorb) consisting of lipase immobilized onto polymeric carrier beads is available for children who receive overnight tube feedings, usually by gastrostomy with a feeding pump. The beads are packaged into a cartridge that can be placed in line with the feeding tube and hydrolyze the formula as it passes through the cartridge. The manufacturers warn against using Relizorb with a formula that contains insoluble fiber because fiber could clog the Relizorb cartridge. Efficacy data are still limited, but small studies suggest that it can help reduce early morning satiety and bloating for some individuals [

          Clinical response
         </strong>
         – Adjustment of PERT doses is typically guided by patient-reported symptoms of malabsorption, such as diarrhea (foul-smelling, greasy, bulky stools), bloating, gassiness, and abdominal pain. Unfortunately, symptoms do not correlate well with the efficacy of PERT in individual patients [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,40
         </a>
         ]. Thus, if patients have these symptoms despite doses of PERT approaching the daily maximum, alternate causes of abdominal symptoms, such as constipation or small intestine bacterial overgrowth, should be sought and treated. There is no evidence that constipation is caused by supratherapeutic or inadequate enzyme doses.

          Fecal fat testing
         </strong>
         – Laboratory tests generally are not helpful for adjustment of PERT doses, because there are no methods that are accurate and clinically practical. However, if there is uncertainty about optimal dosing of PERT in an individual patient after adjustment based on clinical symptoms, then fecal fat measurements can be performed. By contrast, fecal elastase is not useful for this purpose, because it is a measure of intrinsic pancreatic function rather than fat malabsorption [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The most accurate and commonly used fecal fat test is the collection of a 72-hour stool sample, in conjunction with a careful record of dietary intake  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67223" href="/z/d/graphic/67223.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). For an individual older than six months of age, fecal fat excretion is considered abnormal if it is more than 7 percent of the fat intake [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,27
         </a>
         ]. For infants under six months of age, fecal fat excretion of up to 15 percent of total fat intake can be normal [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. This test has moderate sensitivity and specificity for fat malabsorption, but the collection procedure is onerous for most patients [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The test does not distinguish between hepatobiliary, mucosal, and pancreatic causes of fat malabsorption. The test can be used for initial diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency, but in this case, PERT must be discontinued during the collection period.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Other approaches to evaluating fecal fat are easier to perform but have low accuracy. Qualitative measurement (Sudan stain) of a spot stool specimen is easier to perform but is not reliable, because fecal fat may not be evenly distributed in individuals consuming a mixed diet.

         Despite optimized pancreatic enzyme replacement, residual fat malabsorption exists. This remaining fat malabsorption is thought to be due to decreased long-chain fatty acid uptake by the gut and not the result of reduced pancreatic enzyme-mediated lipolysis. A structured lipid matrix supplement (Encala) has been developed that is formulated with lysophosphatidyl monoglycerides and essential fatty acids and does not require lipase for digestion/absorption of fatty acids. In a randomized trial in patients with severe residual fat malabsorption despite PERT and a CF diet, this supplement improved the coefficient of fat absorption, plasma fatty acid profile, and growth [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. It represents the only non-enzymatic treatment for fat malabsorption in CF.

         Prolonged contact of the enzyme supplements with oral mucosa may cause ulcers, especially with the powdered form. To prevent this complication, children should learn to swallow capsules as early as possible; some can master the technique as young as three to four years of age. When it is necessary to open the capsules for enzyme delivery to younger children, the microspheres should be administered with food (eg, applesauce), even in infants. The mouth should be inspected after eating and rinsed with water, milk, or formula if necessary to remove any beads clinging to the oral mucosa [

         Limited evidence suggests that excessive doses of PERT are associated with fibrosing colonopathy, characterized by inflammation and strictures. As a result, a maximum dose of 2500 lipase units/kg body weight per meal (or less than 10,000 lipase units/kg body weight per day) is recommended [

         Pancreatic insufficiency in CF may cause malabsorption of fat and other macronutrients, which is particularly problematic because the disease may also cause increased energy requirements. Thus, it is imperative that growth parameters are followed closely. For all patients, weight and length (or height) are measured at every contact (at least every three months) and weight/length or body mass index is calculated. Head circumference should also be monitored for children younger than two years  (

          Prevalence
         </strong>
         – Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have some degree of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction. This problem tends to worsen over time, and at least 85 percent develop clinically important pancreatic insufficiency. There is a moderate association between the patient's genotype and the probability of developing pancreatic insufficiency  (

          Surveillance
         </strong>
         – All patients with CF should be screened for pancreatic insufficiency; this is generally done with fecal elastase testing. Those with normal results should be retested annually and more frequently if there is diminished growth, poor weight gain, or abnormal stools to monitor for development of pancreatic insufficiency. (See
         <a class="local">

          Pancreatic enzyme replacement
