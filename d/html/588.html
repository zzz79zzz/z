Studies indicate that children involved with child welfare and living away from their birth parents in informal placements with relatives have had similar life experiences. Thus, providing health care for children involved with child welfare, and especially those in foster care, requires an understanding of childhood trauma and its potential negative impact on the developing brain; the unique health, mental health, developmental, and educational problems of children and adolescents in foster care; and the structure, goals, and mandates of the foster care system as this will facilitate provision of appropriate comprehensive care to this vulnerable population [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Comprehensive health care for children and adolescents in foster care will be discussed here. The epidemiology of foster care and an overview of the foster care system in the United States are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/596.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of foster care placement and overview of the foster care system in the United States"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">HEALTH NEEDS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children in foster care are a uniquely vulnerable population. They are classified as children with special health care needs by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) because of the high prevalence of chronic medical, developmental, and mental health problems, most of which predate placement in foster care [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. Most children in foster care have at least one chronic medical problem  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57645" href="/z/d/graphic/57645.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and one-fourth have three or more [<a href="#rid2">2,4,6-10</a>]. In a cross-sectional study, the mortality rate among children in foster care was increased compared with children in the general population, independent of race/ethnicity or age [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2840.html" rel="external">"Children and youth with special health care needs"</a>.)</p><p>Throughout this topic, the concept of health encompasses physical (including dental), mental, behavioral, developmental, educational, and psychosocial health. Some of the most commonly identified health problems of children in foster care include, but are not limited to [<a href="#rid2">2,4,6-9,12,13</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exposure to childhood adversity and trauma resulting in toxic or traumatic stress</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Educational, behavioral, and mental health problems</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Developmental disabilities, especially in cognitive, communication, and personal-social skills</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychosocial deprivation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prenatal drug and/or alcohol exposure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic medical illness, for example:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neurologic conditions, some of which are the result of abusive head trauma or neglect</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Genetic and congenital problems</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Asthma</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dental problems</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hearing and vision impairment</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Overweight/obesity</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prematurity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exposure to tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, hepatitis, and infestations</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated lead levels</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of prior health care</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Under-immunization</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Complex childhood trauma and toxic stress</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complex childhood trauma underlies many of the health problems affecting children and adolescents in foster care [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Understanding the impact of multiple adverse childhood experiences is fundamental to providing appropriate care for these children [<a href="#rid15">15-18</a>]. Their health problems are compounded by the trauma of removal and separation from their parents/caregivers and the ongoing uncertainty of living in foster care [<a href="#rid2">2,7,19-22</a>].</p><p>Children in foster care have often experienced multiple adversities by the time they enter foster care. Infants and young children entering foster care have high rates of prenatal substance exposure, prematurity, and chaotic and inappropriate caregiving by parents and other care providers [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Children entering foster care may have experienced significant levels of interpersonal violence in their families and communities in addition to maltreatment in the form of abuse or neglect that resulted in removal and placement in foster care. Adolescents in foster care also have high rates of prior maltreatment, often undisclosed, and rates may be higher among adolescents in congregate versus family foster care [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>Maltreatment is the ultimate breach of the parent-child relationship. Most young children in foster care have experienced ongoing or intermittent neglect of their most basic needs; they also may have been physically, emotionally, or sexually abused. Rigid, harsh discipline by a caregiver with unrealistic expectations is common in maltreating families, as is the absence of normal predictable nurturance and routines [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>The terms complex childhood trauma, developmental trauma disorder, and toxic stress are used to describe the cumulative impact of childhood adversities and the subsequent dysregulation of the neuroendocrine stress system, epigenetic changes, and stimulation of inflammatory pathways that negatively affect brain development and overall health [<a href="#rid14">14,15,25-29</a>]. The areas of the brain most affected are those involved in executive function, memory, emotional regulation, attention, and stress reactivity. The impact on cognitive and emotional development manifests as insecure attachment, intellectual disabilities, inattention, poor emotional self-regulation, impulsivity, hyperactivity, emotional reactivity, hyper-arousability, hypervigilance, and other behavioral and emotional problems [<a href="#rid4">4,14,30</a>]. Ongoing exposure to early maltreatment in a setting lacking in protective factors can erode the resilience of children over time [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Mental health issues</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2079016117"><span class="h4">Prevalence and predisposing factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mental health is the most significant health concern for most children and adolescents in foster care. Behavioral and emotional problems rooted in childhood trauma and deprivation are common [<a href="#rid10">10,32-36</a>]. Primary care providers should be vigilant in monitoring children and adolescents in foster care for past or current mental health problems. (See <a class="local">'Mental health'</a> below.)</p><p>The frequency and severity of emotional problems related to complex childhood trauma may be compounded by the child's lack of security and permanence in foster care; lack of stability in placement exacerbates underlying emotional and behavioral problems [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. More than one-third of children in foster care have moderate to severe emotional problems, and another one-third have less severe disabilities.</p><p>Behavioral exacerbations may be precipitated by a number of factors, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poor quality visitation with birth parents, particularly if it is erratic or causes the child to relive the trauma of separation or rejection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The stress of changes in placement, unrealistic expectations of foster/kinship parents, and court appearances.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Changes in caseworkers, childcare providers, or therapists that magnify losses in the lives of these children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reminders of prior trauma, which may be subtle and escape the notice of the caregiver; a child or adolescent presenting with the symptoms noted below should be assessed for exposure to trauma reminders (see <a class="local">'Manifestations of mental health issues'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Foster family's lack of respect for the child's culture (including religion, race, and ethnicity) and/or not allowing the child to practice their culture in a reasonable manner [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]</p><p></p><p>Foster parent, social worker, or adolescent self-reports may underestimate emotional or developmental problems [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. In a study of children entering foster care in California, for example, 84 percent were found to have emotional or developmental problems during comprehensive assessment, but only 33 percent of foster parents or social workers reported such problems [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In another study, 41 percent of early adolescents (11 to 14 years) entering foster care in Wisconsin had a prior mental health diagnosis, and 72 percent of those without a prior mental health diagnosis received one when formally assessed [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>Mental health access is low compared with mental health need but improves as children enter school or have more contact with health care providers [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Disparities in mental health access remain a significant issue for children in foster care [<a href="#rid40">40,42</a>], with White children having more access than children of other race/ethnicities [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Access to mental health is also increased among young children (age two to five years) who have experienced sexual abuse (compared with neglect) [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. In addition, children in nonrelative foster care appear to have better access to mental health than those in relative foster care [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>]. As young people "age out" of foster care, their access to mental health care also decreases [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p>Children in foster care account for a disproportionate amount of Medicaid mental health expenditures and are more likely to use Medicaid-reimbursed mental health services and high-cost services (eg, emergency department, inpatient) than children eligible for Medicaid through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, formerly Aid to Families with Dependent Children [AFDC]) [<a href="#rid30">30,48,49</a>]. Children in foster care also are more likely than those in TANF to have a mental health problem [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. The mental health symptoms of children in foster care often are manifestations of trauma and can be difficult to distinguish from other problems such as ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, depression, and bipolar disorder [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. The possibility that a child has experienced significant trauma that has not been identified or appropriately addressed should be considered in children with multiple mental health diagnoses or children diagnosed with both behavioral and developmental/learning issues.</p><p>Mental health issues related to early trauma also are prevalent among adolescents in foster care, as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 17-year-olds entering foster care in Missouri, 61 percent had at least one psychiatric disorder during their lifetime; 62 percent reported that their earliest psychiatric problem was manifest before entering foster care [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nearly one-third of older adolescents in foster care in the Midwest Study had affective or substance use disorders [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Twenty-five percent of young adults in the Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study had posttraumatic stress disorder (a rate nearly twice that in Vietnam war veterans) [<a href="#rid52">52,53</a>].</p><p></p><p>The AAP and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry strongly recommend that children entering foster care have a full mental health evaluation within several weeks of placement by a trauma-informed, pediatric mental health professional. The failure to view behavioral and emotional symptoms through a trauma lens may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Traumatic stress symptoms are best treated with stability in a nurturing placement and evidence-based psychotherapies, although medications may be prescribed in the short-term for the treatment of specific symptoms, such as insomnia. Caregivers may need to be counseled to use trauma-informed positive parenting [<a href="#rid54">54</a>] and that medication can temporarily assist with symptoms while awaiting trauma-informed mental health services. Several studies have demonstrated problems including a high prevalence of psychotropic medication use, polypharmacy, prescription of medication for a diagnosis for which the medication is not indicated, and use of two or more drugs from the same class [<a href="#rid55">55-59</a>]. Although some children in foster care who have experienced trauma may have comorbid mental health conditions for which medication is indicated, clinicians and foster parents should be vigilant to ensure that psychotropic medication use is necessary and appropriate [<a href="#rid60">60</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H530937209"><span class="h4">Manifestations of mental health issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children may present with symptoms such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention that mimic other disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Dysregulation of sleep, eating, and elimination (ie, voiding and stooling) are common and may reflect altered structure and function of specific areas of the brain, especially the hippocampus. Thus, the provider needs to include trauma as part of their differential diagnosis of common childhood emotional and behavioral symptoms. </p><p>The manifestations of emotional disorders related to trauma and toxic stress vary by the type, intensity, and frequency of stressors/trauma; the age, temperament, and coping capacities of the child; and the presence or absence of protective factors in the child's life:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infants and young children frequently have sleeping and feeding disorders, extreme fussiness or irritability, and tantrums. Infants younger than six months may have tremors related to withdrawal from prenatal substance exposures. Prenatal substance exposure is also associated with lower language and motor functioning, although early and stable placement may buffer vulnerability to perinatal risk on development [<a href="#rid61">61,62</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5016.html" rel="external">"Prenatal substance exposure and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS): Management and outcomes", section on 'Long-term outcomes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preschool and early school-age children may have problems with toileting, sleep, transitions, and emotional self-regulation. Dysregulation may manifest as frequent tantrums, aggression, impulsivity, destructive behaviors, and hyperactivity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anxiety is more common and depression is less common among children in foster care than expected. However, depression may be a later manifestation of early childhood trauma and manifest in adolescence. Depression may manifest as withdrawal and social isolation or recurrent somatic symptoms that escalate during times of stress or anxiety. Anxiety may manifest as inattention, hyperactivity, high reactivity, or extreme worry. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1224.html" rel="external">"Pediatric unipolar depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some children in foster care have symptoms that meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder with hyper-arousal and high reactivity, re-experiencing (intrusive memories, nightmares about the trauma), and avoidance (memory deficits about trauma, guilt, worry, or numbing). Most children and adolescents, however, manifest traumatic stress symptoms that do not meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. The term "developmental trauma disorder" has been applied to children with a history of complex trauma whose symptoms include a mix of behavioral, developmental, and emotional problems in recognition of the effects on multiple areas of the development brain [<a href="#rid63">63</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adolescents may test the limits of acceptable social behavior through truancy, delinquency, running away [<a href="#rid64">64</a>], substance abuse, sexual experimentation, and self-destructive or violent activities. High-risk behaviors are believed to represent both the effects of trauma on the prefrontal cortex (and atypical development of emotional and behavioral regulation) and attempts to treat trauma symptoms such as intrusive thoughts [<a href="#rid65">65</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Trauma that occurs in the primary attachment relationship can lead to insecure attachment and have long-lasting implications for interpersonal relationships [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. Children may view the world as a hostile and unpredictable place and have great difficulty forming healthy attachments to adult caregivers or significant others. Poor relational care in infancy and early childhood may also alter the child's sense of self [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. However, in an observational study, nearly one-half of 62 adolescents who were insecurely attached to their birth parent were able to form a secure attachment to their foster parent [<a href="#rid68">68</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Exposure to violence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Violence exposure among children in foster care was evaluated through interviews of 300 school-aged children from Los Angeles County [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. The following results were reported:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Eighty-five percent had witnessed violence in their lifetime; of these, 54 percent had witnessed violence in the previous six months</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fifty-one percent had been a victim of violence in their lifetime; of these, 41 percent had been victims of violence in the previous six months </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Children in foster care have also experienced high levels of domestic violence, with a potential lifetime exposure of approximately 60 percent [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]</p><p></p><p>Child abuse and the effects of witnessing violence are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6605.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6603.html" rel="external">"Child neglect: Evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/591.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Childhood exposure", section on 'Effects'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Development and education</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cognitive and academic achievement of children and adolescents in foster care is similar to that of children of underrepresented groups with low socioeconomic status living with their birth families [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. However, children in foster care have more developmental and educational problems and lower rates of high school completion. Educational problems include learning disabilities, limited cognitive ability, and behavior disorders [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The negative impact of trauma on the development of executive function often manifests as inattention and distractibility, which may underlie many of the learning issues noted among those in foster care. Many children who achieve stability in a nurturing home appear to experience significant improvement in developmental and academic functioning [<a href="#rid72">72,73</a>]. Close monitoring for developmental and educational problems is warranted even if a child in foster care appears to be doing well initially, given the multiple adversities and uncertainty children continue to experience after placement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/610.html" rel="external">"Specific learning disorders in children: Clinical features", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Birth to six years – More than one-half of the preschool children in foster care have developmental disabilities, particularly communication disorders, poor social-adaptive skills, personal-social delays, and delayed fine-motor skills. Screening for developmental disabilities is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Screening'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Six to 18 years – Children in foster care are often behind expected grade level in school performance. The poor school achievement of children in foster care is attributed to a variety of factors, including emotional problems, the impact of complex trauma on the developing brain, prenatal alcohol and illicit substance exposure, frequent changes in school placement, school absence, and the chaos of the children's lives before being placed in foster care. Once in foster care, children may be moved out of their school district, and thus need to acclimate to a new environment. Every school placement change results in approximately a four-month loss in academic skills [<a href="#rid74">74,75</a>]. Nonetheless, school attendance usually improves in foster care and child welfare is required by law to try to maintain a child in their school of origin [<a href="#rid76">76</a>].

A few states have a centralized health information system into which health information is entered [<a href="#rid78">78</a>]. While the child is in foster care, it is helpful to collect and maintain up-to-date immunization records, the medical problem list, medication list, and pertinent psychosocial information. Such information should follow the child through placement changes or changes in providers. Ideally, the medical home remains constant even if a placement change occurs, so that the medical home serves as the central repository of health information while the child is in foster care. Laws and regulations around information sharing vary among states so that it is best to seek direction from the state child welfare system or health attorney regarding who can/should have access to health information, including via the patient portal of electronic health records. Health information ideally should follow the child out of foster care, whether they are returning to a parent, adopted, in the care of kin/guardian, or emancipating from care.

In general, Medicaid may not pay for services that have been shown to be of benefit to highly traumatized children, such as therapeutic foster care, mentored visitation, and evidence-based mental health services such as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy [<a href="#rid85">85</a>]. Some communities have addressed these problems by enrolling Medicaid-eligible children and adolescents in foster care into prepaid capitated health plans (Medicaid managed care) to provide an immediate, organized system for comprehensive care [<a href="#rid86">86</a>]. However, mental health care has not always been adequately addressed or covered by managed care. Other communities have provided a centralized source of comprehensive care or identified preferred providers who are willing and able to provide the scope of required services by cobbling together a variety of funding streams [<a href="#rid87">87</a>]. Many such programs ensure quality health services but operate at a substantial deficit. Some states mandate immediate enrollment of children in foster care into Medicaid Managed Care (MMC). Ideally, states would negotiate with MMC to define a package of benefits that would promote integrated care models, preventive mental health services, evidence-based trauma-informed mental health treatment, and appropriate coverage for children with complex medical, mental health, and/or developmental health problems. As of January 1, 2014, any young adult emancipating from foster care at age 18 years or older can retain their Medicaid coverage until age 26 years. Federal law also requires that Medicaid coverage be available to the young adult graduate of foster care who moves out of state.</p><p>The diffusion of authority and responsibility for the health care of children and adolescents in foster care results in a number of complexities. Child welfare is ultimately responsible for the health care of children and teens in foster care, but birth parents retain legal guardianship and consent rights until the child/teen is freed for adoption or ages out. Thus, foster caregivers and relatives have physical custody but do not have the right to consent for health care in most states. Laws around who may consent for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening and have access to screening results also vary from state to state. Adolescents in foster care who have capacity to consent are covered by laws governing minors in their state. Caseworkers often have limited health information available to them at the time of removal and placement. In addition, they may have insufficient knowledge or training to know what types of information should be collected, or how to access needed health care services.

Information should be gathered from as many sources as possible (previous health care providers, caseworkers, foster parents, natural parents, other relatives, schools, childcare centers, etc) to obtain medical, family, social, behavioral, and educational histories that are as complete as possible. Information about a child's strengths, talents, and interests should also be included.

Children who have passed previous developmental screenings may fall off their trajectories as developmental tasks become more complex or because of the impact of accumulating stressors.

(See <a class="local">'Comprehensive health assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up visit</strong> – The follow-up visit should occur 30 to 60 days after the comprehensive assessment. The follow-up visit provides an opportunity to review newly obtained health history, including the results of the mental health and developmental (or educational) evaluations, assess adjustment to foster care and visitation, monitor for abuse and neglect, and provide support and guidance to the foster parent and child. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up visit'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recommended surveillance schedule</strong> – Children in foster care should receive preventive health services according to the American Academy of Pediatrics' schedule for children in foster care. Additional monitoring visits are suggested according to the following schedule: monthly until age six months; every three months from age 6 to 24 months; and every six months from 24 months to 21 years. (See <a class="local">'Recommended health surveillance schedule'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Role of the primary care provider</strong> – Pediatric practices providing medical care for children in foster care should be trauma-informed and organized to accommodate the special needs of these children.
