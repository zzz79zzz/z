         Treatment of human calculi by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was first used in patients for the treatment of kidney stones in 1980 [

         ] and pancreatic stones [

         Pancreatic duct stones are found in approximately 22 to 60 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The stones can lead to obstruction of the outflow of pancreatic secretions, causing increased intraductal pressure [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Because the pancreas is relatively noncompliant, the rise in intraductal pressure can induce tissue hypertension and ischemia, which may be a major factor causing pain in patients with CP [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that symptoms may improve following pancreatic duct drainage [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The extraction of pancreatic duct stones has usually been attempted during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). However, successful stone extraction during ERCP depends upon the size and location of the stones and may not be possible if strictures are present or pancreatic stones have become embedded in the ductal system. As a result, a method of stone disruption prior to endoscopic extraction could be helpful. ESWL leads to the fragmentation of pancreatic stones, which has improved the results of endoscopic therapy and may have additional indications in the treatment of patients with CP [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         Lithotripsy works by concentrating focused shock waves (SWs) on stones, which causes their disruption. SWs can be generated by three methods:
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         SW generation takes place in degassed water. The SWs are focused either by reflection of the primary wave, arraying of the piezoceramic elements on a hemispherical disk, or by an acoustic lens. SWs are directed into the body via a water cushion or a water basin.
        </p>
        <p>
         The stones must be localized using radiographic imaging prior to lithotripsy. Application of several hundred to several thousand SWs to the calculus in a focal area results in gradual disintegration of the stone. Disintegration results from the rapidly rising pressures (up to 500 to 1000 bar) within the focal area [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Stone localization'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other forms of pancreatic stone lithotripsy have been reported in small case series [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. The techniques involve disruption of pancreatic stones by intraductal mechanical, electrohydraulic, or pulsed-dye laser lithotripsy during ERCP. These methods probably offer no advantage over ESWL, which is simple to perform, has high efficacy and has a low complication rate. (See

         The role of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in the management of patients with chronic pancreatitis is evolving. The technique is not widely available, particularly in the United States, and its efficacy compared with other methods of treatment has not been established in randomized controlled trials (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5647.html" rel="external">
          "Chronic pancreatitis: Management"
         </a>
         ). However, a meta-analysis including a total of 588 patients found that ESWL was effective in relieving main pancreatic duct obstruction and alleviating pain in chronic calcific pancreatitis, most often in combination with endoscopic therapy [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         ESWL for pancreatic stones is indicated for patients with all of the following:

         Almost all stones are amenable to therapy because their biochemical composition consists of 95 percent

         on a protein matrix. In our experience, approximately 44 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis were eligible for ESWL [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The technique is optimally suited for patients who have a dilated main pancreatic duct that contains a single stone but has no stricture. However, patients with relatively unfavorable characteristics (such as those with multiple stones, pancreatic duct strictures, or small pseudocysts, or those who continue to drink alcohol) may also benefit from ESWL. (See
         <a class="local">

         Adequate visualization of pancreatic and surrounding anatomy is essential prior to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). We usually accomplish this by obtaining good quality plain films of the pancreatic area in left and right oblique positions, as well as a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In centers in which MRCP is unavailable, a computed tomography scan with and without intravenous contrast can also demonstrate pancreatic ductal obstruction related to pancreatic stones.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the majority of patients, a two-dimensional radiologic targeting system is required during lithotripsy because ultrasound localization of pancreatic stones is insufficiently precise. In one study, for example, the position of the stone was monitored successfully in 14 percent of patients treated with a piezoelectric lithotriptor using only ultrasound for localization [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Localization by ultrasound may be better when the main pancreatic duct is dilated [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The median stone size and pancreatic duct size was 12 mm in one report that relied exclusively on ultrasound targeting [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. For very small stones or radiolucent stones, visualization can be improved by instillation of contrast medium through a nasopancreatic catheter.

          18
         </a>

          19-21

         Most patients are positioned so that the stones are separated from the spine (slight left or right lateral decubitus), with shock waves (SWs) entering the body from the ventral side [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,15,16,19-23
         </a>
         ]. Some lithotriptor devices require that the SWs enter from the dorsal side [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,24
         </a>
         ] or obliquely [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The SWs should be focused first on the most distally located stone and then on the other calculi proceeding from the head to the tail. This allows drainage of the fragments downwards through the papilla. A total of 3000 to 5000 SWs using the highest possible energy level (0.54 mJ/mm-2) are usually delivered in one treatment session, which lasts approximately 45 to 60 minutes. When ERCP immediately follows the ESWL session, the energy level of the SW is reduced to a maximum level of 0.33 to 0.37 mJ/mm-2 to avoid duodenal edema and erosions, which might impair further endoscopic treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         SWs can be triggered by breathing (when the stone is moving out of the focal zone during breathing) and/or by the electrocardiogram (during the refractory period). This is particularly helpful in patients who have a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as premature ventricular contractions can be observed during lithotripsy. In these patients, SWs should be delivered only during the refractory period to avoid possible ventricular arrhythmias.
        </p>
        <p>
         Repeat ESWL may be required if stones have incompletely disintegrated, which is often the case in patients with large or multiple stones. The reported mean number of treatment sessions required to complete lithotripsy has ranged from 1.3 to 6.0 per patient in most reports [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,15,18,19,22,23,26-28

         <a href="#rid17">

         In our experience, therapeutic ERCP is usually required within a few hours of ESWL to remove stone fragments. However, in other centers, successful spontaneous passage of the residual fragmented stones has been reported [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,27,28
         </a>

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In a series from Japan, 24 of 32 patients (75 percent) with stones in the main pancreatic duct achieved spontaneous stone clearance following ESWL applied once or twice per week [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. However, the high rates of spontaneous stone clearance seen in this study may be explained by the selection of patients without severe main pancreatic duct strictures (22 out of 32) and with good residual exocrine function (only two patients out of 32 [6 percent] presented with steatorrhea) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Based on the available data, we suggest allowing spontaneous passage of the stone fragments only in patients without an associated tight stricture and with good residual exocrine function.

         On the other hand, many authorities advocate that pancreatic sphincterotomy should be performed

Placement of a nasopancreatic tube with its tip proximal to the unfragmented stone increases the efficacy of ESWL and may permit stone passage when the tube is perfused during the procedure [

         Stone extraction during ERCP can be accomplished with a mini-Dormia basket using the "rotation-perfusion" technique, which consists of sweeping the basket along the main pancreatic duct with a rotary motion while injecting

         Studies suggested that delaying endoscopic intervention for more than 36 hours after ESWL may be beneficial for some patients. In a study that compared ERCP &gt;36 hours with ERCP &lt;12 hours or between 12 to 36 hours after ESWL in 267 patients with native papilla (ie, no prior ERCP), delaying ERCP &gt;36 hours was associated with higher rates of successful cannulation (91 versus 71 and 82 percent, respectively) and stone clearance (91 versus 76 and 85 percent, respectively) [

However, the piezoelectric generator was used in a small minority of patients (5 percent), whereas the electromagnetic system used in 61 percent and the electrohydraulic spark gap system in 31 percent. Lower success rates were reported in two studies with a total of 128 patients. ESWL was considered to be technically successful in only 54 and 60 percent of patients, respectively [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,26

         <a href="#rid26">
          26

         ]. In a study of 148 patients with pancreatic duct stones, patients with lower density stones (measured by mean value of CT attenuation, using cutoff value 1000.45 Hounsfield units) had a better stone clearance rate compared with patients with higher density stones (69 versus 60 percent) [

         Studies have shown that ESWL is effective at both relieving pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis and at improving pancreatic exocrine (but not necessarily endocrine) function. However, the variable natural history of chronic pancreatitis complicates the assessment of treatments aimed at relieving symptoms. In one series, for example, 85 percent of 141 patients with chronic calcific pancreatitis obtained pain relief after a median time of 4.5 years, and the rates of pain relief were similar in those who underwent surgery and in those who did not [

         The radiographic success of ESWL has been associated with clinical improvement. In a meta-analysis of 27 studies with 3189 patients who underwent ESWL for chronic calcific pancreatitis with main pancreatic duct stones &gt;5 mm in size, 53 percent of patients reported no pain during follow-up (95% CI 51-55 percent) and 33 percent of patients reported mild to moderate pain (95% CI 31-36 percent) [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. In a subsequent meta-analysis of 22 studies including 3868 patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic duct stones who were treated with ESWL, complete relief of pain was reported by 64 percent of patients (95% CI 58-71 percent), while complete ductal clearance was achieved in 70 percent of patients (95% CI 64-76) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Post-procedural pancreatitis and cholangitis occurred in 4.0 and 0.5 percent of patients, respectively. Individual studies have found that complete or partial pain relief following ESWL was achieved in 62 to 95 percent of patients during a mean follow-up ranging from 7 to 77 months [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,15-17,21,23,26,27,29,33,35,42,43

        </p>
        <p>
         Immediate relief of or improvement in pain has been associated with successful decompression of the main pancreatic duct (as suggested by decrease in its diameter or stone clearance) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,17,24,30
         </a>

No significant differences in the outcome of pancreatic pain were reported when ESWL alone was compared with the combination of endoscopy with ESWL treatment (n = 29).

         Given the above findings, the advantages of treatment with ESWL alone (noninvasiveness, efficiency, innocuousness, and low cost) have to be considered when choosing the initial therapeutic option in selected patients. (See

         Pancreatic surgery is required in 1.4 to 20 percent of patients after technical failure of stone disintegration or endoscopic ductal drainage, or for complications of pancreatitis beyond the capability of endoscopic management. Later surgery may also be indicated for definitive biliary drainage (hepaticojejunostomy) or for pancreatic ductal drainage (pancreaticojejunostomy) [

         Severe complications, such as organ damage or acute pancreatitis, are rare following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Overall morbidity is related primarily to the associated endoscopic procedures and is generally easily controlled with medical treatment. No procedural or hospital mortality has been reported in large published series [
         <a href="#rid9">

         A prospective study with a total of 634 patients undergoing 1470 ESWL procedures found that major complications of pancreatic ESWL (eg, post-ESWL pancreatitis, bleeding, infection, steinstrasse, and perforation) occurred at an overall rate of 6.7 percent [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Steinstrasse was defined as acute stone impaction at the papilla leading to poor pancreatic drainage and upstream dilation of the pancreatic duct. It was reported in 0.4 percent of cases. This very rare complication could require emergency endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or ESWL. Risk factors for complications were pancreas divisum (odds ratio [OR] 4.4, possibly owing to a narrow minor papilla) and a longer interval between diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic ESWL (OR 1.3). Protective factors were male sex (OR 0.50), diabetes mellitus (OR 0.45), and steatorrhea (OR 0.43). Interestingly, no procedure-related risk factors were identified.

        <p>
         Data have suggested that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) resulted in lower risk of post-ESWL pancreatitis. In a trial including 1370 patients with pancreatic stones, the risk of post-ESWL pancreatitis was lower in patients who received rectally administered

         In a small series of 13 patients with pancreatic stones treated by ESWL and investigated before and after lithotripsy, there was a transient increase in serum lipase, mild hemolysis, and an isolated increase in serum LDH 5 isoenzyme, suggesting granulocyte damage [

         <strong>
          Indications
         </strong>
         – We suggest extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) as a first-line approach in patients with painful chronic pancreatitis associated with obstructive ductal stones (calcified or radiolucent), inducing upstream dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, regardless of the etiology of the chronic pancreatitis (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). (See

         <strong>
          Postprocedure care
         </strong>
         – As a general rule, stone fragmentation by ESWL is followed by endoscopic ductal drainage using pancreatic sphincterotomy, fragmented stone extraction, and pancreatic stenting in the case of a ductal stricture. However, in selected patients with uncomplicated calcified chronic pancreatitis, ESWL without endoscopic ductal drainage may be an option. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Need for ERCP'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Efficacy
         </strong>
         – The best fragmentation rates (approximately 90 percent) are obtained when a fluoroscopic targeting system is used to focus on the stones. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Technical results'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         After completion of endoscopic pancreatic ductal drainage, definitive pain relief can be expected in approximately two-thirds of patients at long-term follow-up. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pain relief'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The best clinical results are seen in patients who do not smoke and in patients who receive early treatment in the course of their chronic pancreatitis. (See
         <a class="local">
