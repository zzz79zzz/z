         Sudden cardiac death in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is most frequently the result of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. The appearance of a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia following an MI, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT; monomorphic or polymorphic)
         <strong>
         </strong>
         or ventricular fibrillation (VF), in the early period post-MI may be the harbinger of ongoing myocardial ischemia, the development of proarrhythmic myocardial scar tissue, elevated sympathetic tone or increase in circulating catecholamines, or an electrolyte disturbance such as hypokalemia. In-hospital mortality approaches 20 percent or more in patients who develop VT or VF following an MI. As such, rapid identification and treatment of these arrhythmias can be life-saving. Although all patients with a prior MI have an elevated risk of malignant arrhythmias, the magnitude of risk varies from patient to patient, with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction being the most prominent risk stratifier.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will focus on the incidence, mechanisms, and clinical features of ventricular arrhythmias during and after acute MI. Treatment for established ventricular arrhythmias during acute MI and in the post-MI patient, using defibrillation with or without antiarrhythmic medications, is discussed separately. (See

         While many studies have evaluated the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in the peri-infarct period, comparison of these studies is difficult due to differences in populations (percutaneous intervention therapy versus fibrinolytic therapy versus no therapy), type of infarct (ST segment elevation MI [STEMI] versus non-ST segment elevation MI [NSTEMI] versus both), and arrhythmia reported (ventricular tachycardia [VT] versus ventricular fibrillation [VF] versus both). The clinical significance of different types of ventricular ectopy following MI also varies markedly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ventricular arrhythmias, ranging from isolated premature ventricular complexes/contractions (PVCs; also referred to a premature ventricular beats, premature ventricular depolarizations, ventricular premature complexes, or ventricular premature beats) to VF, are common in the immediate post-infarction period (ie, within the first 48 hours). Observations in the pre-fibrinolytic era found the following range of incidence [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </a>
         ]:

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, VT and VF, are infrequent but serious complications of an acute STEMI. The largest experience on the incidence of VT and VF during an acute STEMI comes from the GUSTO-1 trial of 40,895 patients who were treated with thrombolytic therapy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The overall incidence of sustained VT or VF was 10.3 percent: 3.5 percent developed VT, 4.1 percent VF, and 2.7 percent both VT and VF. Approximately 80 to 85 percent of these arrhythmias occurred in the first 48 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rates of VT and VF have declined with time. In a study of 11,825 patients with acute MI between 1986 and 2011, there was a decrease in the incidence of both VT (from 14.3 to 10.5 percent) and VF (from 8.2 to 1.7 percent) over the 25 years reviewed [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Sustained ventricular arrhythmias are less common in patients with an acute NSTEMI or unstable angina compared to patients with STEMI, as illustrated in a pooled analysis of four major trials of over 25,000 such patients [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The overall incidence of VT or VF was 2.1 percent, lower than the 10.3 percent incidence in GUSTO-1 in STEMI [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. VT occurred in 0.8 percent, VF in 1 percent, and VT and VF in 0.3 percent. The median time to arrhythmia was 78 hours.

         </span>
         The definition of "early" versus "late" ventricular arrhythmias can vary among cardiologists and electrophysiologists and is also changing with time. Most now consider "late" arrhythmias to be those that occur beyond 24 to 48 hours post-MI onset. Late VT is a predictor of a worse prognosis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Among post-MI patients who survived for 30 days, subsequent one-year mortality was significantly higher among those who had late VT (24.7 percent) compared with those without sustained ventricular arrhythmia (2.7 percent) [
         <a href="#rid4">

         In the era of early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), VT (especially non-sustained VT) remains fairly common. In the MERLIN-TIMI 36 study of 6355 patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes who underwent seven days of continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring following their presentation to the hospital to assess for VT and ischemia, 25.3 percent were found to have VT (20 percent VT without ischemia, 5.3 percent VT with ischemia) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Compared with patients with neither VT nor ischemia on continuous ECG monitoring, patients with VT without concurrent ischemia had a significantly increased risk of both cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death (SCD; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.2 and 2.3, respectively). Patients with VT and ischemia had an even higher risk of both cardiovascular death and SCD (adjusted HR 5.4 and 6.5, respectively).

         Data regarding the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias at the time of acute STEMI come from studies of patients treated with either fibrinolysis or primary PCI. Although the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is probably lower with contemporary therapies [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,8-11
         </a>
         ], these data are also probably underestimating the true incidence of arrhythmias because patients with prehospital SCD may not have been included in studies of fibrinolysis or primary PCI. The risk factors for and the prognosis of early VT or VF in patients with STEMI are discussed separately. (See

         Among patients with acute MI in the fibrinolytic era, the incidence of VF has ranged from 3.7 to 6.7 percent in large studies [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,10-13
         </a>

         ]. The overall incidence of sustained VT or VF was 10.2 percent (3.5 percent developed VT, 4.1 percent VF, and 2.7 percent both VT and VF). Approximately 80 to 85 percent of these arrhythmias occurred in the first 48 hours. Two limitations of fibrinolytic trials are the exclusion of patients who died of SCD in the prehospital arena, which affects the total denominator of patients, as well as the fact that fibrinolysis and reperfusion may lead to reperfusion arrhythmias, falsely increasing the incidence of MI-associated arrhythmias.

         The proper milieu for the development and maintenance of ventricular arrhythmias is ultimately based upon the rapid and profound effects that acute myocardial ischemia has on the electrophysiologic characteristics of the myocyte. Changes in the resting membrane potential and in the inward and outward ionic fluxes during the action potential lead to alterations in conduction, refractoriness, and automaticity of cardiac muscle cells, all of which contribute to the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias [

         These events produce the mechanisms that initiate arrhythmias and the substrate for arrhythmia perpetuation. Arrhythmia pathogenesis varies at different stages in this process.

Acute and delayed arrhythmias are distinguished by clinical arrhythmia type, cellular mechanisms, and immediate prognostic implications.

         During the chronic, healing phase of an acute MI (more than 48 hours), the typical patient with sustained monomorphic VT (SMVT) has had a large, often complicated infarct with an LV ejection fraction ≤30 percent [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22
         </a>
         ]. The VT in this situation is usually reentrant and scar mediated, resulting from fibrosis due to the infarction. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         New ischemia can be superimposed upon this substrate with the appearance of a variety of ventricular arrhythmias, most commonly polymorphic VT or VF but also including NSVT and SMVT [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Polymorphic VT (associated with a normal QT interval of the sinus beat) and VF are the only arrhythmias associated with active ischemia, regardless of the cause.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Thus, revascularization and anti-ischemic therapy may be part of the antiarrhythmic regimen. Autonomic imbalance, electrolyte abnormalities, and the proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs can also contribute to the appearance of SMVT or other ventricular arrhythmias.

         ]. The early occurrence of PVCs does not predict short- or long-term mortality, but frequent and/or multiform PVCs that persist more than 48 to 72 hours after an MI may be associated with an increased long-term arrhythmic risk, especially in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [

In the GISSI-2 trial, which evaluated 8676 patients with ST elevation MI (STEMI) treated with thrombolytic therapy who underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring before discharge, more than 10 PVCs per hour was a significant predictor for both total (relative risk [RR] 1.62, 95% CI 1.16-2.26) and sudden mortality (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.22-4.08).

        <p>
         While PVCs are not generally predictive of a risk of more serious arrhythmia, an exception is the presence of an R-on-T PCV, ie, those that occur right after the apex of the T wave. In the presence of ischemia, the R-on-T PVC is associated with an increased risk of provoking polymorphic VT or VF. (See

         PVCs produce few or no symptoms in the vast majority of patients, although some individuals may be incapacitated by palpitations or dizziness. PVCs rarely cause true hemodynamic compromise, except when they occur frequently in a patient with severely depressed LV function or when they are associated with an underlying bradycardia. The most common symptoms resulting from PVCs are palpitations secondary to the hypercontractility of a post-PVC beat or a feeling that the heart has stopped secondary to a post-PVC pause. Less often, frequent PVCs can result in a pounding sensation in the neck, lightheadedness, or near syncope.

         An accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR), which has also been called "slow ventricular tachycardia," arises below the atrioventricular (AV) node (within the ventricular myocardium) and has, by definition, a rate between 50 and 100 beats/minute  (

        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical presentation of AIVR can vary, but given the relatively slow rate and transient nature patients are frequently asymptomatic. Some patients may notice palpitations or lightheadedness, and there may be some associated hypotension if the rate results in a drop in cardiac output.
        </p>
        <p>
         AIVR occurs in up to 50 percent of patients with acute MI, although it is not always documented on ECG as it may be transient. Some studies have suggested an association with reperfusion following fibrinolytic therapy [

         Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) is defined as three or more consecutive PVCs lasting less than 30 seconds, originating below the AV node (within the ventricular myocardium), with a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef111254" href="/z/d/graphic/111254.html" rel="external">
          waveform 2
         </a>
         ). VT is considered sustained if it lasts more than 30 seconds or is associated with hemodynamic collapse requiring prompt therapy. Monomorphic VT is identified by the presence of a single, consistent QRS morphology, which suggests that each beat arises from the same location (or the same reentrant circuit) and activates the ventricle in the same sequence. This uniformity should be present in all 12 ECG leads. As a result, a 12-lead ECG should be obtained in stable patients in order to fully characterize the VT morphology.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical presentation may include palpitations, dizziness or lightheadedness, shortness of breath, worsening ischemic symptoms due to the elevated heart rate, and hemodynamic compromise or collapse. Patients with faster tachycardias and worse LV systolic function are less likely to tolerate the arrhythmia. Another concern is that sustained monomorphic VT (SMVT) may produce ischemia, which may be an important concern for the degeneration of SMVT into ventricular fibrillation (VF).
        </p>
        <p>
         The impact of NSVT on mortality was evaluated in 6560 patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Only 1.2 percent of patients without VT experienced sudden cardiac death (SCD). Compared with patients with no VT, patients with four to seven beats of NSVT (2.9 percent SCD; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.5) and patients with eight or more beats of NSVT (4.3 percent SCD; adjusted HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-4.9) had a higher risk of SCD.
        </p>
        <p>
         The probable mechanism and the prognostic significance of NSVT depend upon the time at which it occurs in relation to infarction. In the early stage of an evolving infarction (ie, the first 6 to as many as 48 hours), monomorphic VT may result from transient arrhythmogenic phenomena in ischemic and infarcting tissue, such as abnormal automaticity, triggered activity, and reentrant circuits created by heterogeneous conduction and repolarization. In the first 24 to 48 hours after an infarction, nonsustained VT (NSVT) is usually due to abnormal automaticity or triggered activity in the region of ischemia or infarction. In comparison, NSVT that occurs later is more often due to reentry.
        </p>
        <p>
         SMVT in any other setting is considered a marker of permanent arrhythmic substrate (ie, fibrosis and reentry) and an increased long-term risk of arrhythmia recurrence and SCD. Because of the physiologic and mechanistic link between SMVT and permanent substrate, it is not clear that SMVT at any point, even early after an MI, should be attributed to transient phenomena. Furthermore, SMVT in the setting of an acute MI may reflect permanent substrate from a prior infarction. As a result, the prognostic significance of SMVT in the early period after an MI is unclear. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1040.html" rel="external">
          "Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease: Treatment and prognosis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact, studies suggest that early SMVT is associated with higher in-hospital mortality due to cardiac arrest and possibly to exacerbation of ischemia and extension of the infarct [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,11,35-39

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether early SMVT is associated with an increased long-term mortality risk among contemporary patients undergoing revascularization who survive to hospital discharge is less well studied [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,11,14,35,37

         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Among these patients, 150 had hemodynamically unstable VT, 35 had monomorphic VT, and 115 had nonmonomorphic VT (ie, polymorphic VT or VF). Mortality at eight years was higher in those with monomorphic compared with the nonmonomorphic VT (63 versus 37 percent). Among patients who did not have early hemodynamically significant VT, mortality was 27 percent.

         ]. Even if signs and symptoms are absent, myocardial ischemia, which is the most common cause, should be suspected. Polymorphic VT frequently accompanies episodes of coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina). In some patients, the arrhythmia may be the only manifestation of ischemia (without angina or other more typical symptoms) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>

         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>

         When polymorphic VT develops, the type and intensity of symptoms will vary depending upon the rate and duration of VT along with the presence or absence of significant comorbid conditions. Patients with polymorphic VT and symptoms typically present with one or more of the following: sudden cardiac arrest, syncope/presyncope, "seizure-like" activity, or palpitations. Importantly, polymorphic VT that persists for more than 10 to 15 seconds often degenerates into VF.

         VF is the most frequent mechanism of SCD. It is a rapid, disorganized ventricular arrhythmia, resulting in no uniform ventricular activation or contraction, no cardiac output, and no recordable blood pressure. As such, patients invariably present with sudden collapse (syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest). The ECG in VF shows rapid (300 to 400 beats/minute), irregular, shapeless QRST undulations of variable amplitude, morphology, and interval  (

         The occurrence of VF among patients with an acute STEMI, if occurring within the first 48 hours, is associated with an increase in early mortality (eg, in-hospital mortality) but little or no increase in mortality at one to two years among patients who survive to hospital discharge [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,10,37-39,47
         </a>
         ]. These data are quite old; similar data do not exist in contemporary patients treated with early revascularization.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data are more limited in patients with a non-STEMI (NSTEMI). In a pooled analysis of patients with NSTEMI or unstable angina, VF was a significant predictor of increased mortality at both 30 days and six months (adjusted HR 23 and 15, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The increase in risk was largely due to more deaths in the first 30 days.

         Late VT and VF are related to healing of the MI. Usually this reflects the development of scar tissue, which serves as an arrhythmogenic substrate that can promote the development of VT/VF. Fibrosis present in the scar leads to areas of conduction block with interdigitation of viable myocardium; the ensuing slowing of conduction at the border of the infarct can lead to stable reentry circuits and subsequent arrhythmias [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48

         ]. In general, late VT/VF is thought to portend risk of recurrent malignant arrhythmia and is usually treated specifically. (See

         <strong>
          Incidence
         </strong>
         – Ventricular arrhythmias, ranging from isolated premature ventricular complexes/contractions (PVCs; also referred to a premature ventricular beats, premature ventricular depolarizations, ventricular premature complexes, or ventricular premature beats) to ventricular fibrillation (VF), are common in the immediate post-MI period. In the era of early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and aggressive medical therapy, approximately 25 percent of patients with a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome experience ventricular tachycardia (VT) within the initial seven days, an event that portends a significantly greater risk of dying compared with patients without VT. (See

         <strong>
          Mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis
         </strong>
         – VT and VF in the setting of MI result from the complex interaction of multiple factors, including myocardial ischemia, necrosis, reperfusion, healing, and scar formation. Ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of acute MI result from an interplay among three basic components: injured myocardium, which is capable of developing reentrant circuits; arrhythmia triggers (eg, spontaneous PVCs, variations in cycle length); and modulating factors (eg, electrolyte imbalance, ongoing ischemia, autonomic nervous system). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Premature ventricular complex/contraction
         </strong>
         – PVCs are common after acute MI with a reported incidence as high as 93 percent. PVCs produce few or no symptoms in the vast majority of patients, although some individuals may be incapacitated by palpitations or dizziness. The early occurrence of PVCs does not predict short- or long-term mortality. (See

         <strong>
          Accelerated idioventricular rhythm
         </strong>
         – This is generally felt to be due to reperfusion of the occluded artery, which occurs in up to 50 percent of patients with acute MI. The clinical presentation of AIVR can vary, but given the relatively slow rate and transient nature patients are frequently asymptomatic, although some patients may notice palpitations or lightheadedness, and there may be some associated hypotension if the rate results in a drop in cardiac output. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Monomorphic VT
         </strong>
         – VT is considered sustained if it lasts more than 30 seconds or is associated with hemodynamic collapse requiring prompt therapy. The clinical presentation may include palpitations, worsening ischemic symptoms due to the elevated heart rate, and hemodynamic compromise or collapse. Patients with faster tachycardias and worse LV systolic function are less likely to tolerate the arrhythmia. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Polymorphic VT
         </strong>
         – Polymorphic VT (in the absence of QT prolongation of a sinus complex) is much less common in the setting of an acute MI, but when polymorphic VT occurs early after an acute MI, usually within the first 12 hours after the onset of symptoms, it is typically associated with symptoms or signs of recurrent myocardial ischemia. Patients with polymorphic VT and symptoms typically present with one or more of the following: sudden cardiac arrest, syncope/presyncope, "seizure-like" activity, or palpitations. Importantly, polymorphic VT that persists for more than 10 to 15 seconds often degenerates into VF. (See
         <a class="local">

          VF
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         VF is the most frequent mechanism of SCD. It is a rapid, disorganized ventricular arrhythmia, resulting in no uniform ventricular contraction, no cardiac output, and no recordable blood pressure. As such, patients invariably present with sudden collapse (syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest). (See
