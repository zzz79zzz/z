Our approach is based upon findings from randomized trials when available, as well as our clinical experience, data from observational studies, and expert opinion. As in the first stage, creating a positive childbirth experience is one of the goals of care in the second stage.</p><p>Intrapartum care in the first and third stage of normal labor is discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4445.html" rel="external">"Labor and delivery: Management of the normal first stage"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134954.html" rel="external">"Labor and delivery: Management of the normal third stage after vaginal birth"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Detailed discussion of specific subjects related to labor and birth and intrapartum care of complicated labor and birth are also reviewed separately in individual topic reviews on each subject (eg, abnormal progression, preterm labor, cervical ripening and induction, operative vaginal delivery, cesarean birth, malpresentation, analgesia and anesthesia, support, maternal medical/obstetric disorders, episiotomy, multiple gestation, postpartum hemorrhage).</p><p>Management of labor and delivery during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is reviewed separately.

These movements are necessary to avoid presenting diameters of the nonspherical head that are larger than the diameters of the bony pelvis through which the head must traverse and because the pelvic outlet is at a 90-degree angle to the pelvic inlet. </p><p>The course of the second stage is affected by several maternal and fetal factors, including [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pelvic size and shape  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50612" href="/d/graphic/50612.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).

These benefits begin in the first stage and continue through the second and third stages of labor. </p><p>In the second stage, pushing (contraction of voluntary striated muscles of the diaphragm and abdominal wall) is partly a response to stimulation of the pelvic floor by the descending presenting part and partly a voluntary effort that is self-initiated and/or directed by a birth attendant, such as a doula or other labor support person [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Warm compresses also may provide patients a positive sensory experience during childbirth without anesthesia. Although not harmful and supported by some meta-analyses [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>], in our practice, we do not advise patients to perform antenatal perineal massage nor do we perform second-stage perineal massage or apply warm compresses to the perineum in the second stage. Trials suggesting a benefit have major methodologic limitations due to lack of blinding, differences in the provision of usual care, and inability to address the importance of other factors related to perineal injury. </p><p>If used, warm compresses can be made from clean wash cloths or perineal pads immersed in warm tap water (up to 110° Fahrenheit [43° Celsius]) and wrung to release excess water [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. They are held against the mother's perineum during and between pushes, and changed as needed to maintain warmth and cleanliness. Perineal massage is performed during and between pushes with two fingers of the lubricated gloved hand moving from side to side just inside the patient's vagina and exerting mild, downward pressure on the perineum. A water-soluble lubricant should be used.</p><p>Data from meta-analyses of randomized trials show:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In laboring patients ≥36 weeks, applying warm compresses during the second stage of labor [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reduced occurrence of third- and fourth-degree tears compared with hands off or no warm compresses (2.1 versus 4.5 percent; risk ratio [RR] 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.79; four trials, 1799 participants, moderate quality evidence, substantial heterogeneity among trials).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reduced third- and fourth-degree tears compared with hands off/usual care (1.4 versus 2.9 percent; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.94; five trials, 2477 participants).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rates of intact perineum (2.3 to 2.4 percent, moderate quality evidence) and minor trauma (eg, first- and second-degree tears, 1.8 to 3.4 percent, very low-quality evidence) appeared to be similar for the intervention and nonintervention groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In laboring patients ≥36 weeks, compared with no massage, perineal massage applied by a midwife during the second stage (nine trials, 3374 participants) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reduced severe perineal trauma (1.3 versus 2.9 percent; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25–0.94) </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reduced episiotomy use (22.1 versus 33.0 percent; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38–0.82)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Increased the incidence of intact perineum (30.4 versus 26.6 percent; RR 1.40, 95% 1.01–1.93) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In antepartum patients who performed digital perineal massage for at least the last four weeks of pregnancy, perineal trauma (mainly episiotomies) was reduced but the rates of first- or second-degree perineal tears and third-/fourth-degree perineal trauma were similar in the intervention and no intervention groups [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p>Although a multicenter trial in Sweden including nearly 4000 patients randomly assigned to two versus one midwife during the second stage reported that having an additional midwife reduced the risk of severe perineal trauma (3.9 versus 5.7 percent, adjusted OR 0.69-0.97), there were substantial limitations to the design [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. For example, the outcomes were subjective, the outcome assessors were not blinded, the biologic plausibility was unclear as there were no statistically significant differences between groups in perineum-protecting interventions (warm compresses, manual perineal protection, birth position), the actual actions of the second midwife could not be measured, and no cost analysis was performed. Of note, the assisted vaginal delivery rate was lower and the episiotomy rate was higher in the two-midwife group, although the difference was not statistically significant; these factors, especially a higher proportion of mediolateral episiotomies, could account for the results.    </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2615164479"><span class="h1">PUSHING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2614317278"><span class="h2">Early versus delayed</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We generally prefer that patients begin pushing soon after complete cervical dilation is identified (called early or immediate pushing) to minimize the duration of the second stage; however, if the fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern is normal and the station is high, patients may delay pushing (also called laboring down or the passive phase of the second stage) for as much as an hour until the further descent has occurred to reduce the duration of maximal maternal exertion. This decision is based on patient-specific factors, such as whether there is a need to expedite delivery, maternal fatigue, motor blockade from neuraxial anesthesia, and maternal preference.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of term singleton pregnancies randomly assigned to delayed or immediate pushing (12 trials, 5445 participants) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delayed pushing resulted in less time spent actively pushing (mean difference -27.54 minutes, 95% CI -43.04 to -12.04).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>However, this was at the expense of longer second stage (mean difference 46.17 minutes, 95% CI 32.63-59.71) and the longer second stage was associated with an increased risk for chorioamnionitis (9.1 versus 6.6 percent, risk ratio [RR] 1.37, 95% CI 1.04-1.81) and low umbilical cord pH, as defined by individual trial authors (2.7 versus 1.3 percent, RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.30-3.07).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rates of spontaneous vaginal, assisted vaginal, and cesarean birth were similar for both approaches.</p><p></p><p>All participants had neuraxial analgesia. The overall quality of evidence was considered low because of inconsistency and indirectness due to the high heterogeneity of the included trials.</p><p>In a large multicenter trial (2414 participants) that dominated the meta-analysis, the rates of perineal lacerations, occult levator ani muscle injury on ultrasound examination, pelvic organ prolapse stage, and patient-reported pelvic floor symptoms up to six months postpartum were similar for nulliparous patients who underwent immediate pushing and those who underwent delayed pushing [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. However, the immediate pushing groups had lower rates of postpartum hemorrhage (2.3 versus 4.0 percent), chorioamnionitis (6.7 versus 9.1 percent), neonatal acidemia (0.8 versus 1.2 percent), and suspected neonatal sepsis (3.2 versus 4.4 percent) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].  </p><p>Based on these data, ACOG recommends that patients begin pushing when the cervix becomes completely dilated to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes from delayed pushing [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1375577659"><span class="h2">Breathing/pushing technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In our practice, we advise patients to bear down when they feel the need (ie, spontaneous pushing or physiologic pushing), unless neuraxial anesthesia has inhibited the bearing down sensation. Although a common practice is to tell parturients to pull back their knees, tuck in their chin, take a deep breath, bear down at the start of a contraction, and push for 10 seconds with the goal of three pushes per contraction, there is no strong evidence that coaching individuals in this way has any benefit or harm compared with allowing them to bear down and push according to their own reflex needs in response to the pain of contractions and the pressure felt from descent of the fetal head. </p><p>We advise against Valsalva pushing (pushing with a closed glottis) as there is no clinically significant benefit to this technique. It is not harmful, but results in transient maternal cardiovascular effects. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1034.html" rel="external">"Vagal maneuvers", section on 'Valsalva maneuver'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a meta-analysis of randomized trials of different breathing and pushing techniques (8 trials, 884 participants mostly without epidural anesthesia), maternal and newborn outcomes were similar for parturients who followed their own instincts about breathing while pushing (ie, spontaneous pushing) versus those who were told to take a deep breath at the beginning of a contraction and hold it as long as possible while bearing down (ie, directed pushing with Valsalva maneuver) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. All trials were limited by lack of blinding and by crossover between groups, and the overall quality of evidence was low. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A multicenter trial found that nulliparas with singleton term pregnancies and epidural analgesia randomly assigned to moderate pushing (pushing twice during each contraction, resting regularly for one contraction in five without pushing) had a similar rate of urinary or anal incontinence at six months postpartum as the intensive pushing control group (pushing three times during every contraction) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. No obstetric factor in the management of the second stage appeared to affect the occurrence of incontinence, except for operative vaginal delivery.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2258248653"><span class="h2">Malposition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Expectant management is appropriate for occiput posterior (OP) and occiput transverse (OT) positions early in the second stage as long as the FHR pattern is reassuring and descent is occurring.

If descent slows or arrests, manual rotation may be indicated. Timing of rotation and other management issues are reviewed separately.
