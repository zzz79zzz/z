         The results of treatment of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL/LBL) have steadily improved, and currently complete remission (CR) can be induced in 75 to 90 percent of patients. However, in contrast to ALL/LBL in children, relapses are common and long-term survival rates are approximately 25 to 50 percent, depending upon patient age and disease characteristics [

        <p>
         Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is frequently used for management of ALL/LBL in adults. Allogeneic HCT uses intensive preparative therapy (also called conditioning therapy; ie, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) to reduce the burden of leukemic blasts; blood cell formation is restored by engraftment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from another individual (the donor). Allogeneic HCT can be used as consolidation therapy in first complete remission (CR) of ALL/LBL for selected patients with adverse clinical/pathologic features and for some patients in second CR (ie, after experiencing a relapse) or with primary refractory ALL/LBL

          Allogeneic HCT
         </strong>
         – Allogeneic HCT uses intensive preparative therapy (also called conditioning therapy) to reduce the burden of leukemic blasts and restores blood cell formation by infusing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from another individual. Allogeneic HCT is frequently used for adults with ALL/LBL.

         <strong>
          Conditioning (preparative) regimen
         </strong>
         – These terms refer to intensive chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy that reduces the burden of residual leukemic cells. However, the preparative regimen also reduces or eliminates the ability of the transplant host to restore blood cell formation, which necessitates rescue by a donor graft. Conditioning regimens are described as:

          Myeloablative conditioning (MAC)
         </strong>
         – MAC uses very high-dose ("supralethal") treatment that causes irreversible cytopenias and requires hematopoietic support.

          Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)

         <strong>
          Graft donor
         </strong>
         – For patients with ALL/LBL, the graft source is generally from another individual (ie, allogeneic graft); autologous HCT (ie, use of the patient's own stored cells) is rarely used in this setting.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A matched sibling donor (MSD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) is generally preferred, but other options include a partially matched haploidentical family member donor or umbilical cord blood (UCB).

         The preferred donor for patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for ALL is a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling or matched unrelated donor (MUD). However, fewer than 25 percent of patients in the transplantable age group have an HLA-matched sibling donor. Allogeneic HCT using a partially matched family member donor or umbilical cord blood is a reasonable option for patients who do not have an HLA-identical matched donor [

         There has been steady improvement in the outcome of patients undergoing MUD-HCT, largely due to better matching at the HLA loci using molecular methods for DNA sequencing instead of serology alone [

          7
         </a>
         ]. Patients were matched for diagnosis, age, stage of disease, and year of transplantation. TRM was higher with MUD-HCT (44 versus 15 percent) but the relapse rate was lower (32 versus 55 percent). The two-year leukemia-free-survival (LFS) for all patients with ALL was similar in both groups (39 and 32 percent).

The relapse rate was approximately 26 percent at one year. For adults in CR2, MUD-HCT yielded an LFS of 42 percent compared with zero percent after autologous HCT.

         A review of the experience (1988 to 1990) with MUD-HCT facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) described 127 adults with poor risk ALL [ie, presence of t(9;22), t(4;11), or t(1;19)], with an age range from 16 to 54 years [

         Preparative regimens are generally divided into three categories: myeloablative, nonmyeloablative, and reduced-intensity regimens. Most studies of allogeneic HCT in ALL have used myeloablative preparative regimens. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3557.html" rel="external">
          "Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Definitions'

        </p>
        <p>
         Myeloablative preparative regimens use very high, "supralethal," doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation in an attempt to improve upon the results of conventional treatment. The use of these doses is based upon the dose-response relationship observed in hematologic malignant diseases in general and in ALL in particular [

         Relapse of disease is responsible for a large proportion of failures from allogeneic HCT in ALL, suggesting that current conditioning regimes do not eradicate tumor cells sufficiently. Further intensification is limited by parallel increases in treatment-related mortality (TRM). There is no generally agreed-upon best preparative regimen prior to transplant regimen, although total body irradiation (TBI) plus
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">
          cyclophosphamide

         TBI is either fractionated over three to five days or given as a single dose. Fractionated TBI is less toxic to normal cells but large radiation doses are more effective at killing resistant tumor cells. Studies in adults with ALL found that single dose TBI was associated with a significantly higher TRM but also a lower relapse rate than fractionated TBI; there was no difference in the overall leukemia-free survival (LFS) [

As an example, a review from 163 transplant centers compared the results of 103 identical twin and 1030 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling transplants for leukemia [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. The three-year probability of relapse of leukemia was substantially higher in the identical twin transplants for acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 52 versus 16 percent), and for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 40 versus 7 percent); the GVL effect was less pronounced and not statistically significant for ALL (36 versus 26 percent). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3546.html" rel="external">
          "Biology of the graft-versus-tumor effect following hematopoietic cell transplantation"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other observations have supported a GVL effect in ALL:

         In one study of 84 patients with CML, 23 with AML and 22 with ALL in relapse after HCT, infusions of donor lymphocytes (DLI) were capable of inducing remission in CML (73 percent) and AML (29 percent). There was no response in the patients with ALL [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. In other reports, however, occasional patients with relapsed ALL have responded to DLI [
         <a href="#rid31">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, the existence of a beneficial allogeneic GVL effect against ALL cells is likely, but its magnitude is still a matter of controversy. Assuming that GVL does operate in ALL, its effect appears to be less powerful than that observed against myeloid leukemias, such as CML [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30,33

          "Immunotherapy for the prevention and treatment of relapse following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation"
         </a>
         ). The high relapse rate (over 50 percent) among patients transplanted for advanced ALL may be due in part to the minimal effectiveness of this immunologic reaction. (See

          Definitions/concepts
         </strong>
         – Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) uses intensive treatment to reduce the burden of leukemic blasts; blood cell formation is restored by engraftment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Allogeneic HCT (ie, transplantation using a graft from another individual) can play an important role for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL/LBL); by contrast, autologous HCT (stored cells from the patient, him/herself) is rarely used with this disease.

          GVHD
         </strong>
         – Acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) are distinct multisystem disorders that affect diverse organ systems and have different time courses. GVHD occurs when immune cells transplanted from a non-identical donor (the graft) recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, thereby initiating an immune reaction that causes disease in the host. (See

          GVL
         </strong>
         – GVL results from immunologic effects of donor T cells against residual leukemic cells (GVL). GVL appears to be less robust against ALL/LBL than it is for other hematologic malignancies. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Graft-versus-leukemia'

         <strong>
          Settings
         </strong>
         – Transplantation is used for consolidation therapy after first complete remission (CR) in selected patients with high-risk clinical or pathologic features, as consolidation after achieving CR following relapse, and for primary refractory ALL/LBL. Selection of HCT in each of these settings must weigh the benefits and adverse effects of transplantation against other therapeutic options. (See

         <strong>
          Donor selection
         </strong>
         – For allogeneic HCT, the preferred donor is a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (MSD) or a matched unrelated donor (MUD). When MSD nor MUD grafts are not available, other options include a partially matched haploidentical family member donor or umbilical cord blood (UCB). (See
