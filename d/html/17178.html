The most common reason for maternal transfer is lack of availability of neonatal tertiary care, since transferring the fetus in utero is generally preferable to postnatal newborn transport.</p><p>Maternal transfers are also performed for maternal medical or surgical conditions, to accommodate family request, to comply with insurance contract requirements, or when a pregnant or postpartum patient seeks emergency care at a facility without obstetric services. The number of hospitals without obstetric services is increasing in the United States, which has led to the need for more maternal transfers, more births in hospitals without obstetric units, more preterm births, and more out-of-hospital births [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Disparities also exist between the levels of available maternal and neonatal services: 13 percent of females of reproductive age do not live within a 50-mile radius of an obstetric and neonatal intensive care unit [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss inter-facility maternal transport. Prehospital pediatric care and transport are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13870.html" rel="external">"Pediatric considerations in prehospital care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25870676"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, a large proportion of infant mortality and severe morbidity occurs among very low birth weight infants (VLBW, &lt;1500 g), even though they account for only 1.3 percent of all births [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In part for this reason, four major organizations worked together to make recommendations for regional development of perinatal health services and maternal transport programs [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Two major purposes of regionalization were to clearly define the scope of neonatal care available at hospitals and increase the number of high-risk and preterm births occurring at appropriate level facilities, rather than transferring neonates to these facilities after birth.</p><p>Although most maternal transports are for neonatal indications, some are for maternal indications. A national effort to standardize maternal levels of care has also been initiated in an effort to improve maternal morbidity and mortality and decrease "near misses" [<a href="#rid2">2,7</a>]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and others have developed a joint care consensus document of standards for designations of maternal care that are complementary to, but distinct from, neonatal levels of care [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Levels of maternal care are categorized as birth centers, basic care (level I), specialty care (level II), subspecialty care (level III), and regional perinatal health care centers (level IV)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138472" href="/z/d/graphic/138472.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The document recommends that all facilities have the capacity to stabilize and provide initial care for pregnant people with emergencies (eg, hemorrhage, hypertension) and should develop collaborative relationships with higher level care facilities to facilitate maternal transport when appropriate.</p><p>Additional resources are listed below. (See <a class="local">'Resources'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25870888"><span class="h1">REGULATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although all hospitals are not expected to provide labor and delivery services or tertiary maternal and neonatal care, all hospitals with emergency departments should be prepared to begin the assessment and stabilization of pregnant and postpartum patients who present for emergency care, and those offering labor and delivery services should be prepared to assess and stabilize patients who have complicated pregnancies, even if specialized care for high-risk pregnancies or complicated newborns is not available at their facility.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21515544"><span class="h2">Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) governs the transfer of patients between hospitals that accept payments from the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The intent is to ensure that all patients receive a medical screening examination to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists and, if present, necessary stabilizing treatment regardless of the patient's ability to pay. Transfer of patients with an emergency medical condition is appropriate if the patient makes a written request or if the facility does not have the capability or capacity to provide necessary treatment to stabilize the emergency medical condition.</p><p>Under the statute, a pregnant patient with an emergency obstetric condition (eg, nonreassuring fetal status, advanced labor, pregnancy complications threatening maternal or fetal health) who presents to a hospital providing obstetric services is not considered stabilized until delivery of the infant and placenta. Such patients can only be transferred if they or their representative requests transfer or if a physician or other qualified medical personnel signs a certification that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. If the hospital does not provide obstetric services, the benefits of a transfer in this setting may outweigh the risks.</p><p>A qualified medical provider may sign the certification that benefits of transfer outweigh the risks, in consultation with a physician, if the responsible physician is not physically present at the time of transfer. Hospitals have the ability to designate nonphysician medical providers to act as a qualified medical provider and provide medical screening examinations. If nonphysicians will be screening patients, the hospital must indicate in their bylaws which nonphysicians can perform this service; the written statute is not specific regarding whether the nonphysician is a registered nurse, nurse practitioner, or certified nurse midwife. A clear process for phone consultation between the physician and nonphysician provider and guidelines for when the physician must come in to assess the patient before transfer should be established. When a nonphysician certifies the transfer, hospital bylaws should provide a means for a physician to sign the certification for transfer after the fact.</p><p>Violations of the EMTALA statute may result in fines for hospitals and individual physicians, as well as termination of Medicare provider agreements or civil suits [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>It is also important to note that patients in early labor who can be transferred to another facility without jeopardizing their health or fetal well-being are not considered to have an emergency condition covered by the statute. If the transfer is not medically necessary, the patient may be responsible for the transfer cost [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21515551"><span class="h2">Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS) is a voluntary accreditation program for medical transport services, including rotorwing (helicopter), fixed wing (plane), and surface vehicle (ambulance, boat, etc), and is not specific to maternal transport. CAMTS has developed accreditation standards with measurable criteria for medical transport that are designed to address issues of patient care and safety. Accreditation is granted after completion of an application process and a site visit to evaluate "substantial compliance" with the accreditation standards [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>The CAMTS accreditation process addresses multiple general criteria for certification, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Management and staffing</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Quality management</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient care</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Communications</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rotorwing standards</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fixed wing standards</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Surface vehicle standards</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medical escort standards</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21515558"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25870941"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The primary indication for transport of a pregnant or postpartum patient from their present facility is lack of sufficient resources at the facility for appropriate maternal and/or neonatal care. Patients may also request transfer to another facility for personal reasons. Compliance with insurance contract requirements may also be a factor.</p><p>Maternal transfer for neonatal indications (ie, the neonate rather than the mother will require the higher level of medical care) is generally preferable to transferring the neonate after delivery. In utero transfer, when warranted and feasible, results in better infant outcomes than postnatal transfer [<a href="#rid14">14-18</a>]. It also avoids potential separation of the mother from her newborn and the newborn's health care team, which is important if a higher level of neonatal care is the reason for the transfer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4966.html" rel="external">"Preterm birth: Definitions of prematurity, epidemiology, and risk factors for infant mortality", section on 'Level of neonatal care'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H460081454"><span class="h3">Barriers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A potential barrier to indicated transfer is the erroneous perception among providers and/or patients that the present facility can provide an appropriate level of maternal and neonatal care.

The screening examination should include ongoing evaluation of fetal heart rate; frequency, strength, and duration of uterine contractions; fetal position and station; cervical dilation; and status of the membranes [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. All patients should have intravenous (IV) access with at least an 18 gauge catheter (if possible), and oral intake should not be permitted. Placement of a bladder catheter should be considered, depending on the patient's condition (eg, ability to use a bedpan, need for information on hourly urine output) and anticipated duration of transport.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inter-facility agreements should be in place that formalize the relationship between the transferring and receiving facilities and clearly delineate each facility's responsibilities.

(See <a class="local">'Resources'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The receiving facility should be able to provide the appropriate level of care for both the mother and the newborn. Definitions for various maternal and newborn levels of care have been developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href="#rid21">21</a>] and the American Academy of Pediatrics [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Good communication between the referring facility, transport team, and receiving facility is important: written documentation or, ideally, recorded conversation with typed transcript. Faulty communication related to inaccurate, incomplete, untimely, or misinterpreted verbal/written information is a leading cause of preventable serious patient harm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An appropriately equipped, rapid mode of transport to the receiving facility should be available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The transport team should be able to provide a timely response and should have the training and experience to assess the patient's status, determine appropriateness of transfer, and provide appropriate monitoring and care during transport. Most transport teams do not include a physician. If the transport team is not able to manage the medical issues in transport with phone consultation, then suitability for transport should be reconsidered or a physician should join the team.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25870969"><span class="h2">Evaluation and stabilization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step before initiating transfer is to determine whether the mother and fetus are stable, and whether any contraindications to transfer exist (see <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above). According to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), stability for transfer is determined by the physician or qualified medical provider evaluating the patient. (See <a class="local">'Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)'</a> above.)</p><p>Stability is a judgment that the patient's condition is not expected to deteriorate substantially during the transfer process. If the patient is unstable, stabilizing measures should be initiated before transfer. If an unstable patient must be transferred, the transferring provider should document why the benefits of transfer to another facility outweigh the risks for the mother and/or the fetus. For example, a postpartum patient may require emergency neurologic care for an intracranial hemorrhage that occurred at a facility unable to provide those services.</p><p>Advanced labor is considered an unstable condition because of the possibility of delivery during transport. Although delivery of the obstetric patient during transport is a significant concern, the available data suggest that delivery en route is a rare event. In one large study, 1080 obstetric transports for preterm labor were performed in nulliparous and multiparous patients during a 21-month period [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Fifty-four patients were &gt;7 cm dilation at the time of the call for transport, and 25 of the 54 were fully dilated; station ranged from -2 (12 patients) to +2 (10 patients). A trained flight nurse evaluated each patient at the referring facility to determine safety of transport, and decided not to transport 5 of the 54 patients. Of the remaining 49 patients, 40 were transported by helicopter with a mean transport time of 15 minutes, 8 were transported by fixed wing transport with a mean travel time of 90 minutes, and 1 was transported by ground ambulance with a transport time of 27 minutes. No patient delivered en route, but 32 (59 percent) delivered within 0 to 120 minutes of arrival at the receiving hospital.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25870977"><span class="h2">Records and documentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Written informed consent should be obtained and a copy of the patient's medical records (eg, antenatal record, pertinent hospital records and ultrasound reports) should accompany her to the receiving facility. Reports that are unavailable at the time of transport can be sent electronically (secure fax or email) when they become available. Completion of a transfer form that includes key information about the patient, the indication for transport, and mode of transport selected is also recommended.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25870992"><span class="h2">Communication before and after transfer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ongoing communication between providers at each facility are important to facilitate safe transfer. Once the decision to transfer has been made, the transferring facility (physician or provider performing the medical screening examination) should contact the receiving facility. The receiving facility should clearly communicate its willingness to accept the patient in transport. Nurse-to-nurse sign out is also essential. Key points the transferring provider should communicate include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gestational age</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diagnosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reason(s) for transfer</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient condition (ie, vital signs, cervical examination, membrane status, fetal heart rate pattern, uterine contractions, pertinent laboratory and ultrasound results) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intended mode of transport</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medications</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Estimated blood loss and blood products transfused</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medical/obstetric history</p><p></p><p>After the patient has been transferred, the receiving facility should provide follow-up regarding the patient, as well as a written discharge summary with recommendations for outpatient care upon discharge. The process for communicating this information to the transferring facility/provider, and the person responsible for this communication (eg, receiving physician) should be clearly defined.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25871007"><span class="h2">Responsibility</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The referring physician and hospital are responsible for the patient until they arrive at the receiving facility, unless the receiving facility is sending the transport team. In that instance, the receiving facility assumes responsibility for the patient once they leave the transferring hospital. Each facility should have a clear understanding of its responsibilities before, during, and after the transport, ideally in the form of contracts, memorandum of understanding, or another written document clarifying roles and responsibilities. Medical direction during transport may be provided by the referring physician, accepting physician, medical director of the transport agency, or a combination [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2597745451"><span class="h2">Estimated time for and mode of transport</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In determining the mode of transport, the referring provider must take into consideration a variety of factors, including availability of different modes of transport, patient acuity, weather, distance, time, ground conditions, and cost. Utilizing fixed wing and helicopter transport obviously requires additional resources, particularly take-off and landing sites. Fixed wing (and sometimes helicopter) transport also involves additional transfer of the patient by ground ambulance from the landing site to the hospital facility.</p><p>Limited observational data are available regarding advantages and disadvantages of various transport modes for obstetric patients. Air medical transport of pregnant patients by helicopter or fixed wing plane appears to be safe and associated with a very low risk of in-flight complication(s), including delivery [<a href="#rid23">23-28</a>].</p><p>Helicopter transport offers some advantages compared with surface vehicle transport, particularly when the distance to the receiving facility is relatively long or in urban areas where traffic congestion prevents rapid transit. In these situations, some patients who are considered insufficiently stable for surface vehicle transport may be candidates for more rapid transfer by helicopter. Helicopter transport costs can be competitive with ground transport costs [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Helicopter transport may be particularly advantageous in clinical scenarios where timely transport is essential; for example, a pregnancy at the limit of viability in advanced preterm labor where delivery at a facility unprepared to handle resuscitation of a periviable fetus may substantially impact likelihood of neonatal survival.

Maternal vital signs should be obtained and recorded every 15 minutes, or more frequently, as dictated by the patient's condition. The frequency of uterine contractions should be noted and documented. The patient should generally be transported in a left lateral decubitus or sitting position to minimize aortocaval compression from the uterus.</p><p>Patients may develop nausea, vomiting, and/or anxiety related to the transport. Supportive care should be provided. Intravenous (IV) medication options to treat nausea and vomiting include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9820" href="/z/d/drug information/9820.html" rel="external">promethazine</a> 12.5 to 25 mg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9642" href="/z/d/drug information/9642.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a> 5 to 10 mg, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9719" href="/z/d/drug information/9719.html" rel="external">ondansetron</a> 4 to 8 mg. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9573" href="/z/d/drug information/9573.html" rel="external">Lorazepam</a> 1 to 2 mg may be used alone or in combination with an antiemetic for patients with more significant anxiety issues.</p><p>The ability to perform en route continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring can be limited by available space for the monitor, early gestational age, and turbulence or movement from the transport process. The desired type and frequency of fetal monitoring should be discussed by the sending, receiving, and transporting teams as necessary, especially when fetus is considered viable. Intermittent documentation of fetal heart tones by Doppler should be performed if continuous fetal monitoring cannot be accomplished and is an acceptable alternative. Possible interventions if a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern is identified en route include repositioning the patient, increasing IV fluid administration, administering tocolytic drugs, and possibly administering supplemental oxygen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16663.html" rel="external">"Intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings: Management"</a>.)</p><p>Limited data exist regarding fetal monitoring during maternal transport. In the only study on the feasibility of continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring during maternal fixed wing transport, 40 of the 57 transports (70 percent) were electronically monitored [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. The other 17 patients could not be monitored electronically because of obesity, no electronic monitor available, unable to convert monitor for use with an airplane battery, or "unknown" reasons; the fetal heart rate of these patients was intermittently monitored with a Doppler device. Thirty-three of the 40 electronic fetal heart rate tracings (83 percent) were clear and readable at least 50 percent of the time en route. Maternal inspired oxygen was adequate to avoid fetal hypoxia at cabin altitudes of 1100 to 7000 feet (335 to 2134 meters) for flights up to 80 minutes long.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4196401832"><span class="h1">RESOURCES</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A general guide for inter-facility patient transfer has been published by the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fone.nhtsa.gov%2Fpeople%2Finjury%2Fems%2Finterfacility%2Findex.htm&amp;token=aiHbEIl4FNC3PgBefKD4iGQc9IvB%2BxKUGmadOxUsdLnogvrw%2B8p9vJ6kH%2FfJjEdscrc47f4mRpOOV2E6osYoT58MYNNRSDKYkazLmz5omNg%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=17178" target="_blank">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.
