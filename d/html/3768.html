         Patients who are potentially exposed to HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) through a nonoccupational exposure or injury are at risk for acquiring infection. Patients can be exposed through sexual contact or through exposure to infected blood (or blood-contaminated body fluids). Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV and HBV may reduce the risk of transmission if administered soon after the exposure.

         The management of adults with a potential nonoccupational exposure to HIV, HBV, and HCV are reviewed here. Detailed discussions of the risk of transmission after exposure to these pathogens, the management of occupational exposures, and the prevention of mother-to-child transmission are found elsewhere:

         HIV infection is acquired through sexual contact, exposure to infected blood (including blood-contaminated body fluids), or perinatal transmission. The distribution of the modes of transmission of HIV infection varies in different countries. In the United States, male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use (IDU) account for more than half of cases [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, in certain resource-limited areas (eg, Sub-Saharan Africa), penile-vaginal intercourse is responsible for 70 to 80 percent of HIV infections [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of HIV infection also varies by the type of sexual or parenteral exposure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60145" href="/z/d/graphic/60145.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Risk factors for HIV transmission include a high HIV viral load in the source, the presence or absence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), lack of circumcision, and certain host and genetic factors [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6

         Patients should be evaluated after a possible exposure to HIV to determine if nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) with antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be offered to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Although the data supporting nPEP are limited, feasibility and safety data have led to widespread acceptance of this practice, which has been advanced by expert guideline committees [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-10
         </a>

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision to initiate nPEP depends upon several factors. These include:

         The risk of HIV acquisition. As an example, a person who engages in condomless receptive anal sex has a much greater estimated risk of HIV acquisition than a person who has oral sex  (

         For patients who present within 72 hours of a possible HIV exposure, it is important to assess if the exposure presents a substantial risk of HIV acquisition  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108662" href="/z/d/graphic/108662.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         ). We consider
         <strong>
          any
         </strong>
         of the following to be a high-risk exposure:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●

          ●

         A percutaneous exposure to blood (or body fluids contaminated with blood)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who have had a high-risk exposure, we recommend initiating nPEP if the source has HIV. We also suggest nPEP when the HIV status of the source is unknown if the source is at high risk for having HIV (eg, man who has sex with men, person who uses injection drugs, sex worker), or if the patient was sexually assaulted. A more detailed discussion of the management of sexual assault victims is found elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2765.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims in the emergency department", section on 'Management'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients may desire nPEP if they had condomless sex with a source whose risk factors are unknown. For such patients, the decision to initiate nPEP depends upon the patient's exposure risk, such as the route of exposure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60145" href="/z/d/graphic/60145.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), and other cofactors that heighten risk of transmission (eg, presence of genital ulcer disease). If the indications for nPEP are unclear, clinicians can call the National Clinician's Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline at 888-448-4911 for expert advice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain patients repeatedly present with exposures that could qualify for nPEP (eg, discordant sex partners who rarely use condoms or injection drug users who often share injection equipment). For such patients, we try to avoid repeated courses of nPEP, and we discuss the possibility of transitioning from a post-exposure regimen to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of subsequent HIV infection [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,11
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113426.html" rel="external">
          "HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis", section on 'Persons receiving post-exposure prophylaxis'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who are taking PrEP typically do not require additional post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV, unless they report taking their medication sporadically or have not taken their PrEP regimen within the week before the exposure [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Another time that nPEP should be considered in patients taking PrEP is if the source is known to have confirmed drug-resistant virus [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,11
         </a>
         ]. Specific nPEP regimens are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Special considerations'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         For most patients, the duration of nPEP is 28 days. However, if the source is available and agrees to testing, post-exposure prophylaxis may be able to be discontinued if the HIV RNA is suppressed or if HIV testing returns negative. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Duration of post-exposure prophylaxis'
         </a>

         </span>
         Nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) should be given within 72 hours of an exposure. Once the need for nPEP has been identified, the patient should receive an immediate dose. The first dose should not be delayed pending HIV testing of either the exposed patient or the source. (See
         <a class="local">
          'HIV and other testing'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Animal data suggest that there is a small window of opportunity to interrupt HIV transmission. A meta-analysis that included data from 25 nonhuman primate studies found a significant association between timing of post-exposure prophylaxis and reduced seroconversion after exposure to a closely related virus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. In an early study of 24 macaques who received post-exposure prophylaxis with an experimental nucleoside analog, there was no evidence of viral replication if treatment was started within 24 hours of exposure; however, the efficacy of post-exposure prophylaxis decreased when the time between exposure and treatment was extended [
         <a href="#rid13">

         We administer a three-drug regimen for nPEP given the efficacy of this combination in patients with chronic HIV infection, the improved tolerability of available treatment regimens, and the demonstrated safety of these agents. This approach is consistent with several guideline panels, including the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Public Health Service, the International Antiviral Society-USA Panel, and the World Health Organization [

          Using tenofovir-emtricitabine as the NRTI combination
         </strong>
         – There has been extensive use of coformulated TDF/FTC as the NRTI combination because it is well tolerated and requires once-daily dosing. In addition, there is excellent accumulation of these agents in the genital tract [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

Patients are more likely to develop Fanconi syndrome if they have reduced kidney function and/or a PI is used as the third agent. However, these adverse effects usually occur with long-term administration of TDF, and not the short duration used for nPEP.

         Rapid HIV testing should be performed on all persons seeking evaluation after a potential nonoccupational HIV exposure. The preferred three-drug regimens for nPEP are adequate for both treatment and prevention of HIV, so early initiation of a three-drug regimen pending lab results is appropriate. (See

         If the source is known and is willing, they should be tested for HIV. In most scenarios, a negative rapid HIV test negates the need for continued nPEP. However, if there is concern that the source is acutely infected with HIV, additional RNA testing should be performed since HIV screening tests (eg, antibody/antigen or antibody only) may not detect acute HIV infection.

         If the source is known to have HIV, he or she should be interviewed if possible to determine their HIV treatment history, and the results of their most recent viral load and resistance tests. In addition, we repeat an HIV viral load and genotype at time of exposure. This information will provide guidance regarding the need for continued nPEP and/or which regimen should be administered.

Thus, HBsAg-positive patients should be evaluated to see if antiviral therapy for HBV should be continued after they have completed the 28-day course for nPEP. If treatment is discontinued, such patients should be monitored closely. (See

         <strong>
          Barriers to post-exposure prophylaxis
         </strong>
         – Many individuals are not aware of nPEP [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47,50-53
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a study conducted from 1999 to 2003, which followed 4295 men who have sex with men (MSM) from six cities in the United States, 48 percent of participants reported awareness of nPEP, 2 percent utilized nPEP prior to enrollment, and 6 percent utilized nPEP at least once during the study [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, in a separate study of 554 MSM surveyed at two New York City bathhouses from 2006 to 2007, only 36 percent of men were aware of nPEP or pre-exposure prophylaxis [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. Less than half of the men reported disclosing MSM behavior to their primary care provider, and this lack of disclosure likely served as a barrier to nPEP use. However, awareness and use of nPEP may be increasing [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52,56,57
         </a>
         ]. In a survey of MSM in Australia, awareness of nPEP increased from 23 percent in 2001 to 64 percent in 2010 [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. Nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis use also increased from 2.3 percent to 3.9 percent over that time period.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Provider-level factors can also be a barrier to nPEP. As an example, patients with high-risk exposures seen in an emergency departments are not always offered nPEP and many persons continue to decline nPEP when offered [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. In a prospective study of 386 adolescent sexual assault victims in Canada, only 43 percent accepted and one-third completed the 28-day course of nPEP [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. One of the major factors associated with nPEP acceptance was the strength of the recommendation by the examining health care provider. In another study of providers in Miami and the District of Columbia, the availability of a written nPEP protocol and patient requests for nPEP were associated with nPEP administration [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Another potential barrier is the lack of access to antiretroviral medications. A 2007 survey in Los Angeles revealed that only 15 percent of health care venues were able to offer nPEP services, and only 9 percent of these venues were able to provide nPEP to noninsured persons [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ]. Although most insurance carriers will pay for nPEP medications, delays with prior authorizations and mail order pharmacies may further complicate the timeliness of medication initiation.

         alone reduced transmission by 70 to 80 percent. Although there are major differences between nonoccupational and occupational exposures (eg, type of exposure, delay in initiating treatment), post-exposure prophylaxis continues to be recommended by many experts after a high-risk exposure [

Of note, 8 of the 11 nPEP users who were infected with HIV seroconverted more than three months following nPEP use, suggesting that their infections were not related to nPEP failure, but continued high-risk exposure. The use of an nPEP regimen not widely prescribed in the US is an additional limitation of this study.

         However, during the initial evaluation of the exposed patient, we obtain laboratory testing for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to guide future treatment decisions. If the exposed patient requires

         Post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered to patients without previously documented HBV immunity who are exposed to blood or body fluids from a source who is HBsAg-positive or whose HBV status is unknown (ie, HBV-unknown).

         Most patients who require post-exposure prophylaxis should receive the hepatitis B vaccine if they were exposed to a source who is HBsAg-positive or HBV-unknown. However, there is no role for additional doses of the hepatitis B vaccine if the exposed patient previously failed to respond to two complete courses of the hepatitis B vaccine series. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients who are vaccine nonresponders'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         HBIG should be administered (in addition to the hepatitis B vaccine), to patients who are without evidence of immunity if the source is HBsAg-positive. We also administer HBIG to exposed patients without evidence of immunity if the source is HBV-unknown  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106531" href="/z/d/graphic/106531.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ), although, the decision to use of HBIG when the source is HBV-unknown is less clear since there are no data to guide treatment decisions and guideline recommendations vary [
         <a href="#rid75">

         Our approach is consistent with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for occupational HBV post-exposure prophylaxis [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75,78
         </a>
         ]. Other guidelines do not routinely use this approach for nonoccupational exposures and typically recommend HBIG for HBV post-exposure prophylaxis only if the source is known to be HBsAg-positive [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78
         </a>
         ], or if the source is at high risk for being HBsAg-positive (eg, injection drug users, sexually active men who have sex with men) [

          77

         When post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated, it should be administered within 24 hours of an exposure, if possible. If prophylaxis is not available at the initial visit, the exposed patient should receive the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible. HBIG, if indicated, may be more difficult to obtain, and should be administered within seven days of a percutaneous exposure or 14 days of a sexual exposure.

         Patients without a history of HBV who have not received or completed their hepatitis B vaccine series require post-exposure prophylaxis after a potential exposure to a source who is HBsAg-positive or HBV-unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
         Such patients should receive the hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG. The vaccine and HBIG can be given simultaneously but should be administered at different sites  (

        </p>
        <p>
         The patient should then complete the hepatitis B vaccine series, even if the source is found to be HBsAg negative; the dosing schedule depends upon the type of vaccine  (

         Many patients will have completed the initial hepatitis B vaccine series but do not know if they have had an adequate response (ie, a post-vaccination anti-HBs ≥10 milli-international units/mL). If the exposed patient is uncertain that they completed the hepatitis B vaccine series, they should be treated as if they are unvaccinated. (See

         On rare occasions, testing of the source may reveal that an individual has isolated anti-HBc (HBsAg negative, anti-HBs negative, but anti-HBc positive). Isolated detection of anti-HBc can occur in several settings: during the window period of acute hepatitis B (when the anti-HBc is predominantly IgM class); many years after recovery from acute hepatitis B when anti-HBs has fallen to undetectable levels; and after many years of chronic HBV infection when the HBsAg titer has decreased below the cutoff level for detection. A false-positive anti-HBc can also be seen. (See

         If the source is found to have isolated anti-HBc, additional testing for HBV DNA should be performed to evaluate for occult HBV infection. This testing does not impact the need for hepatitis B immunization in nonimmune patients. However, if HBV DNA is detected (or if HBV DNA cannot be obtained within seven days of a percutaneous exposure or 14 days of a sexual exposure), the exposed patient should be managed the same way as if the source is HBsAg positive.

         Most patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States and Europe acquire the disease through parenteral exposure (eg, intravenous drug use). Although the risk of sexual transmission appears to be low, among men who have sex with men (MSM), certain sexual practices may carry a higher risk of transmission [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79,80
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a study of 5310 MSM followed for a median of seven years, unprotected receptive anal sex with more than one partner was independently associated with incident HCV infection among both participants with and without HIV, whereas unprotected insertive anal sex with multiple partners was not [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no medications or immunizations to reduce the risk of acquiring HCV after a possible exposure. Thus, post-exposure management depends upon close monitoring and referral for treatment if infection does occur. We perform HCV testing in patients who have had a percutaneous exposure or a high-risk sexual exposure (eg, condomless receptive anal intercourse, sexual assault).
        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient has no history of HCV infection, we obtain a baseline HCV antibody. We also obtain an HCV viral load if the patient has signs and symptoms of acute HCV infection (eg, elevated aminotransaminase levels), or has a partner who is known to have HCV infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the exposed patient tests negative for HCV at baseline, the approach to follow-up depends upon the HCV status of the source:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If the source tests negative for HCV RNA, no further testing needs to be performed.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If the HCV status of the source is positive or unknown, the exposed patient should be tested for HCV RNA at least three weeks after the exposure. If positive, the patient should be referred to care; if negative, no further testing is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         If the exposed patient was treated for HCV in the past, they are still at risk for reinfection, even if the HCV antibody is positive. For such patients, we obtain HCV RNA at baseline and at follow-up testing (if needed), rather than an antibody.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is one approach to testing and is based upon guidelines from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [

         Patients who are potentially exposed to HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) through a nonoccupational exposure (eg, sexual or percutaneous) are at risk for acquiring one of these infections. (See

         To reduce the risk of HIV transmission, patients who present within 72 hours of a possible exposure (eg, condomless receptive or insertive vaginal or anal intercourse and/or a percutaneous exposure to blood, or body fluids contaminated with blood) should be evaluated for nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) with antiretroviral therapy (ART) (see
         <a class="local">
          'General principles of HIV post-exposure management'

         If the source has HIV, we recommend initiating post-exposure prophylaxis (

         If the source's HIV status is unknown at the time of the exposure, we suggest post-exposure prophylaxis if the source is at high risk for having HIV (eg, man who has sex with men [MSM], injection drug user, sex worker), or if the patient has been sexually assaulted (

         Some patients may also desire nPEP for HIV if they had condomless sex with a source whose risk factors are unknown. For such patients, the decision to initiate nPEP depends upon the route of exposure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60145" href="/z/d/graphic/60145.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ), and other cofactors that heighten risk of transmission (eg, presence of genital ulcer disease). If the indications for nPEP are unclear, clinicians can also call the National Clinician's Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline at 888-448-4911 for expert advice.

         Once the need for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis has been determined, the patient should be given a dose as soon as possible, and within 72 hours of the exposure. Prophylaxis should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be delayed pending HIV testing of the exposed patient or the source. (See

         Patients receiving nPEP for HIV should receive a 28-day course of ART. After nPEP is discontinued, patients should have repeat HIV testing approximately 6 and 12 weeks after the exposure to assess for seroconversion  (

          table 2

         Patients with a potential nonoccupational exposure to HIV should also be evaluated for HBV and HCV. If their status is unknown, we test the exposed patient for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and hepatitis C antibody. If the source is willing, they should be evaluated for these infections as well. Patients with a sexual exposure should also be offered and/or treated for other sexually transmitted infections, depending upon the type of exposure  (

         Patients with a potential sexual or percutaneous exposure to HIV should also be evaluated for HBV post-exposure prophylaxis. If the source is HBsAg-positive or the HBV status is unknown, the need for immediate post-exposure prophylaxis depends primarily upon the exposed patient's HBV immune status and their vaccination history. (See

         There are no medications or immunizations to reduce the risk of acquiring HCV after a possible exposure. Thus, post-exposure management depends upon close monitoring and referral for treatment if infection does occur. We perform HCV testing in patients who have had a percutaneous exposure or a high-risk sexual exposure (eg, condomless receptive anal intercourse, sexual assault) unless the source tests negative for HCV RNA.
