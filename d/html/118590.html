This pain, also termed centralized pain or nociplastic pain, results from a process termed central sensitization and is present in approximately 10 to 40 percent of patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), psoriatic arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Central sensitization is also prominent in many musculoskeletal pain disorders traditionally thought of as localized and focal musculoskeletal pain disorders, including chronic trauma-induced low back pain (LBP) and neck pain, such as following a motor vehicle accident (MVA); complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS); joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS); carpal tunnel syndrome; and lateral epicondylitis.</p><p>Recognition of central sensitization is important in clinical care; its symptoms can influence the assessment and adversely impact the outcome of patients with the associated rheumatologic and musculoskeletal disorders. Centralized pain is the primary mechanism underlying fibromyalgia and related chronic pain disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, and temporomandibular disorder. The management of chronic pain in patients with rheumatic disease requires a better understanding of centralized pain in chronic systemic and regional rheumatic and musculoskeletal pain disorders [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>].</p><p>An overview of the mechanisms, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and approach to treatment of central sensitization in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases is presented here. More detailed discussions of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of the fibromyalgia syndrome in adults and children are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5626.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5624.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5625.html" rel="external">"Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5627.html" rel="external">"Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6426.html" rel="external">"Fibromyalgia in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6424.html" rel="external">"Fibromyalgia in children and adolescents: Treatment and prognosis overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2761399727"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS AND PAIN MECHANISMS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1152103963"><span class="h2">Definitions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Centralized pain, also referred to as central sensitization or central pain, can be defined as "an amplification of neural signaling within the central nervous system (CNS) that elicits pain hypersensitivity" [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In other words, the brain and the spinal cord "turn up the volume" in response to any potentially unpleasant stimulus. Central sensitization is characterized by hyperalgesia, an increased response to a painful stimulus, and allodynia, pain following a stimulus that is typically not irritating. Centralized pain begins and is perpetuated solely by CNS alterations, without a peripheral trigger or ongoing painful stimulus outside the CNS.</p><p>Conceptions of chronic and centralized pain have evolved, and some inconsistencies in how terms are used remain. Historically, chronic pain was categorized based upon the inciting peripheral pain mechanisms  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119785" href="/d/graphic/119785.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Chronic pain categories included inflammatory (ie, pain resulting from inflammatory pathology), focal structural (ie, pain resulting from focal anatomic pathology), and neuropathic (ie, pain resulting from nerve damage). As examples, the pain related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was seen as primarily inflammatory; that of osteoarthritis (OA) as primarily related to anatomic, structural pathology in the joint; and neuropathic as in that from diabetic neuropathy. Initially, the term central pain referred to pain localized to the CNS, such as that following a brain or spinal cord lesion [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Subsequently, centralized (or central) pain was used to refer to any pain condition that could not be explained by a peripheral source. Examples of central pain disorders include fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and temporomandibular disorder [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5626.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia"</a>). The pathophysiology of these central pain conditions does not follow traditional nociceptive pathways and was historically often considered psychogenic in origin or labeled as psychosomatic. According to this view, centralized pain was characterized as dysfunctional, in contrast to inflammatory, neurogenic, or structural pain, which were considered adaptive and potentially protective [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>It is now recognized that each of these pain categories overlap, most notably neuropathic and centralized pain, depending upon their definition. For example, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) restricts the term neuropathic pain to conditions with evidence of nerve damage, such as diabetic neuropathy [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. By contrast, using the broader definition of central pain as that arising from the brain and/or spinal cord, centralized pain can be a component of any peripheral pain disorder [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Accordingly, central pain complicates the evaluation and treatment of every chronic pain condition. As an example, the painDETECT instrument, which was designed to measure neuropathic pain, cannot differentiate pain due to nerve damage from centralized pain [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1159506389"><span class="h2">Pain mechanisms in rheumatic disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most chronic painful disorders, the pain results from a combination of several interacting mechanisms, including inflammatory, structural, and centralized causes. Each pain category, particularly centralized pain, overlaps and intersects with the others to some degree  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119785" href="/d/graphic/119785.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) (see <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above). As an example, patients with RA may have an inflammatory synovitis causing structural knee damage and pain related to both processes, but the pain response is modified centrally, in the brain and spinal cord. As discussed below, chronic pain conditions often considered to have a peripheral structural etiology, such as chronic low back pain (LBP) or complex regional pain, are predominately central in nature [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>].</p><p>Chronic widespread pain (CWP), without any known peripheral musculoskeletal pathology, is present in 5 to 15 percent of the population, and many of these individuals meet the classification criteria for fibromyalgia [<a href="#rid4">4,5,11</a>]. However, there is no formal definition of CWP, and it has been informally defined by applying the fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria of pain in the left side of the body, pain in the right side of the body, pain above the waist, pain below the waist, and axial skeletal pain [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. A number of fibromyalgia diagnostic classification criteria have been proposed, all of which require the presence of widespread or multisite pain for at least three months, but also include symptoms such as fatigue and sleep disturbances [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. These fibromyalgia criteria overlap with the informal criteria for CWP, and therefore, CWP and fibromyalgia are often used interchangeably.</p><p>There are genetic factors that predispose individuals to CWP/fibromyalgia. Candidate genes have included serotonin 5-HT2A receptor polymorphism T/T phenotype, serotonin transporter, dopamine 4 receptor, and catecholamine o-methyltransferase (<em>COMT</em>) polymorphisms, although no single strong genetic polymorphism has emerged [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Physical factors, including trauma, repetitive strain, infections, and obesity, and psychological factors, such as chronic stress, anxiety, and depression, are often considered to be inciting or perpetuating factors in fibromyalgia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5626.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H800663558"><span class="h2">Neurophysiologic and neuroimaging changes in chronic widespread pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Characteristic anatomic and functional markers of centralized pain can be detected with neuroimaging, as can limited electrodiagnostic abnormalities. These observations have provided insights into the neurophysiologic changes in patients with CWP but remain research tools without direct applicability yet in clinical practice. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5626.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia"</a>.)</p><p>Allodynia and hyperalgesia were initially documented by a heightened pain response to mechanical pressure over a joint or muscle [<a href="#rid15">15</a>] (see <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above). Centralized pain was also noted following exposure to other noxious stimuli, such as temperature or sound [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Fibromyalgia has been the prototype for centralized pain. In studies comparing patients with fibromyalgia with normal controls, the patients with fibromyalgia had lower mechanical and thermal pain thresholds and increased temporal summation of second pain, termed "windup" [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Maintenance of windup of secondary pain in fibromyalgia requires lower noxious stimulation than in controls, and this correlates with perceived pain intensity. This has often been demonstrated by quantitative sensory testing (QST), using heat and pressure-pain thresholds or tonic suprathreshold pain via the cold-pressor test [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and functional neuroimaging (fMRI) provide insight into the intricate mechanisms of central pain, demonstrating characteristic structural and functional brain MRI abnormalities in patients with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain disorders [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. The abnormal findings on imaging tests have included decreased cortical thickness, diminished brain volumes, and increased levels of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5626.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia"</a>.)</p><p>The use of fMRI has allowed measurement of resting brain regional connectivity. Abnormal connectivity between two distinct brain regions, the default mode network (DMN) and the insula, was present in patients with fibromyalgia, and these alterations correlated with pain intensity [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Integrating fMRI with machine-based learning has revealed a particular pattern of pain response, a potential neural signature of pain [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. This technique was used to demonstrate a fibromyalgia pain neural signature upon comparison of 37 fibromyalgia patients with 35 matched controls [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Analysis of the pattern of responses revealed a consistent imaging response to painful and nonpainful stimuli that distinguished fibromyalgia subjects from controls with 92 percent sensitivity and 94 percent specificity [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Although such studies need to be replicated and these techniques are too costly for routine clinical practice, they provide a framework for potential diagnostic utility.</p><p>An objective measure of regional brain changes associated with mood and personality traits, such as catastrophizing, has been provided by fMRI. As an example, the response to catastrophizing statements in 31 patients with fibromyalgia correlated with enhanced neural activity in the posterior cingulate cortex [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Another study, using functional and structural MRI together with questionnaire responses regarding pain severity, function, and body-mapping of pain, has shown that patients with chronic widespread urologic pelvic pain syndrome (including patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome) had a similar pain neural signature to that of fibromyalgia patients [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Other modalities used to measure a heightened pain response have included resting state electroencephalography [<a href="#rid22">22</a>], magnetoencephalography [<a href="#rid23">23</a>], and positron emission tomography (PET) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1833643307"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H108247158"><span class="h2">Overview of clinical impact</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical, neurophysiologic, and imaging findings of chronic widespread pain (CWP)/fibromyalgia with centralized pain are common in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), inflammatory joint disorders, chronic back and neck pain, and other conditions. The presence of concomitant CWP/fibromyalgia, seen in at least one-quarter of patients with many of these rheumatologic and musculoskeletal disorders, adversely impacts the patient's level of pain and other symptoms and findings, potentially affecting composite disease activity measures and consequently impacting treatment decisions and outcomes of therapy. Perceived pain levels can differ widely among patients with the same underlying conditions. (See <a class="local">'Osteoarthritis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Inflammatory arthritis and systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases'</a> below and <a class="local">'Chronic low back and neck pain'</a> below and <a class="local">'Regional musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain conditions and other disorders'</a> below.).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1480657923"><span class="h2">Osteoarthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CWP is seen in many patients with OA, where it is associated with increased severity of joint and soft tissue pain, including pain in multiple sites distant to the affected joint, reduced benefits from medications for pain, and worse pain outcomes following joint replacement surgery [<a href="#rid25">25-35</a>]. Pain severity generally correlates better with the degree of CWP and evidence of central sensitization than with the extent of radiographic OA. For example, in 39 patients with hip OA, there was no significant correlation of radiologic severity with pain, but there was a significant correlation with evidence of central sensitization, as measured by quantitative sensory testing (QST) ratings [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p>Prospective studies in patients with knee OA have found a 10 to 15 percent prevalence of CWP [<a href="#rid25">25-27</a>]. The prevalence of CWP/fibromyalgia in a general OA population is unknown. However, the incidence of developing new CWP in a cohort of patients with or at high risk of knee OA was noted in a group of studies [<a href="#rid25">25-27</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>OA patients with chronic knee pain followed for more than five years in two community-based cohorts, the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study and the Osteoarthritis Initiative, were at an increased risk for subsequent pain in multiple other joints and soft tissue locations compared with patients initially lacking knee pain (80 and 64 percent with bilateral and unilateral knee pain, respectively, versus 50 percent) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. There was no specific pattern to the pain, and the findings did not vary when subjects with CWP at baseline were excluded, consistent with central sensitization as the likeliest explanation for the findings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In knee OA patients, there was an association of underlying joint inflammation (based upon the presence of synovitis or effusions) with pain sensitization, as shown by decreased pressure pain thresholds (PPT), while bone marrow lesions were not associated with pain sensitization [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PPT reduction and temporal summation were not associated with radiographic OA but correlated with pain severity, suggesting that pain sensitization in OA may often be a "trait" or patient characteristic of those individuals predisposed to central sensitivity, rather than a "state" determined by OA joint pathology [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p>A range of studies has documented a major role for CWP and central sensitization in OA-related pain and as a marker for diminished pain reduction with medication and more adverse pain outcomes after joint replacement surgery. The following studies are representative:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The discordance between knee pain and OA radiographic severity was related to the degree of central sensitivity in a study of 113 knee OA patients using QST [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. There was heightened pain sensitivity in the high pain/low radiographic knee OA group, compared with low pain sensitivity in the low pain/high radiographic group.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preoperative CWP was associated with poorer patient outcomes after joint replacement in OA patients undergoing knee or hip replacements, as shown by the association of the presence and severity of CWP/fibromyalgia with greater postoperative analgesic use and poorer pain outcomes [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. For each one-point increase in the preoperative fibromyalgia severity scale, there were greater than 7 mg more <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">morphine</a> equivalents needed postoperatively, and the odds of failing to meet the threshold for improved outcome increased by 18 percent [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other studies also demonstrate an association of CWP with greater pain. In one study, one-third of knee OA patients had evidence of central sensitization based on QST measures of temporal summation and windup [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Additionally, the relationship between QST and fibromyalgia was evaluated in 128 OA patients scheduled to have knee replacements [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. In females, but not in males, increased pressure pain sensitivity at multiple sites correlated with the presence of fibromyalgia and its symptom severity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The presence of CWP can be associated with reduced responses to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In a study in which knee OA patients demonstrated reduced pain thresholds at multiple anatomic sites and increased windup, the patients with the greater evidence of centralized pain had the best response to NSAIDs, suggesting a central as well as a peripheral mechanism of action of NSAIDs [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of abnormal brain morphology associated with chronic pain, 16 patients with unilateral right-sided hip pain had neuroimaging before and nine months after hip arthroplasty [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. There were significant differences in brain gray matter volume, especially in the thalamus, in those hip OA patients compared with healthy controls. Nine months after surgery, the areas of reduced thalamic gray matter volume were found to have "reversed" to levels in the controls. Another report also noted regional structural brain changes in patients with advanced knee OA that improved after knee replacement [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. However, structural changes did not correlate with QST evidence of pain disinhibition.</p><p></p><p>Socioeconomic status, mood, sleep disturbances, use of opiates, and catastrophizing are also important factors in pain severity, disability, and outcome in OA [<a href="#rid37">37-39</a>].</p><p>There was a correlation of central sensitization with potential serologic biomarkers in OA patients [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. An elevated matrix metalloproteinase-mediated breakdown of C-reactive protein (CRP) was associated with temporal summation. In subjects with knee OA, women exhibited greater sensitivity to a variety of painful stimuli in comparison to men [<a href="#rid40">40,41</a>].</p><p>Nonetheless, despite the impact of central sensitization, there is evidence that structural joint damage does play an important role in pain severity. As an example, in a study of more than 1000 OA patients in a within-person, case-control study of patients discordant for pain between their knees, severity of radiographic knee OA correlated strongly with knee pain severity [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H669453262"><span class="h2">Inflammatory arthritis and systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H812679777"><span class="h3">Rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CWP/fibromyalgia is present in a moderate proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly those with seronegative RA. A number of features are evident in this group [<a href="#rid43">43-56</a>]. RA patients with comorbid fibromyalgia symptoms have greater pain despite less inflammatory synovitis. The patients with both fibromyalgia and RA have higher scores on standard measures of RA disease activity and greater medication use than patients with RA alone. The presence of CWP/fibromyalgia is associated with greater discordance between patient and physician global assessments.</p><p>The reported prevalence of fibromyalgia in RA has been estimated from 13 to 40 percent [<a href="#rid43">43-45</a>]. In one study, the incidence of fibromyalgia in early RA subjects was 3.6 to 6.8 cases per 100 person-years, was highest during the first year after the diagnosis, and correlated with pain severity and poor mental health [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Additionally, seropositivity inversely correlated with concurrent fibromyalgia. Similarly, an electronic health record (EHR)-based phenome-wide association study, using EHR-derived clinical phenotypic data, also demonstrated a strong association of fibromyalgia with RA seronegativity [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p>A number of studies have identified similar characteristics among patients with RA and concurrent fibromyalgia. They have higher levels of pain, fatigue, sleep and mood disturbances, neuropathic symptoms, and worse physical and mental health, compared with patients without fibromyalgia, yet they exhibit lower levels of systemic and joint inflammation, as indicated by CRP levels or based upon joint ultrasound  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119787" href="/d/graphic/119787.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. In patients with RA, neuropathic symptoms, based upon elevated painDETECT scores, are strongly associated with concurrent fibromyalgia [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Although the painDETECT instrument was designed to measure neuropathic pain, it does not differentiate central from peripheral pain (see <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above); thus, the elevated painDETECT scores likely measure central pain [<a href="#rid7">7,49</a>].</p><p>Patients with RA and fibromyalgia have higher disease activity scores, worse outcomes, and take more medications than those without fibromyalgia [<a href="#rid44">44,45,50</a>]. In one study, 20 percent of RA patients had concurrent fibromyalgia and, compared with those without fibromyalgia, had worse scores on sleep, tender joint count, and neuropathic pain, as well as RA disease activity [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. None achieved a clinical remission by Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) remission criteria. Additionally, concurrent fibromyalgia accounts for much of the patient-clinician discordance in global assessment ratings in RA patients [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Patients with RA and concurrent fibromyalgia more often used <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> and analgesics and less often used <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. They were also more likely to be identified as receiving inappropriate therapy.</p><p>Generalized allodynia, including to light touch and cool temperatures, is present in patients with RA [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. In RA patients, CRP levels were inversely associated with pain thresholds at joints but not at nonjoint sites [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. Sleep disturbances were associated with pain thresholds at both joint and nonjoint sites, suggesting that central sensitization may link pain sensitivity and abnormal sleep. A 2011 systematic literature review found significant evidence for central sensitization in RA, including increased windup and generalized hyperalgesia at joints and nonarticular sites [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. In 263 RA patients, the contribution of centralized pain to overall pain ratings was determined by QST, measuring PPTs, temporal summation, and conditioned pain modulation [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. RA patients with evidence of low PPTs and high temporal summation had greater pain ratings.</p><p>Neuroimaging in RA demonstrated structural changes including increase in gray matter content in the basal ganglia and smaller intracranial volume [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. This suggests that anatomic changes in certain brain regions, such as increase or decrease in structure, may reflect altered pain response. There was no evidence for cortical gray matter atrophy. Fifty-four patients with RA underwent functional neuroimaging (functional MRI [fMRI]) and were also evaluated for fibromyalgia symptoms [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. There was a positive correlation of regional brain connectivity from the default mode network (DMN) to the left mid/posterior insula with the severity of fibromyalgia, similar to that noted in patients with fibromyalgia.</p><p>The interaction of peripheral inflammation with central sensitization was investigated in comparing RA patients with concomitant fibromyalgia with those without fibromyalgia [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. In those RA patients with fibromyalgia, increased functional connectivity of various brain regions correlated with a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), suggesting a "bottom-up" role of pain centralization. This implied that central pain in RA, including in those patients who don't meet the criteria for fibromyalgia, is bidirectional and may respond to traditional RA therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1433465972"><span class="h3">Spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Concurrent CWP/fibromyalgia is present in 10 to 30 percent of patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) and associated with greater symptoms, higher disease activity measures, and in some studies, more use of biologic therapies, but without higher levels of inflammatory markers or extraspinal disease [<a href="#rid60">60-66</a>].

Patients who met fibromyalgia criteria had worse disease activity scores, global severity, and quality of life, as well as more mood disturbances and fatigue. Concurrent fibromyalgia did not correlate with an elevated CRP or evidence of extraspinal disease but did correlate with a greater likelihood of receiving biologic therapy. There was also a much greater adverse impact on work in those with concurrent fibromyalgia.</p><p>Because ankylosing spondylitis (AS; radiographic axial SpA) may not be associated with clinically apparent synovitis, there has been concern that it may be misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia. However, in 200 patients with axial SpA and 100 with fibromyalgia, this misdiagnosis was unusual [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. Fibromyalgia patients rarely met the classification criteria for AS, although 13 to 20 percent of the AS in this study met the criteria for fibromyalgia.</p><p>Another group found no difference in the proportion of patients with AS and concurrent fibromyalgia who received anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy compared with those without fibromyalgia, but twice as many with concurrent fibromyalgia, present in 21 percent of the patients, had stopped treatment after two years [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. In 500 patients with axial SpA, 38 percent met the criteria for fibromyalgia [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. Those with concurrent fibromyalgia had a poorer response to TNF inhibitors, which were related to lower scores on self-reported disease activity instruments rather than to a suboptimal physiologic response. The bidirectional effect of inflammation on central pain described above in RA has also been noted in AS. In a study of 801 patients with AS, the presence of fibromyalgia correlated with both disease activity and widespread pain symptoms [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. Starting a TNF inhibitor and improving disease activity decreased the presence of concurrent fibromyalgia.</p><p>As in patients with RA, neuropathic symptoms as determined by elevated painDETECT scores are found in most patients with AS, and they correlated with structural neuroimaging changes, including decreased gray matter in the primary somatosensory cortex [<a href="#rid65">65</a>].

However, in patients meeting criteria for an axial SpA, a fibromyalgia misdiagnosis was uncommon [<a href="#rid62">62</a>].

These include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timely recognition of the centralized pain syndrome</strong> – Understanding that central sensitization underlies the historically categorized functional somatic syndromes provides the framework for an integrated diagnostic and therapeutic biopsychological illness model. It then follows that seemingly distinct conditions like fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic headaches, temporomandibular joint pain, and chronic pelvic/bladder pain syndromes share characteristics of chronic pain, fatigue, and cognitive, mood, and sleep disturbances. Rather than attempting to tease out individual features of these common illnesses, a diagnosis is based on symptoms common to all  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119790" href="/d/graphic/119790.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). This common symptom-based approach will foster an earlier affirmative diagnosis, rather than a diagnosis of exclusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Timely recognition of primary central pain conditions is cost-effective, as demonstrated in decreased health care costs and utilization once a diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made in the primary care setting [<a href="#rid114">114</a>]. The accuracy of a fibromyalgia diagnosis in general practice is poor, and there is inadequate knowledge regarding the fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria [<a href="#rid115">115,116</a>]. Patients seen at tertiary care fibromyalgia centers tend to have longer-standing symptoms and are less responsive to treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5624.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5627.html" rel="external">"Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults", section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recognition of symptomatic impact and prognostic implications of centralized pain</strong> – CWP/fibromyalgia is associated with reduced benefit from joint replacement surgery, adverse events (complex regional pain syndrome [CRPS] following wrist fracture), and other interventions; CWP may also result in overestimation of inflammatory disease activity and may lead to inappropriate disease management by assuming the disease is active or flaring based on symptom severity [<a href="#rid50">50-52,63,64,67</a>] (see <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> below). Preoperative centralized pain predicted poor outcome in knee osteoarthritis (OA) joint replacement [<a href="#rid117">117</a>]. Since central sensitization adversely affects the outcome of spine surgery, joint arthroplasty, and carpal tunnel release, it is prudent to evaluate patients for generalized pain hypersensitivity prior to these procedures. Signs of central sensitization should also alert the clinician that a patient may be at risk for adverse events. For example, after a distal radius fracture, the presence of fibromyalgia correlated strongly with the patient developing CRPS [<a href="#rid118">118</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Importance of acknowledgment and patient education regarding neurophysiologic underpinning of CWP/fibromyalgia</strong> – Understanding that central sensitization is not simply a psychogenic illness allows health care providers to avoid the mind-body dualism and provide a foundation to educate the patient and avoid the common patient fear that, "He thinks it is all in my head." These patients will benefit from a more individualized biopsychological treatment program. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5627.html" rel="external">"Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recognition that treatment of the rheumatic disease might reduce centralized pain</strong> – The interplay of centralized pain with inflammatory, immune, and structural input should be kept in mind in disease management  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119785" href="/d/graphic/119785.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), as some evidence suggests that treatments considered to be antiinflammatory, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>], or immune-mediated, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibition [<a href="#rid119">119</a>], also have a beneficial impact on central sensitization in systemic rheumatic diseases such as RA [<a href="#rid59">59</a>] and AS [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. Likewise, central pain is affected by structural disease, as noted with the improvement in quantitative sensory testing (QST) hyperalgesia and neuroimaging regional abnormalities following successful arthroplasty [<a href="#rid33">33,35</a>]. Immune and inflammatory factors are present in central sensitization [<a href="#rid31">31,40</a>].

However, it is not established whether treatment of the rheumatologic disorder affects the chronic widespread pain (CWP)/fibromyalgia or whether the prognosis for the CWP/fibromyalgia in these patients is different from that for fibromyalgia alone.

However, these disease activity measures are often self-report instruments that do not correlate with worse inflammatory parameters or structural disease progression. Therefore, central sensitization may affect disease management because of overestimation of disease activity or misattribution of the source of symptoms or a perceived disease flare due the degree of overall symptom severity.

In most chronic painful disorders, the pain results from a combination of several interacting mechanisms, including inflammatory, structural, and centralized causes. Characteristic anatomic and functional markers of centralized pain can be detected with specialized neuroimaging, as can limited electrodiagnostic abnormalities. (See <a class="local">'Definitions and pain mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Common underlying conditions</strong> – The clinical and neurophysiologic and imaging findings of chronic widespread pain (CWP)/fibromyalgia with centralized pain are common in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), inflammatory joint disorders, chronic back and neck pain, and other conditions. The presence of concomitant CWP/fibromyalgia, seen in at least one-quarter of patients with many of these disorders, adversely impacts the patient's level of pain and other symptoms and findings, potentially affecting composite disease activity measures and consequently treatment decisions, and outcomes of therapy.

We do not routinely obtain other laboratory testing, such as an antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), muscle enzymes, or thyroid function tests unless indicated by specific clinical features suggesting an additional diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of centralized pain is based upon the chronicity and widespread nature of pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119790" href="/d/graphic/119790.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The pain should be present for at least three months consecutively and either widespread or multisite  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119789" href="/d/graphic/119789.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In addition, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and/or mood disturbances should be present.
