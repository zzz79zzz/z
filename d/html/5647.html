         Chronic pancreatitis can produce a variety of symptoms and complications that require therapy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Abdominal pain is the most common clinical feature, the most common reason for intervention, and has the most negative impact on quality of life. As chronic pancreatitis progresses, patients may develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (steatorrhea, maldigestion) as well as diabetes due to destruction of pancreatic islet cells. Patients with chronic pancreatitis can develop a variety of complications, including pancreatic pseudocyst, bile duct or duodenal obstruction, visceral artery pseudoaneurysm, pancreatic ascites and pancreatic pleural effusions, gastric varices due to thrombosis of the splenic vein, and pancreatic malignancy. The avoidance of environmental toxins such as tobacco and alcohol are the only measures that can prevent progression of chronic pancreatitis. All other therapies are directed at managing abdominal pain, maldigestion, pancreatogenic diabetes, or the other complications of chronic pancreatitis. This topic will review the treatment of abdominal pain, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and pancreatogenic diabetes. The clinical manifestations of chronic pancreatitis and management of complications of chronic pancreatitis are discussed in detail separately. (See

         We advise alcohol and smoking cessation in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Cessation of alcohol (if this is the etiology of the chronic pancreatitis) and tobacco delay progression of chronic pancreatitis, and, in the case of tobacco, reduce the likelihood of subsequent pancreatic carcinoma. Their impact on pain is variable; some patients will experience some degree of pain relief with abstinence.

         Patients with chronic pancreatitis are advised to consume low-fat meals, small meals, and avoid dehydration. While these recommendations are reasonable and often most tolerable to patients, they are not supported by any data. Many patients with chronic pancreatitis may also have some degree of gastroparesis, and smaller meals may minimize symptoms as well as consideration of prokinetic medications. Very low-fat diets are to be avoided due to increased risk for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, E, D, and K). Vitamin supplementation is often required, and vitamin D and calcium supplementation should be nearly universal. More specialized nutritional supplementation (eg, medium-chain triglyceride oil, elemental diets) are rarely, if ever, necessary.

         Pain is the most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis and is responsible for the most negative impact on quality of life [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. However, pain is not universal and some patients with chronic pancreatitis may present with exocrine insufficiency or diabetes rather than pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to initiating therapy in a patient with chronic pancreatitis who presents with abdominal pain, it is necessary to confirm that the symptoms are in fact due to chronic pancreatitis and not an alternative etiology. This is particularly challenging in the early stages of chronic pancreatitis when abdominal pain may be significant, but characteristic and diagnostic imaging features may be absent. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5649.html" rel="external">
          "Chronic pancreatitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in adults"
         </a>
         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5896.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Initial evaluation should include a detailed history to assess for the presence of abdominal pain associated with chronic pancreatitis at baseline, the character of pain (constant or intermittent, usual triggers for pain), severity, and impact on their quality of life. Patients with established chronic pancreatitis may develop worsening abdominal pain for many other reasons (peptic ulcer disease, superimposed pancreatic carcinoma, narcotic bowel, gastroparesis, pancreatic pseudocyst, duodenal or biliary obstruction). While there is no single pathognomonic characteristic of pain associated with chronic pancreatitis, it is most commonly epigastric, boring with radiation to the back, and is alleviated by leaning forward. Typically, the pain is worse within 5 to 10 minutes of eating as a result of stimulating the inflamed gland. Pain may initially be episodic and tends to become more continuous over time. During the initial phases, elevations in amylase and lipase are common with painful flares, but as the disease progresses, pancreatic enzymes are often not elevated during painful flares.
        </p>
        <p>
         To identify alternative causes of pain we perform high-quality computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging can also determine the anatomy and diameter of the pancreatic duct, which is useful when considering possible endoscopic or surgical therapy for pain. The appearance of the pancreatic duct, and of the pancreas itself, on imaging studies does not predict symptoms. Patients with a very dilated pancreatic duct and an obstructing stone in the head of the pancreas or with diffuse pancreatic calcifications may have no pain, while those with a non-dilated duct and few or no calcifications may have severe pain.

         The mechanisms of pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis are complex and involve both injury of the pancreas and alterations in visceral nociceptive signaling [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Unfortunately, and perhaps due to, these complex mechanisms, strategies for treatment of pain have limited efficacy.

         The majority of patients with painful chronic pancreatitis require analgesics [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Efforts should be made to minimize opioids, especially chronic narcotic use. We begin with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         and suggest the use of opioid agents only if non-narcotic agents fail. Patients should be seen frequently and counseled that pain control, rather than total absence of pain, is the realistic goal. In patients who require opioid analgesia, we initially use lower-potency opioid agents like
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10010" href="/z/d/drug information/10010.html" rel="external">
          tramadol
         </a>
         . Tramadol, a dual-action analgesic, with mu-opioid agonistic and monoaminergic properties, has been studied in painful chronic pancreatitis and has similar efficacy as stronger opioids. In any patient with pain requiring opioid therapy, we add adjunctive agents including tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and combined serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8484" href="/z/d/drug information/8484.html" rel="external">
          duloxetine

         </a>
         ). These should continue for several weeks or even a few months, prior to considering increasing the dose of potency of opioid therapy. Referral to a pain clinic is often of benefit. Our approach is consistent with The World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder, which was developed to guide treatment of cancer pain in adults, and suggests initial treatment of chronic pain with nonopioid medications [

         Antioxidant therapy can be utilized for initial management of abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis, although the benefit of pain reduction is likely small. Results from randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for treatment of pain associated with chronic pancreatitis have been conflicting [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. It is not clear what might explain these different results, but it may be due to differences in the population studied (particularly the nutritional status prior to antioxidant therapy or etiology of chronic pancreatitis). In a 2014 meta-analysis that included nine randomized trials, antioxidants appeared to reduce pain but the effect size was small [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         Pancreatic enzyme supplementation  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ) may reduce pain due to abdominal cramping and diarrhea due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in selected patients. However, it is unclear whether enzyme supplementation treats pain secondary to pancreatic inflammation or ductal stones. The rationale for using pancreatic enzyme supplementation was that delivering high doses of pancreatic proteases to the duodenum would reduce cholecystokinin (CCK) levels, which would reduce the stimulation of the pancreas by CCK. However, only the non-enteric preparations release the majority of their proteases in the duodenum, and these agents are not easily available. Randomized trials using a non-enteric-coated tablet demonstrated some reduction in pain, while several trials using enteric-coated capsules had no effect. A meta-analysis of these trials was not able to demonstrate a benefit [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         In patients with pain due to chronic pancreatitis who fail to respond to medical management alone, the subsequent management depends on pancreatic ductal anatomy and the available expertise. Patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team and should have surgical consultation at this point. In those with a non-dilated pancreatic duct, continued medical therapy is appropriate, with consideration of celiac plexus block. Surgical management in patients with a nondilated main pancreatic duct (&lt;6 to 7 mm) involves resection of the involved pancreas.

         Celiac plexus blockade is an option for pain relief in patients with refractory pain due to chronic pancreatitis. Advantages of celiac plexus blockade include the fact that a single treatment can potentially provide pain reduction or relief, may reduce or eliminate the need for oral analgesia, and can be performed quickly and repeated as needed. However, it is unclear which patients will derive the most benefit and the pain relief is transient, lasting for three to six months. Celiac plexus blockade can be repeated on an "as-needed" basis, generally separating procedures by three months or more if the patient has had clinical benefit from the initial celiac intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
         The celiac nerve plexus transmits nociceptive signals from the pancreas, with transmission through several splanchnic nerves. Blocking of the pain signal by injection of an anesthetic (typically
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/z/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">
          bupivacaine
         </a>
         ), sometimes with a steroid, into the celiac plexus could induce temporary pain relief. Celiac plexus block can be administered by computed tomography (CT) guidance, or by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance, which is safer and more effective than CT. The benefit of EUS-guided celiac plexus block in chronic pancreatitis is not well studied [
         <a href="#rid15">

        <p>
         Celiac plexus neurolysis, an attempt to destroy the nerve fibers within the plexus, either with injection of absolute alcohol or sectioning the splanchnic nerves in the thorax, is not appropriate for chronic pancreatitis and is reserved for pancreatic malignancy.

         In patients with a small-diameter main pancreatic duct (&lt;6 to 7 mm) with refractory pain, resection, rather than drainage of the fibrotic and poorly drained parenchyma, is performed. Directed partial resection is performed based on whether the disease is head-dominant (pancreaticoduodenectomy) or tail-dominant (distal pancreatectomy). Patients with diffuse parenchymal involvement may require a total pancreatectomy, ideally with islet autotransplantation. All of these operations are uncommonly performed for chronic pancreatitis. Surgery has largely focused on the pancreatic head in those with an inflammatory mass in the head of the pancreas obstructing the duodenum or the bile duct. (See

          Pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple operation)

         – This operation, to remove the entire pancreatic head and duodenum, creates a pancreaticojejunostomy and choledochojejunostomy, and can be performed with antrectomy or with pylorus-sparing reconstruction  (

          Duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (DPPHR)

         – Several procedures have been developed to allow resection of the pancreatic head while leaving in place the duodenum, in an effort to reduce postoperative morbidity  (

         ). In the Beger operation, the pancreatic head is formally resected, and a Roux-anastomosis is created to drain the remaining pancreatic remnant and bile duct. In the Frey operation, only the anterior surface of the pancreatic head is cored out and a longitudinal incision is performed over the remaining pancreatic duct in the body and tail of the pancreas, again with a Roux reconstruction. Other variants on this surgical approach also exist. (See

         We suggest endoscopic drainage procedures in patients with a symptomatic, obstructed pancreatic duct as first-line therapy. We reserve surgery for patients who fail endoscopic treatment or are unable or unwilling to undergo endoscopic treatment. Emerging data suggest that surgical therapy is more effective and more durable than endoscopic approaches. However, in practice, many patients still choose endoscopic therapy due to a reluctance to undergo surgery, and many surgeons only operate once endoscopic approaches to pancreatic drainage have been exhausted or unsuccessful.

         Randomized trials have compared endoscopic with surgical therapy for painful chronic pancreatitis. One trial randomized 72 patients to either endoscopic or surgical therapy and noted similar rates of pain relief at one year of follow-up, but better rates of long-term pain relief in the surgical group [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. A second randomized trial was stopped early, after only 39 subjects had been randomized, due to better outcomes in the surgical group [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21
         </a>
         ]. Higher rates of complete or partial pain relief were observed in the surgical group as compared with patients who received initial endoscopic therapy at two years of follow-up (75 versus 32 percent) and in a subsequent study with five years of follow-up (80 versus 38 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         However, endoscopic techniques for drainage have continued to improve since these initial trials. There are limited data on the optimal timing of surgery. A randomized trial of initial surgery, versus an approach of utilizing endoscopic techniques first followed by subsequent surgery if needed for pain control, included 88 patients with a dilated pancreatic duct on prescribed opioids for severe pain (strong opioids for ≤2 months or weak opioids for ≤6 months) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. In this study, pain relief as measured by differences in pain scores was better in the initial surgery group over 18 months, and the surgical group required fewer interventions over follow-up (median one versus three). However, there was no difference in rates of complete or partial pain relief at end of follow-up in the early surgery or endoscopy-first approach group (58 versus 39 percent). There was no difference in complications, hospital admissions, pancreatic function, or quality of life between the two groups. These results need replication and studies are needed to determine if these differences in pain relief are sustained over time.

         The primary goal of endoscopic therapy is to improve the flow through the pancreatic duct by eliminating obstructing ductal strictures or ductal stones. Endoscopic intervention requires a high degree of technical skill, but also requires careful patient selection. As the goal is to improve ductal drainage, the pancreatic ductal anatomy is the paramount feature for patient selection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those patients most amenable for endoscopic therapy are those with clear-cut evidence of ductal obstruction, including a dilated main pancreatic duct with an obstructing stricture or stone in the head of the pancreas (close enough to the tip of the endoscope to allow effective therapy). Endoscopic therapy alone is generally less feasible for stones or strictures in the body of the pancreas and impossible if the obstruction is in the tail of the pancreas. Accessory devices are often required, including lithotripsy for stones. Endoscopic therapy for pain usually involves a pancreatic sphincterotomy, pancreatic stone removal, and pancreatic duct stents. Stones that are impacted require extracorporeal or intraductal lithotripsy. Intraductal lithotripsy, using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) scopes and small pancreatoscopy scopes, is most widely available. Multiple endoscopic procedures are usually necessary to achieve ductal clearance and resolution of strictures. (See

        <p>
         The largest report with long-term follow-up included 1018 patients treated at eight expert centers and followed for an average of five years. This series included patients with appropriate ductal anatomy and included a mixture of pancreatic duct strictures and stones. In this study, approximately one-fourth of patients ultimately underwent surgery for failure of endoscopic therapy to relieve pain, and pain relief was seen in two-thirds of patients based on intention-to-treat analysis [

         Like endoscopic therapy, surgical therapy can be directed at improving pancreatic ductal flow. Patients who would be candidates for these types of operations generally require a dilated pancreatic duct (similar to endoscopic therapies), with a size of at least 5 to 6 mm so that the duct can be readily identified at surgery. The most common operation historically has been the modified Puestow operation, in which the pancreatic duct and overlying pancreas is incised along its length, and stones are removed and strictures are incised. This exposed duct is overlaid with a Roux limb for drainage  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67361" href="/z/d/graphic/67361.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). This procedure is the least technically demanding surgical approach and preserves the maximum amount of pancreatic parenchyma. In many case series, approximately three-quarters of patients will experience pain improvement or relief, although this drops to approximately one-half over more prolonged follow-up. Pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function are generally unaffected by this procedure as no parenchyma is resected, but these continue to deteriorate as in nonsurgical patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with a dilated main pancreatic duct (≥6 to 7 mm) and pain are candidates for a drainage procedure, such as lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ), or Frey procedure (LPJ with added local head resection to address fibrotic parenchyma that drains poorly and peripancreatic neural damage in the pancreatic head). These procedures are not commonly performed, and surgical expertise in these procedures is not widely available.

         Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is a late manifestation of chronic pancreatitis, usually occurring after more than five years of disease. Patients with mild exocrine pancreatic insufficiency may be asymptomatic or have mild abdominal discomfort and bloating with normal-appearing bowel movements. Advanced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency results in maldigestion of fat and protein and weight loss. Overt steatorrhea does not occur until approximately 90 percent of glandular function has been lost. Patients with steatorrhea report loose, greasy, foul-smelling stools that are difficult to flush. Other symptoms include bloating, cramping, and increased flatulence. Deficiencies of vitamins (especially fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K) are common. In particular, vitamin D deficiency and subsequent osteopenia and osteoporosis are exceedingly common (40 and 25 percent, respectively), with an increased rate of nontraumatic bone fracture [

          Initial dose
         </strong>
         — A reasonable starting dose for pancreatic enzyme supplementation is 40,000 to 50,000 USP units taken with the first bite of each main meal, and one-half that amount with snacks. Commercial pancreatic enzyme products range from 3000 to 40,000 USP units of lipase per capsule or tablet. In the United States, one product is available in tablet (non-enteric-coated) form; the rest are enteric-coated capsules.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients should be advised that the enzymes should be taken with the first bite of a meal but, if consuming a meal takes more than 20 minutes, to instead take half the number of capsules with the first bite and the other half in the middle of the meal to maximize digestion. If the non-enteric-coated preparation is chosen, suppression of gastric acid with a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor is required to avoid acid denaturation of lipase. Although it is estimated that delivery of 10 percent of normal pancreatic lipase output (approximately 90,000 USP units with each meal) can theoretically correct steatorrhea and maldigestion, in practice enzyme replacement therapy only rarely leads to normalization of digestion [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. The full 90,000 USP units (10 percent of normal pancreatic enzyme output) may not be needed, as the remaining pancreas may still have some function and gastric lipase may compensate, but some patients may need more than 90,000 USP units.

         Patients with refractory symptoms should be advised to eat more frequent, smaller meals. It is occasionally useful to change from one formulation to another (eg, changing from enteric-coated preparations to a combination of a non-enteric-coated preparation plus an agent to suppress acid) or to raise the dose higher than 90,000 USP units of lipase per meal. If all these measures fail to improve signs and symptoms of malabsorption, it is important to evaluate patients for alternative causes, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. (See

This type of diabetes, termed type 3c diabetes, is characterized by loss of insulin as well as loss of other counter-regulatory islet hormones (glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide) [

         ]. This can produce a brittle diabetes, with a high risk of treatment-induced hypoglycemia.

         is the preferred oral hypoglycemic agent as there is circumstantial evidence that it may lower the risk of secondary pancreatic carcinoma [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. However, insulin is often needed. Patients with chronic pancreatitis tend to have lower insulin requirements than patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Vigorous attempts at tight control of blood glucose value may be associated with disastrous complications of treatment-induced hypoglycemia. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 analogues and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors have not been well studied in patients with chronic pancreatitis and are generally avoided due to their risk of acute pancreatitis.

         Chronic pancreatitis is an ongoing process of pathologic response to pancreatic injury. Abdominal pain is the most common clinical symptom. As chronic pancreatitis progresses, patients may develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (steatorrhea, maldigestion) and diabetes. Complications of chronic pancreatitis include pancreatic pseudocyst, bile duct or duodenal obstruction, visceral artery pseudoaneurysm, pancreatic ascites and pancreatic pleural effusions, gastric varices due to thrombosis of the splenic vein, and pancreatic malignancy.

         We screen patients with chronic pancreatitis for smoking and alcohol use and encourage vigorous efforts at cessation. In addition, patients with chronic pancreatitis are advised to consume low-fat meals, small meals, and avoid dehydration. (See

         Prior to initiating therapy in a patient with chronic pancreatitis who presents with abdominal pain, it is necessary to confirm that the symptoms are in fact due to chronic pancreatitis and not an alternative etiology. Initial evaluation should include a detailed history to assess for the presence of abdominal pain at baseline, the character of pain, severity, and impact on quality of life. To identify alternative reversible causes of abdominal pain, we perform high-quality computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See

         The majority of patients with pain due to chronic pancreatitis require analgesics. We use a stepwise approach to treatment with the goal of avoiding high-dose opioids for pain control. We begin with

          acetaminophen
         </a>
         and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for initial management of abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis. In patients with pain requiring opioid therapy, we use suggestive adjunctive agents to minimize the use of opioid analgesia and treat coexisting depression. Adjunctive agents including tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and combined serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg,

         In patients with pain due to chronic pancreatitis who fail to respond to initial medical management alone, subsequent management is individualized depending on pancreatic ductal anatomy, available expertise, and patient preference.

         Patients with a non-dilated pancreatic duct who prefer nonoperative therapy may continue medical therapy with a celiac plexus block. Surgical management in patients with a non-dilated main pancreatic duct (&lt;6 to 7 mm) involves resection of the involved pancreas. (See

         In patients with refractory pain due to chronic pancreatitis and an obstructed, dilated pancreatic duct, we suggest initial endoscopic drainage rather than surgical therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Emerging data suggest that surgical therapy is more effective and more durable than endoscopic approaches. However, in practice, many patients still choose endoscopic therapy due to a reluctance to undergo surgery, and many surgeons only operate once endoscopic approaches to pancreatic drainage have been exhausted or unsuccessful.

         Patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency require pancreatic enzyme supplementation. A reasonable starting dose for pancreatic enzyme supplementation in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is 40,000 to 50,000 USP units with each meal, and one-half that amount with snacks. The effectiveness of enzyme supplementation is generally gauged clinically by an improvement in stool consistency, loss of visible fat in the stool, improvement in fat-soluble vitamin levels, and gain in muscle strength and body weight.

         Patients with chronic pancreatitis may suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus, but are also prone to diabetes from destruction of pancreatic islets from the chronic pancreatitis (type 3c diabetes). This can produce a brittle diabetes, with a high risk of treatment-induced hypoglycemia.
