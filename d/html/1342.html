Rates of venous and arterial thrombosis were 0.8 and 0.5 percent, respectively, and rates were acceptably low for significant bleeding (2 percent), skin reactions (1.8 percent), and osteoporotic fractures (0.04 percent).

Experience with fondaparinux during pregnancy is extremely limited, and data regarding placental passage are mixed. A series of 13 individuals treated with fondaparinux during 15 pregnancies reported 10 uncomplicated deliveries of healthy babies [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Of the remaining five pregnancies, three ended in miscarriage, one had a pregnancy termination due to fetal anomalies, and one was associated with recurrent VTE, possibly due to underdosing. One of the adverse outcomes may have been related to a delay in birth due to lack of experience with fondaparinux management, which emphasizes the importance of having a clear birth plan. Another series reported the use of fondaparinux during 12 pregnancies in 10 individuals who had hypersensitivity reactions to LMW heparin [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Outcomes were good; there was no major bleeding or fetal abnormalities.

The precise incidence of warfarin embryopathy is unknown, with different series reporting widely ranging numbers. The best overall estimate of the risk is &lt;10 percent. The teratogenic effect appears to be dose-related rather than correlating with maternal INR; doses less than 5 mg per day appear to provide the highest margin of safety, but teratogenicity at these doses has been reported [<a href="#rid58">58-60</a>].</p><p>The risk of teratogenicity is greatest for fetuses exposed to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> between the sixth and 12<sup>th</sup> weeks of gestation [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

Though the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have not been shown to be teratogenic, individuals taking these anticoagulants should be switched to LMW heparin prior to conception; if pregnancy occurs unintentionally, the DOAC should be discontinued immediately and LMW heparin commenced [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>The optimal timing for changing to LMW heparin is unclear, and it is necessary to balance the importance of avoiding <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> or a DOAC during early pregnancy/organogenesis with the inconvenience of using LMW heparin for an undefined period until conception occurs.

If labor occurs before 39 weeks, heparin is discontinued at the first signs of labor.

The advantage of switching is that unfractionated heparin has a shorter half-life so its effect dissipates faster after discontinuation, the anticoagulant effect is readily assessed by the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and anticoagulation can be reversed with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9831" href="/d/drug information/9831.html" rel="external">protamine sulfate</a> when required.
