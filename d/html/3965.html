It is believed to be the most common form of antibody disorder in older children and adults with recurrent rhinosinusitis and/or bronchopulmonary infections.  </p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of this disorder. A detailed discussion of the interpretation of vaccine responses and an overview of humoral immunodeficiencies are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3929.html" rel="external">"Assessing antibody function as part of an immunologic evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3914.html" rel="external">"Primary humoral immunodeficiencies: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93661856"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3751593359"><span class="h2">Definition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SAD describes an inadequate antibody vaccine response to polysaccharide antigens in an individual with normal responses to protein antigens, normal serum levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM), and normal IgG subclass concentrations [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Polysaccharide nonresponse is the <strong>only</strong> identifiable abnormality.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93661961"><span class="h2">Terminology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The terminology for SAD or polysaccharide non-response is not standardized, and other names appear in the literature, including "impaired polysaccharide responsiveness," "specific antibody deficiency with normal Ig levels and normal B cells," "selective antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobulins," and "antibody deficiency with near-normal immunoglobulins" [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Non-response or poor response to vaccines may be found in a host of distinct primary or secondary immunodeficiency disorders, such as common variable immunodeficiency or asplenia, or it may exist in isolation as the only identifiable immune problem [<a href="#rid3">3-8</a>]. In this review, we use the term "SAD" to refer to the disorder in which polysaccharide nonresponse is the sole identifiable immunologic abnormality and the descriptive term "polysaccharide nonresponse" to denote the immunologic defect, which may occur in a variety of disorders. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3314122409"><span class="h2">Background</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SAD was first reported in a small group of patients in the early 1980s [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Subsequently, it was established that polysaccharide nonresponse can be seen in both children and adults [<a href="#rid11">11-14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93662076"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of SAD is not fully understood, and the various conditions in which it occurs suggest that many different defects may result in the same immunologic endpoint.</p><p>Among children younger than six months of age with normal immune systems, the inability to respond to polysaccharide antigens is common although not universal because some children can respond vigorously [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Polysaccharide responsiveness normally increases with age. It is possible that polysaccharide responsiveness does not develop equally in all individuals and that polysaccharide nonresponse in some children may simply represent delayed maturation of the immune system [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Still, this apparent limitation of the infant immune system prompted the development of conjugate vaccines, in which polysaccharide antigens are complexed to more immunogenic protein antigens.</p><p>There is also evidence that polysaccharide nonresponse can result from congenital molecular abnormalities. One study described an adult patient with a mutation in Bruton tyrosine kinase, a deficiency more commonly associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, who had normal immunoglobulin concentrations but absent responses to polysaccharides [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. In addition, polysaccharide nonresponses can be identified in some patients with congenital dysmorphic syndromes or chromosomal abnormalities associated with recurrent infections, such as patients with various phenotypes associated with 22q11 microdeletions who do not fulfill criteria for the DiGeorge syndrome. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SAD is not uncommon among children and adults with recurrent and/or severe sinopulmonary infections [<a href="#rid3">3-5,18,19</a>]. With the widespread use of the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine to assess immune function, this syndrome has become the most frequently identified immunodeficiency in clinics that evaluate patients with recurrent and/or severe infections [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Studies in specific age groups include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In children older than two years of age referred for evaluation of recurrent infections, SAD was found in 5 to 10 percent [<a href="#rid19">19,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 595 adults with chronic rhinosinusitis, SAD of varying severity was identified in 40 percent, compared with 10 percent of normal controls [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In another study of 129 patients undergoing sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis after failing medical treatment, 12 percent had SAD [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among adults with recurrent (≥3 episodes) community-acquired pneumonia, SAD was found in 8 percent [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recurrent or severe rhinosinusitis and/or bronchopulmonary infections are the primary presenting disorder.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of patients with SAD overlap with those of all antibody deficiency syndromes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Sinopulmonary infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of patients have recurrent upper and/or lower respiratory infections due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Common infections include otitis media, bronchitis, acute and chronic rhinosinusitis, and pneumonia. SAD has been identified in a subset of patients with bronchiectasis of unknown etiology [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>Patients may present with symptoms suggestive of IgE-mediated diseases (such as chronic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma), and evaluation by in vivo or in vitro methods may confirm atopy. However, failure to improve significantly with appropriate therapy should raise suspicion of additional diagnoses, including an underlying immune disorder, especially if the atopic symptoms are complicated by infections. There are no data to suggest that atopic disease is more prevalent in patients with SAD compared with the general population, and some patients with SAD have very low levels of IgE and no evidence of specific IgE sensitization to allergens.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H720477487"><span class="h2">Other disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Noninfectious complications such as connective tissue diseases, autoimmunity, and rarely hematopoietic malignancies have also been described in patients diagnosed with SAD [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Screening for these comorbidities should be performed if there is a suggestive history or finding upon initial evaluation, and monitoring for new signs and symptoms is an important component of ongoing management.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93662873"><span class="h2">Indications for evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of SAD should be suspected in children and adults with recurrent and/or severe sinopulmonary infections. The table shows the infectious issues suggesting that an evaluation for a defect in the humoral immune response should be performed  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60473" href="/d/graphic/60473.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3908.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with recurrent infections", section on 'What is an excessive number of infections?'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1448738966"><span class="h2">Laboratory studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation for SAD involves the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Measurement of serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Measurement of IgG subclass levels</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of response to polysaccharide and protein vaccines</p><p></p><p>Immunologists debate the need for concomitant measurement of IgG subclasses and polysaccharide nonresponses, and differences of opinion exist. We measure IgG subclasses in patients with impaired polysaccharide responses because this is consistently found in association with IgG2 deficiency, and patients with these findings should be categorized as having IgG2 subclass deficiency rather than SAD [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3964.html" rel="external">"IgG subclasses: Physical properties, genetics, and biologic functions"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3906.html" rel="external">"IgG subclass deficiency", section on 'IgG2 deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of SAD is a diagnosis of exclusion, in which the <strong>only identifiable immunologic abnormality</strong> is a deficient response to polysaccharide vaccines. Levels of IgG, IgG subclasses, IgA, IgM, and IgE should be normal, and responses to protein vaccines should be normal. In addition, no other primary or secondary immune disorder should be present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3929.html" rel="external">"Assessing antibody function as part of an immunologic evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3903.html" rel="external">"Laboratory evaluation of the immune system"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Referral</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This evaluation may be initiated by the primary care clinician, or the patient may be referred to an allergy/immunology specialist at the outset. For patients who are requiring antibiotics regularly, we advocate for early referral to an immunology specialist. For patients who have not required multiple antibiotic treatments, it may be reasonable to complete an age-appropriate immunization schedule first and then to perform a complete immunologic evaluation only if frequent infections continue to occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6053.html" rel="external">"Pneumococcal vaccination in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7021.html" rel="external">"Pneumococcal vaccination in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Pneumococcal vaccination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After prevaccine titers are obtained, immunization with a polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (eg, Pneumovax 23 or Pnu-Imune 23) is used to assess immunologic response to polysaccharide antigens in patients over two years of age  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117459" href="/d/graphic/117459.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. In addition to providing diagnostic information, vaccination enhances immunity to a common respiratory pathogen in patients suffering from recurrent infections, at least in those able to respond [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Interpretation of vaccine response is described briefly here and reviewed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3929.html" rel="external">"Assessing antibody function as part of an immunologic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>Panels of quantitative serum levels of antibodies to different pneumococcal serotypes are available through several commercial laboratories. It is recommended that the same laboratory perform the pre- and postvaccination measurements, because different laboratories may measure different serotypes. We recommend measuring antibodies to at least 14 serotypes and ideally to all 23 serotypes present in the 23-valent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9784" href="/d/drug information/9784.html" rel="external">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPSV23). When patients have been immunized with conjugate vaccine(s), the panel should include antibodies to serotypes not present in the 10-valent or 13-valent conjugate vaccines, as response to these serotypes is the only way to assess the response and diagnose SAD to unconjugated polysaccharides  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77758" href="/d/graphic/77758.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91154" href="/d/graphic/91154.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). At least one publication has suggested that panels of pneumococcal serotypes including as few as five serotypes may be adequate to predict and diagnose SAD [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. However, most literature and guidance have used larger panels as suggested here. Furthermore, it may be difficult to place patients into the accepted severity classifications (see <a class="local">'Degrees of nonresponse'</a> below) if only a few serotypes are used to make the diagnosis. These severity levels were developed based upon evaluation of patients using significantly larger panels of 14 to 23 serotypes. If possible, patients should be evaluated before giving vaccines for diagnostic purposes and again at least four weeks and no more than eight weeks after vaccination with the PPSV23 [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>Pneumococcal immunization is generally well-tolerated. However, patients who have protective levels of antibodies to one or more serotypes included in the vaccine prior to immunization may have exaggerated local reactions at the site of vaccine injection that can last several days. These reactions may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.</p><p>Titers may be assessed in adults who have been vaccinated with the polysaccharide vaccine within the previous five years. Patients vaccinated more than five years ago may have waning titers, so if low titers are found, the patient can be revaccinated and titers checked again in four weeks.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Unimmunized patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most normal unimmunized adults have protective antibodies to some pneumococcal serotypes tested as a result of clinical or subclinical infections [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. However, the lack of preimmunization protective antibodies is not a deficiency per se and may simply represent a lack of exposure. Most of these patients have a vigorous response to immunization. Responders cannot be differentiated from nonresponders without immunization and retesting after immunization. However, one study suggested that the presence or absence of pre-existing protective antibodies may also predict responses to immunization with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9784" href="/d/drug information/9784.html" rel="external">PPSV23</a>, due to the varying immunogenicity of the capsular polysaccharide unique to each serotype [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>In partially or unimmunized patients, it may be necessary to update prior immunizations or to start an immunization program appropriate to the patient's age (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6053.html" rel="external">"Pneumococcal vaccination in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7021.html" rel="external">"Pneumococcal vaccination in adults"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Interpreting a pneumococcal vaccine response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The interpretation of a patient's response to the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is reviewed briefly here and in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3929.html" rel="external">"Assessing antibody function as part of an immunologic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1607153554"><span class="h4">Normal response to PPSV23</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A "normal" or protective response to an individual serotype following challenge with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9784" href="/d/drug information/9784.html" rel="external">PPSV23</a> is defined as 1.3 mcg/mL or greater [<a href="#rid29">29,34</a>]. Note that if the baseline levels are ≥1.3 mcg/mL prior to immunization with PPSV23, then a two-fold increase over baseline is a satisfactory response to the vaccine.</p><p>The cut-off of 1.3 mcg/mL is based upon consensus among a panel of experts that this level is protective against pneumococcal disease following vaccination with a polysaccharide vaccine [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. These arbitrary levels for polysaccharide responses have been questioned, with some using 1 mcg/mL or 1.5 mcg/mL as a protective titer [<a href="#rid35">35</a>] and at least one group using 50 percent or more as representing a normal response in adults [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p><strong>Note that an adequate response to </strong><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9784" href="/d/drug information/9784.html" rel="external">PPSV23</a><strong> is different from the response that is adequate to provide protection against invasive pneumococcal disease in a patient vaccinated with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which is ≥0.35 mcg/mL.</strong> This discrepancy can be confusing but is likely due to the potential differences in the immune responses to conjugated polysaccharide antigens compared with the pure polysaccharide antigens in PPSV23. Therefore, we do not recommend making a diagnosis of an antibody deficiency based solely on results from an initial measurement of antibody titers to <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, which may include pre-existing antibodies developed in response to natural infection or immunization with the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9906" href="/d/drug information/9906.html" rel="external">13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</a> (PCV13). The diagnosis of SAD can <strong>only </strong>be made by interpretation of an individual's response to pure polysaccharide antigens such as are included in PPSV23.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Children aged 2 to 5 years who were previously immunized with the conjugate vaccine and are then given the polysaccharide vaccine are expected to generate protective responses to at least 50 percent of the serotypes present <strong>only</strong> in the unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals aged 6 to 60 years are expected to generate protective responses to at least 70 percent of serotypes tested if they did not receive the conjugate vaccine.

We consider the response adequate if a majority of the interpretable serotypes are protective following administration of the polysaccharide vaccine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The normal response for individuals over age 65 is not well-defined, but it is probably decreased (ie, both lower titers and fewer protective titers) compared with younger individuals.

In the absence of severe infections or a clinical presentation with a history of life-threatening illness, we consider prophylactic antibiotics as a first-line therapy.
