         Twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence refers to a rare pregnancy complication unique to monochorionic twins of a multiple gestation in which one fetus has an absent or rudimentary nonfunctional heart ("acardiac twin") and is entirely perfused in a retrograde direction by its sibling ("pump twin") via abnormal arterio-arterial anastomoses. The acardiac twin typically has other severe congenital anomalies, such as a poorly developed or absent upper body and head. The four types (acephalus, anceps, acormus, amorphus) reflect the degree of abnormal development (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141760" href="/z/d/graphic/141760.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ); none can survive ex utero.
        </p>
        <p>
         An additional concern is that if an acardiac twin grows to a very large size relative to the pump twin, the latter is at high risk of developing heart failure from the circulatory burden of supporting its co-twin. Heart failure and other complications may lead to preterm birth or death, which commonly occurs in the absence of intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss issues related to TRAP sequence. More common complications of monochorionic twinning, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS), and selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) are reviewed separately.

          INCIDENCE

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The incidence of TRAP sequence is estimated to be 1 in 38 (2.6 percent) monochorionic twin pregnancies and 1 in 9500 to 11,000 (0.01 percent) pregnancies, based on mathematical models [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Historically, TRAP sequence had been reported to occur in approximately 1 percent of monochorionic twin pregnancies and 1 in 35,000 (0.003 percent) pregnancies [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. These historic figures are widely cited but based on data prior to 1954. In contemporary obstetrics, the incidence appears to be higher due to factors such as the use of first-trimester obstetric ultrasound examination, which can detect early twin demises, and assisted reproductive technology, which has increased the incidence of multiple gestations, including monochorionic twins.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the twin name, TRAP sequence very rarely occurs in monochorionic triplet and higher-order multiple gestations. A literature review identified 11 case reports documenting the occurrence of this phenomenon [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Subsequent reports have also emerged, adding to the existing body of evidence [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. In monochorionic triplet pregnancies, more than one pump or acardiac fetus may be present [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>

         In the normal fetal circulation, relatively oxygen-rich blood from the placenta flows through the umbilical vein toward the fetal liver. The ductus venosus shunts 80 percent of this blood flow into the inferior vena cava, allowing it to bypass the liver and mix with venous return from the lower extremities and kidneys before entering the right atrium (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765" href="/z/d/graphic/66765.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Once the blood enters the right atrium, the two sides of the fetal heart act in parallel through intra- and extracardiac shunts (foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus) to fill the aorta and provide the systemic circulation. The distal aorta terminates in the left and right common iliac arteries, which each divide into external and internal iliac branches. The umbilical arteries, which originate from the internal iliac arteries, carry relatively deoxygenated blood back to the placenta where it is oxygenated and then flows back to the fetus via the umbilical vein.

         </span>
         In TRAP sequence, the pump twin maintains the normal fetal circulatory pattern described above. Additionally, a portion of its cardiac output travels through one or more mostly arterio-arterial anastomoses with its co-twin, resulting in retrograde flow of deoxygenated blood into one or both umbilical arteries and the systemic circulation of the co-twin, thus creating "reversed" circulatory perfusion. While the arterio-arterial anastomoses between twin circulations in TRAP sequence usually exist along the placental surface, a range of vascular atypia has been described, and other abnormalities, such as direct umbilical artery-to-umbilical artery communications that bypass the chorionic plate, are possible [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Veno-venous anastomoses may also play a minor role.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the pump twin carries the hemodynamic burden of perfusing its own body as well as that of its acardiac co-twin, it is at risk for developing high-output heart failure, which manifests as cardiomegaly, polyhydramnios, ascites and other pathologic fluid collections, and hydrops fetalis.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The precise pathogenesis of TRAP sequence is unknown. One theory is that early abnormal development of arterio-arterial anastomoses allows retrograde flow of deoxygenated blood from one twin to the other and this leads to abnormal cardiac development of recipient twin. In another theory, early abnormal cardiac development of one twin results in low systemic arterial pressure and this is the abnormality allowing retrograde flow of blood from its co-twin through arterio-arterial anastomoses. Regardless of the exact cause, the net result is that the one twin (acardiac twin) depends on retrograde blood flow from the other twin (pump twin) for circulatory support beginning very early in the first trimester. Reversed circulation of deoxygenated blood from the pump twin may contribute to a wide range of gross structural abnormalities in the co-twin [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. For example, the lower half of the acardiac twin may receive a preferential share of the pump twin's circulatory support. This is likely the reason for relatively better development of the fetal abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities than the upper extremities and head, which often have various degrees of necrosis, maldevelopment, or absence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Placental vascular anastomoses alone are not sufficient for the development of TRAP sequence, as nearly all monochorionic twins have some degree of inter-twin placental anastomoses, whereas TRAP remains a rare phenomenon.

         </span>
         The prenatal diagnosis of TRAP sequence should be suspected in any monochorionic multiple gestation in which one fetus has either absent cardiac activity or a rudimentary pump structure (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53045" href="/z/d/graphic/53045.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ), especially in the setting of multiple severe cranial and/or limb anomalies and skin edema. In first-trimester pregnancies, the initial presentation may appear as monochorionic twins with one demise; however, on follow-up, the "demised" twin will have grown.
        </p>
        <p>
         A TRAP diagnosis is confirmed if umbilical artery color or spectral Doppler interrogation of the acardiac fetus demonstrates blood flowing toward, rather than away from, its body (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64737" href="/z/d/graphic/64737.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. This reversed perfusion is pathognomonic and required for sonographic diagnosis of TRAP sequence [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The focus of Doppler interrogation should be on placental arterio-arterial anastomoses and the umbilical artery of the demised or severely anomalous fetus to limit thermal exposure of the other fetus as much as practically possible for safety. Since both twins typically have umbilical cord insertion sites relatively close together in the placenta, flow in the arterio-arterial anastomoses can be evaluated well in this region. (See

          Co-twin demise
         </strong>
         – A demised twin will not have limb movements, retrograde arterial flow on Doppler assessment, or continued growth on serial ultrasound examinations, whereas an acardiac twin will demonstrate some or all of these findings. In a classic vignette of an early TRAP presentation, a patient with first-trimester sonographic diagnosis of a demised twin returns for a midtrimester fetal anatomic survey of the surviving co-twin only to discover that the presumed embryonic/fetal demise has continued to grow, at which time TRAP sequence is diagnosed. To avoid this initial misdiagnosis, color Doppler study should be performed for all early cases of suspected vanishing or demised twins in early monochorionic twin gestations to evaluate for reversed perfusion to the demised twin.

          Placental mass

         – Rarely, an acardiac twin presenting as a severely amorphous tissue mass may be mistaken for a placental mass, such as a chorioangioma or placental or umbilical cord teratoma. Chorioangiomas are usually well-circumscribed, rounded, vascular lesions next to the chorionic surface near the cord insertion site. Color Doppler ultrasound should demonstrate the low-resistance pulsatile blood flow in the aberrant fetal vessels perfusing the lesion. A teratoma consists of a disorganized collection of various tissue types but usually does not have an axial skeleton or separate umbilical cord attachment to the placenta [

         Diagnostic genetic testing – Pregnancies complicated by TRAP sequence may be at increased risk of aneuploidy. Various autosomal trisomies and sex chromosome aneuploidies have been described in case reports, and were sometimes discordant between twins [

          15-18

         ]. As in any pregnancy with a fetal anomaly, patients should be offered a diagnostic procedure (eg, amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling) to obtain fetal cells for genetic testing (karyotype, microarray). As the acardiac fetus has no prognosis for ex utero survival, it is reasonable to only sample the pump twin's amniotic sac. This information may influence patient decisions regarding pregnancy continuation, acardiac twin cord occlusion, and/or other aspects of prenatal, intrapartum, or postnatal care. (See

         Calculation of the ratio of acardiac twin estimated fetal weight to pump twin estimated fetal weight (acardiac:pump twin weight ratio) is an important component of TRAP sequence evaluation. Pump twin estimated fetal weight is performed using standard biometric formula, whereas accurate estimation of acardiac twin weight can be more challenging given the large potential variations in physical shapes (eg, no head, abnormal extremities, hydrops) that are not amenable to assessment by standard biometric formula. Acardiac twins resembling amorphous tissue masses can be measured in three orthogonal planes. The following formula has been proposed to estimate acardiac weight, using the longest length of the acardiac mass:

         Following a diagnosis of TRAP sequence, ideally patients should be referred to a fetal diagnosis and therapy center with experience managing these pregnancies for further assessment and discussion of prognosis and management strategies. For continuing pregnancies, these strategies include expectant management and/or occlusion of the cord of the acardiac twin. Cord occlusion confers a better prognosis than expectant management in pregnancies with one or more poor prognostic features. In a 2016 meta-analysis of 26 retrospective studies of TRAP sequence, pregnancies treated with cord occlusion had a higher chance of live birth of the pump twin than those managed expectantly (79 versus 65 percent; odds ratio [OR] 2.22, 95% CI 1.23-4.01), with the greatest benefit in pregnancies with poor prognostic factors (83 versus 31 percent; OR 8.58, 95% CI 1.47-49.96) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Treatment of these pregnancies is only available at a limited number of institutions due to the need for highly specialized training and equipment. A list of many such centers in North America can be found on the North American Fetal Therapy Network website (). (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         If referral to a center providing acardiac twin cord occlusion is not possible, amnioreduction can treat polyhydramnios (if present) and limit its consequences (eg, preterm birth, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [PPROM]). However, it is a temporizing measure that does not address the underlying TRAP pathophysiology. Referral to a fetal therapy center experienced with cord occlusion treatment is, therefore, strongly recommended. (See

         ), we may increase second-trimester monitoring to twice weekly to optimize the timing of cord occlusion therapy, if desired. In those cases in which cord occlusion is indicated but declined or is not indicated, twice weekly monitoring can help with delivery timing when a gestational age compatible with ex utero survival has been reached.

         Cord occlusion interrupts the vascular communication(s) between twins, thereby relieving the pump twin of the hemodynamic burden of supporting its acardiac co-twin. Because all of the blood is being supplied by the pump twin and the cord is occluded, this twin is not at increased risk of adverse effects from demise of the acardiac twin, in contrast to the sequelae of monochorionic twins with one natural demise.

         We offer cord occlusion therapy for pregnancies complicated by TRAP sequence that have at least one poor prognostic factor (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141742" href="/z/d/graphic/141742.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). In the absence of any poor prognostic factors, expectant management is reasonable. Although a ratio of the estimated weight of the acardiac twin to that of the pump twin &gt;0.70 is one identified poor prognostic factor, many centers now offer cord occlusion therapy for ratios &gt;0.50, or when there is evidence of a rapidly growing acardiac twin. Ultimately, the decision to intervene must be individualized to the specific clinical findings of the pregnancy and must balance maternal and obstetric risks against potential pump twin benefits. Local legal regulations regarding termination may be an additional factor, although it should be reiterated that acardiac twins often lack hearts and heads and are universally acknowledged to have no chance for ex utero survival.
        </p>
        <p>
         The minimum gestational age for offering cord occlusion is modality specific. For example, laser photocoagulation can be performed in the late first trimester whereas radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or bipolar coagulation are typically offered at 16 to 18 weeks of gestation.
        </p>
        <p>
         While no consensus exists on a maximum gestational age for offering cord occlusion, by 26 to 28 weeks it may be reasonable to consider delivery rather than cord occlusion when there is evidence of pump twin compromise. State and institutional limitations may also restrict the gestational age at which cord occlusion therapy can be offered. Consultation with a center experienced with TRAP sequence that offers cord occlusion therapy is strongly recommended in the evaluation and management of affected pregnancies. (See

         In the United States, RFA is the most commonly used cord occlusion technique, and the preferred technique at the institution of the author of this topic. In many treatment centers, RFA and/or bipolar coagulation are reserved for pregnancies ≥16 weeks of gestation, but preferably ≥18 weeks, due to concerns about a higher rate of procedure-related complications, such as PPROM, with earlier intervention. Because RFA involves a smaller caliber uterine entry than bipolar occlusion to conduct the procedure, RFA proponents believe that it may have a lower complication rate (and therefore greater efficacy) for achieving midtrimester cord occlusion. However, limited data have not conclusively demonstrated improved outcomes with RFA [

         ]. In a meta-analysis that included 481 cases of bipolar cord occlusion and 320 cases of RFA from 17 studies involving complicated monochorionic gestations, overall survival was not significantly different for the two techniques (RFA 76.8 percent, bipolar occlusion 79.1 percent) [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. While PPROM occurred less frequently in the RFA group (RFA 17.7, bipolar occlusion 28.2 percent), mean gestational age at delivery was similar for both groups (RFA 34.7±1.7 weeks, bipolar occlusion 35.1±1.6 weeks). The analysis was limited by small studies and heterogeneity of fetal anatomy, operator experience, and technique.

         The optimal management of TRAP sequence presenting prior to 16 to 18 weeks is unclear. Laser photocoagulation (also called intrafetal or interstitial laser) of the umbilical arteries of the acardiac fetus may be offered as early as 12 to 14 weeks. At this early gestational age, ultrasound findings may not accurately identify TRAP pregnancies at high risk of fetal demise, which has been reported to occur acutely and unpredictably in 33 to 83 percent of such pregnancies [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. For this reason, cord occlusion of all cases before 16 weeks has been proposed to reduce the risk of first-trimester demise; however, this approach remains investigational because of limited data, substantial risk for publication bias, and potentially high procedure-related loss rates (8 percent (1 in 12) in one study [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ] but 29 and 42 percent (7 in 24 and 5 in 12) in two other studies [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35,36
         </a>
         ]) that may exceed the loss rate of expectant management (33 to 83 percent) [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. While laser photocoagulation has the advantage of potentially definitive therapy as early as the late first trimester, it has not proven to be superior to expectant management until 16 to 18 weeks. An international trial is underway comparing early intervention (13 to 14 weeks) with intrafetal laser under ultrasound guidance using an 18- to 20-gauge needle with later intervention (16 to 19 weeks) by the same intrafetal ablation technique or by fetoscopic laser coagulation [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. This trial should contribute to our understanding of intrafetal laser as a treatment for TRAP sequence and timing of therapy.

          Bipolar coagulation

         – Under ultrasound guidance, bipolar coagulation is performed by passing an operative sheath (approximately 10- to 12-French) through a small skin incision in the maternal abdomen and into the uterus to reach the acardiac fetus via the Seldinger technique or direct trochar entry.

Bipolar forceps are advanced through the sheath and guided sonographically to grasp the target site. Once confirmed to be in place, power is applied until successful cord occlusion is achieved.

Laparotomy may be required to manage bleeding complications unresponsive to conservative management. Among the 98 patients identified in the North American Fetal Therapy Network Registry of RFA cord occlusion therapy for TRAP, there were no maternal deaths, no patient required a blood transfusion, and most patients were hospitalized for ≤1 day after the procedure [

         Absence of blood flow in all acardiac twin umbilical vessels should be confirmed by Doppler studies at completion of the procedure and at subsequent ultrasound examinations. Follow-up sonograms of the pump twin should evaluate for: recovery of heart function, normalization of Doppler studies (if abnormalities existed prior to therapy), resolution of hydrops (if previously present), and normalization of amniotic fluid volume (if polyhydramnios was present).

         There is no consensus or evidence basis to support any particular monitoring strategy after cord occlusion therapy. We perform weekly sonograms after RFA for several weeks until sustained normalization of findings has been demonstrated. Additionally, we perform serial pump twin growth assessments approximately every three weeks throughout pregnancy.

          Definition/pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence refers to a rare, unique complication of monochorionic twin pregnancy in which a severely anomalous twin with an absent or rudimentary heart ("acardiac twin") is perfused by its co-twin ("pump twin") via retrograde flow of deoxygenated blood through arterio-arterial anastomoses. If the acardiac twin grows to a very large size relative to the pump twin, the pump twin is at high risk of developing heart failure from the circulatory burden of supporting its co-twin. (See

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The prenatal diagnosis of TRAP sequence should be suspected in any monochorionic multiple gestation in which one fetus has either absent cardiac activity or a rudimentary pump structure (

          image 1
         </a>
         ), especially in the setting of multiple severe cranial and/or limb anomalies and skin edema. The diagnosis is confirmed in such cases by color Doppler interrogation of the umbilical artery of this fetus showing blood flowing toward, rather than away from, its body (

          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – The acardiac twin cannot survive ex utero. The perinatal mortality rate of pump twins is related to presence of poor prognostic features (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141742" href="/z/d/graphic/141742.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). In fetuses with poor prognostic features, perinatal mortality is ≥50 percent with expectant management and &lt;20 percent with intervention (cord occlusion). (See

          Cord occlusion
         </strong>
         – For ongoing pregnancies with TRAP sequence and at least one poor prognostic factor (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141742" href="/z/d/graphic/141742.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         ), we recommend cord occlusion of the acardiac twin rather than expectant management (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). Ideally, the procedure should be performed at a center with proficiency in the evaluation and management of TRAP sequence, and in accordance with local regulations. Techniques include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), bipolar cord coagulation, and laser photocoagulation. The choice is individualized based on operator experience, center resources/ procedural offerings, clinical presentation, gestational age, and preference. The procedure is typically performed at 16 to 18 weeks of gestation, or soon thereafter. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         The most common complication of RFA and bipolar cord occlusion is preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM). (See
