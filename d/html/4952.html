         Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic heart muscle disease caused by mutations in one of several sarcomere genes that encode components of the contractile apparatus of the heart. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4956.html" rel="external">

         HCM is characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy of various morphologies, with a wide array of clinical manifestations and hemodynamic abnormalities  (

         </a>
         ). Depending in part upon the site and extent of cardiac hypertrophy, patients with HCM can develop one or more of the following abnormalities:

         In broad terms, the symptoms related to HCM can be categorized as those related to heart failure (HF), chest pain, or arrhythmias. Patients with HCM are prone to both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Many of these arrhythmias are asymptomatic, but some can precipitate hemodynamic collapse and sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD is a catastrophic and unpredictable complication of HCM and in some patients may be the first presentation of the disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The assessment of risk for arrhythmic SCD is a critical component of the clinical evaluation of nearly all patients with HCM and will be reviewed here. The management of patients following risk assessment and following a documented ventricular arrhythmia is discussed separately. (See

         Other issues related to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD, as well as other clinical manifestations, natural history, diagnosis and evaluation, and treatment of patients with HCM, are discussed separately. (See

         Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with HCM and can range from isolated ventricular premature beats (VPBs) to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) to sustained VT and ventricular fibrillation. While the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias is highly variable, clinically documented sustained VT is relatively rare, with the annual incidence of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in clinically identified HCM referral populations being approximately 1 percent, with even lower reported rate in HCM patients in the general community [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The frequency of ventricular tachyarrhythmias detected by ambulatory monitoring in patients with HCM has been evaluated in a variety of studies [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,6-12
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a study of 178 patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, VPBs were highly prevalent (seen in 88 percent; 12 percent had ≥500 VPBs) and NSVT was present in 31 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, there is no evidence to suggest that frequent VPBs are, by themselves, indicative of an increased risk of sustained ventricular arrhythmia. This is similar to other forms of heart disease in which treatment of VPBs alone is warranted only in symptomatic patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122361.html" rel="external">
          "Premature ventricular complexes: Treatment and prognosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other studies have shown lower rates of NSVT (typically asymptomatic), with ranges of 15 to 31 percent of patients with HCM [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,6-8
         </a>
         ]. NSVT is more likely in older patients and is associated with greater LV wall thickening and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV symptoms  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683" href="/z/d/graphic/52683.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Episodes are most frequent during sleep and other periods of heightened vagal tone.
        </p>
        <p>
         The prevalence of NSVT is less common in young patients (&lt;40 years old) with HCM, and therefore when present is of greater predictive value for SCD than when it occurs in older patients. Among one cohort of 428 patients ≥60 years of age with HCM, the risk of arrhythmic SCD was 0.2 percent per year, lower than the younger HCM population and significantly lower than the risk of non-HCM-related death [
         <a href="#rid13">

         ), interstitial fibrosis, and replacement fibrosis provides the likely structural nidus for the generation of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HCM. This substrate can be acted upon by potential triggers and/or modifiers, including myocardial ischemia, LV outflow tract obstruction, and abnormal vascular response with inappropriate vasodilatation, as well as the impact of high adrenergic states (eg, during competitive sports, etc) that can lower the threshold for initiating VT/ventricular fibrillation.

         The presentation of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HCM is highly variable, ranging from an absence of symptoms to palpitations to SCA, but in general the presentation of ventricular arrhythmias is similar to their presentation in other types of patients without HCM.

         Since the underlying abnormal myocardial substrate in HCM can evolve over time, nearly all patients with known or suspected HCM should undergo serial evaluations assessing SCD risk every 12 to 24 months, particularly young and middle-aged HCM patients who were previously considered low or intermediate risk, but who still remain eligible for primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy [

         Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Our experts have differing approaches to utilizing CMR in HCM, with currently no clear consensus on how to best apply this advanced imaging technique for HCM diagnosis. Some experts proceed with CMR only when diagnosis of HCM remains uncertain following echocardiography while other experts perform CMR in all patients with suspected or diagnosed HCM to most reliably assess LV morphology, including maximal LV wall thickness, as well as to further inform risk stratification with assessment of extent of late gadolinium enhancement.

         These established risk factors have greatest weight in young and middle age patients, but risk stratification for SCD should still be performed in all patients with HCM, independent of symptoms or hemodynamic status. The risk factors associated with SCD have also been evaluated for their more general association with overall mortality and outcomes. Several society guidelines for HCM as well as ventricular arrhythmias and SCD have outlined the risk factors for SCD in patients with HCM  (

In patients with echo-derived measurements that are &lt;30 mm but in whom CMR demonstrates massive LVH (echocardiography underestimated wall thickness), it would be reasonable to consider an increased risk for SCD as well, with consideration given to placement of an ICD for primary prevention.

         Thin-walled apical aneurysms are almost always associated with transmural scar (ie, apical late gadolinium enhancement [LGE]), which represent a structural nidus for the generation of sustained monomorphic VT. Apical aneurysms most notably occur in association with midventricular hypertrophy, which often produces mid-cavitary obstruction resulting in high apical systolic pressures, which likely promotes the adverse LV remodeling that ultimately develops into a thin-walled scarred akinetic apex. Patients with apical aneurysms often come to medical attention because of the dramatically abnormal ECG with precordial ST segment elevation and giant T wave inversions, most notably in leads V3 and V4, a similar ECG pattern to HCM patients with only hypertrophy at the apex (without aneurysm). This phenotype is distinct from HCM patients with increased wall thickness confined to the apex, without associated wall thinning (ie, apical HCM). (See

         Among a cohort of 1940 consecutive patients with HCM seen at one of two high-volume referral centers and who underwent echocardiography with LV opacification and/or CMR, 93 patients (4.8 percent) were found to have an LV apical aneurysm [

Of the 54 patients who received an ICD for primary prevention, 18 patients (33 percent) experienced a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia requiring ICD intervention, resulting in an arrhythmic event rate of 4.7 percent per year (compared with 0.9 percent per year in the patients without an LV apical aneurysm), with no difference in the risk of SCD based on the size of the aneurysm. In contrast to the general population of patients with HCM without an apical aneurysm, risk of SCD persists into the seventh decade of life (and beyond) among patients with HCM and LV apical aneurysm. In one cohort of 118 such patients, 36 percent of SCD (and aborted SCD) events occurred in patients ≥60 years of age [

Of note, the high-risk phenotype of HCM with apical aneurysm stands in contrast to apical HCM patients who, in the absence of any of the conventional sudden death risk factors, are in fact at low risk for experiencing life-threatening VT/VF.

          LGE on CMR imaging

          35,36
         </a>
         ]. The presence and extent of LGE is associated with markers of disease severity, including the magnitude of LVH and the presence of nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias. How best to integrate LGE in HCM management strategies remains controversial, even among HCM experts. However, based on the totality of data evaluating LGE and outcomes in HCM, we suggest considering the results of contrast-enhanced CMR with LGE in assessing risk of SCD to provide a more complete evaluation of patients who may benefit from primary prevention ICD therapy. More data to inform this management issue will also be forthcoming following the completion of a Nation Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study, Novel Markers of Prognosis in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCMR), involving 40 centers and more than 2500 patients, anticipated to be completed over the next seven years [

         In addition, there are a number of methods that have been used to quantify LGE in HCM, but there is no expert consensus on which technique should be universally employed in clinical practice. The lack of standardization with respect to the preferred strategy for quantification of LGE in HCM represents a challenge. The two most commonly employed methods to identify high-signal intensity LGE pixels in the LV wall include applying a grayscale threshold several standard deviations (five or six) above mean signal intensity within a region of "nulled" myocardium and the full-width at half maximum method. Both of these techniques are highly reproducible and reliably represent total fibrosis burden as demonstrated by histopathologic analysis of ventricular septal tissue removed in HCM patients undergoing surgical myectomy [

         In a 2016 meta-analysis, which included 2993 patients from five cohorts, the presence of LGE on CMR imaging was associated with significantly greater risk for total mortality (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7), cardiovascular mortality (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.6), and SCD (OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-5.9) [

          NSVT
         </strong>
         – The presence of multiple asymptomatic runs of NSVT (most commonly defined as ≥3 beats at &gt;120 beats per minute) is associated with an increased risk for SCD in patients with HCM, although the effect of a patient's age plays a role in the associated risk [

Although the data for relating characteristics of NSVT to SCD risk are scant, it would be reasonable to give greater weight to increased risk of SCD in patients with HCM with NSVT that is frequent, prolonged, and particularly fast, while a single, slow, short burst of NSVT on ambulatory monitoring is itself not associated with increased risk of future life-threatening VT/ventricular fibrillation (VF), and in the absence of any other conventional risk factors does not form the basis for primary prevention ICD. For patients with HCM and an ICD, NSVT is associated with an increased risk of appropriate ICD therapies for VT/VF [

In this cohort of older patients, there was a smaller increase in risk with NSVT (1.6 versus 0.9 percent per year in patients with and without NSVT, defined as ≥3 beats at 120 beats per minute) [

          Myocardial ischemia
         </strong>
         – There are conflicting data as to whether myocardial ischemia is a risk factor for SCD in patients with HCM. In a series of 23 young patients with HCM (age 6 to 23 years), ischemia was associated with a history of cardiac arrest or syncope [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The relationship between ischemia and outcomes is likely dependent upon both the age of the patient and the etiology of ischemia (eg, severe small vessel-mediated ischemia versus atherosclerotic obstructive coronary artery disease [CAD]). Patients with HCM and coincident CAD have mortality rates that exceed those of CAD patients with normal LV function [

          Genotype
         </strong>
         – There appear to be high-risk genotypes for SCD, particularly related to troponin T disease and several of the beta myosin-heavy chain mutations [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52

          14,16

         ]. Moreover, most mutations are novel (ie, "private mutations"), and thus a certain genotype may be associated with higher risk in a specific family but would not be associated with the same consequences in other unrelated patients and families. For this reason, clinical decisions about risk for sudden death and need for primary prevention ICD are not made based on the results of genetic testing. (See

          LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The incidence of SCD in patients with obstruction also varies substantially based upon the number of additional risk factors  (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         There are also a number of practical limitations to using LVOT gradient as a clinical risk factor for sudden death. Gradients are present in large numbers of patients, which would ultimately lead to significant overtreatment with ICDs in this disease. Additionally, gradients can be abolished and/or significantly mitigated with drugs or invasive septal reduction therapy. Nonrandomized retrospective cohort studies suggest that risk of SCD or appropriate ICD shocks is very low following septal myectomy [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56,57
         </a>

         It is reasonable to consider ICD in patients with one major risk factor, since SCD risk is increased. Decisions about high-risk status in patients with one risk factor should be individualized based on the strength of the specific risk factor and the individual patient situation. The presence of two or more risk factors for SCD is associated with even greater SCD risk. In patients in whom sudden death risk remains uncertain after assessment with the major risk markers or who are uncertain about pursuing ICD therapy, the presence of a risk modifier may be associated with additional sudden death risk and therefore may help resolve ICD decision-making.

         While the risk of SCD in patients with HCM can be estimated from large populations, individualized risk prediction offers the hope of the most accurate risk assessment and appropriate interventions. Given the complexity of SCD risk assessment in patients with HCM and the mixed data on the HCM Risk-SCD calculator, we feel that additional studies are warranted to further validate and refine this risk model in other HCM populations, along with the need for additional comparisons with the current United States guideline-based approach using a number of noninvasive risk markers [

          63,64

         In a cohort of 706 patients with HCM and no prior history of SCD who were seen at two European referral centers, 42 patients (5.9 percent) experienced an SCD event (defined as SCD, successful resuscitation from SCA, or appropriate ICD intervention for VT/VF) over the five-year follow-up (1.2 percent per year) [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. Patients with an SCD event had significantly greater estimated five-year risk of SCD using the HCM Risk-SCD calculator (4.9 versus 2.8 percent in patients without SCD), with the calculator resulting in improved risk assessment compared with 2003 and 2011 society guidelines.

         The HCM Risk-SCD calculator has also been retrospectively applied to a cohort of 2094 patients with HCM seen at a large United States referral center [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. The HCM Risk-SCD calculator accurately predicted patients at low risk without SCD events (92 percent specificity), but the sensitivity of a high-risk classification was only 34 percent for predicting SCD events, suggesting that the majority of patients at risk for SCD would have been missed using only the calculator to quantify risk. In contrast, the enhanced 2011 ACC/AHA guideline criteria had sensitivity and specificity of 87 and 78 percent, respectively, suggesting greater likelihood of preventing SCD with an ICD at the expense of slightly higher use of ICDs in patients without SCD events.

         The HCM Risk-SCD model and the conventional risk factors from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines were compared in a cohort of 288 patients (mean age 52 years, 66 percent male, 25 percent with LVOT obstruction ≥30 mmHg) with HCM from a single referral center in the United Kingdom, among whom 14 patients experienced SCD or equivalent (resuscitation from cardiac arrest or appropriate ICD shock for VF or VT &gt;200 beats per minute) over a mean follow-up of 5.6 years [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. Compared with the conventional ACC/AHA risk factors, the HCM Risk-SCD model more accurately predicted low-risk patients who did not require an ICD (220 of 274 patients [82 percent] compared with 157 of 274 patients [57 percent]) but also failed to identify a significantly greater number of high-risk patients who experienced SCD or equivalent (6 of 14 patients [43 percent] compared with 1 of 14 patients [7 percent]).

         The presence of LGE identified on CMR may aid in further risk stratifying patients following calculation of the HCM Risk-SCD score. Among 354 patients with HCM and calculated HCM Risk SCD score suggesting low to intermediate five-year risk (&lt;6 percent), patients with LGE extent ≥10 percent had much higher five-year rates of hard cardiac events including SCD, resuscitated cardiac arrest, appropriate ICD therapies, and sustained VT (23 versus 3 percent) [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In a 2019 meta-analysis which included 7291 patients with HCM (including the original HCM Risk-SCD cohort and five subsequent cohorts), 70 percent of patients were identified as low risk, 15 percent as intermediate risk, and 15 percent as high risk [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. In total, 184 SCD events occurred, with 68 percent occurring in the intermediate and high risk (prevalence of SCD events 1, 2.4, and 8.4 percent in low, intermediate, and high risk groups, respectively). The majority of patients with HCM are stratified as low risk for SCD, but the greatest number of appropriate ICD therapies occur in this low-risk group. Conversely, patients identified as being at high risk of SCD are more likely to receive an appropriate ICD shock, but overall this group receives the lowest number of appropriate ICD therapies. However, proportionally, since the denominator is much larger in low-risk patients, the percentage of patients with ICD shocks is greatest in the high-risk group. This essentially means that, similar to other risk prediction scenarios, the risk score discriminates best those patients with HCM at highest risk for sudden death, but may fail to identify a significant number of patients who have low-risk scores but who are at high risk for sudden death.

         Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are prone to ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmias can range from isolated ventricular premature beats (VPBs) to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) to sustained VT and ventricular fibrillation (VF). While the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias is highly variable, the annual incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the clinically identified general HCM patient population is approximately 1 percent. (See

          'Introduction'

         The presentation of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HCM is highly variable, ranging from an absence of symptoms to palpitations to SCD. Most patients with VPBs or NSVT will be asymptomatic or have intermittent palpitations, while on rare occasions SCD can be the initial presentation of sustained VT or VF. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         Since the underlying abnormal myocardial substrate in HCM can evolve over time, all patients with known or suspected HCM should undergo serial evaluations for SCD risk stratification, including history and physical examination, interim family history, echocardiography, ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring, and exercise testing (on a case-by-case basis). With the emerging role of extensive late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) informing risk assessment, contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) should also be considered. It is reasonable to repeat SCD risk assessment every 12 to 24 months in patients who remain at risk and potentially eligible for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of SCD.
