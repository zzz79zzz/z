         Fluid resuscitation is the mainstay of therapy in patients with severe hypovolemia. Although no clear definition exists, severe hypovolemia may be present when loss of blood or extracellular fluids results in decreased peripheral perfusion. Hypovolemic shock is considered present when severe hypovolemia results in organ dysfunction as the result of inadequate tissue perfusion. In patients with severe hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock, delayed fluid therapy can lead to ischemic injury and irreversible shock with multiorgan system failure.

         Treatment of severe hypovolemia and hypovolemic shock are discussed here. Etiologies, manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion and maintenance fluid therapy are discussed separately. (See

         Management of hypovolemia involves assessing and treating the underlying cause, identifying electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, and assessing and treating the volume deficit, all of which influence the choice of fluid and rate at which it should be administered.

         Clinicians should identify the etiology (or etiologies) contributing to hypovolemia so that therapies can be directed at the underlying cause of volume loss. Potential etiologies of hypovolemia include gastrointestinal, renal, skin, hemorrhage, and third-space losses. Therapies may include anti-emetics to treat vomiting, cessation of diuretics, or controlling bleeding. Further details regarding etiology and diagnosis of hypovolemia are discussed separately. (See

         Biochemical analysis will alert the clinician to electrolyte (eg, hypo- or hypernatremia, hypo- or hyperkalemia) and acid-base disturbances (eg, contraction alkalosis, metabolic acidosis) which may affect choice of replacement fluid and rate of repletion. In some cases, an arterial blood gas may be needed if mixed acid-base disturbance is suspected. (See

         Clinical assessment involves estimating pre- and post-deficit body weight, if known, as well as assessment of clinical and laboratory parameters including the blood pressure, jugular venous pressure, urine sodium concentration, urine output, lactate, and, if bleeding has not occurred, the hematocrit. Ultrasonographic assessment of collapse of the inferior vena cava on inspiration may be useful in some situations. Assessing volume deficit is discussed separately. (See

However, several factors influence the choice between 0.9 percent saline and buffered crystalloids, which are discussed below. (See

The open-label design, lengthy study period (2003 to 2012), and heterogeneity of fluids that were compared between the groups, limit confidence in a possible benefit of colloid solutions in this population.

         ] and hyperchloremic acidosis [normal saline]), as well as institutional and clinician preference. Following initial resuscitation, we have a low threshold to re-evaluate the type of fluid administered depending upon the patient's response and development of adverse effects. As an example, patients with hypernatremia in association with hypovolemia may benefit from fluids with lower concentrations of sodium or supplemental free water, while those with symptomatic acute hyponatremia may benefit from hypertonic saline. Similarly, in patients with hyperchloremic acidosis, buffered crystalloids may be preferred, while 0.9 percent saline may be preferred in those with metabolic alkalosis. Potassium-containing solutions such as Lactated Ringer are traditionally avoided in patients with hyperkalemia; however, data in patients undergoing renal transplantation suggest that Lactated Ringer does not significantly increase the potassium level when compared with normal saline [

         Two major trials reported modest benefit from the use of balanced crystalloids in critically ill and non-critically ill patients. A trial including 15,802 adults in five intensive care units in one institution found that balanced crystalloids (

         solution or Plasma-Lyte A) resulted in a modest reduction in a composite outcome of death from any cause at 30 days, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction, when compared with 0.9 percent

         </a>
         (14.35 versus 15.4 percent), but no significant difference in the rates of the individual components of the outcome were found [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The response was variable among subgroups. For example, a pre-specified analysis of patients with sepsis (who received higher volumes than the median of approximately 1 L) found infusion of balanced crystalloids to be associated with a lower 30-day mortality (25.2 versus 29.4 percent; adjusted odds ratio 0.8, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94), while minimal benefit was seen in other subpopulations. No differences in in-hospital death, ICU- ventilator- or vasopressor-free days, rates of stage-2 or higher AKI, or creatinine levels before discharge were reported. Another parallel trial including 13,347 non-critically ill patients treated in the emergency department and subsequently hospitalized outside the ICU found that compared with 0.9 percent saline, buffered crystalloids did not affect the number of hospital-free days but did result in a modest reduction in the composite outcome of death from any cause, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (4.7 versus 5.6 percent) without significant difference in the individual outcomes [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Although well-conducted, both of these studies were criticized for issues including small median volumes of infusion, heterogeneity of the populations studied, and a response in a composite outcome that was marginal [

         By contrast, two other major trials reported no difference in mortality or AKI when buffered solutions or 0.9 percent

         was used. The first, a two-by-two-factorial-design randomized trial (BaSICS) of over 11,000 critically ill patients, compared fluid resuscitation using either saline or buffered crystalloid solution (in a blinded comparison) and faster versus slower fluid administration (in an open-label comparison) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. Most patients had undergone elective surgery, and the remainder were a mix of medical and emergency surgery patients. No difference was reported for 90-day mortality (26 percent [buffered solutions] versus 27 percent [saline]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.90-1.05), incidence of AKI, or need for replacement therapy [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, giving a fast bolus (999 mL/hour) or slow infusion (333 mL/hour) had no effect on mortality or rate of AKI [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Only small volumes of fluid were administered (1.5 L by first day after enrollment; 2.9 L by day 3), which was equal and supported by similar chloride levels among the groups, a feature that may limit generalizability for patients in whom larger volumes of fluid are administered; thus, whether more aggressive resuscitation measures would have resulted in a difference is unknown. Further confounding the outcome is that two-thirds of patients received more than 1 L of fluid prior to randomization, which may or may not have been the same as that administered during the study. The trial may also have been underpowered to detect a difference since the mortality was lower than that predicted. While a prespecified subgroup analysis reported that patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who were treated with buffered solutions had a higher mortality compared with those treated with saline (31.3 versus 21.1 percent; HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.03-2.12), these data may be explained by the tonicity of the balanced solutions used rather than the anion composition and are hypothesis-generating only.

         In keeping with the above trial, an additional randomized trial of 5037 critically ill patients (almost half of whom had sepsis) reported no difference in the mortality or incidence of AKI among patients treated with either 0.9 percent

         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         . However, the impact of balanced crystalloids ranged from a 9 percent relative reduction to a 1 percent relative increase in the risk of death (risk ratio [RR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.91-1.01), limiting the certainty of the effect. The risk of developing AKI was also reduced (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.02), but the impact on the need for renal replacement therapy was less certain (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81-1.11).

         Colloid-containing solutions are rarely used as first-line resuscitative fluids for the management of hypovolemia and hypovolemic shock not due to bleeding. However, some clinicians advocate the administration of colloid solutions, particularly albumin, in those with limited response to crystalloid solutions or those in whom hypoalbuminemia is thought to be contributing to shock, although data to support these indications are limited. Hyperoncotic starch should, in general, be avoided since its use is associated with an increased risk of kidney dysfunction and mortality. (See

         The use of hyper-oncotic (20 to 25 percent) albumin has been used in individuals with intravascular volume depletion but total body volume overload, such as patients with cirrhosis.

         Following the response to fluid administration is necessary to prevent irreversible shock and to prevent over resuscitation and iatrogenic hypervolemia. Irreversible shock is associated with loss of vascular tone, a drop in systemic vascular resistance, pooling of blood in the capillaries and tissues, an impaired response to vasoactive medications, and multiorgan failure. Clinical parameters including heart rate, blood pressure, urine output, skin turgor, mucus membrane integrity, and mental status should be continuously followed during fluid replacement to assess the efficacy of volume replacement. For most patients, the period of observation lasts for the duration of fluid resuscitation (eg, 6 to 48 hours, longer for ongoing fluid loss). While there are no recommended ideal measurable targets for patients with hypovolemia, many clinicians use parameters extrapolated from patients with sepsis and septic shock (eg, mean arterial pressure 65 to 70 mmHg, no greater than 70 mmHg, urine output &gt;0.5 mL/kg/hour), the details of which are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1613.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Measuring laboratory parameters including chemistries and lactate level within 6 hours and urinary sodium within 24 hours of replacement may also be useful. If, for example, the urine sodium concentration remains below 15 mEq/L (15 mmol/L), then the kidney is sensing persistent volume depletion and more fluid should be given. Use of the urine sodium concentration does
         <strong>
          not

         apply to edematous patients with heart failure or cirrhosis in whom the urine sodium concentration is a marker of effective circulating volume depletion but not of the need for more fluid or more salt.

         In most patients, an immediate clinical response to fluid administration is appreciated by clinical examination and laboratory findings.

         Some patients may show evidence of over resuscitation such as pulmonary edema. Although peripheral edema is a marker of fluid overload, it should not be used as the sole marker for adequate fluid resuscitation or fluid overload since peripheral edema is often due to acute dilutional hypoalbuminemia.

         While most patients respond to fluid resuscitation, some patients demonstrate a poor or no improvement in clinical or biochemical parameters within the first 1 to 6 hours of treatment. Such patients may require additional testing and/or monitoring (to investigate other potential etiologies for shock and to assess for fluid-responsiveness), or an empiric trial of alternative resuscitation fluid such as albumin. Rarely, when hypovolemic shock is refractory to aggressive fluid administration, vasopressors are added to maintain tissue perfusion.

         Fluid management in patients with intravascular hypovolemia who have chronic liver disease is challenging, since most are also total body sodium and fluid overloaded with interstitial edema and/or ascites. In general, these patients should be managed using a similar strategy to that in noncirrhotic patients. However, particular attention needs to be paid to avoiding and managing hyponatremia and to managing third space sequestration with diuresis and paracentesis. The intermittent administration of hyperoncotic (20 to 25 percent) albumin as a resuscitative fluid is poorly studied but used by experts to limit fluid retention in this population [

          General principles
         </strong>
         – Rapid volume repletion is indicated in patients with severe hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock. Delayed therapy can lead to ischemic injury and possibly to irreversible shock and multiorgan system failure. Management of hypovolemia involves assessing and treating the underlying cause, identifying electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, and assessing the volume deficit, all of which influence the choice of fluid and rate at which it should be administered.

          Initial approach
         </strong>
         – For patients with intravascular volume depletion due to bleeding, fluid loss is repleted with blood products, typically packed red cells. Patients may receive fluid replacement with crystalloid (eg, 0.9 percent

         We recommend initial fluid replacement with an isotonic crystalloid solution rather than a colloid-containing solution (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ) based upon the rationale that randomized trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated no consistent clinically meaningful benefit from colloids when compared with crystalloids. (See

          saline
         </a>
         is individualized and informed by factors including patient chemistries, estimated volume of resuscitation, potential adverse effect of the solution used (eg, hyponatremia [

          Lactated Ringer
         </a>
         ], and hyperchloremic acidosis [normal saline]), as well as institutional and clinician preference. The clinician should have a low threshold to re-evaluate the type of fluid administered depending upon the patient's response and development of adverse effects. The rationale for this recommendation is based upon the lack of an ideal standard crystalloid resuscitation solution and data that suggest potential benefit from buffered crystalloids, particularly when large volumes of fluids are administered (eg, &gt;2 L). (See
         <a class="local">

         Colloid-containing solutions are rarely used as first-line resuscitative fluids for the management of non-hemorrhagic hypovolemia and hypovolemic shock. However, some clinicians advocate the administration of colloid solutions, particularly albumin, in those with a limited response to crystalloid solutions or those in whom hypoalbuminemia is thought to be contributing to shock, although data to support these indications are limited.

         For patients with severe hypovolemia and hypovolemic shock, we recommend against the use of hyperoncotic starch solutions due to an increased risk of acute kidney injury and death (

          Grade 1B

         <strong>
          Rate of fluid repletion
         </strong>
         – The rate of fluid repletion should be individualized depending upon the underlying etiology and rate of fluid loss, estimated total body deficit, predicted future losses, and underlying electrolyte abnormalities. While there is no one ideal initial rate, many clinicians model the rate of fluid administration on rates similar to those recommended in patients with sepsis and septic shock, although data to support this strategy are lacking. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial rate of fluid repletion'

         <strong>
          Monitoring the response
         </strong>
         – Clinical parameters including heart rate, blood pressure, urine output, skin turgor, mucus membrane integrity, and mental status should be continuously followed during fluid replacement to assess the efficacy of volume replacement and avoid over resuscitation. Chemistries, lactate, and urinary sodium should also be intermittently followed (within 6 to 24 hours). While there are no recommended ideal measurable targets for patients with hypovolemia, many clinicians use parameters extrapolated from patients with sepsis and septic shock. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring the response'

         <strong>
          Follow-up
         </strong>
         – In most patients, an immediate clinical response to fluid administration is appreciated, such that fluids can be weaned and/or stopped. However, for patients who fail to respond, additional testing and monitoring (to investigate other potential etiologies for shock and/or to assess for fluid-responsiveness), or an empiric trial of an alternative resuscitation fluid such as albumin may be required. Rarely, vasopressors are added in shock refractory to aggressive fluid resuscitation so that tissue perfusion can be maintained. (See

          Special populations
