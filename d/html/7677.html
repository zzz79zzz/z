For the majority of patients with OSA, positive airway pressure (PAP) is first-line therapy. The initiation of PAP therapy requires selection of a mode of PAP (eg, continuous or bilevel PAP) and titration of pressure to reduce and/or eliminate obstructive events to an acceptable level during sleep.</p><p>The titration methods for PAP in patients with OSA are reviewed here. The diagnosis and overall management of OSA, the indications for PAP therapy, and the initial mode selection for PAP titration are discussed separately.

The titration methods used to target the optimal level of PAP are discussed in this topic. Initial mode selection for OSA patients is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99556.html" rel="external">"Mode selection for titration of positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnea"</a>.)</p><p>There are also more technologically advanced PAP devices designed for specific applications. It is uncommon to treat patients with <strong>uncomplicated</strong> OSA (ie, OSA which is not complicated by other respiratory and nonrespiratory disorders that could potentially affect respiration during sleep  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef123023" href="/d/graphic/123023.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121157" href="/d/graphic/121157.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)) with these more advanced (and more expensive) PAP modalities.

Assessing adequacy of the titration module for the selected mode of PAP is different for the mode selected and is discussed in the individual sections below. (See <a class="local">'Adequacy assessment of CPAP titration'</a> below and <a class="local">'Assessment of APAP titration adequacy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Assessment of BPAP-S titration adequacy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Auto-titrating BPAP-S'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">IN-LABORATORY FIXED-LEVEL CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (CPAP)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fixed-level CPAP delivers PAP at a level that remains relatively constant (within 1 to 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) throughout the respiratory cycle. The PAP splints the upper airway open, preventing upper airway collapse or narrowing, during sleep. Patients must be able to initiate every breath while on CPAP. A fixed level of CPAP can be determined using either an in-laboratory polysomnographic (PSG) assessment, which is discussed in this section, or at home by using auto-titrating CPAP (APAP) technology, which is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (APAP)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H975267588"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In-laboratory fixed-level CPAP titration is the gold standard for determining optimal fixed-level PAP for patients with OSA. While fixed-level CPAP was traditionally the first-line treatment for most patients with OSA based upon its efficacy and extensive clinical experience  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102356" href="/d/graphic/102356.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), APAP is being increasingly used as an alternative in select patients with OSA, and has increased even more during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Details regarding the efficacy of CPAP and patient suitability for this mode selection are discussed separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99556.html" rel="external">"Mode selection for titration of positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Initial mode and setting options'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7695.html" rel="external">"Obstructive sleep apnea: Overview of management in adults", section on 'Efficacy'</a>). Choosing between an attended in-laboratory PSG titration and in-home APAP titration is also discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99556.html" rel="external">"Mode selection for titration of positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Factors influencing the setting'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3696938215"><span class="h2">Initial settings and titration during polysomnography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The optimal level of CPAP can be determined in the sleep laboratory using a fixed-level CPAP device during full-night or split-night PSG. Fixed-level CPAP titrated during an attended in-laboratory PSG study is the gold standard method for PAP titration. Detailed protocols are available from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. We suggest the following titration module:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CPAP is started at a low level (eg, 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The amount of CPAP is serially increased (usually in increments of 1 to 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) until evidence of upper airway obstruction is eliminated, allowing at least five minutes at each pressure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The minimal amount of CPAP that consistently prevents upper airway obstruction becomes the fixed CPAP setting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Engaging expiratory pressure relief and humidification may also be necessary during titration for improved tolerance. (See <a class="local">'Intolerance of the sensation of pressure'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The recommended maximum level of CPAP is 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for adults. However, we and the AASM recommend considering transitioning to bilevel PAP in spontaneous mode (BPAP-S) at CPAP levels of approximately 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. (See <a class="local">'Bilevel positive airway pressure, spontaneous mode (BPAP-S)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">What constitutes an optimal titration during PSG is discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Adequacy assessment of CPAP titration'</a> below and <a class="local">'Intolerance of the sensation of pressure'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>While a full-night PSG is ideal and considered the gold standard [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], most patients can be successfully titrated using the same method during a split-night PSG. A split-night study involves an initial diagnostic study that is followed by PAP titration during the second half of the night. The titration is performed only if the diagnostic portion of the study conclusively identifies OSA. However, if more time is needed for OSA diagnosis or adequate CPAP titration is not achieved during the allocated time, or it is apparent that a patient may need BPAP-S instead of CPAP, the patient may need to be brought back on a separate night for another diagnostic study or PAP titration, respectively. Details regarding the diagnostic criteria for OSA during the diagnostic phase of a split-night study and factors that affect the choice between a full- or split-night study are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7706.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults", section on 'Polysomnography'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2784377030"><span class="h2">Adequacy assessment of CPAP titration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the sleep laboratory, during PAP titration (for either continuous PAP [CPAP] or BPAP-S), the goal is to determine the minimal pressure required to resolve all apneas, hypopneas, snoring, and arousals related to these events, in all stages of sleep and in all sleep positions. However, a minority of titrations achieve this goal. Variable levels of PAP titration adequacy are defined by AASM as the following [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Optimal, good, adequate </strong>– This is defined as the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Optimal</strong> – Reduces the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), which includes the respiratory effort-related arousal (RERA) index plus the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), to &lt;5 events per hour for at least 15 minutes; supine rapid eye movement (REM) sleep should not be interrupted by spontaneous arousals or awakenings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Good</strong> – Reduces the RDI ≤10 events per hour or by 50 percent if the baseline RDI is &lt;15 events per hour; supine REM sleep should not be interrupted by spontaneous arousals or awakenings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Adequate</strong> – Does not reduce the RDI ≤10 events per hour but reduces the RDI by 75 percent from baseline (especially in severe OSA patients), or one in which the titration grading criteria for <strong>optimal</strong> or <strong>good</strong> are met with the exception that supine REM sleep did not occur at the selected pressure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients who achieve an "optimal," "good," or "adequate" rating, the patient should receive the fixed-level therapy identified during the titration. However, in practice, suboptimal (ie, good or adequate) titrations are commonly compensated for by using APAP rather than repeating a titration study. This strategy is gaining acceptance and transitions the patient to APAP using settings incorporating a pressure range that allows pressures higher than the previously determined fixed CPAP pressure [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In fact, many durable medical equipment suppliers are routinely delivering APAP devices set to the prescribed fixed CPAP pressure, presumably for issues of cost and convenience (eg, the supplier may only stock one type of device rather than two).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inadequate</strong> – An inadequate titration is one that does not meet adequate, good, or optimal criteria.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For most patients with an "inadequate" titration, an assessment for potential explanations should be performed (eg, mask leak, oronasal issues, intolerant of pressure, pressure &gt;20 cm<sub> </sub>H<sub>2</sub>O required, complex sleep disorder is suspected). We typically repeat in-laboratory titration using the same PAP modality as in the initial titration when the reasons for inadequacy have been addressed. Alternatively, if the patient has uncomplicated OSA (eg, patients with an "inadequate" titration due to inadequate supine or REM duration), we trial APAP (see <a class="local">'Factors that influence initial success'</a> below). For patients in whom higher pressures are required, we sometimes repeat titration with BPAP-S. (See <a class="local">'Bilevel positive airway pressure, spontaneous mode (BPAP-S)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Success or lack thereof of PAP can subsequently be judged by the clinical response and downloaded data from the treatment device, as measured by the respiratory event index (REI). If the REI indicates control of the patient's OSA but the clinical response is not concordant, we typically proceed with repeat in-laboratory PSG [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99556.html" rel="external">"Mode selection for titration of positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Follow-up after initial titration'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97878.html" rel="external">"Downloading data from positive airway pressure devices in adults", section on 'Assessing effectiveness'</a>.)</p><p>Measurement of the REI is a ubiquitous feature of modern flow generators. The REI, which is an AHI "estimate," is calculated by device software (also sometimes known as known as AHI<sub>flow</sub>) that measures changes in airflow. Manufacturers label residual event frequencies as AHIs on data downloads from their PAP devices despite the fact that the correct metrics are REIs. It is important that the clinician understand the distinction between the REI derived from device downloads and the AHI obtained from PSG; the latter is computed not just from flow data but also from associated declines in oxyhemoglobin saturation and/or electroencephalographic evidence of arousal. By contrast, the REI is determined by proprietary algorithms and hardware platforms that differ between manufacturers. In the uncommon situation when REI values obtained on the same patient but derived from different manufacturer's devices are compared, the clinician should take into account this possible source of imprecision [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Data comparing the two are limited, but some studies suggest good correlation if the PSG AHI is either very high or lower than 10 events per hour [<a href="#rid5">5,7,8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97878.html" rel="external">"Downloading data from positive airway pressure devices in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Further details on assessment after the initial titration are provided separately. (See <a class="local">'Factors that influence initial success'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99556.html" rel="external">"Mode selection for titration of positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Follow-up after initial titration'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">AUTO-TITRATING CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (APAP)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>APAP devices deliver continuous PAP (CPAP) at varying levels; higher pressure for when more is needed and lower pressure for when less is needed. APAP devices utilize proprietary algorithms to <strong>detect</strong>  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132343" href="/d/graphic/132343.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) and <strong>resolve</strong> obstructive events during sleep and can therefore be used not only to determine an optimal fixed level of CPAP (see <a class="local">'Titration'</a> below) but also to treat OSA (even if a fixed pressure is identified by fixed-level titration in the laboratory). APAP is not a diagnostic modality and is designed primarily for in-home use. Similar to CPAP, patients must be able to initiate every breath while on APAP.</p><p>When APAP is used to treat OSA, the average pressure delivered by the device is generally lower than that used during treatment with fixed-level CPAP, which may lead to better tolerance of treatment [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>].</p><p>Event-detection software provides estimates of the respiratory event index (REI), hours of use, and presence or absence of an air leak. Based on this information, algorithm software varies the level of PAP to treat device-detected events and compensate for leaks. The REI is a device-calculated corollary of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the latter of which is measured during polysomnography (PSG). Since algorithms are proprietary, treatment efficacy may vary among individual devices. Data that support APAP as a treatment modality are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99556.html" rel="external">"Mode selection for titration of positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Uncomplicated obstructive sleep apnea'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1298880391"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>APAP titration or treatment is suitable for patients in whom a diagnosis of moderate to severe uncomplicated OSA is made (ie, OSA which is not complicated by other respiratory and non-respiratory disorders that could potentially affect respiration during sleep  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef123023" href="/d/graphic/123023.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121157" href="/d/graphic/121157.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102356" href="/d/graphic/102356.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>)). Data to support this strategy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99556.html" rel="external">"Mode selection for titration of positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Uncomplicated obstructive sleep apnea'</a>.)</p><p>Other patients in whom APAP titration is considered an option include patients with mild OSA, patients who are intolerant of the pressure associated with fixed-level CPAP (ie, APAP is used as a pressure-relief strategy), patients with known variable pressure requirements (eg, significantly higher pressures required when supine, intermittent use of alcoholic beverages near bedtime, exacerbations of allergic rhinitis), and patients in whom access to a sleep laboratory is not feasible (eg, during the COVID-19 pandemic, denied by insurance, or excessively inconvenient due to distance).

As with all auto-titrating devices, if the clinical response diverges from the device-reported REI, we also typically perform in-laboratory monitoring with the patient's own device at its usual settings.

Common to all auto-titrating devices, auto-titrating BPAP-S devices use proprietary algorithms to determine optimal settings that reduce device-detected obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and more minor degrees of obstruction (eg, snoring) to an acceptable level.</p><p>Several BPAP-S flow generators are available in the United States and their algorithms differ with respect to how they deal with obstructive apneas and hypopneas. For example, one brand of flow generator operates with a fixed level of pressure support (PS; inspiratory PAP [IPAP] minus expiratory PAP [EPAP]) and titrates both IPAP and EPAP simultaneously to deal with the entire spectrum of obstructive events. By contrast, another brand of flow generator titrates both IPAP and EPAP separately: EPAP is titrated to eliminate frank obstructive apneas and IPAP to eliminate lesser degrees of obstructive events. Although EPAP and IPAP are auto-titrated independently, PS is constrained within limits set by the prescriber.</p><p>There remain limited efficacy data to help guide clinicians in the use of auto-titrating BPAP-S. Two small randomized trials of unselected patients using auto-titrating BPAP-S showed similar efficacy as measured by polysomnography (PSG) [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. One employed the variable PS device but with a minimal PS range (maximum of 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) compared with continuous PAP (CPAP) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]; the other used the competitor's flow generator set to a fixed PS of 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O versus a comparison group using fixed BPAP-S [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Both studies demonstrated equal efficacy in terms of initial improvement of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) but one study suggested that it was not maintained [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. It should be noted that the variable PS device used in the latter study appears to have employed expiratory pressure relief as well as auto-titration. Some studies have employed auto-titrating BPAP-S to treat a subgroup of patients with poor compliance with other PAP modalities or patients with no improvement in AHI on CPAP [<a href="#rid17">17,23-25</a>]. Results were mixed; compliance was better at 10 weeks in one study [<a href="#rid23">23</a>] and similar in two other trials after long-term follow-up [<a href="#rid17">17,25</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – We offer a trial of auto-titrating BPAP-S to OSA patients who do not tolerate or fail fixed- or auto-titrating CPAP (APAP) or fixed BPAP-S [<a href="#rid26">26-28</a>]. We also sometimes use auto-titrating BPAP-S devices as a form of "pressure-relief" (ie, reducing the uncomfortable sensation of breathing against high pressure from a fixed-level device).

The optimal approach and empiric initial settings for auto-titrating BPAP-S devices are unclear, as there is a paucity of data and few validated algorithms to help guide clinicians with these devices. One reported approach, limited to the flow generator that allows for the setting of a PS range, arbitrarily sets the minimal EPAP at 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, maximal IPAP at 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and maximal PS at 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, allowing the device's proprietary algorithms to titrate the pressures to resolve obstructive events [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].

This REI is based on continuous indirect monitoring of airflow and is not equivalent to the AHI derived from PSG, since it relies only on decreases in airflow to determine the presence of an event. Ideally, the settings for auto-titrating BPAP-S should be done in an attended in-laboratory setting, so that the response can be measured by PSG and an actual AHI obtained. In that way, adequacy can be measured in a manner similar to that described for fixed-level CPAP.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, we have increasingly observed that auto-titrating BPAP-S is deployed using empiric settings without first confirming effectiveness in the sleep laboratory. When this is done, it is necessary to rely on the REI reported by the device to determine adequacy of treatment. Recently, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) has issued a guideline approving the use of home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) for follow-up of some patients treated for OSA [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, the guideline did not clearly state that HSAT should be done concurrently with the use of PAP. If HSAT using unmodified type 3 devices is used for this purpose, it might be necessary to rely on the chest and abdominal effort signals to identify<strong> </strong>respiratory events. We have not seen such use reported in the literature. However, we discovered that it is possible to fashion a cable that allows routing of the flow signal from a patient's PAP device to the flow channel on the type 3 HSAT device used in our laboratory. This allowed us to successfully score events based on actual PAP airflow while the patient used their PAP treatment at home. To our knowledge, this technique has not been previously reported but could possibly be employed depending on the particular HSAT device and PAP flow generator being used. Devices monitoring peripheral sympathetic tone to identify respiratory events could also be used for this purpose, and are supported by two studies [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. There is no guidance from the AASM for this possible strategy.

Nasal and oronasal masks are the commonly used interfaces. In general, most patients do not tolerate nasal pillows if continuous PAP (CPAP) or inspiratory PAP (IPAP) is above 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O due to the discomfort of excessive turbulent airflow directly impacting the nasal mucosa. Oral interfaces are rarely used but may be helpful in certain situations if nasal or oronasal interfaces cannot be tolerated. Full facemasks are rarely used.</p><p>A relatively new development is the availability of "minimal-contact" masks, which fit under the nose and over the mouth. They allow the patient to wear glasses, if necessary, and the patient can read, watch television, or use personal computing devices while in bed. Although these activities in bed are generally to be discouraged, it can be difficult to convince patients to follow these basic precepts of sleep hygiene. In our experience some patients fail to achieve adequate compliance with PAP treatment because they fall asleep, without their PAP, while engaging in these activities. The solution is to prescribe a minimal-contact mask and instruct them to wear their PAP, with the flow generator on, while engaging in these activities. In that way they are already using PAP when they do fall asleep. In addition, these interfaces are less bulky than conventional facemasks and seem to be better at staying in place with movement during sleep.</p><p>Patients should be encouraged to try several different interfaces during PAP titration. We typically prefer the interface that offers the best mix of comfort and efficacy is prescribed (ie, the most comfortable mask is not always the best fitting and the best-fitting mask is not always the most comfortable) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. However, trials of different interfaces may be necessary for the patient at home even after the seemingly best-fitting interface and optimal level of PAP have been determined in the laboratory or sleep clinic. In reality, the optimal interface varies from patient to patient and often is not the interface used during a laboratory titration. Many patients try a variety of interfaces before the optimal model and size are identified, leading most clinicians to conclude that the best interface is "the one the patient will use."</p><p>Pressure requirements may vary depending on the interface such that retitration may be needed when switching interfaces. For example, pressure requirements may be higher if an oronasal interface is used when compared with a nasal or nasal pillows interface [<a href="#rid39">39-42</a>]. In addition, for oronasal masks, pressure requirement varies depending on whether the patient preferentially breathes through the nose or mouth. While some evidence suggests that higher residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and more leaks occur with the use of oronasal masks compared with nasal masks [<a href="#rid40">40,43</a>], one randomized controlled trial reported no difference in the residual AHI or compliance between these interfaces [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2203578850"><span class="h2">Intolerance of the sensation of pressure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with OSA who specifically complain of discomfort caused by exhaling against PAP, we suggest a trial of pressure relief and/or the application of a pressure ramp. Alternatively, switching to an auto-titrating device is also reasonable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2475707701"><span class="h3">Pressure relief</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pressure relief involves lowering the delivered pressure during expiration in order to prevent the discomfort that some patients report when breathing out against PAP. This feature is available on CPAP, auto-titrating CPAP (APAP), bilevel PAP in spontaneous mode (BPAP-S), and auto-titrating BPAP-S (auto-BPAP-S) devices. However, it is important for the prescriber to understand how pressure relief is implemented by different manufacturers and in different models of flow generators by the same manufacturer. Options are as follows [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Brief reduction in CPAP or expiratory PAP (EPAP; BPAP-S flow generators) at the start of exhalation followed by a return to full pressure before the start of inspiration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduction in CPAP or EPAP during the entirety of expiration (alternatively described as adding a small degree of pressure support [PS] to IPAP, simulating a BPAP-S device).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>BPAP-S, with or without expiratory pressure relief.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Auto-titrating BPAP-S, either with or without a fixed level of PS or PS that will auto-titrate within a small range of pressures.</p><p></p><p>However, all of these approaches are subject to change by the manufacturer, with little oversight by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or notice to the medical community. PAP devices were designated in 2018 as class II devices by the FDA under rule 510(K), which means that if modifications are made, the flow generator must only be considered substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device (section 513[i][1][A] FD&amp;C Act) [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p>The actual settings for any given device do not necessarily correspond to a fixed amount of pressure decrease, and therefore the selection can be somewhat arbitrary. For some devices, the mapping of a given setting to a given decrease in pressure is proprietary to the manufacturer, and may vary with the treatment pressure(s). For others, the degree of expiratory pressure relief may be chosen from values built into the flow generator.</p><p>In the case of laboratory titrations, the technologist usually determines whether to use pressure relief and at what setting; in our experience, the maximum setting is commonly (but not always) chosen since the goal is to perform a successful titration. This is best achieved when patient comfort with PAP is maximal.</p><p>In actual practice, there are few data to suggest that treatment efficacy varies with pressure relief setting regardless of which manufacturer's flow generator is prescribed.</p><p>One study examined the effects of various pressure relief strategies using a testing apparatus that used a Starling resistor to simulate sleep-disordered breathing [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. This study examined a selection of flow generators from different manufacturers and identified the best setting(s) during an initial titration without pressure relief. They then instituted various pressure relief settings while maintaining the best titrated pressure(s). Instituting several of the pressure-relief mechanisms resulted in loss of control of the simulated sleep-disordered breathing. However, the Starling resistor is not a perfect model of the upper airway [<a href="#rid47">47</a>], and bench testing results may not be transferrable to the clinical arena. Nevertheless, we suggest that when in-laboratory titrations are used to determine treatment settings, the pressure relief setting determined during the laboratory titration should be replicated when treatment is prescribed. If pressure relief is initiated during the course of treatment, we are limited to using the respiratory event index (REI) reported by the PAP device to determine whether effectiveness is maintained. Similarly, if treatment is instituted with APAP at home, the REI must be closely monitored if pressure relief is later instituted or its setting changed.</p><p>A beneficial impact of routinely applying pressure relief on adherence has not been proven in randomized trials when compared with either conventional CPAP [<a href="#rid48">48</a>] or APAP [<a href="#rid49">49</a>] without pressure relief. This was best demonstrated by a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials (514 patients with OSA, mean AHI &gt;30 events per hour of sleep) that compared CPAP with pressure relief with conventional CPAP [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. The meta-analysis found no differences in adherence, sleepiness, or vigilance when pressure relief was used compared with patients who had PAP without pressure relief.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H598688698"><span class="h3">Pressure ramp</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A pressure ramp initiates PAP delivery at a low level (usually 4 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and then progressively increases the PAP to the prescribed level over a duration designated by the clinician (usually 5 to 45 minutes). This feature serves as a comfort measure, allowing the patient to fall asleep before reaching the higher pressures that might interfere with sleep onset. The pressure ramp can be restarted at any time and is available with CPAP and BPAP devices, whether fixed or auto-titrating. There are no published data indicating that a ramp feature augments acceptance or adherence with CPAP, although many clinicians routinely prescribe a pressure ramp. Noteworthy is that prescribing an APAP setting with a lower limit of 4 (or even 6) cm H<sub>2</sub>O basically provides the same feature since the device will start at the lower pressure limit and not increase the pressure until events are detected.</p><p>Ramp abuse refers to repeated activation of the ramp feature, usually at the beginning of the night, if the patient is still awake when the pressure ramps up to a level that is perceived as preventing sleep. This behavior, which can also occur during nighttime awakenings, can diminish the effectiveness of therapy [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. We address ramp abuse by appropriate patient education or by any of the measures that improve patient comfort with PAP therapy. We sometimes repeat titration if there is suspicion that the ramp abuse is indicative of a therapeutic pressure target that is too high. We also sometimes change from a nasal mask to an oronasal mask when there is suspicion that the ramp abuse is the result of discomfort associated with the stronger force of flow from a nasal mask.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1852366352"><span class="h3">Auto-titratable or other device</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients in whom pressure intolerance is an issue and in whom pressure relief or pressure ramping have not resolved the issue, we sometimes switch to an auto-titratable device (eg, APAP) on a trial basis. One meta-analysis of 64 studies reported that pressure modification by switching to APAP resulted in approximately 13 more minutes of usage per night at six weeks [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. However, the AHI scores were lower in patients on fixed-level CPAP and the effects on daytime sleepiness scores were no different. (See <a class="local">'Auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (APAP)'</a> above.)</p><p>Rarely, switching to a bilevel device is needed, in which case we repeat an in-laboratory titration.

[<a href="#rid52">52,53</a>]. This is especially true in the southwest of the United States due to a climate low in humidity, but also can occur in other locations during cold weather. Home heating invariably lowers indoor humidity unless a room humidifier is used or the heating system incorporates humidification.</p><p>Heated humidification decreases the nasal resistance by approximately 50 percent, whereas cold humidification has almost no impact on resistance because it does little to raise the relative humidity of the PAP airflow [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. Heated humidification is particularly important in patients who have undergone uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, as PAP airflow tends to be more irritating due to the altered postoperative anatomy [<a href="#rid54">54-56</a>]. In theory, reduced nasal resistance from heated humidification may improve the comfort and effectiveness of PAP delivered via nasal mask or nasal pillows. However, clinical studies have not consistently found such benefits [<a href="#rid54">54,55</a>], and heated humidification may only improve adherence in those with nasal dryness [<a href="#rid51">51,57,58</a>].</p><p>Many devices allow for the specification of heated humidification that may be fixed or adaptive. In the latter, the degree of heated humidification can be increased, reduced, or turned off at will by the patient or clinician. In addition, the tubing that connects the flow generator to the patient interface can be specified as either simple, unheated tubing or tubing that incorporates electrical heating wires  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef132347" href="/d/graphic/132347.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). Heated tubes reduce condensation or "rain out" of water that can occur when humidified PAP air flows through an <strong>un</strong>heated tube. Heated tubes can be set to a fixed temperature controlled by the patient, or can be set to adapt the temperature according to specific algorithms aimed at maintaining a warm flow of air through the tube. External insulation of PAP tubing with cloth or other material may also reduce "rain out," but the availability of heated tubing has for the most part replaced this strategy.</p><p>Ideally, the humidifier reservoir is full at bedtime and is almost empty in the morning. This means the maximum amount of humidification is being supplied. However, some patients aren't comfortable with this degree of humidity and prefer lower settings, or even turn the heat to zero.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H266506988"><span class="h3">Nasal congestion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nasal congestion is a common problem that may pre-exist or be precipitated by PAP therapy [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. Airflow resistance is higher when nasal congestion is present. This can impair comfortable breathing through the nose, thereby negatively impacting adherence. It may also impede PAP delivery to the upper airway and ameliorate upper airway collapse during sleep.</p><p>For nasal congestion, we typically administer a topical nasal glucocorticoid, antihistamine or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8570" href="/d/drug information/8570.html" rel="external">ipratropium</a>, or prescribe an oral antihistamine [<a href="#rid60">60-62</a>]. Switching from a nasal to an oronasal mask may also be helpful, allowing the positive pressure to be delivered through the mouth if nasal patency is compromised [<a href="#rid63">63,64</a>]. While some patients find oronasal masks less tolerable than nasal masks [<a href="#rid65">65</a>], in our experience most patients tolerate these well and benefit from the avoidance of mouth leaks and dependence on nasal patency. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7532.html" rel="external">"Chronic nonallergic rhinitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7526.html" rel="external">"Pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3104675826"><span class="h3">Mouth breathing and air leaks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who breathe through their mouths while asleep or who are unable to keep their mouth closed against the PAP are likely to develop a mouth leak when PAP therapy is initiated through a nasal interface. A mouth leak exists when the airflow delivered through the nose exits through the mouth instead of reaching the more distal oropharyngeal airway. Air leak through the mouth may present as oral dryness. We typically use a chin strap that holds the mouth closed to eliminate mouth leaks [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. However, in patients who continue to have a mouth leak despite a chin strap, we typically switch to an oronasal mask [<a href="#rid63">63-65</a>].</p><p>Air leaks via the mask may be improved by switching to a better-fitting mask.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2721467604"><span class="h3">Claustrophobia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Claustrophobic patients may find nasal pillows less intimidating than other interfaces. Alternatively, we have patients undergo a trial of mask desensitization [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. During desensitization, the patient wears the mask while awake, initially for a short period while relaxing (eg, reading or watching television). Once comfortable, we encourage the patient to wear the mask for progressively longer periods, with the goal of incrementally increasing the patient's tolerance of the mask and of positive pressure so that it can be worn at night during sleep.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2887059776"><span class="h3">Altitude compensation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although pressure levels induced by earlier generations of PAP devices decrease significantly at higher altitudes and reduce efficacy [<a href="#rid68">68</a>], newer generations of PAP devices typically include an altitude compensation feature as standard. Thus, altitude compensation is not usually a consideration when choosing a device. However, should a patient insist on using an older flow generator, altitude compensation should be confirmed if the device pressure is set at an altitude lower than that at which the patient resides, or if the patient customarily sleeps in locations at different altitudes [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. Some older flow generators are equipped with a manual control that the patient can set to compensate for changes in altitude, but this method is inconvenient and the accuracy of the compensation is questionable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1706597493"><span class="h3">Others</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other factors that influence success include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Facial hair – Patients with a mustache or beard may experience excessive leakage with nasal masks or full facemasks, respectively, in which case nasal pillows can be employed, if shaving their facial hair is not an option. Given the wide range of interfaces now available  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef132345" href="/d/graphic/132345.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>), it is usually possible to identify an interface that will work despite facial hair.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cosmetic issues – Some patients may complain that the interface headgear disturbs their hair style or leave imprints on the skin of their face.

In our experience, nasal pillows are often the easiest to take on and off. With any interface, the patient may experience difficulty replacing the interface when sleep is interrupted for bathroom breaks or other reasons. In this case we instruct patients to simply disconnect the distal end of the tubing from the PAP device rather than trying to remove and replace the interface itself.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aerophagia - A chin strap may reduce aerophagia. Aerophagia may also be improved by switching to an APAP device (or rarely BPAP) because it lowers the mean pressure, although this strategy may not improve compliance [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. We have had success with the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10264" href="/d/drug information/10264.html" rel="external">simethicone</a> over-the-counter products taken at bedtime, and during the night during awakenings if necessary. Theoretically, asking the patient to sleep in the left lateral decubitus position, which places the gastroesophageal junction in a superior position to the stomach, may help also, although to our knowledge there are no studies supporting this strategy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intimacy – We discuss in advance how to employ PAP therapy in a manner that has limited interference with intimacy or sexual activity (eg, engaging in sex prior to initiating CPAP treatment).

Device settings have traditionally been identified during a laboratory polysomnography (PSG), but select patients are candidates for auto-titrating continuous PAP (APAP) or bilevel PAP in spontaneous mode (BPAP-S). The goal of any titration is to determine the minimal pressure(s) required to resolve all apneas, hypopneas, snoring, and arousals related to obstructive events, in all stages of sleep and in all sleep positions.
