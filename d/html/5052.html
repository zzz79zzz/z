         Apnea of prematurity is a developmental disorder in preterm infants that is a consequence of immature respiratory control. Apnea of prematurity is most widely defined as cessation of breathing for more than 20 seconds, or a shorter respiratory pause associated with oxygen desaturation and/or bradycardia in infants who are younger than 37 weeks gestation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The frequency of symptoms is inversely proportional to gestational age (GA), and almost all infants with a GA less than 28 weeks are affected.
        </p>

         The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical presentation of apnea of prematurity are reviewed here. The management of apnea of prematurity is discussed separately. (See

         Apnea is classified as central, obstructive, or mixed depending on the presence of continued inspiratory efforts and upper airway obstruction.

         Most apnea spells in preterm infants are central or mixed. This was illustrated in a study of physiologic recordings of 2082 apneic episodes in 47 infants: 40 percent of episodes were central, 50 percent were mixed, and 11 percent were obstructive [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         Periodic breathing episodes are characterized by a pattern of alternating breaths and brief respiratory pauses. Although descriptions vary, periodic breathing is usually defined as repetitive cycles of breathing and respiratory pauses that are approximately 5 to 10 seconds in duration. These pauses may be accompanied by modest oxygen desaturation and bradycardia that do not require clinical intervention. Periodic breathing is common in preterm infants. It needs to be differentiated from apnea of prematurity as it does not require intervention.

         ]. As a result, the cause of apnea in term infants should be assumed to be pathologic and can include hypoglycemia, seizure disorder, infection, severe birth asphyxia, intracranial hemorrhage or stroke, drug depression, and micrognathia with obstruction of the airway. (See

         Moderately preterm infants – In a multicenter study, apnea was diagnosed in 50 percent of infants born between 33 and 34 6/7 weeks gestation based on documentation in the medical record [
         <a href="#rid4">

         ]. Persistent apnea was associated with longer hospitalization. However, there was a wide range in the rate of apnea among the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) as the criteria for diagnosing apnea varied. The authors speculated that the true incidence of apnea was underestimated because of underreporting of events. This underestimation of events by nursing documentation has been confirmed by ongoing cardiorespiratory monitoring [

         </span>
         Apnea of prematurity is a developmental disorder that reflects physiologic immaturity rather than a pathologic process. In fetal life, gas exchange occurs via the placenta, and respiratory muscle activity is intermittent. At delivery, the change to postnatal life requires continuous respiratory muscle activity to sustain gas exchange. However, the mechanisms underlying the transition from intermittent to continuous breathing are not fully understood. It is thought that apnea of prematurity is due to disruption of these developmental ventilation control processes due to immaturity resulting in impaired respiratory drive and/or failure to maintain airway patency.

         In preterm infants, the immaturity of breathing responses affects all levels of respiratory control, including central and peripheral chemosensitivity and inhibitory pulmonary neuronal signal [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Based on limited data from physiologic studies in preterm infants and animal studies, the following observations have been made regarding the pathogenesis of central respiratory drive impairment in preterm infants with apnea [

         In the fetus, respiratory activity is decreased due to descending inhibition from higher brain mechanisms (ie, above the brainstem) and from the low fetal arterial partial pressure of oxygen (approximately 25 mmHg). After preterm delivery, these mechanisms appear to persist until the infant is able to developmentally adapt to the extrauterine environment.

         A (yet to be determined) genetic component appears to be associated with apnea of prematurity, as illustrated by the higher concordance rate of apnea among monozygotic preterm twin pairs compared with same sex dizygotic twins (87 versus 62 percent) [

         Hypoxia – Increase in ventilation in response to hypoxia is almost exclusively dependent on feedback from carotid body peripheral chemoreceptors situated in the thorax. Preterm infants have a biphasic response to hypoxia with an initial increase (hyperventilation) and subsequent decrease in inspiratory efforts (hypoventilation and sometimes apnea) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>

         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Although adults may also exhibit a biphasic ventilatory response to hypoxia, the degree of respiratory depression (following the initial increase in ventilation) is not as severe.

         Decreased peripheral chemosensitivity in response to hypoxia may delay recovery from apnea. As noted above, the normally low fetal PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         results in decreased fetal respiratory activity. With the fourfold increase in oxygen levels at birth, the peripheral chemoreceptors, which have adapted to the low fetal oxygen levels, are initially unresponsive until a subsequent increase in their sensitivity to extrauterine oxygen levels. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to this maturation remain unclear.

         Increased peripheral chemoreceptor responses to hypoxia have also been shown to destabilize breathing in preterm infants and contribute to periodic breathing [

          17

         thresholds are very close in preterm infants, and frequent oscillations in breathing elicited by increased peripheral chemosensitivity may drive the eupneic PaCO

         Inhibitory upper airway reflexes – Activation or stimulation of inhibitory upper airway reflexes (also referred to as the laryngeal chemoreflex) may contribute to the pathogenesis of apnea, although the mechanism is poorly understood. This reflex appears to be mediated through irritant receptors in the larynx. The reflex response evolves from apnea and bradycardia in early postnatal life to protective coughing and swallowing with advancing maturation. In newborn animal models, for example, milk from a different species or water instilled in the airway resulted in decreased ventilation or apnea [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. In human infants, prolonged hypopharyngeal suctioning or aspiration of small volumes of milk also may induce this apneic response [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. However, no temporal relationship has been demonstrated between apnea of prematurity and gastroesophageal reflux. (See

         Viral infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may also enhance this apneic response, which is a common manifestation of RSV infection. In addition, upper respiratory infection may cause edema and obstruction of the airway. (See

         Nasal obstruction – Newborn infants depend upon a patent nasal airway for adequate ventilation because neonates are obligate or preferential nose breathers [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, apnea may be precipitated by intermittent nasal obstruction from swelling that may occur in association with excessive suctioning or with prolonged use of nasogastric tubes.

         Laryngeal and tracheal abnormalities – The larynx and trachea are less common sites of mechanical airway obstruction because these rigid structures are less likely to collapse than the hypopharynx. Nevertheless, mild obstruction caused by laryngeal edema, vocal cord dysfunction, tracheal stenosis, or laryngeal and/or tracheal malacia can precipitate apnea in some cases.

         Apnea may become evident in the first two to three days after birth or beyond the first week in preterm infants who are breathing spontaneously. Breathing pauses usually are accompanied by bradycardia and hypoxemia [

         In infants who are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, episodic desaturation and bradycardia are also quite common and are manifestations of ineffective ventilation and possibly cardiorespiratory reflex responses to airway stimulation by an endotracheal tube [

         For infants with later episodes of apnea after the first few weeks of life or who present with recurrent apnea, the cause of apnea may be due to a serious underlying pathologic condition such as sepsis. These infants require a thorough evaluation to determine if there is a precipitating cause, which may be treatable. (See

         Apnea of prematurity typically resolves before 37 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) in infants delivered after 28 weeks gestation. In contrast, in infants born before 28 weeks, apnea frequently persists until term PMA [

This was best illustrated in a study that included 443 preterm infants (gestational age [GA] ≤34 weeks) that demonstrated significant cardiorespiratory events were rare beyond 43 weeks PMA and occurred no more frequently in the preterm group than in healthy term infants [

         The diagnosis of apnea of prematurity is considered when either a respiratory pause greater than 20 seconds or a shorter respiratory pause accompanied by oxygen desaturation and/or bradycardia is detected in an infant with a gestational age (GA) less than 37 weeks. These events are typically identified by the routine use of cardiorespiratory monitors and/or pulse oximeters for preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Because apnea occurs in most infants born below 28 weeks gestation and in over half of more mature preterm infants, all preterm infants should be monitored for apnea. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Incidence'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the diagnosis of apnea of prematurity is a diagnosis of exclusion. Other causes of apnea need to be considered and eliminated before the diagnosis of apnea of prematurity can be conclusively made. This is especially true for any preterm infant in whom there is a recent onset of apnea following a time period without apneic events. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'

         Neonatal cardiorespiratory monitors utilize impedance technology to measure respiration, which only measures chest wall motion. This technology is only effective to diagnose central apnea, and the use of these apnea monitors will miss mixed apnea, which is frequently associated with upper airway closure and continued respiratory muscle activity and obstructive apnea. Monitoring heart rate and oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter provides additional data to ensure that infants with both mixed and obstructive apnea that result in significant decreases in heart rate or percent of oxygenated hemoglobin measured by pulse oximetry (SpO

         Heart rate monitoring is important in the detection of apnea of prematurity, since bradycardia usually accompanies apnea of prematurity. The decreased heart rate is thought to be a reflex response. The most frequent reason for persistent cardiorespiratory alarms in preterm infants is short respiratory pauses (&lt;15 seconds) associated with bradycardia [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. While many centers have traditionally set bradycardia alarms at &lt;80 beats per minute (bpm), we have lowered alarm settings to 70 bpm in convalescing preterm infants to decrease the frequency of alarms without apparent adverse effects. This approach is supported by the observation that isolated bradycardia is unlikely to adversely affect cerebral oxygenation [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31
         </a>
         ]. However, there are no data that determine the optimal threshold alarm setting for bradycardia.

         Pulse oximeters are used as a frequent adjunct to cardiorespiratory monitors in the NICU. As with bradycardia alarms, they provide an additional safety measure for respiration monitors. Typically, the alarms are set at &lt;85 or &lt;80 oxygen saturation. The incidence and depth of oxygen desaturation episodes after apnea are dependent on pulmonary oxygen stores and baseline level oxygen saturations levels [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. As many preterm infants have low lung volumes associated with residual lung disease and a very compliant chest wall, they are vulnerable to frequent and deep falls in oxygen saturation with relatively short respiratory pauses. The time interval for the determination of the average oxygen saturation can be adjusted. A longer averaging time will smooth out the signal and decrease the number of short alarms [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ], but may transform repetitive short desaturations into a falsely longer episode [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. In addition, patients with pulmonary hypertension are predisposed to desaturation during a respiratory pause.

         Oral feeds – Apnea of prematurity must be distinguished from the hypoxemia, cyanosis, and bradycardia sometimes associated with the introduction of oral feedings in preterm infants. These changes in color and heart rate occur commonly before 34 to 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) as a result of ineffective coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing, which may cause impaired ventilation. These events may persist in some neonates to 38 weeks PMA [

         Apnea of prematurity is a developmental disorder in preterm infants that occurs as a direct consequence of immature respiratory control.

         Apnea of prematurity is most widely defined as cessation of breathing for more than 20 seconds or a shorter respiratory pause associated with oxygen desaturation and/or bradycardia in infants who are younger than 37 weeks gestation. Apnea is classified as central, obstructive, or mixed depending upon the presence of continued inspiratory effort and upper airway. In preterm infants, most apnea spells are classified as either being central or mixed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Apnea'
         </a>
         above.)

         The incidence of apnea is inversely proportional to gestational age (GA), and almost all extremely preterm infants (GA &lt;28 weeks) are affected. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Incidence'
         </a>
         above.)

          ●
         </span>
         Although the exact mechanisms underlying apnea of prematurity are unknown, it is thought to be due to disruption of ventilation control processes due to immaturity that results in impaired central respiratory drive and/or inability to maintain upper airway patency. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathogenesis'
         </a>
         above.)

         Apnea of prematurity typically presents within the first few days of life, and occasionally beyond the first week, in affected preterm infants who are not mechanically ventilated. It typically resolves before 37 postmenstrual weeks in infants delivered after 28 weeks gestation, but in infants born before 28 weeks, apnea frequently persists until 43 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). (See
         <a class="local">

         The diagnosis of apnea of prematurity is considered when either cessation of breathing greater than 20 seconds or a shorter period of respiratory pause accompanied by oxygen desaturation and/or bradycardia is detected. These events are typically identified by the routine use of cardiorespiratory monitors and/or pulse oximeters for preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Although apnea of prematurity is the most common cause of apnea in preterm infants, it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Other causes of apnea need to be considered and eliminated before the diagnosis of apnea of prematurity is made. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'

         The goal of the diagnostic evaluation is to identify any underlying cause (eg, sepsis). The evaluation is based on a comprehensive history and assessment of the infant, and laboratory testing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation to determine cause of apnea'
