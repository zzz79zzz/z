         Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) is a rare disorder in which anaphylaxis occurs in association with physical exertion. In most patients, symptoms only develop if a certain food is eaten in close approximation to physical exertion or other cofactors are present, which is commonly called food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA). The clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of EIA and FDEIA are discussed in this topic review. Management and prognosis are presented elsewhere. (See

         Anaphylaxis, from any cause, is defined as a serious allergic or hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death [

         <strong>
          Food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA)
         </strong>
         – FDEIA is a disorder in which symptoms develop only if exercise takes place within a few hours of eating and, in most cases, only if a specific food to which the patient is sensitized is eaten in the pre-exercise period. It is the combination of the food (allergy) and exercise (cofactor) that precipitates attacks. Patients tolerate the culprit food in the absence of exercise, and they tolerate exercise in the absence of the culprit food. One of the most common food allergies to present as FDEIA is wheat allergy, or wheat-dependent EIA (WDEIA).

         The term FDEIA, although familiar to allergy specialists, is problematic for at least three reasons:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Research in the pathophysiology of FDEIA has shown that, although exercise is the most common and consistent cofactor in FDEIA, symptoms can also be elicited by other cofactors, particularly alcohol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, even at rest [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7
         </a>
         ]. Thus, symptoms are not strictly dependent on exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Some patients do not develop full anaphylaxis but experience only urticaria and/or angioedema from the combination of the culprit food and other cofactors. Therefore, anaphylaxis is not the only presentation.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The disorder is primarily a form of food allergy, but one in which signs and symptoms only develop when certain other exposures are present. The term FDEIA does not capture the essential nature of the underlying food allergy.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, the term
         <strong>
          cofactor-dependent food allergy
         </strong>
         would be a more accurate and descriptive term. Although we prefer this term, we use FDEIA in this topic review because it is the better-recognized term at present.

         EIA (food dependent or independent) is characterized by signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis in the setting of physical exertion  (

         Although stopping activity counteracts the progression of the attack, patients often do not instinctively stop exertion when they first develop the disorder. Instead, many try to run for help or "push through" early symptoms, which typically precipitates a dramatic worsening of symptoms. Patients should be educated about the importance of immediate cessation of activity as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. (See

         A 2022 systematic review identified 722 patients with food-dependent exercise-induced allergic reactions, in which 83 percent experienced anaphylaxis and 17 percent developed only urticaria and/or angioedema [

         The frequency and predictability with which symptoms occur vary among patients with EIA and FDEIA. Most patients exercise regularly but experience attacks only occasionally. A minority of individuals experience symptoms with most attempts at exercise. Still other patients have one or two attacks over a span of several years, although such infrequent attacks should prompt a careful evaluation for undetected cofactors. (See

         Vigorous forms of exercise, such as jogging, racquet sports, playing football or soccer, dancing, and aerobics, are most often implicated, although lower levels of exertion (eg, brisk walking or yard work) are capable of triggering attacks in some patients [

          3,4,15,16

         The foods most commonly implicated in FDEIA are wheat, other grains, and nuts in Western populations and wheat and shellfish in Asian populations; however, an array of culprit foods has been reported, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, legumes, and, less often, various meats, cow's milk, and egg [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,22-35
         </a>
         ]. Wheat (66 percent), vegetables (9 percent), seafood (9 percent), legumes (7 percent), and fruits (6 percent) accounted for the most common culprit foods in a systematic review [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. For some foods, the responsible component allergens or epitopes have been reported [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,36-43
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The amount of food ingested is important, and clinical threshold levels for gluten have been determined for use in designing challenge protocols [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,5,11,44
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients develop symptoms only after eating a specific food, although a few have attacks if any food (usually solids rather than liquids) has been ingested [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. Rare patients have been described in whom symptoms only occurred if two or more foods were eaten together before exercise [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,16,46
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The processing of the food may be critical in some cases. In one report, a patient developed FDEIA with tofu but could tolerate soy milk [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Immunoblotting identified beta-conglycinin as the main allergen. Pepsin digestion readily degraded the beta-conglycinin in soy milk, but the same allergen in tofu was resistant to pepsin digestion, suggesting that this difference in allergen stability was fundamental to the patient's presentation. In another study, nine patients were described who developed anaphylaxis only to the hydrolyzed wheat protein Meripro 711 in a cake mix [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Skin prick tests and serum levels of Meripro 711-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E were positive in all patients. However, they tolerated ingestion of regular nonhydrolyzed wheat products (eg, bread or pasta) on a regular basis.

The association between EIA and food intake was not recognized in the first decades after the disorder was identified, and it is possible that many of these early cases of EIA were actually FDEIA. In addition, recognition of FDEIA is increasing. In a Hong Kong series of patients referred for the diagnosis of "idiopathic anaphylaxis," 16 of 29 cases had FDEIA [

         The specific physiologic changes and/or cellular events that occur during exercise to trigger mast cell activation are not fully understood. A 2015 expert panel concluded that none of the current theories was adequate and recommended that a global research network be established to advance the field [

Of note, the vast majority of publications in the last decades describe cases of FDEIA, with EIA unrelated to food reported much less commonly. Thus, it is probable that many of the early cases of EIA were actually FDEIA, in which the association with food intake was not recognized. Failure to recognize the association with food may also partly explain the commonly made observation that identical episodes of exercise trigger symptoms on one occasion and not on others [

         In patients with FDEIA, anaphylaxis may be triggered even at rest by ingestion of much higher amounts of the specific food allergen than normally ingested in daily life [

          3,5,11
         </a>
         ]. Thus, the distinction between food allergy and FDEIA may primarily be an increased reaction threshold in FDEIA as compared with simple food allergy, rather than invoking a different pathogenesis. Because patients with FDEIA are sensitized to the culprit food but tolerate ingestion in the absence of cofactors, theories of pathogenesis have focused on changes that occur during exercise or upon exposure to other cofactors, which could overcome or reverse this tolerance:

         Gastric permeability can increase during exercise, which may permit increased entry of intact or incompletely digested allergens into the circulation during exercise but not during rest [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,51,81,82
         </a>
         ]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and alcohol, which are recognized cofactors in FDEIA reactions, also increase gastric permeability [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,83,84

         Another theory posits that the shifts in blood flow that normally occur with exercise (ie, away from the stomach, intestines, and other intra-abdominal organs and toward the heart, skeletal muscles, and skin) allow food allergens to reach a different population of mast cells that may be more reactive to the food in question than mast cells residing in the gut [

         FDEIA may also develop during the course of oral immunotherapy (OIT) as responsiveness is reduced but not eliminated. In patients undergoing OIT to foods such as wheat, egg, or milk, the presence of various cofactors (eg, exercise or illness) can lead to breakthrough symptoms [

          92

Exercise was a more common contributor to moderate or severe symptoms than to mild symptoms. In another study of patients allergic to wheat and receiving wheat OIT, exercise-induced allergic reactions were reported in 14 out of 21 patients (67 percent) who eventually achieved desensitization. Eleven patients (52 percent) reported exercise-induced allergic reactions even five years or longer after stopping OIT [

         Wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) is the best-studied form of FDEIA and a relatively severe form of food allergy.

          31,37,77,97

          95,96,99

        </p>
        <p>
         Many patients who initially present with WDEIA will develop symptoms at rest if enough wheat is ingested or yet-unknown relevant cofactors (eg, stress) are also present [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,11
         </a>
         ]. The necessity of exercise was brought into question in a 2015 study of patients with WDEIA. In this study, 16 patients who tolerated wheat ingestion at rest and had positive in vitro tests for immunoglobulin (Ig)E to omega-5 gliadin were challenged with increasing amounts of a bread made with pure gluten flour, alone or combined with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         , alcohol, and exercise [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Gluten flour contains 35 mcg of omega-5-gliadin per mg gluten flour, which is a more than tenfold increase in the concentration of this major allergen compared with normal bread flour. In 14 of 16 patients, objective reactions (most commonly urticaria) could be elicited without exercise, using various combinations of larger amounts of pure gluten flour bread, aspirin, and alcohol. These findings demonstrate that exercise is simply another cofactor for the clinical expression of an underlying food allergy and is not an absolute requirement for symptoms. Another interesting finding in this study was that gastric and intestinal permeability in patients with FDEIA, as measured by absorption of nondigestible sugars, increased after the cofactors aspirin and alcohol in patients with positive challenge results and after exercise in healthy control subjects but did not correlate with plasma gliadin levels, indicating that intestinal permeability to small molecules is greater than permeability to peptides or proteins, and evaluation of the latter is a more appropriate measure in the assessment of allergen absorption.
        </p>

         A 2018 study using a very similar protocol confirmed the earlier study and demonstrated that exercise increased the severity of wheat-induced anaphylaxis and lowered the threshold for developing symptoms but was not an absolute requirement in many cases [

         The amount of gluten ingestion required to produce symptoms in the absence of exercise or other cofactors is typically more than would normally be consumed at one time, likely explaining why most patients do not have symptoms in the absence of cofactors. Specifically, the amount of gluten required to elicit symptoms without other cofactors in this cohort was equivalent to that found in one kilogram of bread made with normal flour.

         The diagnosis of EIA or food-dependent EIA (FDEIA) is most often made clinically, based upon a meticulous history of the events surrounding the episodes. However, the diagnosis is often delayed. In a retrospective series of 132 patients with wheat-dependent EIA (WDEIA), diagnosis was delayed one to five years in 40 percent and more than five years in 29 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Typically, patients present with episodes of warmth/flushing and urticaria during exertion, which progress to involve more severe symptoms over time. In EIA, no symptoms occur without exercise. In FDEIA, ingestion of large amounts of the food alone may occasionally produce symptoms, and other cofactors may augment symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other cofactors'

         above.)

         The diagnosis also requires exclusion of other disorders that could present similarly. (See

         A positive food/exercise challenge confirms the diagnosis, but a negative challenge with the same exercise intensity ± culprit food does not reliably exclude the diagnosis. Sometimes high doses of food allergen (eg, using concentrated gluten) and cofactors are necessary to reproduce symptoms. For WDEIA, a protocol for exercise challenge has been designed and validated, but it is labor-intensive and requires heart-rate controlled ergometer equipment [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         Was exercise, some type of exertion, or other cofactors associated with each of the attacks? If not, then the patient with food-associated symptoms may have a primary food allergy with symptoms that are exacerbated by exercise. (See

         In patients with FDEIA, skin testing and/or in vitro testing for food-specific IgE is essential to the evaluation because sensitization to the precipitating food(s) is usually demonstrable, with rare exceptions [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients may not be aware of the relationship to food, because they normally eat the food without reaction, and, thus, an argument can be made for testing for food-specific IgE to foods commonly involved in FDEIA even if the patient is not suspicious of this association [
         <a href="#rid102">
          102
         </a>
         ]. However, the clinical history can usually limit the list of possible causative foods.
        </p>
        <p>
         If testing for food sensitization is negative but the history is strongly suggestive of FDEIA, we suggest the following:

         In patients with suspected WDEIA, there are several additional measures that may demonstrate an underlying wheat allergy. If testing using commercial extracts is negative, testing with high-gluten flour (also called vital wheat gluten) mixed into
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">
          saline
         </a>
         to form a paste may reveal the allergy. This is available in specialty baking stores or online. In a study of 16 patients with WDEIA, all 16 subjects reacted to skin testing with high-gluten flour, while 15 reacted to regular wheat flour, and 8 reacted to commercial wheat extract [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In another study with 47 challenge-positive patients with WDEIA, skin testing with raw wheat (regular wheat flour) was positive in 94 percent (44 of 47) and to vital wheat gluten in 96 percent (45 of 47) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If skin testing with gluten flour is not possible or is negative and WDEIA is strongly suspected based upon the history, a commercially available serum-specific IgE assay for IgE to omega-5 gliadin should be performed. The sensitivity of this assay was found to be 80 percent in a study of 50 Japanese patients with positive wheat/exercise challenges, making this immunoassay more clinically useful than those for wheat, gluten, or other wheat allergens [
         <a href="#rid103">
          103
         </a>
         ]. IgE to omega-5 gliadin may be positive even when IgE to wheat is negative [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,104
         </a>
         ]. In some cases of WDEIA, it may not be possible to demonstrate sensitization to the full food allergen source (eg, wheat extract or native wheat) but only to molecular allergens (eg, omega-5-gliadin, Tria19) or gluten. In the study of 17 German patients with WDEIA mentioned previously, 82 percent had IgE to omega-5 gliadin, although other allergens (alpha, beta, and gamma gliadins or lipid transfer protein Tri a14) might be also important, as demonstrated with experimental assays [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31,97

However, because the intent of this study was to determine if exercise was absolutely required for reactions, patients were challenged sequentially with and without exercise and other cofactors. Patients ingested between 10 and 80 grams of gluten, which elicited symptoms in four patients. Another 10 subjects required wheat ingestion plus premedication with 500 to 1000 mg of

         These studies indicate that large amounts of gliadin (as present in pure gluten flour) may be needed to induce a reaction or, alternatively, more typical amounts in daily life in conjunction with a cofactor. Exercise and other cofactors may reduce the reaction threshold and increase the symptom severity. It remains to be determined why such measures are necessary to elicit symptoms in a laboratory challenge but apparently not in the patient's routine life. It is possible that other cofactors (eg, emotional stress) must also be present for symptoms to develop and that these have not yet been identified.

          Cholinergic urticaria
         </strong>
         – Cholinergic urticaria is a form of physical urticaria characterized by small punctate wheals (1 to 3 mm in diameter) with surrounding erythema  (

          picture 1

         ). Urticaria is elicited by raising the core body temperature. Patients may experience symptoms with exercise but also upon exposure to factors that passively increase body temperature, such as hot showers or saunas, very strong emotion, or very spicy food. Symptoms of cholinergic urticaria are usually limited to the skin, although generalized symptoms can occur if cutaneous mast cell mediators are released in sufficient amounts and diffuse into the systemic circulation [
         <a href="#rid106">
          106-108

          "Physical (inducible) forms of urticaria", section on 'Cholinergic urticaria'
         </a>
         ). By contrast, the wheals of EIA are usually large (10 to 15 mm in diameter). This distinction is not true in all cases, and the punctate wheals of cholinergic urticaria may enlarge and coalesce as symptoms progress.

A formal food challenge should be performed to determine tolerance if the patient cannot report tolerating portion-sized amounts of the food in question in the absence of exercise SINCE the last episode of anaphylaxis. In light of new developments in the pathogenesis of FDEIA, it is possible that FDEIA is actually a subclinical form food allergy that only results in symptoms in the presence of additional cofactors (exercise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], alcohol, physical or emotional stress).

          Definitions and terminology
         </strong>
         – Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) is a disorder in which anaphylaxis occurs in response to physical exertion. In the majority of patients, symptoms only develop if exercise takes place within a few hours of eating a specific food to which the patient is allergic, but the food allergy is asymptomatic unless there is associated exertion. This is called food-dependent EIA (FDEIA). A more accurate term for FDEIA would be "cofactor-dependent food allergy" because research has demonstrated that there are cofactors other than exercise that can lower a patient's threshold for developing symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Terminology'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Signs and symptoms
         </strong>
         – Typical manifestations of EIA and FDEIA include generalized pruritus, warmth, flushing, urticaria and angioedema, and sudden fatigue, progressing to gastrointestinal symptoms, upper airway obstruction, and collapse in some cases. Symptoms usually begin during exercise or just after stopping exercise. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Possible cofactors
         </strong>
         – Cofactors other than exercise may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcoholic beverages, infections and other illness, high pollen levels, extremes of heat and humidity, and menstrual status in some women. These factors can lower a patient's threshold for developing symptoms during exercise and worsen the severity of symptoms. In research protocols of FDEIA, mild symptoms can also be elicited by exceedingly high doses of the food allergen, even without exertion. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other cofactors'

         <strong>
          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Both EIA and FDEIA are rare. The food-dependent form is more common and increasingly recognized. Adolescents and young adults account for most reported cases, although both EIA and FDEIA have occasionally been described in young children and older adults. EIA and FDEIA are usually sporadic, although familial cases have been reported. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Pathogenesis
         </strong>
         – The specific physiologic changes and/or cellular events that occur during exercise to trigger the development of symptoms in EIA are not fully understood. FDEIA appears to be a subtype of food-induced anaphylaxis, in which the patient is normally tolerant of the food, but the addition of exercise and/or other cofactors causes a breakdown in this tolerance. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Theories of pathogenesis'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Evaluation and diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of EIA/FDEIA is usually based upon the clinical history and exclusion of other disorders. In patients with suspected FDEIA, allergen-specific IgE to the food in question should be demonstrable. Exercise challenge is not required for the diagnosis, but a positive challenge can be useful in confirming the diagnosis. A negative challenge does not reliably exclude the diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation and diagnosis'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The differential diagnosis of EIA includes cholinergic urticaria, systemic mastocytosis, cardiovascular events, exercise-induced asthma, and exercise-associated laryngopharyngeal reflux. The differential diagnosis of FDEIA additionally includes primary food allergy exacerbated by exercise. (See
