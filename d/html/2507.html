Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females; however, the incidence varies markedly. Country-specific incidence rates are available through the World Health Organization (WHO) <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgco.iarc.fr%2F&amp;token=papEJRwmxEbzVq8Z5Cy8HpHRmuU6GAJR2OxnHjUvdx0%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2507" target="_blank">GLOBOCAN database</a>.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the management and prognosis of primary colon cancer. Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, and diagnosis are addressed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2606.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2496.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of colon cancer is usually made by colonoscopy.

The stage of a colon cancer has three components, primary tumor (T), status of the regional nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M), which together are combined to form stage groupings from I to IV. Stage groupings permit the stratification of prognosis, which is useful for the selection of treatment. The T, N, and M categories for colon cancer are assigned based upon:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whether there are signs of cancer spread on physical examination or radiographic imaging tests</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Findings from surgical resection and histologic examination of the resected tissues</p><p></p><p>The current combined American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging for colorectal cancer (eighth edition, 2017) is illustrated in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>TNM staging for colorectal cancer is discussed in more detail elsewhere, and colon cancer prognosis, stratified according to stage, is discussed in more detail below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2484.html" rel="external">"Pathology and prognostic determinants of colorectal cancer", section on 'TNM staging'</a> and <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17949181"><span class="h1">THE CLINICAL STAGING EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pretreatment clinical staging is best accomplished by physical examination (with particular attention to ascites, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy), computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest imaging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2496.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer", section on 'Clinical staging evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17949425"><span class="h2">Radiographic imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with newly diagnosed invasive colon cancer, preoperative chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans can demonstrate regional tumor extension, regional lymphatic and distant metastases, and tumor-related complications (eg, obstruction, perforation, fistula formation), findings that may assist in selecting the therapeutic approach. An important point is that the finding of isolated liver or lung metastases on preoperative studies may not necessarily alter the surgical approach to the primary tumor, particularly in patients who are symptomatic from bleeding or impending obstruction. (See <a class="local">'Metastatic disease'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2495.html" rel="external">"Locoregional methods for management and palliation in patients who present with stage IV colorectal cancer", section on 'Management of the primary cancer'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary colon cancer", section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The necessity of preoperative abdominal/pelvic CT for all patients with colon cancer is controversial, as is the clinical benefit of a staging chest CT. Nevertheless, the standard practice at most institutions is that all patients with stage II, III, or IV colon cancer undergo chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT either prior to or following resection, an approach that is endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fjournal%2Fannals-of-oncology&amp;token=vdCs7dqmABYrTYLl86e3UDwt2BFE9AyeKZI%2FKeB1WiFTufLwrax5osV2NsSW%2BHKz7ozkdwxIKZlPXkaoknS5Rw%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2507" target="_blank">European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)</a>. It is generally preferable to obtain these scans prior to, rather than after, operation, as the scan results will occasionally change surgical planning.</p><p>Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver might identify more hepatic lesions than are visualized by CT and may be indicated to further define the extent of disease in patients who have suspected liver metastases on CT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2496.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer", section on 'Liver magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) scans do not appear to add significant information to CT scans for routine preoperative staging of colon cancer. PET scan may be helpful for patients who are thought to be candidates for resection of isolated colorectal cancer liver and lung metastases, in whom the routine use of PET reduces the number of nontherapeutic laparotomies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/115954.html" rel="external">"Hepatic resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis", section on 'Positron emission tomography'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7815.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Benefits, indications, preoperative evaluation, and techniques", section on 'PET scans'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17949195"><span class="h2">Tumor markers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of tumor markers have been associated with colon cancer, especially carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Serum CEA levels should be obtained preoperatively in patients with colon cancer, particularly as an aid to post-treatment follow-up. Elevated preoperative CEA levels that do not normalize following surgical resection can imply the presence of persistent disease and the need for further evaluation. Serum CEA should <strong>not</strong> be used as a screening test for colon cancer due to low sensitivity and specificity for early stage disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2496.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer", section on 'Tumor markers'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17949202"><span class="h2">Colonoscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ideally, each patient should have visualization of the entire colon prior to surgery. Colonoscopy serves to localize the tumor, provide a tissue diagnosis, characterize the lesion as mucosal or submucosal, and evaluate the patency of the lumen, the presence of extrinsic colonic compression, and synchronous carcinomas and adenomas. Synchronous invasive colorectal cancers are found in 3 to 5 percent of cases, while the prevalence of synchronous adenomas is as high as 30 percent.</p><p>If full colonoscopy cannot be performed prior to elective colon resection because of obstruction or poor preparation, a <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9180" href="/d/drug information/9180.html" rel="external">barium</a> enema, or (preferably) CT or magnetic resonance colonography can be used to evaluate the entire large bowel. Alternatively, the entire residual colon can be examined colonoscopically after resection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2496.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer", section on 'Colonoscopy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17949245"><span class="h2">Family history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A family history of colorectal and other extracolonic cancers (going back three generations if possible, but at least first- and second-degree relatives) should be sought, as the patient may be a member of a kindred with a hereditary predisposition. This finding could alter the surgical approach, prompting consideration of subtotal or total colectomy in high-risk individuals. (See <a class="local">'Genetic issues'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86140.html" rel="external">"<i>MUTYH</i>-associated polyposis", section on 'Colonic manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>However, use of family history alone is not sufficient to identify most patients with a hereditary colon cancer syndrome, particularly Lynch syndrome. Clinical practice guidelines from ASCO and others recommend testing of all colorectal cancers, independent of stage and age, for loss of mismatch repair protein expression (the underlying defect in Lynch syndrome) or microsatellite instability, the biologic consequence of mismatch repair protein deficiency [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Genetic issues'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Tumor characteristics'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17948781"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF LOCALIZED DISEASE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Surgical resection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 80 percent of cancers are localized to the colon wall and/or regional nodes. Surgery is the only curative modality for localized colon cancer. The goal of surgery for invasive cancer is complete removal of the tumor, the major vascular pedicle, and the lymphatic drainage basin of the affected colonic segment  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64156" href="/d/graphic/64156.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Surgical procedures for treatment of primary colon cancer are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary colon cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Restoration of bowel continuity using a primary anastomosis can be accomplished in most patients undergoing an uncomplicated colectomy. However, a temporary proximal diverting colostomy or ileostomy may be necessary in cases of diffuse peritonitis or free perforation if the patient is medically unstable or, sometimes, for an obstructing left-sided colon cancer, although this is controversial. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary colon cancer", section on 'Colonic obstruction'</a>.)</p><p>Laparoscopic-assisted colectomy, rather than open colectomy, is favored for patients with nonobstructed, nonperforated, non-locally advanced colon cancers who have not had prior extensive abdominal surgery. In experienced hands, appropriately selected patients have comparable oncologic outcomes, comparable perioperative morbidity and mortality, and faster recovery with laparoscopic as compared with open surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary colon cancer"</a>.)</p><p>There are reports that robotic surgery has been performed safely for colon cancer, but there are no randomized trials comparing this approach with either laparoscopic or open colonic surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary colon cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7619375"><span class="h3">Older adult patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgery for colon cancer (including laparoscopic resection [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]) should not be denied simply based on age. A comprehensive geriatric assessment may be useful in formulating an appropriate, individualized treatment plan for the older adult patient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2808.html" rel="external">"Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Specific issues surrounding the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in older adult patients are discussed elsewhere.

Benign adenomas, as well as those with severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ (no evidence of invasive cancer, defined as invasion into the submucosa), can be effectively managed by endoscopic removal (polypectomy) alone as long as the resection margins are free of cancer. Endoscopic resection is also a reasonable alternative to radical surgery for selected favorable-risk early stage colon cancers arising in a polyp. The presence of any of the following factors should prompt consideration of radical surgery, as they indicate a higher risk of residual cancer and/or nodal metastases [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary colon cancer", section on 'Malignant polyp'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For both pedunculated and nonpedunculated (sessile) polyps:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Poorly differentiated histology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lymphovascular or perineural invasion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tumor budding (foci of isolated cancer cells or a cluster of five or fewer cancer cells at the invasive margin of the polyp).

Most patients with localized, resectable colon cancer should undergo upfront surgery, followed by adjuvant systemic therapy as clinically indicated. However, it may be appropriate to evaluate selected patients for neoadjuvant therapy, such as those with locally advanced tumors and potentially compromised surgical margins, or those with medically inoperable tumors. This position is consistent with consensus-based guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which in 2016 included neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a treatment option for patients with bulky nodal disease or clinical T4b  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) colon cancer [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. They are also consistent with updated guidelines on management of colon cancer from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p>However, randomized trials have shown mixed results regarding the long-term benefits of neoadjuvant therapy compared with upfront surgery [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. An unresolved problem is what criteria to employ preoperatively to select patients with locally advanced tumors that are not amenable to a complete (R0) resection with upfront surgery. Ideally, patients who are being evaluated for neoadjuvant therapy should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials, where available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2503.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy for nonoperable metastatic colorectal cancer: Selecting the initial therapeutic approach"</a>.)</p><p>For patients with locally advanced colon cancer, neoadjuvant systemic therapy is associated with several potential advantages:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early administration of systemic therapy may reduce the risk of micrometastases</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduction of the primary tumor can facilitate surgical resection</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Better compliance with systemic therapy when it is delivered preoperatively</p><p></p><p>Neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemoradiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, rather than initial surgery, is an accepted approach for locally advanced <strong>rectal</strong> cancer that is supported by data from randomized trials. Increasingly, "total neoadjuvant therapy" approaches are used in clinical practice, which utilize all planned systemic chemotherapy plus chemoradiotherapy in the preoperative setting to maximize the number of patients receiving chemotherapy in the context of curative resection and to downstage the rectal cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2468.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma"</a>.)</p><p>The following data are available on the benefits of neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced <strong>colon</strong> cancer.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> – Observational studies suggest that perioperative chemotherapy is safe and does not worsen postoperative complications [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>].

Nomograms for overall and progression-free survival based on several of these clinicopathologic factors have been developed that can assist in aiding prognostication and patient-clinician communication; however, they do not include tumor location or MSI status and only apply to patients who are not candidates for or do not undergo metastasectomy [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17950079"><span class="h1">POST-TREATMENT SURVEILLANCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following potentially curative treatment for a stage II or III colon cancer, post-treatment surveillance usually consists of periodic history and physical examination, with serial assay of the serum concentrations of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), annual surveillance computed tomography (CT) scans, and colonoscopy to detect metachronous adenomas and primary tumors. Guidelines are available from several groups and are compared and contrasted in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91618" href="/d/graphic/91618.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Whether or not post-treatment surveillance is needed after resection of a stage I colon cancer is controversial, and the guidelines differ on this point  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91618" href="/d/graphic/91618.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). However, most recommend only periodic history and physical examination and colonoscopy.</p><p>The rationale for and evidence supporting these guidelines are discussed elsewhere, as are issues that arise in long-term survivors of colon cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14230.html" rel="external">"Approach to the long-term survivor of colorectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17950156"><span class="h1">GENETIC ISSUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although most colorectal cancers are sporadic, specific genetic disorders have been identified, most of which are autosomal dominant, that are associated with a very high risk of developing the disease. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; 90 percent risk of colorectal cancer by the age of 45 in the absence of prophylactic colectomy) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]; lifetime risk of colorectal cancer 25 to 75 percent) are the most common of the familial colorectal cancer syndromes, but together these two conditions account for fewer than 5 percent of cases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2606.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer", section on 'Hereditary CRC syndromes'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2593.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Lynch syndrome is more common than FAP and accounts for approximately 2 to 3 percent of all colonic adenocarcinomas. The term "Lynch syndrome" is now commonly used for families who have been genetically determined to have a disease-causing defect (inherited or de novo) in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The biologic footprint of a defect in MMR capacity is microsatellite instability (MSI), detected by polymerase chain reaction. Testing of all colorectal cancers is routinely used to help establish the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. Some institutions perform MSI testing and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing for MMR protein expression (which are absent when a disease-causing genetic defect is present) in colorectal cancers in young patients (diagnosed prior to age 50 years) or in those who meet the Bethesda criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72965" href="/d/graphic/72965.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). However, increasingly, universal testing of all colorectal cancers for MSI or loss of MMR protein expression by IHC is performed, a practice that is supported by guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and the United States Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Absence of MSI and intact expression of all four MMR proteins on IHC rules out Lynch syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although over 90 percent of Lynch syndrome-related colorectal cancers will demonstrate MSI, 15 percent of sporadic colorectal cancers also have MSI. Thus, the finding of MSI in a colorectal cancer does not indicate Lynch syndrome but, instead, identifies those patients who should be referred for additional testing (IHC or germline mutational testing).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For individuals with evidence of high MSI (MSI-H) or loss of expression of an MMR protein by IHC, further evaluation is based on the MSI/IHC results and is outlined in the suggested algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef130015" href="/d/graphic/130015.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Absence of protein expression of MLH1 and PMS2, MLH1 alone, or PMS2 alone (which is rare) may be associated with either sporadic or inherited disease. If these proteins are not expressed in a tumor, the next step is analysis of <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation or analysis of methylation of the MLH1 promoter. The presence of a <em>BRAF </em>mutation suggests sporadic rather than inherited disease, and there is no need to refer for genetic testing. If there is methylation of the MLH1 promoter and no <em>BRAF </em>mutation, then a disease-causing genetic defect should be considered, as 5 to 10 percent of these patients may harbor a germline mutation [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>On the other hand, loss of expression of MSH2 alone, MSH2 in combination with MSH6, or MSH6 alone is highly specific for a disease-causing germline defect, and referral for genetic testing (for the genes corresponding to the absent proteins) is appropriate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15804.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Biallelic somatic mutations in the MMR genes also can explain MSI in the tumors of patients where there is no germline mutation noted in the MMR genes.</p><p></p><p>Extracolonic cancers are very common in Lynch syndrome, particularly endometrial carcinomas, which may occur in up to 60 percent of female mutation carriers in some families. Other sites at increased risk of neoplasm formation include the ovaries, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary system, brain, renal pelvis or ureter, and sebaceous neoplasms of the skin, such as sebaceous adenomas or carcinomas. Periodic screening is recommended by expert groups. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15804.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management", section on 'General measures'</a>.)</p><p>The development of one or more of these cancers in a family member of a colon cancer survivor may prompt consideration for genetic testing. Family history is seldom updated regularly during follow-up. However, regularly updating a three-generation family history pedigree from cancer survivors can be valuable to help determine the potential risk of cancer in family members, as well as the survivor's own risk of subsequent cancers that may be associated with a previously unrecognized hereditary syndrome.</p><p>Importantly, the identification of MSI-H/deficient MMR also identifies patients with metastatic colon cancer who might be candidates for treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129349.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy for nonoperable metastatic colorectal cancer: Approach to later lines of systemic therapy", section on 'Microsatellite unstable/deficient mismatch repair tumors'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H37"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF LOCALLY RECURRENT DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Selected patients with locally recurrent colon cancer can be cured, typically with multimodality therapy. Prognostic factors for outcome in patients with recurrent colon cancer were addressed in a large database series of 17,381 patients who were enrolled in 18 randomized phase III trials testing adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II or III colon cancer conducted mainly before 2000 in the era when treatment was mainly limited to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (FU) [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. The median survival of all patients experiencing a recurrence was 13 months. Survival was significantly better in patients with initial stage II rather than stage III tumors (median 18 versus 13 months), in those with a longer disease-free interval, and in those who did not receive FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of the primary tumor.</p><p>Although there are no prospective trials to guide therapy, the management of these patients is typically multidisciplinary and may include chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, or intraoperative radiation therapy in addition to surgery. While guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] recommend six months of adjuvant chemotherapy after resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases, they do not address the utility of chemotherapy after resection of a local recurrence. The decision must be individualized and is based in part on whether adjuvant therapy (particularly an oxaliplatin-containing regimen) was administered previously.
