ADAMTS13 activity is typically undetectable. This condition is also called congenital TTP (cTTP), inherited TTP, familial TTP, and Upshaw-Schulman syndrome [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ADAMTS13</strong> – The protease that cleaves ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1331.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)", section on 'Deficient ADAMTS13 activity'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms</strong> – Minor or transient abnormalities, such as headaches, lethargy, abdominal discomfort, transient loss of attention, and/or brief syncope, are described as symptoms. Often, they have no clearly defined times of onset or resolution. That they are caused by hTTP is supported by their resolution in response to plasma therapy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exacerbation</strong> – More severe illness, often presenting suddenly and often related to a precipitating event, such as pregnancy and the turbulent circulation in newborn infants, is described as an exacerbation [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Episode</strong> – While this term is used for immune TTP, it is generally avoided for hTTP because hTTP patients have a lifetime illness, often with ongoing symptoms without a defined onset or resolution. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2621328"><span class="h1">GENETICS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inheritance of hTTP (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fomim.org%2Fentry%2F274150&amp;token=87jLzclRwWxNoI%2BQq5Gg77HC%2BKf7ulEAjoSWBIDhZjtp8em4ixg%2BGUwPY9Prc9sz&amp;TOPIC_ID=101504" target="_blank">OMIM #274150</a>) is autosomal recessive. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pathogenic variants affecting both alleles of the <em>ADAMTS13</em> gene are required to cause deficiency severe enough to lead to the clinical syndrome. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals who are heterozygous for an <em>ADAMTS13</em> pathogenic variant (only one allele affected) do not appear to be at risk for clinically apparent TTP during pregnancy or other settings that can precipitate TTP exacerbations in patients with biallelic <em>ADAMTS13</em> variants.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, heterozygous individuals have lower baseline ADAMTS13 activity and may have increased risk for certain disorders. This was illustrated in observations from the Rotterdam study, which evaluated cardiovascular outcomes in nearly 6000 healthy individuals 55 years of age or older. Those with ADAMTS13 activity in the lowest quartile of the normal range had a higher risk of stroke (7.3 percent, versus 3.8 percent in the highest quartile; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.65, 95% CI 1.16-2.32) and increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. </p><p></p><p>More than 200 pathogenic variants in <em>ADAMTS13</em> have been described [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. These include insertions, deletions, missense and nonsense point mutations, and splice site mutations [<a href="#rid2">2,3,9,10</a>]. These are cataloged by the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fttpregistry.net%2F&amp;token=VEYs6REUOvbP0Un19sKXqun%2FQbl5dJk8xTIxl90ITCM%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=101504" target="_blank">Hereditary TTP Registry</a>, which has enrolled over 140 patients and family members from 17 countries in America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Pathogenic mutations are spread throughout the <em>ADAMTS13</em> gene [<a href="#rid2">2,3,10</a>]. Most are private (confined to single families). </p><p>Siblings with the same genotype can have strikingly different clinical features. In one family enrolled in the Hereditary TTP Registry, a patient had recurrent strokes beginning at age 17 years, while her younger brother, who was healthy, was discovered to have absent ADAMTS13 activity and the same genotype at age 33 years. </p><p>Genotype-phenotype analyses have demonstrated inconsistent correlations between specific pathogenic variants and clinical features. However, genotypes associated with some residual ADAMTS13 activity, such as a common mutation in the United States and Europe, R1060W, may be associated with less severe disease and/or later age of presentation than genotypes associated with absent ADAMTS13 activity [<a href="#rid3">3,9,12</a>]. </p><p>Residual ADAMTS13 activity is only weakly correlated with age at diagnosis and severity of symptoms, indicating that other factors modify disease phenotype [<a href="#rid3">3,10</a>]. Other modulators of clinical phenotype may include physiologic stresses such as birth, pregnancy, or infections, as well as other unidentified genetic factors. </p><p>Additional discussion of ADAMTS13 function and its role in preventing microvascular thrombosis is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1331.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)", section on 'TTP pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2621342"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>hTTP is very rare in adults (&lt;5 percent of all TTP; one per one million population) but is more common than immune TTP in infants and young children.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Overall</strong> – In our overall experience, hTTP represents &lt;5 percent of all TTP cases. The prevalence is often described as one patient per one million population. In the Oklahoma TTP Registry, representing a population of 2.4 million people, we have identified only one family in 26 years [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Three daughters in this family have hTTP, a prevalence of 1.25 patients per one million people. During this same period, 92 patients with immune TTP have been identified. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A population-based cross-sectional study using medical records in one health district in Norway discovered a much higher prevalence, with 17 individuals affected per one million population [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The prevalence of the R1060W mutation in this Norway district was 0.3 to 1 percent, suggesting that the prevalence of hTTP may be higher than estimated, at least in this region. A founder effect in this community may also explain the findings. The increased availability of ADAMTS13 activity measurement is likely to increase the frequency with which the diagnosis of hTTP is made. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neonates and young children</strong> – The frequencies of immune TTP and hTTP are similar in children &lt;9 years old [<a href="#rid1">1,13</a>]. hTTP commonly presents as severe hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The frequency of immune TTP begins to increase after age 8 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]; immune TTP accounts for &gt;90 percent of TTP in adults. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> – For TTP presenting during a first pregnancy, hTTP may account for up to one-fourth of cases [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p>Other than the founder population in Norway, there does not appear to be an increased rate of hTTP in specific populations [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Since hTTP is autosomal recessive with a rare gene frequency, some affected families may have a history of consanguinity, and the prevalence may be greater in populations in which consanguinity is common.</p><p>There is no sex disparity among patients diagnosed in infancy or early childhood; however, among patients diagnosed as adults, young females are more frequently recognized than males because of the high risk of exacerbation during pregnancy [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2621349"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3119935074"><span class="h2">Presenting symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unlike immune TTP, which can have a dramatic and discrete onset, hTTP often causes seemingly mild and nonspecific symptoms such as [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lethargy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Headache</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of concentration</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abdominal discomfort</p><p></p><p>We describe these as symptoms rather than episodes because in many patients, symptoms are ongoing without a clear time of onset or resolution. (See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p>Thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia can occur, but neurologic symptoms can occur without thrombocytopenia or anemia, and thrombocytopenia may occur without apparent hemolysis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>Acute, severe exacerbations are uncommon but may be life-threatening without appropriate treatment. Case reports have described otherwise healthy individuals with hTTP who died from acute exacerbations. In the early 1970s, before effective treatment was known, we cared for two teenage sisters who presented with acute exacerbations in the third trimester of their first pregnancies, two years apart; both died of hTTP [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Remarkably, individuals with hTTP and undetectable ADAMTS13 activity can also be asymptomatic with apparently excellent health into adulthood, and siblings with the same genotype can have remarkably different clinical courses. (See <a class="local">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p>Uncharacteristic of immune TTP, patients with hTTP may present with severe kidney failure [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. This may occur because the lifelong ADAMTS13 deficiency causes gradual accumulation of thromboses in the vasculature of the kidney. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1330.html" rel="external">"The endothelium: A primer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2757229112"><span class="h2">Times of greatest risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two times of greatest risk are the neonatal period and pregnancy. However, individuals with hTTP can present at any age; diagnosis in the seventh decade has been described [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Other events that may trigger an exacerbation include infections, surgeries, and administration of DDAVP (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10,17</a>]. DDAVP increases levels of circulating von Willebrand factor (VWF). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3094034218"><span class="h3">Neonatal period (first few days of life)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first days of life are a critical period for hTTP. Case series have described severe hemolysis with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia requiring exchange blood transfusion [<a href="#rid9">9,14</a>]. None of these infants was recognized to have hTTP at birth; they were subsequently diagnosed at ages 1 month up to 25 years. Subsequent case reports in which the diagnosis was recognized have reported similar findings [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>Typically, the most frequent cause of hyperbilirubinemia in neonates is blood group ABO incompatibility with alloimmune hemolytic anemia. The hyperbilirubinemia due to alloimmune hemolysis usually responds promptly to treatment with phototherapy (and intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> [IVIG] in severe cases). When hyperbilirubinemia does not respond to this treatment, whole blood exchange transfusion is often performed. This was routine treatment for severe hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia caused by RhD alloimmunization, which was common in the era before RhD immune globulin. In infants with hTTP, hyperbilirubinemia will respond to whole blood exchange transfusion but not to phototherapy. Nevertheless, a diagnosis is rarely established; this is because hTTP is typically not considered [<a href="#rid9">9,19</a>].</p><p>A 2022 study of distinguishing features between hTTP and ABO incompatibility compared clinical features in 20 infants with ABO incompatibility versus four infants who were subsequently diagnosed with hTTP and found striking differences between the two conditions [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p>These are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141631" href="/d/graphic/141631.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and include the following: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most importantly, neonates with hTTP had severe thrombocytopenia. In infants with hTTP, jaundice began sooner and was more severe. <strong>Severe neonatal thrombocytopenia accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia is unusual and is an indication to suspect hTTP and to measure ADAMTS13 activity</strong>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In infants with ABO incompatibility, as with most other causes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, platelet counts were normal. </p><p></p><p>Neonatologists should be aware that hTTP is a cause of severe hyperbilirubinemia, particularly if accompanied by thrombocytopenia. (See <a class="local">'When to suspect the diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>Following recovery, these infants may have recurrent episodes of thrombocytopenia or, occasionally, no symptoms of hTTP until they are adults. </p><p>The reason that neonates with hTTP are at high risk is thought to involve the increased turbulence caused by the reversal of blood flow in the patent ductus arteriosus. Turbulence uncoils VWF and allows platelet adhesion and subsequent aggregation, promoting thrombosis [<a href="#rid5">5,21-24</a>]. Neonates also have a high hematocrit and increased concentration of VWF (especially ultra-large VWF multimers).</p><p>Untreated newborns with hTTP may die [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. In the neonates described above, exchange transfusion was life-saving [<a href="#rid9">9,14</a>]. A 2022 report of an infant with suspected hTTP treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="143378" href="/d/drug information/143378.html" rel="external">recombinant ADAMTS13</a> anticipates future effective and simple management when recombinant ADAMTS13 becomes available [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1157503387"><span class="h3">Pregnancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Presentation in pregnancy is common.

(See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment</strong> – Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and any exacerbations require treatment with a source of ADAMTS13  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef130009" href="/d/graphic/130009.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). If both <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="143378" href="/d/drug information/143378.html" rel="external">recombinant ADAMTS13</a> (rADAMTS13) and plasma are available, we suggest rADAMTS13 (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Risks are lower with rADAMTS13; however, plasma may be an appropriate choice for some patients depending on availability, patient preference, and cost. Shared-decision making is encouraged.

(See <a class="local">'Prophylaxis/prevention of future exacerbations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Shared decision-making</strong> – Involves discussion of the uncertain benefit and possible risks and the choice of a source of ADAMTS13. Pregnancy is high risk as nearly all patients develop complications if not given prophylaxis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indications</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Frequent exacerbations </strong>– For recurrent exacerbations, especially with neurologic symptoms, headaches, lethargy, or other frequent symptoms or thrombocytopenia, we suggest regular prophylaxis (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="143378" href="/d/drug information/143378.html" rel="external">rADAMTS13</a> over plasma (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>); however, as for treatment, plasma may be an appropriate choice for some patients. An alternative is prophylaxis for surgery, trauma, or hospitalization, with on-demand therapy for symptoms. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> – Collaboration between the hematologist and maternal-fetal medicine specialist is essential. For individuals with hTTP who become pregnant, we recommend ADAMTS13 prophylaxis as soon as the pregnancy is documented (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). The choice between <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="143378" href="/d/drug information/143378.html" rel="external">rADAMTS13</a> and plasma is individualized, as safety data during pregnancy are lacking. Prophylaxis is continued until six weeks postpartum. There is no role for premature delivery outside of standard indications. (See <a class="local">'Management of pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Dosing</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="143378" href="/d/drug information/143378.html" rel="external">rADAMTS13</a><strong> </strong>– The prophylaxis dose is 40 IU/kg every two weeks, adjusted for symptoms and platelet count.

(See <a class="local">'Plasma infusion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Siblings</strong> – Siblings of an individual with hTTP have a 25 percent chance of being affected; we test their ADAMTS13 activity as soon as possible, as major morbidities can occur in childhood. Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency warrants genetic testing. Individuals who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in <em>ADAMTS13</em> do not have hTTP but may have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
