Stress fractures may be the result of a small number of repetitions with a relatively large load (eg, a military recruit marching for several miles with a heavy backpack), a large number of repetitions with a usual load (eg, an athlete training for a long-distance race), or a combination of increased load and increased repetitions.</p><p>An overview of the classification, risk factors, diagnosis, management, and prevention of stress fractures is presented here. Specific stress fractures are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Foot and ankle stress fractures (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/223.html" rel="external">"Stress fractures of the metatarsal shaft"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/211.html" rel="external">"Proximal fifth metatarsal fractures", section on 'Stress fractures of proximal diaphysis: Zone 2 injury'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/102920.html" rel="external">"Stress fractures of the tarsal (foot) navicular"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/102919.html" rel="external">"Cuboid and cuneiform fractures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16373.html" rel="external">"Calcaneus fractures", section on 'Stress fractures'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower extremity stress fractures (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/218.html" rel="external">"Stress fractures of the tibia and fibula"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13797.html" rel="external">"Femoral stress fractures in adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Upper extremity and torso stress fractures (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/244.html" rel="external">"Stress fractures of the humeral shaft"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/246.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of rib fractures"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fracture</strong> – Fracture refers to the breaking of a bone. Complete fractures divide the affected bone into two or more pieces, while partial (incomplete) fractures do not extend through the cortex. An example of an incomplete fracture is the "greenstick" fracture, in which the convex side of a long bone is disrupted while the concave surface remains intact. These are most common in children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stress fracture</strong> – A stress fracture occurs when a bone breaks after being subjected to repeated tensile or compressive stresses, none of which would be large enough individually to cause the bone to fail, in a person who is not known to have an underlying disease that would be expected to cause abnormal bone fragility.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stress reaction</strong> –<strong> </strong>A radiographic finding on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or bone scan of increased metabolic activity at a site of bone turnover that does not yet show cortical disruption. Stress reactions are often asymptomatic but considered a precursor to a stress fracture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bone stress injury</strong> – A term that includes all clinically symptomatic stress reactions and stress fractures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Insufficiency fracture</strong> – An insufficiency fracture occurs when the mechanical strength of a bone is reduced to the point at which a stress that would not fracture a healthy bone breaks the weak one. The condition that causes reduced bone strength typically does so throughout the skeleton (eg, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, or osteogenesis imperfecta) but may be more localized (eg, demineralization in a limb due to disuse).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Insufficiency fractures due to osteoporosis, pseudofractures, and radiolucent lines seen in the bones of patients with osteomalacia are reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2035.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7775.html" rel="external">"Osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures: Clinical manifestations and treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2045.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and etiology of osteomalacia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathologic fracture</strong> – A pathologic fracture is due to a localized loss of strength in a bone from a disease process immediately underlying the bone. Examples of pathologic fractures include those that occur at sites of bone tumors (primary or metastatic), bone cysts, and infections.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H316780271"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bone remodels in response to a mechanical stress [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The rate and amount of remodeling depends upon the number and frequency of loading cycles a bone is subjected to (Wolff's law). An abrupt increase in the duration, intensity, or frequency of physical activity without adequate periods of rest may lead to pathologic changes in bone. These pathologic changes result from an imbalance between bone resorption and formation. During periods of intense exercise, bone formation lags behind bone resorption. This renders the bone susceptible to microfractures. Bone responds to this microscopic injury with a reparative response that includes edema, which can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some changes associated with stress fracture can appear on MRI before symptoms develop. (See <a class="local">'Imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>With continued overload, microfractures may propagate (symptoms generally develop during this process) and eventually coalesce into a discontinuity within the cortical bone (ie, a stress fracture). Continued overload can complete the fracture and result in displacement at the fracture site. In summary, stress fracture represents one point on a spectrum of stress-induced bone changes referred to as stress injury.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION (GRADING AND RISK OF COMPLICATIONS)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No gold-standard classification system has been developed for describing stress fractures [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Two clinically useful systems may be used: one describes severity based upon radiographic and clinical features, while another categorizes fractures as either high risk or low risk based upon location. Stress fractures have also been classified clinically on the basis of their risk of complications, such as fracture propagation or displacement, nonunion, persistent pain, avascular necrosis, reinjury, or inability to resume pre-injury level of activity [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. A system involving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings is described below. (See <a class="local">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>The distinction between "low-risk" and "high-risk" stress fractures is based primarily on the fracture site. Stress fractures at low-risk sites are unlikely to entail complications and are generally amenable to conservative management. In contrast, high-risk stress fractures are managed more aggressively, often surgically.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sites at <strong>high</strong> risk of complications:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Spine – Pars interarticularis of the lumbar spine</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hip and thigh – Femoral head, superior side of the femoral neck (ie, tension side)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Knee and leg – Patella, anterior cortex of the tibia (ie, tension side)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Multiple</strong> sites at ankle and foot – Medial malleolus, talus, tarsal navicular, proximal fifth and fourth metatarsals, base of the second metatarsal, great toe sesamoids</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sites at <strong>low</strong> risk of complications: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Second through fourth metatarsal shafts</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Posteromedial tibial shaft</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Proximal humerus or humeral shaft</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ribs</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Sacrum</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pubic ramus</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of stress fracture is less than 1 percent in the general population [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The incidence in athletic populations varies with the type of athlete; military recruits, runners, and gymnasts are considered the highest-risk populations. The incidence of lower extremity stress fracture in all United States military members between 2009 and 2012 was 5.69 per 1000 person-years [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>The incidence of stress fractures among United States collegiate athletes was 5.70 per 100,000 athletic exposures (AEs) over a 10-year period [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In this study, the sports with the highest rates were women's cross country (28.6/100,000 AEs), women's gymnastics (25.6/100,000 AEs), and women's track (22.2/100,000 AEs). The metatarsals accounted for 38 percent of fractures, followed by the tibia (22 percent) and the low back and pelvis (12 percent). In sports with both female and male participants, the rate of stress fracture was over twice as high in females (9.13/100,000 AEs) as in males (4.44/100,000 AEs).</p><p>The incidence among United States high school athletes was 1.54 per 100,000 AEs over an eight-year period [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Again, rates were highest in girls' cross country (10.62), girls' gymnastics (7.43), and boys' cross country (5.42). The lower leg accounted for the most frequent site (40 percent), followed by the foot (35 percent) and low back and pelvis (15 percent), and the rate was higher in girls (2.22/100,000 AEs) than in boys (1.27/100,000 AEs).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Important risk factors for developing stress fractures include a history of prior stress fracture, low level of physical fitness, increased volume and intensity of physical activity, menstrual irregularity, lower body mass index (BMI), diet poor in calcium, and low bone mineral density  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79279" href="/z/d/graphic/79279.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Those with the "female athlete triad" (low energy availability with or without an eating disorder, menstrual dysfunction, and low bone mineral density) are at high risk for stress fracture due to a combination of risk factors. The clinical syndrome "relative energy deficiency in sport" (RED-S) includes several features described below as risk factors. Some overlap with the female athlete triad, but this syndrome includes both males and females [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7393.html" rel="external">"Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110816.html" rel="external">"Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Prior stress fracture</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A history of stress fractures is a strong predictor of future stress fractures [<a href="#rid10">10-15</a>]. A systematic review of eight studies of stress fracture risk found that a prior history was the most significant risk factor (odds ratio [OR] 4.99, 95% CI 2.91-8.56) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The relative risk (RR) is over sixfold in distance runners and military recruits with a history of at least one stress fracture [<a href="#rid10">10,16</a>]. Among track athletes, 60 percent of those who sustained a stress fracture had a history of stress fracture. The one-year recurrence rate in these athletes was 12.6 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H497428574"><span class="h2">Activity-related factors</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Repetitive activities and high training volume</strong> – Specific repetitive activities predispose athletes to site-specific stress fractures. As examples, throwing athletes have an increased risk of humeral and scapular fractures, while runners are at increased risk for pelvic and lower extremity fractures, primarily of the tibia and metatarsals [<a href="#rid5">5,8,10,17</a>]. Gymnasts have an increased risk for stress fractures of the spine, wrist, and foot due to frequent loading of these areas. Stress fractures of the ribs may be seen in golfers and rowers. The following table lists the stress fractures associated with particular sports  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93236" href="/z/d/graphic/93236.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Time spent performing such activity is associated with increased risk. Among military trainees, higher total distance travelled on foot during training is associated with increased risk of bone stress injury [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Increased frequency of training is associated with greater risk of stress fracture in elite figure skaters, with those who train more than 12 times per week sustaining nearly double the incidence of ankle and tibia fractures as those who train less often [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Weightbearing bones, primarily those of the lower extremity, are at greatest risk for stress fracture. As an example, tibial fractures accounted for 49 percent of all stress fractures seen in athletes, followed in frequency by fractures of the metatarsals [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Greater than 12 hours of exercise per week is a risk factor for bone stress injury in females [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Non-athletes who abruptly increase their level of activity may also be at risk for stress fracture. An example would be the patient whose activity was restricted by the pain of arthritis who resumes walking after joint replacement surgery [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decreased physical fitness</strong> – Decreased muscle strength and endurance are associated with an increased incidence of stress fractures [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. Muscles play a supportive role in bone health; when muscles are weak or fatigued, other musculoskeletal structures absorb greater impact. A dramatic increase in physical training may overwhelm the bones' capacity to compensate with normal remodeling. Specific factors associated with higher rates of stress fractures include &gt;1 cm decrease in calf girth [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], less lean mass in the lower extremities [<a href="#rid24">24</a>], less than seven months of prior strength training [<a href="#rid25">25</a>], and poor lower extremity muscle strength [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Rowers with lower knee extensor to elbow extensor strength ratios also had a higher incidence of rib stress fractures in one retrospective case-control study [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although muscle inflexibility has long been cited as a possible risk factor for stress fracture, its role remains unclear [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Among several prospective studies looking at ankle dorsiflexion, one found restricted flexibility to be associated with stress fractures [<a href="#rid28">28</a>] while two found no association [<a href="#rid24">24,29</a>]. One prospective study found decreased hamstring flexibility to be associated with tibial stress fractures in runners [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower exercise levels prior to military training</strong> – Three prospective studies have reported that lower exercise levels (which are different than fitness levels) confer a higher risk of stress fracture [<a href="#rid14">14,31,32</a>]. Among United States Marine recruits, those who self-classified their activity level before basic training as "inactive" had a sixfold higher rate of stress fracture than those with "below average" or higher activity levels [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The incidence among Chinese military recruits with a history of fewer than seven hours per week of exercise before basic training was nearly twice that of recruits with more [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. A study of Finnish military recruits found that those with a history of exercise more often than twice a week prior to the start of military training had a 60 percent lower incidence of stress fracture [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Worn footwear</strong> – Recruits who begin basic training using old shoes have a higher incidence of stress fractures [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Running surface</strong> – Two retrospective studies found no association between running surface and stress fractures [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>], but one found that running on a treadmill reduced tibial strain compared with over-ground running [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2161788938"><span class="h2">Nutrition, bone health, and body composition</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inadequate vitamin D and calcium</strong> – Vitamin D and calcium are essential for bone health and fracture prevention [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. When the amounts of these nutrients are inadequate, bone is weakened and is potentially more susceptible to fractures of any kind.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A systematic review of eight observational studies, including 761 cases of stress fracture, reported an association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and lower extremity stress fractures among military personnel [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Two large retrospective studies of male and female United States Navy recruits reported a markedly higher incidence of stress fractures sustained during training among those with vitamin D deficiency [<a href="#rid38">38,39</a>]. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were also seen in a high percentage (63 percent) of adolescents with pars interarticularis stress fractures [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2022.html" rel="external">"Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment", section on 'Optimal intake to prevent deficiency'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Case-control studies show that lower calcium intake is associated with an increase in stress fracture incidence in females (RR 1.1 per 100 mg of decreased intake) [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Disordered eating</strong> – Restricted caloric intake in female track and field athletes, gymnasts, and dancers correlates with an increased incidence of stress fracture [<a href="#rid24">24,43</a>]. Disordered eating deprives the body of the nutrients needed for bone and muscle metabolism in addition to contributing to other health risks.

Key features include a history of localized pain of insidious onset that increases with activity and focal tenderness limited to the stress fracture site.

The clinician should inquire about likely risk factors and solicit a detailed description of the pain and any antecedent physical activity. Particularly important are recent changes in activity level and participation in athletic activities. Often, patients describe starting a new training program or significant changes in their training regimen (eg, boot camp, addition of hill runs, transition to a harder training surface). The following table lists the stress fractures associated with particular sports  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93236" href="/z/d/graphic/93236.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>A dietary history is valuable for both males and females to exclude eating disorders and dietary deficiency of calcium or vitamin D.

The pain is initially related to activity and increases in severity with increased activity. If the patient continues in the inciting activity, symptoms worsen. Eventually, the pain is present during less strenuous activity and, ultimately, during rest. Occasionally, the patient experiences an abrupt increase in pain at the site of milder chronic symptoms, suggesting that a repeatedly stressed area of bone has completely fractured. Less frequently, a patient's initial presentation may involve the acute onset of severe pain resulting from a complete fracture at the site of a pre-existing stress fracture.

Tenderness is usually limited to the site of injury unless a complete fracture is present, in which case the area of tenderness may be wider due to bleeding and inflammation.</p><p>Many stress fractures are preceded by a bone stress injury of lesser severity that may be more diffuse. As an example, shin splints often precede the development of a stress fracture of the medial tibial border, in which case tenderness may be present along several centimeters of the tibial shaft. However, once a fracture develops, the site of injury will likely demonstrate more focal tenderness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/141843.html" rel="external">"Running injuries of the lower extremities: Patient evaluation and common conditions", section on 'Medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) and tibial stress fractures'</a>.)</p><p>In areas where little soft tissue covers the injured bone, there may be subtle soft tissue swelling over the stress fracture and, occasionally, mild erythema. Bony callus may be palpable in chronic, severe cases. Defects of the cortical surface and bony crepitus are not present.</p><p>When the fracture site is not easily palpable, maneuvers to stress the bone at the area of pain may aid diagnosis. The fulcrum test may be useful when long bones are involved [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. It is performed by placing one hand under the area that is painful and applying steady pressure while the other hand applies steady pressure at the end of the same bone. This creates a fulcrum effect that stresses the site of suspected injury. Increased pain at the area in question during the test is consistent with a stress fracture. The fulcrum test is neither sensitive nor specific, and imaging is needed to make a precise diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Some clinicians use the hop test to help diagnose femoral neck stress fractures [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. This test simply involves having the patient hop on the affected leg, which typically reproduces pain at the fracture site. The patient should stop hopping immediately if significant pain develops around the hip or groin while performing the test. While suggestive of injury, the hop test is nonspecific, and confirmatory imaging is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. Some authors have expressed concern that repeated hopping risks converting the rare tension-side femoral neck stress fracture into a complete fracture, but we know of no actual cases where this has occurred. For patients who may have a femoral neck stress fracture and experience pain simply bearing weight, it is prudent to prescribe nonweightbearing status until appropriate imaging can be obtained.</p><p>The technique of placing a vibrating tuning fork directly over an area of injury to induce pain at a stress fracture site has shown widely disparate sensitivity and specificity in two studies and therefore cannot be recommended as a method to identify a stress fracture [<a href="#rid69">69</a>].

Plain radiographs should be obtained initially and are helpful when positive due to their high specificity, but they are insensitive. If plain radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high and a need for definitive diagnosis exists, MRI is recommended because it is both sensitive and specific. Bone scan is sensitive but nonspecific. Computed tomography (CT) is used as an adjunct if extensive bony injury is suspected because it provides greater anatomic detail of bone.

Tendinopathy, muscle strains, joint sprains, nerve entrapment syndromes, and compartment syndrome share some features with stress fractures. Bone stress reactions probably represent precursor lesions that will progress to stress fractures if the sites are not protected from further insults. Among runners, medial tibial stress syndrome (ie, "shin splints") is the most common example of this phenomenon. Neoplasm and infection represent the most worrisome diagnoses in the differential list. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/141843.html" rel="external">"Running injuries of the lower extremities: Patient evaluation and common conditions", section on 'Medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) and tibial stress fractures'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tendinopathy </strong>–<strong> </strong>Overuse syndromes frequently are due to tendinopathy, a condition characterized by chronic pain in the affected tendon. Onset is usually insidious. Tenderness is localized to the affected tendon, which can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from the underlying bones. Pain may be reproduced by passive stretch and resisted contraction of the affected tendon.

Tenderness and pain with passive stretch or resisted contraction of the involved muscle are indicative of a muscle strain. A localized hematoma and/or palpable depression may develop at the site of a sizable muscle tear. Although radiographs do not reveal a fracture, this is also often true with stress fractures.

Unlike a stress fracture, the patient with shin splints has no discrete bone tenderness. Instead, diffuse tenderness over the middle to distal third of the tibial border (usually medial but sometimes lateral) is typically present. However, if overuse continues, shin splints may progress to a stress fracture without a clear demarcation of this change, and distinguishing between the two can sometimes be difficult clinically. Like stress fractures, shin splints develop in people who suddenly increase their level of physical activity. The change may be in intensity, frequency, or type of exercise. The most frequently associated exercise is running. Shin splints are discussed elsewhere.

An elite athlete or laborer may depend upon an early return to activity to remain competitive or earn their living. Such patients may benefit from more aggressive rehabilitation or from orthopedic consultation earlier in their course than those whose career or livelihood is not threatened by a longer period of rehabilitation. A patient may also require early surgical intervention if there is evidence of nonunion (ie, cyst formation or sclerosis surrounding the fracture) because such fractures are less likely to heal by conservative measures alone.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3742047122"><span class="h2">Elements of conservative care</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H44"><span class="h3">Pain control</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ice (applied locally for 15 minutes every three hours as needed) and pain medication (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> or low-potency opiates) are used to control acute pain. The effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on fracture healing is discussed separately.

As examples, high-risk femoral head and tension-side femoral neck stress fractures should be treated with crutches and complete nonweightbearing as soon as clinically suspected and continued until orthopedic consultation is obtained.</p><p>Other pelvic or lower extremity stress fractures should be treated with reduced weightbearing if walking causes persistent pain. In many foot stress fractures, protection with a controlled ankle motion (CAM) boot, hard-sole shoe, fracture boot, or leg splint eliminates pain with walking.</p><p>Bracing may be helpful in some instances, but studies may be limited depending on the type of stress fracture and clinical context. Use of a calf-length pneumatic brace for tibial stress fractures may reduce the time until pain-free return to play for some patients. Bracing of the spine may be indicated for some stress fractures of the pars interarticularis; orthopedic consultation is recommended for such injuries.

Pain is typically used to judge the efficacy of activity modification. Simply put, activities should be limited to those that are pain free. Failure to do so may prolong healing time and increase the risk of completed fracture or nonunion.</p><p>Active individuals will not tolerate long periods of inactivity. It is mentally untenable and leads to cardiopulmonary deconditioning and muscle atrophy. Instead, patients should be encouraged to engage in activities that closely approximate their desired activity but are pain free. For instance, runners may walk briskly, use elliptical machines, perform shallow-end aquatic therapy or deep-water running, or run on a reduced-weightbearing treadmill machine. Cycling and swimming are excellent alternatives.</p><p>As healing progresses, exercises involving increasing amounts of bone stress can be added gradually as tolerated, using pain as a guide. Should the patient experience any pain at the fracture site, the activity should be replaced by an exercise that places less stress upon the healing bone.</p><p>Preventive measures should be considered, as discussed below, in order to reduce the risk of recurrence.

Those with high occupational or athletic demands warrant more frequent evaluation than recreational patients. Pain should progressively subside with treatment. If symptoms persist after several weeks, compliance with the treatment regimen should be ascertained. Compliant patients with persistent pain may need more restrictive activity modification, further protection of the bone, and a more gradual rehabilitation program. Imaging is needed if there is no clinical improvement despite six additional weeks of conservative management, including the additional measures described.</p><p>Once magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radiographs, bone scan, or computed tomography (CT) confirms the diagnosis of stress fracture, the clinician rarely needs subsequent imaging. Radiographic healing lags behind clinical healing, and both bone scan and MRI may remain positive for up to 12 months following the original injury. Clinical response to treatment should suffice as confirmation of healing for almost all patients. Additional imaging plays a role only when the clinical response to treatment fails to progress appropriately. In this case, repeat imaging will determine if the fracture has extended or developed an area of nonunion. CT images the fracture line in long bones better than plain radiography, bone scan, or MRI.

Stress fracture is part of a spectrum of bone stress injury. (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High- and low-risk fracture sites</strong> – High-risk stress fractures are those at greater risk for displacement, nonunion, or fracture propagation. (See <a class="local">'Clinical classification (grading and risk of complications)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>High-risk sites include the pars interarticularis of the lumbar spine, femoral head, superior side of the femoral neck (ie, tension side), patella, anterior cortex of the tibia (ie, tension side), medial malleolus, talus, tarsal navicular, proximal fourth and fifth metatarsals, great toe sesamoids, and the base of the second metatarsal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Low-risk sites include the second through fourth metatarsal shafts, posteromedial tibial shaft, proximal humerus or humeral shaft, ribs, sacrum, and pubic rami.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors</strong> – Important risk factors for stress fractures include a history of prior stress fracture, low level of physical fitness, a sudden increase in the volume and intensity of physical activity, menstrual irregularity, diet poor in calcium and vitamin D, low bone mineral density, disordered eating, and increasing age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79279" href="/z/d/graphic/79279.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93236" href="/z/d/graphic/93236.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – Early diagnosis of stress fractures is essential to avoid complications. In most cases, the history and physical examination provide sufficient information to diagnose and manage low-risk stress fractures without imaging studies  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114447" href="/z/d/graphic/114447.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong> – Many patients with stress fractures describe the insidious onset of localized pain within days to weeks of beginning a strenuous physical activity. Examination generally reveals focal tenderness at the fracture site. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pain description'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic imaging</strong> – Imaging is needed when high-risk stress fractures are suspected or a definitive diagnosis is necessary. Plain radiographs should be obtained initially and are helpful when positive due to their high specificity, but they are insensitive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended if plain radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high and a need for definitive diagnosis exists. (See <a class="local">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis for stress fracture includes tendinopathy, muscle strain, joint sprain, nerve entrapment, exertional compartment syndrome, neoplasm, and infection. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of fractures at low-risk locations</strong> – Stress fractures at low-risk sites are managed conservatively with the following interventions (see <a class="local">'Low-risk sites'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute pain control as needed using ice and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> and/or low-potency opioids</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Protection of the fracture site with reduced weightbearing or splinting in selected stress fracture locations</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reduction or modification of activities such that pain is not present</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Gradual resumption of activities if pain free</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rehabilitative exercise to promote optimal biomechanics</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Risk factor reduction as indicated</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Proper nutrition, including additional calcium and vitamin D (see <a class="local">'Treatment concepts'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for surgical referral</strong> – Orthopedic consultation is necessary for patients with fractures at high-risk sites or for whom a lengthy rehabilitation process is untenable, such as some high-level athletes or laborers whose livelihoods depend upon a timely return to work.
