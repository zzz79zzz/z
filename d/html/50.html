         Although coronary artery disease (CAD) primarily occurs in patients over the age of 40, younger people can be affected. Most studies have used an age cut-off of 40 to 45 years to define "young" patients with CAD or acute myocardial infarction (MI). The same age definition will be used in this review.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although CAD is an uncommon entity in young patients, it constitutes an important problem for the patient and the treating physician because of the devastating effect of this disease on the more active lifestyle of young patients. In addition, these patients have different risk factor profiles, clinical presentations, and prognoses than older patients. All of these factors should be taken into consideration when treating young patients with CAD.
        </p>
        <p>
         A separate issue, acute MI during pregnancy, is discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89.html" rel="external">

         The prevalence of CAD in younger people is difficult to establish accurately since it is frequently a silent process. The frequency with which this occurs was examined in an autopsy study of 760 young (age 15 to 34 years) victims of accidents, suicides, or homicides [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Advanced coronary atheromata were seen in 2 percent of males and none were found in females aged 15 to 19. An advanced lesion was present in 20 and 8 percent of people aged 30 to 34, respectively, while 19 and 8 percent, respectively, had a ≥40 percent stenosis of the left anterior descending artery.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are also limited data on the frequency of MI in younger subjects. In the Framingham Heart Study, the incidence of an MI over a 10-year follow-up was 12.9/1000 in males 30 to 34 years old and 5.2/1000 in females 35 to 44 years old [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of MI was eight to nine times greater in people aged 55 to 64 years. In other studies, 4 to 10 percent of patients with MI were ≤40 or 45 years of age [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. In two series of patients with CAD at ≤40 years of age, females comprised 5.6 and 11.4 percent of patients [

         The relative importance of risk factors for the development of CAD according to age was evaluated in a report in which 11,016 males aged 18 to 39 years were followed for 20 years [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

        <p>
         Young patients with MI usually have multiple risk factors for CAD. In some studies, for example, as many as 90 to 97 percent had one or more traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10
         </a>
         ]. In a prospective study of over 7000 females with an average age of 27 years at baseline who were followed for an average of 31 years, there were 47 CAD deaths [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The CAD mortality rates for those with no risk factors, only one risk factor, or two or more risk factors were 0.7, 2.4, and 5.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively. A comparable relationship was seen for cardiovascular disease mortality and for all-cause mortality. (See

         Cigarette smoking is the most common and most modifiable risk factor in young patients. It has been noted in 65 to 92 percent of young patients with MI, compared to 24 to 56 percent of patients older than 45 years of age [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,9,12-16

         In a registry study that enrolled 6892 patients with acute ST-elevation MI treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention from 1998 to 2010, smoking rates were highest for those aged 18 to 34 years, at 78 percent, compared with a smoking rate of 24 percent in that age stratum of the general population, with smoking rates notably decreasing with increasing age in the STEMI population [

         Younger patients with CAD more often have a family history of premature CAD: 41 compared to 28 and 12 percent in middle aged or older patients, respectively [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]; and 57 versus 43 percent in two series [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. A higher incidence of a positive family history in young patients (64 percent) was noted in the largest report of 823 patients [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, the offspring of patients with premature CAD are more likely to have coronary risk factors than those without such a family history [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. These include excess body weight and higher levels of serum cholesterol, glucose, and insulin. These offspring are also more likely to have evidence of vascular disease such as endothelial dysfunction and increased carotid artery intima-media thickness [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The association between family history and premature CAD can be due to both genetic and environmental factors. This was addressed in a study of 398 families in which 62 vascular biology genes were evaluated [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Missense variants of several thrombospondin genes were significantly associated with MI and CAD.

         Hypercholesterolemia is common in young patients with CAD, but its prevalence is similar to that in older patients. However, when compared to older patients, young patients have lower mean serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations (35 versus 43 mg/dL [0.9 versus 1.1 mmol/L]) and higher serum triglycerides (239 versus 186 mg/dL [2.7 versus 2.1 mmol/L]) [

         Hypertriglyceridemia was, in one series, the most common lipid abnormality in young patients with MI [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. It may be associated with glucose intolerance and a predominance of small atherogenic LDL particles, both of which predispose to atherosclerosis. (See

         Two other important coronary risk factors, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, appear to be less common in young patients with CAD than in older patients [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,12
         </a>
         ]. However, young patients frequently have subtle problems with glucose metabolism. In one study of 108 patients without a history of diabetes mellitus who had an MI before the age of 45, 65 percent had decreased oral glucose tolerance and a hyperinsulinemic response to oral glucose challenge [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         ]. This finding is consistent with other observations that impaired glucose tolerance in the absence of overt diabetes is a risk factor for coronary disease. (See

         Obesity appears to be an independent risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis, at least in young males. This was illustrated in an autopsy study of approximately 3000 persons between the ages of 15 and 34 who died from noncardiac causes [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Increasing body mass index was associated with both fatty streaks and raised atherosclerotic lesions in the right coronary and left anterior descending coronary arteries in young men, but not young females. The effect of obesity on other risk factors (eg, lipid abnormalities, hypertension, glucose intolerance) accounted for only about 15 percent of the relationship between obesity and coronary atherosclerosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         How this might occur is not known, but other studies have noted an apparently independent effect of obesity as an important coronary risk factor. A report from the Framingham Heart Study suggested that obesity in middle-aged subjects could account for as much as 23 percent of cases of CAD in males and 15 percent in females [

         Factor V Leiden, which is inactivated less efficiently by activated protein C than wild-type factor V, leads to a procoagulant state by increasing thrombin generation.

          3,15,36

Patients ≤45 years of age had a lower prevalence of stable angina than patients ≥60 years of age (24 versus 51 percent) and a higher incidence of acute coronary syndromes (76 versus 49 percent). A greater likelihood of complex lesions on arteriography may have contributed to the development of an acute coronary syndrome. (See

         Kawasaki disease (KD) is a vasculitis of infancy and early childhood. It typically presents as an acute febrile illness in children under the age of five; the incidence is higher in Asian and Asian-American populations than in other groups [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. The etiology of KD is unknown, although an inflammatory response precipitated by an infectious agent is suggested by some epidemiologic data. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6416.html" rel="external">
          "Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The most important complication of KD is coronary vasculitis, leading to coronary aneurysm formation in 20 to 25 percent of untreated patients during the acute stage of the disease. Nearly half of acute aneurysms regress, but approximately 20 percent lead to the development of coronary stenosis in the long term. Patients can present with MI or SCD. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5772.html" rel="external">
          "Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         While patients with known KD are followed for the development of coronary artery stenoses, some patients who were not previously diagnosed are recognized only after presenting with sequelae of CAD, including MI, heart failure, and SCD [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39,40

          12

After adjusting for more favorable baseline characteristics in younger patients, there was no difference in the rate of reinfarction between younger and older males (18 versus 20 percent) or younger and older females (15 versus 21 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Longer-term data were provided by a second study of 823 patients with CAD, 55 percent of whom had a prior MI and 10 percent of whom had diabetes [

         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ] was not predictive of outcome, because patients with more severe disease were more likely to undergo revascularization. In the latter study, 17-year mortality was only 9 percent in patients with normal coronary arteries [

         In addition to the mortality risk, recurrent coronary events are not uncommon. This was illustrated in a report of 108 nondiabetic males ≤45 years of age followed for six to nine years after an acute MI; the event rate (death, acute MI, coronary revascularization) of 50 percent [

         The management of stable angina, including the indications for revascularization, is similar in younger and older patients. Routine coronary angiography is not recommended in young patients who have stable CAD. However, when indicated, both PCI and CABG are effective and are associated with lower risks in younger compared to older patients. (See

         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. Ten-year overall and event-free survival (without MI, elective CABG, or repeat PCI) following PCI were 96 and 58 percent, respectively. Among survivors, 88 percent were free of angina, 93 percent had returned to work, and 19 percent underwent a repeat revascularization procedure because of disease progression at other sites or restenosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         A second report compared the outcome of PCI in 89 patients ≤40 years of age with that of 1916 patients over 40 [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Procedural success was similar in the young and older patients (90 versus 86 percent); there were no periprocedural complications in the younger group, while 7 percent of patients in the older group had a cardiac event (death, MI, or urgent CABG). After a mean follow-up of 30 months, there were no deaths; however, 5 percent required elective CABG and 34 percent underwent repeat PCI for restenosis or disease progression.
        </p>
        <p>
         The applicability of these findings on repeat revascularization, published in 1994, to current practice is uncertain. Advances such as coronary artery stenting, particularly drug-eluting stents and more aggressive antiplatelet therapy have reduced the risk of restenosis, while aggressive lipid lowering with statin therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression.

         Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is easier to perform in young patients because they are usually in better physical condition than older patients and can better tolerate the stress of surgery and general anesthesia. One report reviewed the data on 138 patients less than 40 years of age who underwent CABG with a saphenous vein graft, primarily for angina [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. More than one-half had a prior MI, 60 percent had three-vessel coronary artery disease, and 42 percent had serious left ventricular dysfunction. There was no operative mortality, and the rate of perioperative transmural acute MI was 4 percent. Survival rates at five and ten years were 95 and 84 percent, respectively. There was no significant difference between the long-term patency rate of the saphenous vein grafts compared with other series that included older age groups.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similar results were noted in another study of 107 patients ≤35 years of age in whom the actuarial survival at five and ten years was 94 and 85 percent, respectively, and the actuarial event-free survival was 77 and 53 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. Survival was decreased by multivessel disease and impaired left ventricular function, and event-free survival was decreased by a family history of coronary disease and cigarette smoking. The long-term patency was much higher with mammary artery grafts (93 versus 56 percent with saphenous vein grafts).
        </p>
        <p>
         Better long-term patency with arterial grafts has been noted in other studies in young patients [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ] and is well described in older patients. Arterial grafts are now preferred in all patients undergoing CABG. (See

         <strong>
          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) is uncommon in young males and females (age less than 40 to 45 years). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Risk factors
         </strong>
         – Similar to older patients, the risk factors for CAD include:

         <strong>
          Family history
         </strong>
         – Younger patients with CAD more often have a family history of premature CAD. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Family history'

         <strong>
          Smoking
         </strong>
         – Cigarette smoking is the most common and most modifiable risk factor in young patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Smoking'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Diabetes and hypertension
         </strong>
         – Diabetes mellitus and hypertension appear to be less common in young patients with CAD than in older patients. (See

          Other risk factors
         </strong>
         – Other risk factors such as cocaine use, factor V Leiden, and oral contraceptive use are more common in younger individuals with CAD. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – The clinical presentation of CAD in younger patients is different from that in older patients. A higher proportion of young patients do not experience angina, and, in the majority of cases, an acute coronary syndrome that progresses rapidly to MI if left untreated is the first manifestation of CAD. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         </span>
         <strong>
          Angiographic findings
         </strong>
         – Younger patients have a higher incidence of normal coronary arteries, mild luminal irregularities, and single vessel coronary artery disease than do older patients. Rarer causes of CAD such as spontaneous coronary dissection or Kawasaki disease occur more commonly in the young. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – In general, the management of CAD in the young is similar to that in older individuals. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of chronic CAD'
