In addition, youth with bipolar disorder usually have recurrent episodes of major depression [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>].</p><p>Bipolar disorder severely affects the normal development and psychosocial functioning of the youth and increases the risk for suicide, psychosis, substance abuse, other medical illnesses, and behavioral, academic, social, and legal problems [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Pediatric bipolar disorder frequently has a variable course with rapid fluctuation in mood symptoms during acute episodes. These factors coupled with developmental issues influencing the clinical picture, the difficulties youth can have verbalizing their emotions, and high rates of comorbid disorders, account for the complexity and controversies in diagnosing children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.</p><p>The prevalence of pediatric bipolar disorder in epidemiologic studies is comparable across different countries, with average rates for bipolar I disorder plus bipolar II disorder of approximately 1 to 2 percent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, there may be variability across countries for diagnosing bipolar disorder, particularly the other specified bipolar and related disorder (bipolar disorder not otherwise specified) subtype [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. As an example, a study of hospital discharge rates for pediatric bipolar disorder in the United States and England found that after adjusting for length of stay, the discharge rate was more than 12 times higher in the United States [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This discrepancy was much larger than for other psychiatric diagnoses.</p><p>This topic describes the assessment and diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, comorbidity, and treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111827.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Epidemiology and pathogenesis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15924.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Clinical manifestations and course of illness"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111828.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Comorbidity"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15925.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Overview of choosing treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99164.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar major depression: Choosing treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98716.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder and pharmacotherapy: General principles"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98719.html" rel="external">"Pediatric mania and second-generation antipsychotics: Efficacy, administration, and side effects"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98754.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Efficacy and core elements of adjunctive psychotherapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H190481581"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H926541986"><span class="h2">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite the serious consequences of bipolar disorder, identification of the illness and initiation of treatment occurs, on average, 10 years after its manifestation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Pediatricians and other primary care physicians should be alert to symptoms suggesting the possibility of the disorder. Diagnosing bipolar disorder in children and adolescents can be complex and has significant consequences. Unless a primary care physician has experience with pediatric bipolar disorder, patients in whom the disorder is strongly suspected should be evaluated by a child psychiatrist or other mental health specialist skilled in making the diagnosis.</p><p>Assessment of manic, hypomanic, and depressive symptoms in youth requires careful probing and multiple longitudinal assessments. In addition, it is important to ascertain the frequency, intensity, number, and duration (summarized by the acronym “FIND”) of manic, hypomanic, and depressive mood episodes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], as well as episodes with mixed features (ie, mood episodes that are accompanied by symptoms of the opposite polarity) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Given that lack of insight can be associated with mania or hypomania, it is imperative to obtain information from caregivers or other adults who know the child well in order to accurately assess symptoms and potential change in functioning. The child’s chronologic age, intellectual capabilities, and environmental factors need to be taken into account when assessing the level of functional impairment or improvement.</p><p>Certain symptoms, particularly if they <strong>appear together and are episodic</strong>, should raise the suspicion of pediatric bipolar disorder:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistently increased activity and/or silliness above and beyond what is expected for the developmental age of the child and not accounted by the situation, other psychiatric disorders, or medications</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased need for sleep for several nights (eg, four), especially if the child is not tired or sleepy the day after having slept only three to four hours during the night</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inappropriate sexual behaviors that are out of character, not expected for the mental/chronological age of the child/adolescent, and occur without a history of exposure to sexual activity (eg, abuse or videos)</p><p></p><p>In addition, the presence of psychosis (eg, hallucinations and/or delusions) should raise the question of whether the child has bipolar disorder. Longitudinal studies indicate that psychotic symptoms in the context of depression are a strong predictor of bipolar disorder, particularly if there is family history of bipolar disorder [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Mild or transient manic symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic threshold for episodes of mania or hypomania may precede or coexist with an episode of depression [<a href="#rid1">1,11</a>]. These subthreshold manic symptoms in depressed patients are associated with poor responses to antidepressants and can be a harbinger of eventual bipolar disorder. Clinicians thus need to probe for a history of manic/hypomanic symptoms in youth presenting with depression.</p><p>Evaluation of children and adolescents for bipolar disorder should include a history and examination for the presence of comorbid mental disorders (eg, anxiety disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), substance use, other medical conditions (eg, obesity), suicidal and homicidal ideation and behavior, family psychopathology, and ongoing negative life events (eg, family conflicts and abuse); assessment of psychosocial functioning; and longitudinal observation of the mood symptoms. In some cases, psychometric testing can be useful for children with learning problems. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/613.html" rel="external">"Specific learning disorders in children: Evaluation", section on 'Psychometric tests'</a>.)</p><p>To determine the level of care (eg, hospitalization), clinicians need to assess the severity of mood symptoms; presence of suicidal and/or homicidal symptoms, psychosis, substance abuse, and agitation, as well as parental psychopathology; the child’s and parents’ adherence to treatment; and family environment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H190481588"><span class="h2">Assessment instruments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assessment of mood and other psychiatric symptoms can be facilitated by the use of structured and semi-structured interviews and rating scales. In contrast to the interviews, the rating scales below do not provide a diagnosis, but can reveal symptoms that may alert clinicians to further assess for bipolar disorder. Rating instruments can also be used during treatment to monitor the severity of symptoms over time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H190481595"><span class="h3">Diagnostic interviews</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are several structured and semi-structured interviews that can be used for diagnosing bipolar disorder, including the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for school age children - Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, these interviews are lengthy and time-consuming and are mainly used for research.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H190481602"><span class="h3">Clinician-administered rating scales</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinician-administered rating scales that assess manic symptoms and their severity in youth include the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>] and the KSADS Mania Rating Scale (KSADS – MRS; derived from the KSADS-P mania module) [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. However, using these scales requires training.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H190481609"><span class="h3">Youth- and parent-administered rating scales</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It appears that parental reports are more effective in identifying mania than youth or teacher reports [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The General Behavior Inventory [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], the parent version of the YMRS (P-YMRS) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], and the Child Mania Rating Scale for Parents (about their children) [<a href="#rid13">13,15</a>] are psychometrically sound and can be used to screen for bipolar disorder symptoms in youth. However, these self-report scales usually do not properly elicit the clustering and periodicity of manic/hypomanic symptoms.</p><p>The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is a parent-report instrument that has been used to screen for bipolar disorder in youths by summing the Attention, Aggression, and Anxious/Depressed subscales (CBCL-PBD; pediatric bipolar disorder phenotype) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, the CBCL-PBD is not specific for assessing mania; rather, it seems to detect mood lability or severe psychopathology [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H190481616"><span class="h3">Mood timelines or diaries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mood timelines or diaries describe the course of a patient’s mood symptoms over time. Using school years, birthdays, and holidays as anchor points, timelines and diaries can help assess the onset and course of mood disorders. Timelines use a simple scale showing daily changes in mood  (<a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef84011" href="/z/d/graphic/84011.html" rel="external">form 1</a>). As an example, they can include a scatter line in which 0 represents feeling very sad, 10 excessively happy and 5 is a normal mood. A mood diary can also include stressors and doses of medications. Multiple smartphone applications are available for tracking mood fluctuations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H190481623"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and its subtypes begins by diagnosing the manic or hypomanic episodes that determine the diagnosis of this disorder. It is crucial to ascertain whether the symptoms present in clusters above and beyond any other comorbid psychopathology, and whether the manic/hypomanic episodes are cyclic. In addition, the diagnosis requires that clinicians exclude other relevant psychiatric and other medical conditions that can manifest with symptoms that overlap with those of bipolar disorder. (See <a class="local">'Mood episodes'</a> below and <a class="local">'Bipolar disorders'</a> below and <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>We suggest diagnosing bipolar mood episodes and disorders according to the criteria in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Although the diagnostic criteria were not developed or specifically adapted for use in pediatric populations, it is possible to apply the criteria to children and adolescents by accounting for developmental issues.</p><p>A reasonable alternative to DSM-5 is the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases-10<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-10) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The two sets of criteria are largely the same.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13360196"><span class="h2">Mood episodes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bipolar mood episodes include mania, hypomania, and major depression; however, episodes of major depression are not necessary to make the diagnosis of bipolar disorder [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The distinction between the symptoms of these episodes and normal behavior in children is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15924.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Clinical manifestations and course of illness", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13360219"><span class="h3">Mania</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnostic criteria for manic episodes are described in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106" href="/z/d/graphic/91106.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The core symptoms of mania are abnormally and persistently [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated, expansive, and/or irritable mood</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased energy or goal directed activity</p><p></p><p>These symptoms occur for at least one week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary), nearly every day, for most of the day. During this period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, at least three (if elated mood predominates) or four (if irritable mood predominates) of the following symptoms must also be present [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased need for sleep (eg, feels rested after three or four hours of sleep)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>More talkative than usual or pressured speech</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Racing thoughts or flight of ideas (abrupt changes from one topic to another that are based upon understandable associations)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Distractibility</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (eg, buying sprees or sexual indiscretions)</p><p></p><p>A meta-analysis of 20 observational studies evaluated the frequency of manic symptoms in youth with bipolar I disorder and other specified bipolar disorder (total n &gt;2000) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The most common symptoms included increased energy, irritability, mood lability, distractibility, and goal directed activity (each occurred in approximately 75 percent of patients)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111706" href="/z/d/graphic/111706.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The results of the meta-analysis need to be taken with caution because there were methodologic limitations (eg, studies varied in how they diagnosed bipolar disorder), which led to substantial heterogeneity across studies in the rates of most symptoms.</p><p>Another criterion is that the manic symptoms impair psychosocial functioning, necessitate hospitalization, or are accompanied by psychotic features (eg, delusions or hallucinations); in addition, the symptoms are not the direct result of a substance or general medical condition [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, a typical syndrome of manic symptoms, which emerges during antidepressant treatment and persists beyond the physiologic effect of that treatment (eg, more than one week), should be considered as a manic episode if the full criteria are met. Antidepressant-induced activation (eg, increased energy, silliness, and talkativeness) that occurs solely during treatment should not be diagnosed as mania [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>These symptoms exist as a collection of concurrent symptoms and behaviors. Although a few investigators disagree, the diagnosis of mania requires that the symptoms occur episodically. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15924.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Clinical manifestations and course of illness", section on 'Mania'</a>.)</p><p>Manic episodes occur with bipolar I disorder. (See <a class="local">'Bipolar I disorder'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13360225"><span class="h3">Hypomania</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnostic criteria for hypomanic episodes are described in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107" href="/z/d/graphic/91107.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Hypomania is characterized by an abnormally and persistently elevated or irritable mood, as well as increased energy or goal directed activity, lasting at least four consecutive days, for most of the day, nearly every day [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. During this period, at least three (if elated mood predominates) or four (if irritable mood predominates) of the additional symptoms that characterize mania must be present. (See <a class="local">'Mania'</a> above.)</p><p>The distinction between hypomanic and manic episodes is based upon the intensity and duration of symptoms. Hypomanic symptoms are less severe than manic symptoms, and according to DSM-5, the diagnosis of hypomania requires at least four days of symptoms, whereas mania requires at least seven days [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In addition, psychosocial functioning in hypomania is either mildly impaired or significantly improved, whereas functioning in mania is impaired. If severe, mania may include psychotic features, which usually are mood congruent (eg, having superpowers or being the messiah) and may lead to hospitalization; by definition, hypomania does not.</p><p>Another criterion for hypomania is that the symptoms are not the direct result of a substance [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, a syndrome of hypomanic symptoms, which emerges during antidepressant treatment (eg, pharmacotherapy) and persists beyond the physiologic effect of that treatment, is diagnosed as a hypomanic episode if the full criteria are met.</p><p>Hypomania may be difficult to diagnose not only because functioning can improve during an episode, but also because the symptoms need to be differentiated from normal mood and behaviors usually observed in youths.</p><p>Whereas manic episodes only occur in bipolar I disorder, hypomanic episodes may occur with bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or other specified bipolar and related disorder. (See <a class="local">'Bipolar disorders'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13360231"><span class="h3">Major depression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Episodes of major depression usually occur in youth with bipolar disorder, but they are not necessary for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The diagnostic criteria for major depressive episodes are described in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91398" href="/z/d/graphic/91398.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Major depression is characterized by at least five of the following symptoms for at least two weeks; at least one of the symptoms is dysphoria, irritability, or anhedonia [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day (dysphoria)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diminished interest or pleasure in nearly all daily activities, most of the day, nearly every day (anhedonia)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Significant weight loss or weight gain (eg, 5 percent within a month)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thoughts of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt nearly every day</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diminished ability to think or concentrate nearly every day</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation, or a suicide attempt</p><p></p><p>In addition, the symptoms cause significant distress or psychosocial impairment, and are not the direct result of a substance or general medical condition. Although controversial, in DSM-5, bereavement does not exclude the diagnosis of a major depressive episode. Major depressive episodes may occur with bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or other specified bipolar disorder. (See <a class="local">'Bipolar disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>Depressive symptoms may fluctuate more frequently in depressed children compared with adults, and depressed children may be more reactive than depressed adults. Depressed children may not look or feel depressed but are irritable instead. They can be depressed at school but feel or look happy when they are with their friends or playing games. To consider diagnosing a major depression in youth, it can be useful to evaluate what percent of the time (eg, in a week) they are depressed.
