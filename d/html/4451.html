In this population, concerns have been raised that labor induction with or without cervical ripening may reduce the chances of a successful vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) and may increase the risk for uterine rupture.</p><p>The cervical ripening and labor induction methods that lead to the highest chance of vaginal birth and the lowest chance of uterine rupture in this population have not been established [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Available evidence is inconclusive because no randomized trials have compared the outcome of labor induction after a prior cesarean with the outcome of either planned repeat cesarean birth or expectant management. Data are limited to findings from observational studies, which have several limitations, including inconsistent definitions of uterine rupture and dehiscence, wide variation in induction protocols (eg, timing and dose of prostaglandins and/or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/z/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a> administration), heterogeneity in patient populations, and inconsistency in primary outcome measures [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Induction of labor with or without cervical ripening in patients attempting TOLAC will be reviewed here. Other issues related to TOLAC and issues related to repeat cesarean birth are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4479.html" rel="external">"Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116203.html" rel="external">"Trial of labor after cesarean birth: Intrapartum management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4457.html" rel="external">"Repeat cesarean birth"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">LIKELIHOOD OF VBAC</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A prior vaginal birth is the factor most associated with induction resulting in a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). In a study including over 3200 inductions after a prior cesarean, VBAC rates for those with versus without a prior vaginal birth were 83 and 51 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A favorable cervix also appeared to play a role:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with a favorable cervix (Bishop score ≥6), VBAC rates with versus without a prior vaginal birth were 91 and 69 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with an unfavorable cervix, VBAC rates with versus without a prior vaginal birth were 77 and 45 percent, respectively.

In a study of over 12,000 patients with singleton gestations ≥39 weeks and one low transverse cesarean birth, those undergoing induction at 39+0 to 39+3 weeks without an acute obstetric/medical indication actually had a higher VBAC rate than those managed expectantly (73.8 versus 61.3 percent, odds ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.67) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H569850929"><span class="h1">INDUCTION-RELATED RISK OF RUPTURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with a prior cesarean, the body of evidence suggests induction (any method) is associated with a statistically higher rate of uterine rupture than spontaneous labor or expectant management.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The 2010 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement on Vaginal Birth After Cesarean<strong> </strong>reported that<strong> </strong>the frequency of uterine rupture in those with term pregnancies undergoing induction was nearly twofold higher than that in those in spontaneous labor (1.5 versus 0.8 percent) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study comparing uterine rupture rates in those induced in the 39<sup>th</sup>, 40<sup>th</sup>, and 41<sup>st</sup> week of gestation (n = 1603) with those undergoing expectant management (n = 11,072) also reported a higher frequency of uterine rupture in the induction group (1.4 versus 0.5, 1.3 versus 0.6, and 1.3 versus 0.4 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H627672846"><span class="h2">Risk factors for rupture during induction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Factors that have been associated with an increased risk of rupture during induction after a previous cesarean (TOLAC) include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>No previous vaginal birth</strong> – No prior vaginal birth appears to be a factor associated with a higher chance of rupture [<a href="#rid3">3,7</a>].

These factors are associated with the duration of induction, probability of a vaginal birth after cesarean, and risk of uterine rupture. (See <a class="local">'Risk factors for rupture during induction'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4479.html" rel="external">"Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth", section on 'Predicting the probability of VBAC'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with a favorable cervix who choose to be induced, we perform amniotomy and administer <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/z/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a>. There is no universally accepted definition of favorable or unfavorable cervix, although many obstetricians use a Bishop score ≥6 as the criterion for a favorable cervix  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65320" href="/z/d/graphic/65320.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Issues related to use of oxytocin'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4476.html" rel="external">"Induction of labor with oxytocin", section on 'Oxytocin administration'</a> and <a class="local">'Issues related to amniotomy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with an unfavorable cervix who choose to be induced, we use mechanical cervical ripening (insertion of balloon catheter) followed by amniotomy and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/z/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a> administration. Many clinicians consider a Bishop score &lt;6 indicative of an unfavorable cervix and the need for a ripening agent, while others use a lower threshold (eg, ≤3 or 4). Mechanical cervical ripening may shorten the duration of labor and avoid the possible increase in risk of uterine rupture with prostaglandin ripening agents. The risk of rupture is not eliminated; rupture can occur before the onset of labor. (See <a class="local">'Issues related to use of mechanical methods of cervical ripening'</a> below and <a class="local">'Issues related to use of oxytocin'</a> below and <a class="local">'Issues related to amniotomy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although the combined use of a balloon catheter and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/z/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a> is sometimes employed in patients without a prior cesarean to decrease the time to delivery, safety and efficacy data of this approach in patients undergoing TOLAC are not available.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Issues related to use of oxytocin</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk of rupture associated with </strong><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/z/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a><strong> use</strong> – Available data do not allow a definitive conclusion as to whether use of oxytocin for induced TOLAC is causally associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture. It should also be noted that, even in studies in which increases in risk of rupture for oxytocin induction versus spontaneous labor or expectant management were statistically significant, the absolute increases were relatively small, as shown by the prospective study described below. Thus, we use oxytocin for induction of labor in patients desiring a TOLAC who have a standard obstetric indication for induced delivery. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) acknowledges that induction of labor is an acceptable option for individuals undergoing TOLAC [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. They advise counseling patients as to the risks and benefits of oxytocin induction in this setting.

When oxytocin is used for labor induction, doses over 20 milliunits/minute should be administered with caution (ie, balancing the risks and benefits on a case-by case basis), based on findings from a nested case-control study that identified a dose-response relationship between increasing doses of oxytocin and uterine rupture [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

The procedure for utilizing mechanical methods of cervical ripening is described separately and is not modified for patients with a previous cesarean birth.

In this study, the rate of uterine rupture was similar for patients in spontaneous labor and those who were induced without the use of a prostaglandin, but was significantly higher in patients induced with prostaglandins (type not available).

In addition, the increased risk of rupture may be related to characteristics of patients who receive prostaglandins rather than to the medication itself; as an example, patients who receive prostaglandins are much more likely to have an unfavorable cervix than those induced with oxytocin alone or who enter labor spontaneously. Although some studies describe outcomes for labors induced with oxytocin alone, few describe outcomes with use of prostaglandins alone. In one such study, prostaglandins alone were not associated with uterine rupture, but sequential use of prostaglandin and oxytocin was associated with uterine rupture (OR 3.07, 95% CI 0.98-9.88) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>PGE2</strong> – A meta-analysis of studies of uterine rupture among patients with one prior low-transverse cesarean birth undergoing labor induction with PGE2 estimated a pooled prevalence of five uterine ruptures per 1000 labor inductions (95% CI 2-9 per 1000), which is similar to historic rates reported for labor induction among patients with one prior low transverse cesarean [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].
