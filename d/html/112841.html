Therapy to reduce the risk of subsequent events in such patients is referred to as secondary prevention. Secondary prevention interventions are aimed at known modifiable risk factors for CVD events such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and elevated levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). LDL-C plays a key role in the pathogenesis and perpetuation of atherosclerotic CVD, and LDL-C lowering has been shown in large clinical trials to reduce the risk of CVD events and, in some populations, to reduce all-cause mortality. </p><p>This topic will review the evidence for the benefit from lowering LDL-C in secondary prevention as well as our treatment approach. The approach to lipid lowering therapy for the subgroup of very high-risk patients with an acute coronary syndrome is discussed separately.

(See <a class="local">'Benefits of LDL-C lowering'</a> below.) </p><p>After successful initiation of high-intensity statin therapy, we remeasure LDL-C within six to eight weeks. For patients who have not achieved the expected 50 percent reduction in LDL-C or who in whom the LDL-C is ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), possible nonadherence should be considered, given that nonadherence to statin therapy is frequent.</p><p>For some patients with CVD in whom the LDL-C remains ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) after high-intensity statin therapy, we consider adding a second drug to further lower LDL-C. The decision to add a second LDL-C lowering drug should take into account the potential magnitude of benefit from additional therapy: the higher the residual risk, the more likely we are to add a second drug (or even a third). (See <a class="local">'Magnitude of benefit and baseline risk'</a> below and <a class="local">'Treatment goal'</a> below.) </p><p>In most cases, when we add a second agent, we usually choose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> before a PCSK9 inhibitor for reasons of cost and convenience. After treatment with statin plus ezetimibe, we remeasure LDL-C within six to eight weeks. For many higher-risk patients whose LDL-C remains significantly ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), we consider adding a PCSK9 inhibitor. The higher the degree of CVD risk, the more likely we are to add a PCSK9 inhibitor.</p><p>This approach of adding a second (or even a third) agent should involve shared decision-making between the patient and the provider. Shared decision making means discussing the potential benefits and risks of a new drug with the patient. As discussed below, this discussion is often brief if the chosen drug is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>, as it is low cost and well tolerated. When suggesting that patients start a PCSK9 inhibitor, the discussion is often longer given the higher cost, need for periodic injection, and less robust long-term safety data. In addition, health care providers should assess the potential negative impact on medication compliance of adding another medication. Finally and to the extent possible, we teach the patient about the nature of the disease, including the potential for early atherosclerotic CVD events.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3678676025"><span class="h2">Initial therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with CVD should be recommended lifestyle (modification) interventions associated with improved clinical outcomes and treated with a high intensity statin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1505.html" rel="external">"Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease (secondary prevention) or at very high risk", section on 'Lifestyle modifications'</a> and <a class="local">'Intensity of statin therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Statins, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>, and PCSK9 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Among these three, statins are the best studied. High-intensity statin therapy lowers LDL-C by 50 to 60 percent. They are more effective than ezetimibe and significantly less costly and easier to use than PCSK9 inhibitors. In addition, they have been used with an excellent safety profile for over 30 years. Thus, statins are the first choice in virtually all patients with elevated LDL-C. </p><p>In stable patients (outpatients), we attempt to treat with high intensity statin (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8949" href="/z/d/drug information/8949.html" rel="external">atorvastatin</a> 40 to 80 mg or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/z/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">rosuvastatin</a> 20 to 40 mg daily) and we prefer the highest approved dose in most cases. In patients with intolerance to a high-intensity statin, we recommend moderate-intensity statin plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>. Possible dose adjustment in special populations is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Special populations'</a> below.) </p><p>In patients who do not tolerate one statin because of myopathy, clinicians should to try another statin that may be better tolerated or to try alternative dosing regimens, such as giving the drug every other day, often using low doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/z/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">rosuvastatin</a>. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6833.html" rel="external">"Statin muscle-related adverse events"</a>.)</p><p>Failure of a patient to achieve the expected LDL-C lowering with maximal doses of either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8949" href="/z/d/drug information/8949.html" rel="external">atorvastatin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/z/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">rosuvastatin</a> may be due to poor adherence to therapy and life style recommendations or a variable response to the therapy.</p><p>For patients who cannot tolerate statin therapy, we start <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>.

Inconvenience of three compared with two LDL-C lowering drugs is one reason to consider stopping ezetimibe. Whether ezetimibe is needed for patients who require addition of PCSK9 inhibitor, and who likely have very low LDL-C after treatment with statin plus PCSK9 inhibitor, has not been well studied.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2464687511"><span class="h2">Other possible therapies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who have not achieved their LDL-C goal using <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> or PCSK9 inhibitor should be referred to a clinician who specializes in the treatment of complex lipid disorders. </p><p>For patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="87508" href="/z/d/drug information/87508.html" rel="external">lomitapide</a> is potentially of value, but its cost and side-effect profile may prevent it from being prescribed.

Evaluation of drug efficacy or screening for adverse effects is not necessary with LDL-C lowering therapies. While no high-quality evidence exists to support a specific laboratory test or a specific time interval, we suggest that the LDL-C be checked approximately six to eight weeks after the initiation or change of treatment [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. If LDL-C reduction is substantially less than expected, possible non-tolerance or nonadherence to treatment should be carefully explored, or escalation of therapy considered. Thereafter, measurement every 12 months is reasonable in patients who seem adherent to lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy to evaluate adherence or to comply with insurer specifications. More frequent lipid monitoring is reasonable if the patient has elevated risk of medication nonadherence.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1672372062"><span class="h1">BENEFITS OF LDL-C LOWERING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Across a broad range of baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and LDL-C baseline levels, most therapies that lower LDL-C lead to a clinically important reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke. </p><p>While a mortality benefit has been more difficult to consistently demonstrate, intense LDL-C lowering lowers the risk of all-cause death in those at very high risk. Whatever the reason for the difficulty in consistently demonstrating a mortality benefit, we believe that most patients will accept a recommendation for LDL-C lowering in order to achieve a reduction in ischemic events (eg, MI or ischemic stroke), even in the absence of a demonstrated mortality benefit, since these events degrade quality of life in part through disability, drive up health care costs, and likely portend additional ischemic events. </p><p>A 2018 meta-analysis of 34 randomized trials (n = 270,788) comparing more with less intense LDL-C lowering for both secondary and primary prevention evaluated all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

With treatment, the magnitude in reduction in risk is related to the baseline risk, as well as the potency of the LDL-C lowering drug. (See <a class="local">'Risk groups'</a> above.)</p><p>As the reduction in relative risk is constant at all pretreatment levels, the absolute reduction in risk with an LDL-C lowering drug is greater at higher baseline risk [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. ASCVD patients without higher than average risk features (see <a class="local">'Risk groups'</a> above) may have a 10-year risk in the range of 20 to 25 percent. LDL-C lowering, across all subgroups of patients with ASCVD, reduces the risk by about 21 to 22 percent (1 to 3 percentage points, NNT = 33 to 100 for 10-years treated) for each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Thus, a potent intervention (such as high-intensity statin therapy) decreases absolute risk to greater extent than a weaker intervention (such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>) in patients with similar baseline risk.</p><p>With regard to additional therapy on top of statin therapy (see <a class="local">'Additional therapy'</a> above), a patient case may help to illustrate the magnitude of benefit. A 60-year-old man had an MI five years ago and has done well for years on high-intensity statin therapy (and other appropriate CVD risk-reducing interventions). His stable LDL-C has been about 75 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L). His 10-year risk for a CVD event is around 20 percent. The addition of PCSK9 inhibitor, which would lower the LDL-C to about 35 mg/dL (0.9), would lower the risk by about 20 percent to about 16 percent (0.8 x 20), or lower the absolute risk about 4 percent. The addition of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> would lower the risk to about 18 percent or lower the absolute risk about 2 percent. We believe that many patients will accept the potential burdens associated with additional therapy for this magnitude of benefit.</p><p>The practitioner’s ability to precisely define baseline risk in the individual patient leads to imprecision in the ability to explain to the patient (to predict) the magnitude of benefit from a specific LDL-C lowering intervention. This is partially explained by the fact that baseline risk is explained by factors other than LDL-C such as the presence of other risk factors.

One randomized trial (Treat Stroke to Target [TST]) specifically compared treating to a target LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dL with &lt;70 mg/dL and found a significant reduction in major cardiovascular events when treating to the lower treatment [<a href="#rid18">18</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1120.html" rel="external">"Overview of secondary prevention of ischemic stroke", section on 'LDL-C lowering therapy'</a>).
