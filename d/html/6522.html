         Heel pain in children and skeletally immature adolescents can originate in the bones (fractures), ligaments (sprains), muscles and tendons (tendinitis), fascia, skin, or nerves.
        </p>
        <p>
         Careful history and physical examination with localization of the pain can often identify the underlying etiology  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). In many patients, imaging is not necessary to establish the diagnosis.

         Evaluation of the foot is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         Common acute heel injuries include friction blisters, open wounds, and contusions. Calcaneal fracture or Achilles tendon rupture is rare in children.

         </span>
         Friction blisters are intraepidermal blisters that result from trauma-induced separation within the epidermis. They most frequently occur on the heels and soles of the feet due to friction from shoes and socks during walking or running. Moisture (eg, from sweating) and pressure points typically caused by poor-fitting or new foot wear increases the frictional forces applied to the skin and predisposes to blister formation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Pain occurs when pressure continues to be applied to the fluid between the skin layers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Blisters can be prevented by emphasizing proper mechanics, ensuring that shoes fit properly and that socks stay dry. Socks that wick moisture away from the skin (eg, acrylic, polyester, or wool socks worn over polyester socks) also decrease the likelihood of a blister [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Application of preventive tapes and pads to the heel can also provide a friction barrier and can prevent blisters when applied prior to the activity (eg, running, hiking, sports participation) or when skin irritation is present but a blister has not formed (sometimes called a "hot spot") [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. However, several aspects warrant emphasis:

         <span class="glyph">

         been shown to reduce the development of blisters and may actually increase the risk based upon the tendency to increase friction coefficient with time [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Antiperspirants (eg, 20%

         With proper treatment of blisters, children and adolescents should be able to participate in activities without restriction. Dressing should be soaked off and the blisters inspected daily until healing has occurred followed by reapplication. The caregivers should be advised to watch for signs of infection, including redness, increased pain, swelling, and pus drainage and to seek prompt medical attention if they occur.

         Plantar puncture wounds involving the heel are a common injury. Typical objects causing these injuries include nails, pins, other metal objects, wood, stones, and glass. These wounds have a significant risk for infection. When evaluating plantar puncture wounds in children and adolescents the clinician should determine when the injury occurred, whether the patient was barefoot or wearing shoes, and what object caused the wound, if known. The wound should be examined with the patient prone to be able to assess it completely. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7661.html" rel="external">
          "Infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'Epidemiology'

        </p>
        <p>
         Imaging is warranted when there is a clinical suspicion of a retained foreign body. Plain radiographs can detect many radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, stones, or metallic objects). Wood, plastic, and other radiolucent objects can be located with ultrasound. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also helpful methods of localizing a retained foreign body when plain radiographs or ultrasound fail. MRI cannot be used when metallic objects are present. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7661.html" rel="external">
          "Infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'Diagnosis'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of plantar puncture wounds depends upon the presence of infection and is discussed separately. (See

         Plantar lacerations of the heel warrant assessment, debridement, and treatment according to the general principles of wound management. Typically, nonabsorbable sutures are used for wound closure and are kept in place for approximately 10 days. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">
          "Minor wound evaluation and preparation for closure"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Lacerations to the sole of the foot frequently involve cuts caused by sharp objects that the patient steps on while barefoot and foreign bodies are an important consideration. Imaging is warranted when there is a clinical suspicion of a retained foreign body. Plain radiographs can detect many radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, stones, or metallic objects). Wood, plastic, and other radiolucent objects can be located with ultrasound. CT and MRI are also helpful methods of localizing a retained foreign body when plain radiographs or ultrasound fail. MRI cannot be used when metallic objects are present. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7661.html" rel="external">
          "Infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Relative to wounds on other parts of the body, lacerations on the heel are more painful to anesthetize by local injection. A posterior tibial nerve block provides an alternative approach that may provide better pain control during the procedure. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/100070.html" rel="external">
          "Lower extremity nerve blocks: Techniques", section on 'Ankle block'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Lower extremity wounds are more prone to infection than lacerations with better perfusion (eg, face or scalp lacerations). Thus, patients should have a wound check within a few days of wound closure and should be given careful instructions regarding proper wound care, including no swimming, no immersion while bathing, and monitoring for infection.

         Contusion of the heel, sometimes referred to as a heel pad or foot pad contusion, can be caused by acute trauma (eg, landing from high fall) or stepping on a root or rock during hiking or trail running. Examination reveals focal soft tissue tenderness at the plantar surface of the mid portion of the heel (not at the insertion of plantar fascia, which suggests plantar fasciitis). This is where the os calcis is most prominent and thus, at higher risk of contusion.

         Clinical presentation of a calcaneal fracture depends upon its location and the severity of the injury. Most calcaneus fractures result from significant trauma, typically an axial loading of the foot following a fall or jump from a height. Pain is usually quite severe and weightbearing is often impossible. Swelling and tenderness are typically evident and may be severe. Deformity of the heel may be apparent. The physical examination should include vital signs and a careful evaluation looking for signs of internal injury, particularly for patients involved in high energy trauma (eg, fall from height). Typically, patients with a calcaneus fracture from high energy trauma manifest tenderness around the heel and hindfoot. Areas to palpate include the tuberosity, body, and anterior portions of the calcaneus. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Calcaneal fractures are diagnosed on the basis of imaging studies. Radiographic evaluation of a suspected calcaneus fracture begins with plain radiographs, including lateral and axial views  (

         </a>
         ). Additional views and CT are obtained when clinicians require greater detail about the extent of the fracture or when there is concern for an occult fracture despite nondefinitive initial radiographs. In addition, half of the patients with a calcaneus fracture sustained during a fall or other high-energy trauma have concomitant injuries, including fracture of the contralateral calcaneus and compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine  (

         Calcaneal apophysitis (Sever disease) is one of the most common causes of heel pain in children and young adolescents. Other important causes include plantar fasciitis, painful heel pad syndrome (heel contusion), Achilles tendinitis, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and calcaneal stress fracture.

         An apophysis is a growth plate that does not contribute to the linear growth of the bone. The calcaneal apophysis, located on the posterior inferior aspect of the calcaneus, is the growth plate at the insertion of the Achilles tendon  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63409" href="/z/d/graphic/63409.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). It normally develops at an earlier age in girls than in boys (six versus eight years of age, respectively) and is present for approximately three to four years. The calcaneal apophysis displays increased metabolic activity during periods of rapid growth, which can place it at risk for overuse injury. Factors that can lead to this injury are: participation in sports or other activities that involve running or jumping, abnormal heel striking that can result in repetitive microtrauma to the area [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ], and excessive traction placed on the area by the Achilles tendon.
        </p>
        <p>
         Calcaneal apophysitis is one of the most common causes of heel pain in active children, particularly those who play soccer and basketball or participate in gymnastics or track/running [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. In one study, the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis in general practice was 3.7 cases per 1000 patients. The mean age of presentation is 8 to 12 years; boys are affected more often than are girls; the condition is bilateral in up to two-thirds of cases [

          Clinical features and diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis is made clinically. The characteristic history is one of chronic heel pain that is related to activity and has an insidious onset [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The pain of calcaneal apophysitis may be exacerbated by wearing footwear that lacks heel cushioning or support (eg, flip flops) or athletic shoes with heel cleats (particularly soccer cleats) which center the force of impact on the heel.

        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The physical examination demonstrates heel pain tenderness during direct palpation over the apophysis  (

         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. In the calcaneal compression test, the examiner holds the affected heel in his or her palm with the fingers enveloping the upper portion of the heel and then squeezes to compress the heel in the transverse plane. Heel compression will also reproduce pain from a calcaneal contusion, stress fracture, or acute fracture but should not be painful in plantar fasciitis, fat pad syndrome, posterior impingement, or Achilles tendonitis. Related physical findings that may be seen in children with calcaneal apophysitis include decreased gastrocnemius-soleus flexibility, foot pronation, or arch abnormalities (flat foot or high-arched feet) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12,16

         For the compliant patient whose symptoms fail to improve within four to eight weeks, imaging with plain radiographs should be performed to help exclude other causes of heel pain and the patient should be referred to a sports medicine specialist. Physical therapy is also often employed at this time to help the patient improve calf flexibility and strength, especially eccentric gastrocnemius strength that will soften heel striking [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. An MRI may be warranted to identify any additional conditions if a patient fails to improve with these measures. Should physical therapy fail to improve symptoms and imaging is normal, short-leg casting or use of a fracture boot with a rocker bottom sole for three to four weeks may help to resolve painful symptoms related to stress-associated bone changes.

         Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of inferior heel pain in adults. It occurs less commonly in children and adolescents, but it does occur in athletes (particularly distance runners and dancers) and in sedentary, obese children. Excessive, prolonged foot pronation is a predisposing factor. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Many patients with plantar fasciitis have the "first step in the morning" symptom, in which the pain occurs for the first few minutes after getting out of bed and then improves or resolves. This first step may be easily confused with morning stiffness associated with spondyloarthropathies. As the course of plantar fasciitis progresses, pain may return during activity, following prolonged sitting, or at the end of the day. The patient may report that it feels as if there is a rock in his or her shoe. The pain is lessened if the patient walks on the outside of the foot. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7762.html" rel="external">
          "Plantar fasciitis", section on 'Common clinical features'

        </p>
        <p>
         The area of maximal tenderness typically is over the medial calcaneal tubercle and, less commonly, into the arch (usually in patients with pes cavus). Pain is best appreciated when the great toe is passively dorsiflexed, causing the plantar fascia to become taut and easy to palpate  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76161" href="/z/d/graphic/76161.html" rel="external">
          picture 2

         Posterior heel pain is not part of the usual presentation of plantar fasciitis, a characteristic that can be used to differentiate it from many of the other conditions that cause heel pain. Inflammation of the medial calcaneal branch of the tibial nerve (a type of tarsal tunnel syndrome) can mimic plantar fasciitis  (

          figure 4

         ). However, patients with this pathology will not have the "first step of the morning" sign, will often manifest a positive Tinel sign (tapping over the tibial nerve causes pain and paresthesia), and may have altered sensation. (See

         Chronic heel pain from contusion may occur in runners who use shoes with inadequate cushion. A subcalcaneal fat pad protects the weightbearing surface of the calcaneus. This fat pad has fibrous septae that act as coil-like mattress pads to absorb shock each time the heel strikes the ground. Painful heel pad syndrome may result from disruption of the fibrous septae that compartmentalize the fat in the heel pad. Pain is localized to the heel pad; the plantar fascia is not tender, and pain is not accentuated as the examiner dorsiflexes the toes. Treatment is described separately. (See

If a radiolucent foreign body is suspected, ultrasound may be useful. Cultures of blood or pus are typically not helpful in patients with mild infections but may be warranted in patients with systemic toxicity extensive skin involvement, underlying comorbidities (lymphedema, malignancy, neutropenia, immunodeficiency, splenectomy, diabetes), special exposures (animal bite, water-associated injury), or recurrent or persistent cellulitis.

         Other than those symptoms due to the infection that has triggered the arthritis, the articular and extraarticular manifestations are similar regardless of the particular enteric or genitourinary organism or species of organism causing the disorder. The diagnosis of reactive arthritis is a clinical diagnosis based upon the pattern of findings. Evidence of antecedent or concomitant infection, elevated acute phase reactants (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein), positive testing for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, and imaging abnormalities are consistent with enthesitis or arthritis [

          Rheumatologic disease
         </strong>
         – Enthesitis-related arthritis commonly involves the plantar fascia and Achilles as well. The onset of rheumatologic disease in childhood often coincides with a period of increased sports activity in the second decade. Although the knee and the hip are the joints most commonly involved at the time of presentation, recurrent ankle or heel pain can also occur. Diagnosis of spondyloarthropathy may be delayed if complaints of pain are attributed to recurrent sprains or strains. The detection of painful tendon or ligament insertions (enthesitis) around additional joints is a prominent feature in approximately 75 percent of cases and is an important diagnostic finding [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis are commonly identified. As an example, in one retrospective cohort of 32 children who were newly diagnosed with enthesitis-related arthritis, tenderness at the plantar fascial or Achilles tendon insertion of the calcaneus was described in 19 patients and was most frequently bilateral.

          Tarsal tunnel syndrome

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The tarsal tunnel is a bony canal that runs below the medial malleolus and through which travel the posterior tibialis, flexor hallucis, and flexor digitorum tendons, posterior tibial artery and vein, and tibial nerve  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50910" href="/z/d/graphic/50910.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). Tarsal tunnel syndrome will affect individuals with increased pressure in the tunnel or tension on the nerve. Pressure can be the result of improper foot orthosis or boot pressing on the tarsal tunnel, scar tissue from prior foot injury, as well as runners with inadequate hip stability in midstance will commonly hit the contralateral tarsal tunnel with the opposite shoe as it swings forward. Tension on the nerve occurs from excessive foot pronation. Injury to the tibial nerve causes neuropathic pain that typically radiates to the plantar surface of the forefoot (medial and lateral plantar branches) or the medial calcaneus (medial calcaneal branch). This is classic tarsal tunnel syndrome. Over time, compression of the tarsal tunnel can also result from injury of the posterior tibialis or flexor hallucis tendons. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5278.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome typically present with aching, burning, numbness, and tingling involving the sole of the foot, the distal foot, the toes, and occasionally the heel. The pain may radiate up to the medial ankle. The discomfort is often most irritating at night, may be worse after standing, and sometimes leads to the desire to remove the shoes. The physical examination may be normal in patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome of relatively recent onset. Runners may have evidence of chronic abrasions on the posterior medial ankle. Other key findings include swelling below and posterior to the medial malleolus. Examination may disclose a prominent Tinel's sign (paresthesia when tapping over the nerve posterior to the medial malleolus) with sensory loss over the plantar surface of the foot, not extending onto the dorsal foot. Diagnosis may require nerve conduction studies in patients with equivocal clinical findings. (See

          Anatomic approach
         </strong>
         – Heel pain in the young athlete can originate in the bones (fractures), apophyses, muscles and tendons (tendinitis), nerve, or fascia. Careful localization of the tenderness can help to narrow the differential diagnosis  (

          Overuse conditions
         </strong>
         – Calcaneal apophysitis (Sever disease) is one of the most common overuse injuries causing heel pain in children and young adolescents. Other important causes include plantar fasciitis, painful heel pad syndrome (heel contusion), Achilles tendinitis, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and calcaneal stress fracture. (See

         <strong>
          Bone conditions
         </strong>
         – Most bone conditions that cause heel pain are benign and include unicameral bone cysts and osteoid osteomas. Rarely, Ewing sarcoma may arise in the calcaneus. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Bone conditions'

         <strong>
          Infectious conditions
         </strong>
         – Cutaneous infections (cellulitis or abscess) involving the sole of the foot frequently follow disruption of the skin (eg, blister, puncture wound, or insect bite) or may arise from a retained foreign body such as a splinter, rock, or piece of glass. Extension of infection may cause an osteomyelitis. Plantar warts commonly occur on pressure points in the ball of the foot and the heel  (

          Inflammatory conditions
         </strong>
         – Enthesitis at the insertion of the Achilles or plantar fascia on the calcaneus in the pediatric population should trigger clinicians to consider an inflammatory etiology. Reactive arthritis and rheumatologic disease are the two major considerations. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression or inflammation of the tibial nerve. (See
