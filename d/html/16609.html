There are several important issues that must be considered when hypothyroidism occurs during pregnancy or when women with preexisting treated hypothyroidism become pregnant. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of hypothyroidism during pregnancy are reviewed here. Other aspects of thyroid disease during pregnancy or in women attempting pregnancy are reviewed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7851.html" rel="external">"Overview of thyroid disease and pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7868.html" rel="external">"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and causes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7884.html" rel="external">"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7883.html" rel="external">"Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults", section on 'Reproductive abnormalities'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7883.html" rel="external">"Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults", section on 'Fertility'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H57693617"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H821259"><span class="h2">Clinical manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The range of clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism during pregnancy is similar to those that occur in nonpregnant patients and may include fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, and weight gain. Symptoms may be overlooked or attributed to the pregnancy itself as some of the symptoms of hypothyroidism are similar to those of pregnancy (although cold intolerance is not a normal clinical manifestation of pregnancy). Many patients are asymptomatic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7846.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H821266"><span class="h2">Laboratory findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To meet the increased metabolic needs during a normal pregnancy, there are changes in thyroid physiology that are reflected in altered thyroid function tests. These changes include an increase in thyroxine (T4)-binding globulin (TBG), which results in total T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations that are higher than in nonpregnant women. In addition, high serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, particularly during early pregnancy, result in a reduction in first trimester serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7851.html" rel="external">"Overview of thyroid disease and pregnancy", section on 'Thyroid adaptation during normal pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>Because of the changes in thyroid physiology during normal pregnancy and because there are substantial population differences in the TSH upper reference limit, thyroid function tests should be interpreted using population-based, trimester-specific reference ranges for TSH and assay method and trimester-specific reference ranges for serum free T4. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7851.html" rel="external">"Overview of thyroid disease and pregnancy", section on 'Trimester-specific reference ranges'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the laboratory does not provide population and trimester-specific reference ranges for TSH, an upper reference limit of approximately 4.0 mU/L can be used.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Trimester-specific reference ranges for free T4 should be provided with the assay kits. If not available (and particularly if free T4 values are discordant from serum TSH), measurement of total T4 may be superior to free T4 in the second and third trimesters. Total T4 levels during later pregnancy are approximately 1.5-fold higher than in nonpregnant women.</p><p></p><p>Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies are elevated in 30 to 60 percent of pregnant women with an elevated TSH [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Women who have subclinical hypothyroidism with positive TPO antibodies have a higher risk of pregnancy complications than those whose TPO antibodies are negative [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Subclinical hypothyroidism'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4181675356"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism during pregnancy is based upon the finding of an elevated serum TSH concentration, defined using population and trimester-specific TSH reference ranges for pregnant women [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7851.html" rel="external">"Overview of thyroid disease and pregnancy", section on 'Trimester-specific reference ranges'</a>.)</p><p>TSH should be measured in any women with symptoms of hypothyroidism. Screening of asymptomatic women is reviewed below. (See <a class="local">'Screening'</a> below.)</p><p>For women with a TSH above the population and trimester-specific upper limit of normal (or above 4.0 mU/L when local reference ranges are not available), we also measure a free T4 (or total T4, if trimester-specific reference range for free T4 is not provided or if free T4 measurements appear discordant with TSH measurements). In addition, we agree with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommendation to measure thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies in pregnant women with TSH &gt;2.5 mU/L to inform treatment considerations [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Indications for treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overt primary hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated trimester-specific TSH concentration in conjunction with a decreased free T4 concentration (below assay normal using reference range for pregnant women).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated trimester-specific serum TSH concentration and a normal free T4 concentration.</p><p></p><p>Women with central hypothyroidism from pituitary or hypothalamic disease will not have elevated TSH concentrations during pregnancy.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7883.html" rel="external">"Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults", section on 'Reproductive abnormalities'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7883.html" rel="external">"Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults", section on 'Fertility'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3675135"><span class="h3">Adverse pregnancy outcome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of complications during pregnancy is lower in women with subclinical, rather than overt, hypothyroidism. However, in some [<a href="#rid3">3,13,21-30</a>], but not all [<a href="#rid31">31</a>], studies, women with subclinical hypothyroidism were also reported to be at increased risk for severe preeclampsia, preterm delivery, placental abruption, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and/or pregnancy loss compared with euthyroid women. In one study, these complications were related to the degree of TSH elevation, with preterm birth occurring in 5.4 percent of pregnancies when TSH was ≤4 or ≤6 mU/L, 7.8 percent when TSH was &gt;6 mU/L, and 11.4 percent when TSH was &gt;10 mU/L [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 19 cohort studies, the risk of preterm birth was higher in women with subclinical hypothyroidism compared with euthyroidism (6.1 versus 5 percent, odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.64) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. In a separate meta-analysis of individual participant data, subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with a higher risk of preeclampsia compared with euthyroidism (3.6 versus 2.1 percent, OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.09-2.15) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>Assessment of antibody status is important because women with subclinical hypothyroidism and positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies tend to have the highest risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and adverse outcomes occur at a lower TSH than in women without TPO antibodies [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In the American Thyroid Association (ATA) systematic review (ATA guidelines on thyroid disease during pregnancy), the risk of pregnancy-specific complications was apparent in TPO-positive women with TSH &gt;2.5 mU/L but was not consistently apparent in TPO-negative women until TSH values exceeded 5 to 10 mU/L [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7851.html" rel="external">"Overview of thyroid disease and pregnancy", section on 'Thyroid peroxidase antibodies in euthyroid women'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, limited data suggest that pregnancy outcome for women undergoing in vitro fertilization may be worse among those with preconception TSH levels higher than 2.5 mU/L. As an example, in one study of delivery outcomes after in vitro fertilization, gestational age and birth weight were higher for 150 deliveries where preconception TSH was &lt;2.5 mU/L compared with 45 deliveries where TSH was &gt;2.5 mU/L [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2592188957"><span class="h3">Cognitive impairment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children of women with subclinical hypothyroidism appear to be at risk for neuropsychological impairment. Some [<a href="#rid15">15,19,34-38</a>], but not all [<a href="#rid39">39</a>], observational studies suggest an association between subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy and impaired cognitive development in children. The different outcomes in these studies may be related to differences in the degree of TSH elevation, TPO antibody positivity, maternal iodine status, and cognitive tests performed. In one report of seven- to nine-year-old children, the mean intelligence quotient (IQ) score at age five years was slightly lower in 62 children whose mothers had high serum TSH concentrations (above 98<sup>th</sup> percentile for pregnancy, mean 13.2 mU/L) during the second trimester than in 124 children of mothers who had normal serum TSH concentrations (103 versus 107, p = 0.06) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]; 15 percent of the former had a score of 85 or lower, as compared with 5 percent of the latter. Some experts speculate that preterm delivery may explain some of the neurocognitive dysfunction (when found) in the children of women with subclinical hypothyroidism [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, an analysis of maternal thyroid function at delivery of preterm infants (born ≤34 weeks) and neurodevelopmental outcome assessed at 5.5 years of age demonstrated significant decrements in general cognition and verbal and perceptual performance subscales for each mU/L increment in maternal TSH [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>In another report, 28 children whose mothers had an untreated TSH between 4 and 10 mU/L and negative TPO antibodies during pregnancy were compared with 27 children whose mothers had a TSH &lt;2.5 mU/L. The offspring of mothers with the higher TSH had a development quotient that was 8.67 lower than those with a TSH &lt;2.5 mU/L [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>In another report, 54 children born to mothers with mean TSH 7.81 mU/L in the first trimester (all treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a>) had smaller hippocampal volume and lower scores on memory testing, suggesting either no effect of levothyroxine or that the levothyroxine was not initiated sufficiently early [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>In contrast to these reports, an analysis from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children did not show an association between maternal subclinical hypothyroidism in early pregnancy and childhood performance on National Curriculum Tests administered from ages 4 to 15 years [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. In this analysis, 4616 mothers had thyroid tests performed in the first trimester (median 10 weeks gestation), and 166 had subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as a TSH above the 97.5<sup>th</sup> centile with a free T4 2.5<sup>th</sup> to 97.5<sup>th</sup> centile). The median TSH in mothers with euthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism was 0.97 and 3.22 mU/L, respectively. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2519722251"><span class="h3">Effect of thyroid hormone replacement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is uncertain if thyroid hormone replacement reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy, neonatal, and/or childhood cognitive outcomes in women with subclinical hypothyroidism.

All patients in the universal screening group and all high-risk patients in the case-finding group were tested for free T4, TSH, and TPO antibody levels in the first trimester, and those with positive TPO antibody titers were treated if the serum TSH was greater than 2.5 mU/L. Low-risk women in the case-finding group had their first trimester blood samples assayed postpartum. Overall, there was no significant difference in the total number of adverse outcomes between the case-finding and universal screening groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">However, in a secondary analysis, low-risk women in the universal screening group who were found to have subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH greater than 2.5 mU/L and positive antibody titers) and were treated with thyroid hormone had fewer adverse outcomes (miscarriage, hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, preterm delivery, and many others) than the low-risk patients in the case-finding group with subclinical hypothyroidism who were not treated (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26-0.70) [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a randomized controlled trial of four groups of pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism with or without recurrent pregnancy loss and with or without positive TPO antibodies, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> treatment was associated with reduced pregnancy loss in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].

Studies have shown that approximately 30 percent of women taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> have a serum TSH &gt;4 mU/L when they present for their first prenatal visit [<a href="#rid78">78</a>]. In such women, serum TSH of 4.5 to 10 compared with &lt;2.5 mU/L at the time of presentation is a predictor of miscarriage (odds ratio [OR] 1.80, 95% CI 1.03-3.14) [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. The risk of miscarriage was even higher in women with TSH &gt;10 mU/L at presentation (OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.87-8.37).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2337489170"><span class="h3">Early dose adjustments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given that T4 dose requirements may increase during pregnancy in women with preexisting hypothyroidism, hypothyroid women who are newly pregnant should <strong>preemptively</strong> increase their <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> dose by approximately 30 percent and notify their clinician promptly. We typically accomplish this by increasing the dose from once-daily dosing to a total of nine doses per week (double the daily dose two days each week). Further dose changes are made based upon serum TSH concentrations measured every four weeks until the TSH becomes normal. Using such an approach, only 2 of 25 women in one randomized trial had TSH values greater than 5 mU/L during pregnancy, although eight women had TSH values greater than 2.5 mU/L during the first trimester or greater than 3.0 mU/L during the second or third trimesters, and two had TSH values &lt;0.1 mU/L [<a href="#rid80">80</a>].</p><p>Another approach is to measure serum TSH as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, then again four weeks later, four weeks after any change in the dose of T4, and at least once each trimester [<a href="#rid74">74</a>].

Symptoms may be overlooked or attributed to the pregnancy itself. Many patients are asymptomatic. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of overt primary hypothyroidism during pregnancy is based upon the finding of an elevated population and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration (or above 4.0 mU/L when local reference range is not available) in conjunction with a decreased free thyroxine (T4) concentration (below assay normal using reference range for pregnant women). Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated population and trimester-specific serum TSH concentration and a normal free T4 concentration. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy complications</strong> – Hypothyroidism can have adverse effects on the pregnancy, depending upon the biochemical severity of the hypothyroidism.

We suggest a targeted approach (case finding) rather than universal screening (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We favor screening pregnant women if they are from an area of moderate to severe iodine insufficiency; have symptoms of hypothyroidism; have a family or personal history of thyroid disease or have a personal history of goiter, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disorder, head and neck radiation, recurrent miscarriage or preterm delivery, class 3 obesity, infertility, multiple prior pregnancies (&gt;2), use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/z/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9566" href="/z/d/drug information/9566.html" rel="external">lithium</a>, or recent iodinated radiocontrast; or age &gt;30 years.

In the absence of a history of recurrent miscarriage, some experts (including one editor of this topic) also offer T4 (50 mcg daily) to TPO-positive women who prefer this intervention. Other experts, including the other editor of this topic, do not treat TPO-positive, euthyroid (TSH ≤4 mU/L) pregnant women.

If TSH rises above the population and trimester-specific upper limit of normal (approximately 4 mU/L), we begin treatment with T4.

TSH should be measured every four weeks during the first half of pregnancy because dose adjustments are often required. The goal of treatment is to maintain TSH in the lower half of the trimester-specific reference range (or approximately &lt;2.5 mU/L).
