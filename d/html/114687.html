Aspirin in the former group is termed "primary prevention" and in the latter, "secondary prevention." (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16291.html" rel="external">"Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110006.html" rel="external">"Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">Aspirin</a> is often withheld in patients who report having an allergy or sensitivity to it or to other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin sensitivity is particularly problematic for patients who need an urgent or emergency cardiac or neurologic procedure, such as stenting of an artery (coronary, carotid, or other) or following the diagnosis of an ischemic neurologic event. This topic will discuss an approach for safely introducing low-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg daily) to patients reporting past reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H401029906"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR URGENT ASPIRIN THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following patients may need to have <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> started on an urgent basis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Those suspected of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or an ischemic neurologic event with revascularization not planned</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Those suspected of ACS or an acute ischemic neurologic event with revascularization planned or already executed with stent placement, in whom <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> was not started due to concerns about hypersensitivity</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Those presenting for nonurgent coronary artery revascularization, who have not been taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a></p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2425448341"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF ASPIRIN HYPERSENSITIVITY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4153386144"><span class="h2">Types</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypersensitivity to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is a relatively complicated area of drug allergy, with six distinct types of hypersensitivity reactions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304" href="/d/graphic/90304.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). They are divided into two general categories: reactions that occur with multiple NSAIDs (types 1 to 4) and those that occur with just one NSAID (types 5 and 6), although types 5 and 6 have not been reported with aspirin specifically. Various forms of NSAID hypersensitivity are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2082.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/520.html" rel="external">"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease"</a>.)</p><p>However, for the purpose of introducing low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> urgently to patients with a cardiovascular or neurologic indication, in-depth knowledge of NSAID hypersensitivity reactions is not necessary. Rather, it is primarily important to identify patients whose reactions to NSAIDs involved respiratory symptoms (types 1 and 4)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304" href="/d/graphic/90304.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) because, if-low dose aspirin is to be initiated, these patients require premedication to minimize the asthmatic component of a possible reaction. Without premedication, these reactions can involve potentially severe bronchospasm. (See <a class="local">'Premedication agents and doses'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H157273206"><span class="h3">Respiratory reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who report past reactions to NSAIDs that involved the respiratory tract (ie, wheezing, cough, chest tightness) should be assumed to have a disorder called aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) for the purpose of introducing <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>. AERD (also called NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease [NERD]) is a disorder that presents as the combination of three conditions:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asthma</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adverse reactions to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or other NSAIDs that involve upper and/or lower respiratory symptoms</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis</p><p></p><p>AERD affects approximately 5 to 7 percent of all patients with asthma and typically develops during adulthood over a period of years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For example, the patient may initially have sinus problems, followed after several years by the development of asthma, and then some years after that by adverse reactions to NSAIDs. Many have significant sinus disease that results in reduced or absent sense of smell, and some have had sinus surgery to remove nasal polyps. Patients with AERD may also report severe nasal congestion after drinking alcoholic beverages, which can be another clue to the presence of the disorder. AERD is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/520.html" rel="external">"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease"</a>.)</p><p>Respiratory reactions to NSAIDs in patients with AERD typically begin 30 minutes to three hours after ingestion of an NSAID and present as a dramatic worsening of asthma and nasal congestion with conjunctival injection and facial flushing. A minority of patients also have gastrointestinal symptoms, urticaria/angioedema, or macular rashes. Severe reactions can resemble anaphylaxis, although the mechanism is not immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated, but rather related to dose-dependent inhibition of the cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) enzyme. Some patients with AERD can react to doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> as low as 60 mg, and nearly all will react to 325 mg.</p><p>In the absence of premedication, the asthmatic component of these reactions can be severe, with reductions in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 50 percent or more. Thus, it is important to premedicate patients with AERD, as described below, prior to the introduction of low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>. (See <a class="local">'Premedication agents and doses'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3723224408"><span class="h3">Cutaneous reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cutaneous reactions to NSAIDs are common and usually involve urticaria and/or angioedema. These are classified as types 2, 3, and 5  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304" href="/d/graphic/90304.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Patients with type 2 hypersensitivity have underlying chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), which is defined as unexplained urticaria most days of the week for a period of six weeks or more, even in the absence of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or other triggers. CSU affects approximately 1 percent of the general population. Angioedema (usually of the lip or face) accompanies some urticarial outbreaks in up to 50 percent of affected patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8108.html" rel="external">"Chronic spontaneous urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with type 3 hypersensitivity have no underlying skin disorder and only get urticaria after ingesting NSAIDs, although they may tolerate NSAIDs on some occasions and not others. Patients with type 5 hypersensitivity develop urticaria or angioedema to just one NSAID, although this has not been reported with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> specifically.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H812904095"><span class="h3">Other reactions (including anaphylaxis)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IgE-mediated anaphylaxis to NSAIDs, which is type 6 hypersensitivity, occurs most commonly to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304" href="/d/graphic/90304.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). It has never been conclusively documented with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> specifically, and low-dose aspirin can be given to patients reporting possible anaphylaxis to a different NSAID, although consultation with an allergist is prudent. Patients reporting reactions that resemble anaphylaxis to aspirin specifically should be assumed to have AERD because this is the most likely explanation for severe aspirin reactions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2607062742"><span class="h2">Slow introduction versus desensitization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term desensitization is used in the field of drug allergy to describe methods of slowly introducing medications to patients with documented hypersensitivity. The introduction of low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> to patients with an unconfirmed allergy would not technically be a desensitization in most patients, because the patient may not actually be allergic. In addition, for most forms of NSAID hypersensitivity, reactions are variable, and it is quite possible that the patient will not react at all to any dose of aspirin at the time or only react to relatively high doses but tolerate low doses. The important exceptions are types 1 and 4 (involving respiratory reactions), which do reliably occur with most or all exposures to NSAIDs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2155025689"><span class="h1">DETERMINING THE TYPE OF REACTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3340101033"><span class="h2">Important questions to ask</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To obtain an accurate history of past nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) reactions, the clinician should ask the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Did you have an unwanted reaction to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> in the past?

What dose was taken?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Some patients will report symptoms that are not allergic in nature, but rather are known adverse effects of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, such as gastrointestinal pain, tinnitus, or bleeding. Many of these patients can tolerate low-dose aspirin without recurrence of these adverse effects.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The majority of patients with true <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> hypersensitivity will either describe cutaneous symptoms (ie, hives, angioedema) or reactions that involve respiratory symptoms (wheezing, cough, chest tightness, severe nasal congestion, flushing)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304" href="/d/graphic/90304.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

Patients who were told to avoid all NSAIDs sometimes unknowingly take some other medication in the NSAID group, thus providing information about whether they are reactive to just one NSAID or multiple agents. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">Acetaminophen</a> has extremely weak NSAID properties and is tolerated at usual doses by most patients with NSAID hypersensitivity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do you have asthma and/or a history of sinus problems?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This question should help identify patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), which is the combination of asthma, chronic sinusitis (with nasal polyps), and NSAID hypersensitivity.

Patients with AERD most commonly have respiratory reactions to NSAIDs but occasionally have a mixture of respiratory and cutaneous reactions. These individuals should be premedicated prior to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> desensitization because they may react during it.

(See <a class="local">'Determining the type of reaction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Premedication agents and doses'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The protocol can be done as an outpatient or inpatient, depending on the acuity of the situation. If the patient requires an immediate stenting procedure, other antiplatelet agents can be given instead, and low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> can be introduced once the patient is stabilized. (See <a class="local">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The protocol described here, although it is usually carried out by allergists, can also be administered by clinicians who are not allergy specialists. However, consultation with an allergist is strongly advised if the patient's past reaction to NSAIDs was life threatening or the clinician is not sure how to categorize the past reaction. (See <a class="local">'Referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The protocol for introducing low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> is shown in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112848" href="/d/graphic/112848.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). It generally takes three to five hours to complete. Patients may require treatment for either respiratory or cutaneous reactions during the protocol. The protocol should <strong>not </strong>be aborted if they occur. Instead, the symptoms should be treated with bronchodilators or antihistamines, and the dose that caused the reaction is repeated until the patient no longer reacts. The protocol is then continued until complete. (See <a class="local">'Protocol for aspirin introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Treating symptoms during the protocol'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>This and other protocols are highly successful. Patients who are successfully started on low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> should continue the same daily dose indefinitely. Patients with severe reactions to higher-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs should be counseled that those sensitivities have not been altered by the introduction of low-dose (≤100 mg) aspirin. For example, a patient who had anaphylaxis to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> but has been started on low-dose aspirin must still avoid ibuprofen. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Rajan JP, Wineinger NE, Stevenson DD, White AA.
