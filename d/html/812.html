It is also the origin of the most common malignancy in women [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The risk of developing breast cancer has been linked to both endogenous (eg, nulliparity, early menarche, older age at first pregnancy) and exogenous hormonal influences [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/792.html" rel="external">"Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7427.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks"</a>.)</p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of breast cancer, particularly estrogen-associated breast carcinogenesis, are incompletely understood. Increasing evidence points to developmental differences in the breast that may influence the risk of developing cancer. Thus, an understanding of breast development and morphology, and the biochemical factors that influence it, is pertinent to the study of both premalignant and malignant conditions affecting the breast.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3705575541"><span class="h2">Gross anatomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mature adult breast lies between the second and sixth ribs in the vertical axis and between the sternal edge and the midaxillary line in the horizontal axis. Breast tissue also projects into the axilla as the axillary tail of Spence. </p><p>The breast comprises three major structures: skin, subcutaneous tissue, and breast tissue, which is composed of both epithelial and stromal elements. The epithelial components are branching ducts that connect the structural and functional units of the breast (the lobules) to the nipple. The stroma, which comprises the majority of the breast volume in the nonlactating state, is composed of adipose and fibrous connective tissue.</p><p>The skin of the breast is thin and contains hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and exocrine sweat glands. </p><p>The nipple and areola have distinctive and specialized structures that make them easily identified from their histologic appearance. The nipple has abundant sensory nerve endings and sebaceous and apocrine sweat glands but not hair follicles. The stroma consists of dense collagen enriched in smooth muscle tissue, which can give rise to leiomyomas in this location  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68667" href="/d/graphic/68667.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The areola is more or less circular and pigmented, measuring 15 to 60 mm in diameter. The Montgomery (also known as Morgagni) tubercles, which are located near the periphery of the areola, are elevations formed by the openings of the sebaceous glands, also known as Montgomery glands. </p><p>The ducts from the breast parenchyma converge at the nipple and expand to form the lactiferous sinus. The lactiferous sinus communicates with the surface of the nipple via the collecting duct. The proximal portion of the collecting duct is similar to the remainder of the duct system, but the superficial portion (ie, toward the nipple orifice) is lined by squamous epithelium that can extend into the terminal portion of the lactiferous duct. The squamocolumnar junction is the area where the squamous epithelium meets the glandular epithelium, which is abrupt. Extension of the squamous epithelium into and beyond the lactiferous sinus is pathological, a condition referred to as squamous metaplasia, resulting in obstruction of the duct system. </p><p>The superficial pectoral fascia envelops the breast and is continuous with the superficial abdominal fascia (of Camper). The undersurface of the breast lies on the deep pectoral fascia, covering the pectoralis major and serratus anterior muscles. Connecting these two fascial layers are fibrous bands (the Cooper suspensory ligaments) that represent a natural means of support for the breast. The deep surface is macroscopically well demarcated; however, microscopic breast glandular elements can extend into and even beyond the deep fascial plane. Therefore, total mastectomy may not result in the removal of all the glandular tissue. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3120396540"><span class="h2">Histology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Microscopically, the breast tissue is comprised of epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The epithelial portion comprises secretory parts called acini that connect to a series of ducts that increase in diameter as they approach the nipple. </p><p>The terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU) is the functional and structural unit of the breast. The TDLU comprises the distal smallest ducts (terminal duct) and the acini attached to them  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91348" href="/d/graphic/91348.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). The epithelial elements of the TDLU, the acini and terminal duct, are embedded in the intralobular stroma, which is highly specialized and more cellular and hormonally responsive compared with the interlobular stroma, which is comparatively fibrous and hormonally less sensitive. Knowledge of the structure of the periductal and lobular stroma is important in the understanding of the many disease processes. Most of the proliferative lesions as well as neoplastic lesions in the breast are derived from the TDLU. </p><p>A key feature vital to the understanding of the pathological changes in the breast is the specialized two-cell-type lining of the entire duct and lobular system. Under the light microscope, the two cell layers are clearly discernable, with the columnar or cuboidal larger and taller cells lining the luminal aspect of the duct and acini with an outer cell layer composed of the smaller, spindle-shaped myoepithelial cell layer, which lies between the epithelial cell layer and the basal lamina. The myoepithelial cell layer is continuous and lies parallel to the long axis of the duct system. The contractile properties of the myoepithelial cells contribute to the flow of milk during lactation. </p><p>Appreciation of the two-cell-type layer is critical in distinguishing benign from malignant processes. For example, in sclerosing adenosis and nipple adenomas, which are benign lesions, the two-cell layer is evident by routine histologic examination or ancillary immunohistochemical stains to detect the presence of the myoepithelial cell layer  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef138842" href="/d/graphic/138842.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). By contrast, in well-differentiated malignancies like tubular carcinoma, the myoepithelial cell layer is lost around invasive glands and confirms the malignant nature of these lesions, which can at times be challenging by morphology alone  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef138841" href="/d/graphic/138841.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Blood supply and lymphatic drainage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The principal blood supply of the breast is derived from the internal mammary artery. Approximately one-third of the blood supply (mainly to the upper outer quadrant) is provided by the lateral thoracic arteries.</p><p>The lymphatic drainage of the breast is through both superficial (subepithelial and subdermal) and deep lymphatic vessels, and the lymph flows unidirectionally from the superficial to the deep plexus. Lymph flow from the deep subcutaneous and intramammary vessels moves centrifugally toward the axillary, internal mammary (IM), and clavicular lymph nodes. While most areas of the breast drain to the axillary nodes, drainage can also flow simultaneously or solely to the other nodal sites [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Initial studies estimated that approximately 3 percent of the lymph from the breast drains to the IM chain, whereas 97 percent flows to the axillary nodes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, a 1972 study using intraparenchymal radioactive gold injections in women without breast cancer found drainage to the IM nodes occurred in 36 percent overall [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p>Lymphatic mapping in patients with breast cancer has delineated drainage patterns for palpable and nonpalpable lesions. In a retrospective study that included 678 breast cancer patients with nodes visualized following lymphoscintigraphy, all palpable and nonpalpable centrally located lesions (n = 59) drained to the axillary lymph nodes [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, approximately 35 percent of the lesions also drained to the IM and/or clavicular chain. Most breast lesions (palpable and nonpalpable) from all quadrants drain to the axillary nodes.</p><p>Drainage to the axillary lymph nodes based upon location of the lesion includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Upper outer quadrant (n = 336) – 95.8 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower outer quadrant (n = 88) – 97.7 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Upper inner quadrant (n = 145) – 93.1 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower inner quadrant (n = 50) – 88.0 percent</p><p></p><p>Lesions in the inner quadrants of the breast were significantly more likely to drain to IM lymph nodes compared with lesions in the outer quadrants (37.4 versus 14.4 percent) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Drainage to the IM lymph nodes based upon location of the lesion includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Upper outer quadrant – 10.4 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower outer quadrant – 29.5 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Upper inner quadrant – 32.4 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower inner quadrant – 52.0 percent</p><p></p><p>Largely for the purpose of determining metastatic progression in breast cancer, axillary lymph nodes are grouped by anatomic location and often described by dividing them into arbitrary levels. Level I lymph nodes lie lateral to the lateral border of the pectoralis minor muscle, level II nodes lie behind the pectoralis minor muscle, and level III nodes are located medial to the medial border of the pectoralis minor muscle. </p><p>The IM lymph nodes lie within extrapleural fat in the intercostal spaces in close proximity to the IM vessels. Like the axillary nodes, the IM nodes receive lymph drainage from all quadrants of the breast [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The number of lymph nodes described in the IM chain is variable. Nodes can extend from the fifth intercostal space to the retroclavicular region, but the most prevalent ones are in the upper three interspaces  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74746" href="/d/graphic/74746.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">NORMAL DEVELOPMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Human breast development is a progressive process that is initiated during embryonic life  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91347" href="/d/graphic/91347.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>). The breasts develop from ventral epidermal ridges (milk line), which appear in a five-week embryo and extend from the axilla to the upper medial thigh  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63944" href="/d/graphic/63944.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In humans only the extreme ends of this ridge, in the axilla or vulva, persist. The nipple is formed by evagination of the mammary pit. Failure of this process leads to a congenitally inverted nipple. </p><p>At birth, the breast rudiment is formed by 10 to 12 primitive ductal elements located beneath the nipple-areolar complex. In the prepubertal years, these ducts exhibit relatively slow but steady growth and branching, with canalization into ductal structures. In boys, breast development ceases at this stage.</p><p>Although puberty marks the beginning of glandular maturation, full breast differentiation is attained only with subsequent pregnancy and lactation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Pubertal changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In girls, puberty usually begins around age 10 to 12 under the influence of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7438.html" rel="external">"Physiology of gonadotropin-releasing hormone"</a>). The cells of the anterior pituitary gland release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which promote maturation of the ovarian follicles and their secretion of estrogens, primarily in the form of 17-beta estradiol. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3803.html" rel="external">"Molecular biology and physiology of estrogen action"</a>.)</p><p>Breast development from puberty to adulthood is defined by several parameters, including external appearance, volume, number of structures present in the mammary gland, and the degree of branching or differentiation of the individual structures  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68667" href="/d/graphic/68667.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88523" href="/d/graphic/88523.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The external appearance of the breast from childhood to maturity has been divided into five phases by Tanner  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038" href="/d/graphic/72038.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5849.html" rel="external">"Normal puberty"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Lobule formation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>From a microanatomic standpoint, puberty is marked by increased growth and branching of the ducts to form club-shaped terminal end buds; this is accompanied by an increase in the stromal component [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Growing terminal end buds form new branches, twigs, and small ductules (termed alveolar buds). We use the term alveolar bud to identify those structures that are morphologically more developed than the terminal end bud but more primitive than the terminal structure of the mature resting breast, the acinus. With further branching, alveolar buds become smaller and more numerous, and then they are called ductules.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Type 1 lobules</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When an average of 11 alveolar buds/ductules cluster around a terminal duct, they form the type 1 lobule  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52636" href="/d/graphic/52636.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>).</p><p>Lobule formation is apparent within one to two years after the onset of the menses. Thereafter, glandular development is variable. Full differentiation of the mammary gland to its maximal degree of branching and secretory activity is a gradual process that takes many years  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91351" href="/d/graphic/91351.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>); it may never be attained if pregnancy does not supervene.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Type 2 and 3 lobules</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The breast tissue of adult women contains two other identifiable types of lobules in addition to the type 1 lobule. The changing levels of estrogen and progesterone during menstrual cycles stimulate the type 1 lobule to sprout new alveolar buds and gradually evolve to more mature structures called type 2 and type 3 lobules  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64382" href="/d/graphic/64382.html" rel="external">picture 9</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72142" href="/d/graphic/72142.html" rel="external">picture 10</a>). The number of alveolar buds per lobule increases from approximately 11 in the type 1 lobule to 47 in type 2 lobule and 80 in the type 3 lobule, respectively  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74484" href="/d/graphic/74484.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Parity and age both influence breast architecture [<a href="#rid3">3,13</a>]. The breasts of nulliparous women contain more undifferentiated structures, such as terminal ducts and type 1 lobules (65 to 80 percent of the total lobular component), with only occasional type 2 and 3 lobules. In contrast, the predominant structure in the breast of parous premenopausal women is the most differentiated type 3 lobule (70 to 90 percent of all lobules). By the end of the 40s, the breasts of both nulliparous and parous women are architecturally similar, containing predominantly type 1 lobules. However, they differ markedly with regard to cell kinetics and biologic behavior. In parous women, a first full-term pregnancy between the ages of 14 and 20 correlates with a significant increase in the number of type 3 lobules that predominate until the age of 40, after which a decrease in the number of type 3 lobules occurs [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This fact may provide some explanation as to the protective effects of an early first pregnancy on the risk of breast cancer. (See <a class="local">'Menopause'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Type 4 lobules</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Progression from type 3 to type 4 lobules is attained during pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Early pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1648934292"><span class="h2">Menstrual cycle-related histologic changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both epithelial and stromal components of the terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU) undergo histologic changes with the menstrual cycle.<strong> </strong>These changes are variable among the lobules. During the follicular phase, the epithelium lining the lobules (luminal cells) is small and cuboidal in shape and does not display secretory or mitotic activity. The intralobular stromal tissue is dense and hypocellular. In the luteal phase, the acini are open and enlarged due to luminal secretions. The intralobular stroma is loose, edematous, and more cellular than in the follicular phase.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Pregnancy and lactation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pregnant woman undergoes anatomic and physiologic changes in almost every organ system. During this time, the maximum branching capability of the breast is expressed, and the secretory acinus that is formed during pregnancy represents a terminal outgrowth that marks the full extent of glandular differentiation. Fully differentiated secretory cells are characterized by their ability to synthesize and secrete milk proteins (caseins) and lipids  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91352" href="/d/graphic/91352.html" rel="external">picture 11</a>). </p><p>During pregnancy, the breast attains its maximum development in two distinct phases, characteristic of the early and late stages of pregnancy. Ductular sprouting predominates in the first trimester, while lobular formation exceeds ductal sprouting in the second trimester.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Early pregnancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Under the influence of chorionic gonadotropin, many secretory glands develop from each bud, forming the type 3 lobule. Further proliferation of the distal elements of the ductal tree marks the progression from a type 3 lobule to a type 4 lobule  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51142" href="/d/graphic/51142.html" rel="external">picture 12</a>). In these newly formed lobules, the epithelial cells composing each acinus not only increase greatly in number due to active cell division but also increase in size, mainly because of cytoplasmic enlargement [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>In mid-pregnancy, the lobules further enlarge and increase in number. They surround the duct from which their central branch proceeds so thickly that the chief duct, the terminal or intralobular terminal duct, can no longer be recognized. The transition between the terminal ducts and the budding acini is gradual, making the histologic distinction between the two of them difficult; both show evidence of early secretory activity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Later pregnancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mammary changes during the second half of pregnancy are chiefly a continuation and accentuation of secretory activity. Further progressive branching continues with less prominent bud formation. The formation of fully differentiated secretory units or acini becomes increasingly evident. Proliferation of new acini is reduced, and the lumen of already formed units becomes distended by the accumulation of secretory material or colostrum.</p><p>Just before and during parturition, there is a new wave of mitotic activity within the mammary gland. At this time, and during lactation, the process of further growth and differentiation may be observed in the same lobule type, side by side with the process of milk secretion [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. At this point, the glandular component of the breast has increased to the point where the breast is composed primarily of epithelial elements, with very little stroma.

The progesterone expression is noted in normal breast ductal and lobular cell nuclei, with an expression pattern similar to that of ER-alpha.</p><p>Estrogens are considered to play the major role in promoting proliferation of the breast epithelium. Estradiol acts locally on the mammary gland, stimulating DNA synthesis and promoting bud formation [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

Progesterone acts in conjunction with estrogen to regulate breast development through its specific receptor (PR) on breast epithelial cells. As evidence of the importance of progesterone, during the normal menstrual cycle, the breast epithelium does not exhibit maximal proliferation during the follicular phase, when estrogen secretion is at its peak, but instead during the luteal phase, when progesterone levels are at their highest and estrogen levels have begun to decline.

With progressive differentiation into type 2 and 3 lobules under the hormonal influences of the menstrual cycle, there is a concomitant reduction in proliferative activity. Compared with the cells comprising type 1 lobules, the rate of cellular proliferation, as determined by the percentage of cells that stain positively with Ki-67, is decreased threefold in the type 2 lobules and 10-fold in the type 3 lobules  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61091" href="/d/graphic/61091.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid35">35,39</a>].</p><p>The content of ER-alpha and PR in the lobular structures of the breast is directly proportional to the rate of cellular proliferation [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].

However, despite their architectural similarity, there are important differences between the type 1 lobules of the nulliparous woman and the regressed type 1 lobules of the parous woman. Type 1 lobules of nulliparous women have a very active intralobular stroma, whereas those of the parous woman are more hyalinized and indicative of a regressed structure  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91349" href="/d/graphic/91349.html" rel="external">picture 13</a>). Another important difference is the higher proliferative activity in the type 1 lobules of nulliparous compared with parous women. The cells of both type 1 and type 3 lobules in the parous breast are predominantly in the G0 phase or resting phase, while in type 1 lobules of the nulliparous breast, proliferating cells predominate and the fraction of cells in G0 is quite low. Thus, parity, in addition to exerting an important influence on the lobular composition of the breast, profoundly influences its proliferative activity.</p><p>These biologic differences may provide some explanation for the increased susceptibility of the breast of nulliparous women to develop breast cancer. It is hypothesized that unlike parous women, the type 1 lobule found in the breast of nulliparous women never went through the process of differentiation, seldom reaching the type 3 lobule, and never the type 4 stages [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Although the lobules of parous women regress at menopause to type 1, they are permanently genetically imprinted by the differentiation process in some way that protects them from neoplastic transformation, even though these changes are no longer morphologically observable. Thus, they are biologically different from the type 1 lobule of nulliparous women.</p><p>The postulated mechanism of protection conferred by early full-term pregnancy is that the degree of differentiation acquired through early pregnancy changes the "genomic signature" that differentiates the type 1 lobule from the early parous women from that of the nulliparous women by shifting the stem cell population from "stem cell 1" to "stem cell 2." The genomic signature of the stem cell 2 differs from that of the stem cell 1 cells, and the specific gene products synthesized by the stem cell 2 population can be detected in the blood after the pregnancy event is over [<a href="#rid47">47-49</a>]. Detection of these gene products in circulating blood indicates that the breast has completed the process of differentiation, thus serving as an indicator of the presence of a protective factor, namely, a surrogate marker of lower susceptibility to develop cancer in early parous women. The pattern of gene expression of the stem cell 2 could potentially be used as useful intermediate end points for evaluating the degree of mammary gland differentiation and for evaluating preventive agents like human chorionic gonadotropin.</p><p>The extent of age-related menopausal involution (regression or atrophy) of the type 1 lobule appears to influence the risk of breast cancer and may modify other breast cancer risk factors, including parity. It has also been postulated that unresponsive lobules that fail to undergo differentiation under the stimulus of pregnancy and lactation are responsible for cancer development despite the parity history [<a href="#rid49">49-51</a>]. </p><p>Support for these observations was provided in a report that focused on breast biopsy specimens from 8736 women with benign breast disease [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

They defined complete involution as ≥75 percent of the lobules involuted, partial involution as 1 to 74 percent involuted, and none as 0 percent involuted.

Women with no involution had a higher mean acinar count (32 acini/lobule) than women with partial (19.7 acini/lobule) or complete involution (7.7 acini/lobule). There was a stepwise increase in breast cancer risk with increasing numbers of acini and decreasing degree of involution per lobule. Another study assessed lobule type rather than the degree of involution but arrived at a similar conclusion: women with more type 1 lobules, with more complete involution, have a lower breast cancer risk [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that breast cancer risk is decreased in women with more type 1 lobules and more complete involution (regression) of lobular structures.

It is generally believed that the initiation of breast cancer results from uncontrolled cellular proliferation and/or aberrant apoptosis as a consequence of cumulative genetic damages that activate proto-oncogenes and/or inactivate tumor suppressor genes. These genetic alterations can be inherited as germline mutations or be acquired (somatic mutations) as a result of cumulative exposure to environmental carcinogens (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/785.html" rel="external">"Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes"</a>). The classic two-stage model of carcinogenesis further postulates that the altered genotype of the initiated cell is irreversible and that tumor progression, the second stage in carcinogenesis, depends upon further epigenetic changes that are potentially reversible.</p><p>It remains to be determined whether this animal model of chemical carcinogenesis holds true for breast cancer and what role is played by estrogen. In rodent models of carcinogen-induced and spontaneous mammary cancer, prolonged exposure to both estrogens and progestins can support initial tumor formation and early tumor growth. In vitro, 17-beta estradiol induces phenotypic changes indicative of neoplastic transformation in cultured human breast epithelial cells that are similar to those induced by the chemical carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Furthermore, human studies now provide a clear link between exposure to exogenous hormones and a risk for breast cancer.

As an example, in a case-control study of disease-concordant monozygotic twins, the twin with earlier onset of menses was five times more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer before the other [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. In contrast, other hormonal factors (ie, later first pregnancy, lower parity, later menopause) did not predict an earlier diagnosis when both twins were affected. These data suggest that genotypic differences exist, even among patients with an inherited genetic susceptibility. </p><p>Even though the cause of breast cancer and the ultimate mechanisms through which an early pregnancy protects from cancer development remain largely unknown, comparative studies of normal and neoplastic breast development have unraveled similarities with experimental models that validate their extrapolation for testing hypotheses on the initiation and progression of human breast cancer. From these studies, the following can be concluded:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The process of mammary gland differentiation is the result of complex interactions of ovarian, pituitary, and placental hormones, which in turn induce inhibition of cell proliferation, downregulation of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, activation of specific genes, and expression of extracellular matrix proteins in the normal breast.

(See <a class="local">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Histology</strong> – Breast tissue is composed of both epithelial and stromal elements. The epithelial components are branching ducts that connect the structural and functional units of the breast (the lobules) to the nipple. The stroma, which comprises the majority of the breast volume in the nonlactating state, is composed of adipose and fibrous connective tissue. (See <a class="local">'Histology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Blood supply</strong> – The principal blood supply of the breast is derived from the internal mammary artery. Approximately one-third of the blood supply (mainly to the upper outer quadrant) is provided by the lateral thoracic arteries. (See <a class="local">'Blood supply and lymphatic drainage'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Lymphatic drainage</strong> – Lymph flow from the deep subcutaneous and intramammary vessels moves centrifugally toward the axillary and internal mammary lymph nodes. The majority (97 percent) of the lymph flows to the axillary nodes. (See <a class="local">'Blood supply and lymphatic drainage'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Normal development</strong> – Human breast development is a progressive process that is initiated during embryonic life. Although puberty marks the beginning of glandular maturation, full breast differentiation is attained only with subsequent pregnancy and lactation. (See <a class="local">'Normal development'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pregnancy and lactation</strong> – During pregnancy, the maximum branching capability of the breast is expressed, and the secretory acinus that is formed during pregnancy represents a terminal outgrowth that marks the full extent of glandular differentiation. Fully differentiated secretory cells are characterized by their ability to synthesize and secrete milk proteins and lipids. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy and lactation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Involution</strong> – The postlactational breast requires a combination of lactogenic hormone deprivation and local signals to undergo glandular regression (involution), a process characterized by apoptotic cell death and tissue remodeling. (See <a class="local">'Lobular involution (regression)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Menopause</strong> – After menopause, the breast undergoes regression, with atrophy of the glandular elements and a marked decrease in the number of lobules. Concurrently, the fibrous connective tissue component of the stroma decreases, and adipose tissue accumulates. (See <a class="local">'Menopause'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hormonal influences</strong> – Normal ductal development requires both estrogen and progesterone. Progesterone acts in conjunction with estrogen to regulate breast development through its specific receptor on breast epithelial cells. (See <a class="local">'Hormonal influences on breast development'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Parity, lobular differentiation, and breast cancer risk</strong> – Parity influences the lobular composition as well as the proliferative activity of the breast. The lobules of nulliparous women have a higher proliferative activity than those of parous women. These differences may influence the risk of developing breast cancer. (See <a class="local">'Parity, lobular differentiation, and breast cancer risk'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Architectural patterns and breast pathology</strong> – Breast disease may develop in response to variations in development, proliferative activity, and hormone receptor content in the mature breast. (See <a class="local">'Architectural patterns and breast pathology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2685391060"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Jose Russo, MD (deceased), who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Siegel R, Ward E, Brawley O, Jemal A.
