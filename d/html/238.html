The former include injuries and acute or chronic degeneration or inflammation of the shoulder joint, tendons, surrounding ligaments, or periarticular structures [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>An overview of common presentations and causes of shoulder discomfort and a basic clinical approach to diagnosis are reviewed. In-depth discussions of the shoulder examination and of the diagnosis and treatment of specific disorders of the shoulder are found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13814.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the shoulder"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/239.html" rel="external">"Rotator cuff tendinopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/241.html" rel="external">"Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/225.html" rel="external">"Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/232.html" rel="external">"Multidirectional instability of the shoulder"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105723.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis", section on 'Shoulder'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A complex network of anatomic structures endows the human shoulder with tremendous mobility, greater than any other joint in the body  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90843" href="/z/d/graphic/90843.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90842" href="/z/d/graphic/90842.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90845" href="/z/d/graphic/90845.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The shoulder girdle is composed of three bones (clavicle, scapula, and proximal humerus) and four articular surfaces (sternoclavicular [SC], acromioclavicular [AC], glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995" href="/z/d/graphic/72709.html" rel="external">figure 2A-C</a>). The glenohumeral joint, commonly referred to as the shoulder joint, is the principal articulation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Glenohumeral structures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The glenohumeral joint is loosely constrained within a thin capsule bounded by surrounding muscles and ligaments  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90838" href="/z/d/graphic/90838.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90839" href="/z/d/graphic/90839.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90840" href="/z/d/graphic/90840.html" rel="external">figure 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90841" href="/z/d/graphic/90841.html" rel="external">figure 6</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90836" href="/z/d/graphic/90836.html" rel="external">figure 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90837" href="/z/d/graphic/90837.html" rel="external">figure 8</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98022" href="/z/d/graphic/98022.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>). The shoulder's great mobility is due in large part to the shallow depth of the glenoid and the limited contact between the glenoid and the humeral head  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709" href="/z/d/graphic/72709.html" rel="external">figure 2A</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54102" href="/z/d/graphic/54102.html" rel="external">figure 2B</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69995" href="/z/d/graphic/69995.html" rel="external">figure 2C</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70854" href="/z/d/graphic/70854.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90843" href="/z/d/graphic/90843.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Only 25 percent of the humeral head surface makes contact with the glenoid. The labrum, a fibrocartilaginous ring attached to the outer rim of the glenoid, provides some additional depth and stability.</p><p>The shallowness and small surface area of the glenohumeral joint make it susceptible to instability and injury, requiring that stability be provided primarily by extrinsic supports. Surrounding muscles and ligaments provide these supports. The glenohumeral ligaments serve as the primary static stabilizers  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98022" href="/z/d/graphic/98022.html" rel="external">figure 9</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90837" href="/z/d/graphic/90837.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). They include the superior, middle, and inferior glenohumeral ligaments. The rotator cuff serves as the primary dynamic stabilizer. As such, a primary function of the rotator cuff is to hold the humeral head within the glenoid ("socket") of the joint while enabling full mobility. The rotator cuff is composed of four muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor) that form a cuff around the head of the humerus, to which these muscles attach.</p><p>Shoulder pain is frequently caused by an acute or chronic injury of the rotator cuff, most often the supraspinatus muscle or tendon  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72027" href="/z/d/graphic/72027.html" rel="external">figure 10</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709" href="/z/d/graphic/72709.html" rel="external">figure 2A</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69995" href="/z/d/graphic/69995.html" rel="external">figure 2C</a>). The supraspinatus originates on the supraspinous fossa of the superior-posterior scapula, superior to the scapular spine, and inserts on the greater tubercle of the superior-lateral humeral head just posterior to the biceps tendon. Proximal to its insertion, it passes, along with the subacromial bursa, through the narrow space between the acromion process and the humeral head.</p><p>The acromion is a projection of the scapular spine that extends superiorly and anteriorly over the humeral head  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62016" href="/z/d/graphic/62016.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53837" href="/z/d/graphic/53837.html" rel="external">figure 11</a>). Thus, with the shoulder in abduction, the supraspinatus is susceptible to impingement between the greater tubercle and the acromion. Activities involving repeated abduction with impingement can cause repetitive muscle and tendon trauma and ischemic compression of the tendon.</p><p>The subacromial bursa, also referred to as the subdeltoid bursa, serves the important function of protecting the rotator cuff tendons from the pressure and friction of the underside of the acromion.</p><p>Three other muscles contribute to the rotator cuff  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72027" href="/z/d/graphic/72027.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>). The infraspinatus arises from the infraspinatus fossa of the posterior scapula and inserts on the lateral humeral head (greater tuberosity), just posterior to the supraspinatus where their insertions blend. The teres minor arises from the inferior-posterior scapula and blends with the infraspinatus to attach on the lateral humeral head (greater tuberosity). The subscapularis, the largest of the four cuff muscles, arises from the anterior scapula, inferior to the coracoid, and attaches to the anterior humeral head (lesser tuberosity).</p><p>The rotator cuff muscles rotate the humerus internally (subscapularis) and externally (infraspinatus primarily and teres minor), and contribute to abduction (supraspinatus), along with the deltoid muscle [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The subscapularis is capable of generating approximately twice the force of the external rotators [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The deltoid is the most superficial muscle overriding the glenohumeral area, and it acts as the primary shoulder abductor. It arises from the acromion and attaches to the midhumerus.</p><p>The rotator cuff compresses the humoral head in the glenoid fossa, thereby stabilizing the glenohumeral joint, and serves to counterbalance the elevating forces of the deltoid as well as the forces of other muscles acting on the humerus [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Weakness of the rotator cuff can lead to superior subluxation of the humeral head when the shoulder is abducted beyond 90 degrees, predisposing to impingement syndromes.</p><p>The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99165" href="/z/d/graphic/99165.html" rel="external">figure 12</a>). Suprascapular nerve injury causes a peripheral neuropathy that is estimated to account for 1 to 2 percent of pathologic shoulder conditions [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Injuries to the suprascapular nerve arise most often from mechanical compression, occasionally caused by cysts or tumors. Suprascapular neuropathy causes pain, progressive atrophy, and weakened abduction and external rotation of the shoulder and can be difficult to distinguish from rotator cuff tears.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Extraglenohumeral structures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Shoulder motion is also dependent upon the AC and SC joints and the scapulothoracic articulation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995" href="/z/d/graphic/72709.html" rel="external">figure 2A-C</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62016" href="/z/d/graphic/62016.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90842" href="/z/d/graphic/90842.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90844" href="/z/d/graphic/90844.html" rel="external">figure 13</a>). Together, they are capable of compensating significantly for decreased motion at the glenohumeral joint due to injury. The AC joint is a common site of injury.</p><p>Coordination between glenohumeral and scapulothoracic motion is particularly important for shoulder function. Proper scapular motion and stability allows the humeral head to remain properly seated in the glenoid during abduction, provides a solid base from which the rotator cuff muscles can move the humerus, and enables proper elevation of the coracoacromial arch, thereby diminishing the risk of impingement syndrome  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50894" href="/z/d/graphic/50894.html" rel="external">figure 14</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90842" href="/z/d/graphic/90842.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). The muscles primarily responsible for scapular stability and motion are the trapezius, serratus anterior, rhomboids, and levator scapulae.</p><p>The tendon of the long head of the biceps runs in the bicipital groove between the greater and lesser tubercles of the anterior proximal humerus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59976" href="/z/d/graphic/59976.html" rel="external">figure 15</a>). Transverse tendinous structures (either a continuation of the subscapularis tendon or a distinct transverse humeral ligament [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]) prevent subluxation of the tendon. Anterior shoulder pain can be caused by injury or chronic degeneration of the biceps tendon.</p><p>Several muscles provide additional dynamic stability to the glenohumeral joint, thereby supporting the rotator cuff, which is the primary dynamic stabilizer. These muscles include the teres major, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis major.</p><p>Although the neural networks of the brachial plexus form proximally to the glenohumeral joint, the major peripheral nerves emanating from the plexus pass inferiorly to the joint  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70189" href="/z/d/graphic/70189.html" rel="external">figure 16</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69782" href="/z/d/graphic/69782.html" rel="external">figure 17</a>). Pain from an injury to the plexus or related peripheral nerves from acute or chronic injury can present as shoulder pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5282.html" rel="external">"Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">HISTORY AND PAIN PATTERNS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with acute shoulder pain often seek treatment following an episode of trauma. Diagnosis in this case can often be made by observation, gentle palpation, and plain radiographs. If pain does not follow an acute episode of trauma, the clinician must first distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic causes of shoulder pain.</p><p>Once traumatic injury and potentially dangerous extrinsic causes have been excluded  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55507" href="/z/d/graphic/55507.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), the clinician is generally faced with one of several common patterns of shoulder pain, which are described below.</p><p>Patients experiencing a problem intrinsic to the shoulder may present with complaints of pain provoked by specific movement(s), stiffness or lack of flexibility, weakness or loss of function, instability, or a combination of these symptoms.</p><p>A standard pain history (ie, onset, duration, palliation/provocation, quality, location, and radiation) aids diagnosis. The clinician should inquire about activities that exacerbate symptoms either at work (eg, lifting overhead, painting) or leisure (eg, racquet sports, swimming). In addition, questions about previous injuries and treatment, including past surgery, and about comorbidities such as diabetes (which increases the risk of adhesive capsulitis) are important.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Anterolateral shoulder pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anterolateral shoulder pain aggravated by reaching overhead is a common pain pattern. It is often associated with impingement syndrome and the various stages of rotator cuff tendinopathy (simple strain, uncomplicated tendinopathy, chronic calcific tendinopathy, tendinopathy complicated by tear). Rotator cuff tendinopathy with tendon tear is suspected when pain is complicated by weakness and a notable loss of strength in external rotation or abduction (a loss that is not attributable to poor effort). Adhesive capsulitis (ie, frozen shoulder) is the most likely diagnosis when pain is accompanied by stiffness and a significant loss of movement in external rotation or abduction. Labral tears may present with anterolateral pain, although pain may be deep and poorly localized, and may be associated with instability and a catching sensation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/239.html" rel="external">"Rotator cuff tendinopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/241.html" rel="external">"Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/225.html" rel="external">"Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/232.html" rel="external">"Multidirectional instability of the shoulder"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13815.html" rel="external">"Superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears"</a>.)</p><p>Conditions affecting the acromioclavicular (AC) joint, such as AC separation (if trauma has occurred) or osteoarthritis, are suspected when pain is well localized (the patient often uses one finger to point to the end of the clavicle). Involvement of the glenohumeral joint is suspected when pain is aggravated by movement in multiple directions. Pain originating from the tendon of the long head of the biceps can create well-localized anterior shoulder pain aggravated by lifting or carrying objects like shopping bags. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/254.html" rel="external">"Acromioclavicular joint injuries ("separated" shoulder)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13813.html" rel="external">"Acromioclavicular joint disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/229.html" rel="external">"Biceps tendinopathy and tendon rupture"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105723.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis", section on 'Shoulder'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Posterior shoulder pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Posterior shoulder pain is the least common pattern of the intrinsic conditions affecting the shoulder. Rotator cuff tendinopathy involving the external rotators (teres minor and infraspinatus) can cause focal pain or sometimes referred pain over the scapula. Often, patients with infraspinatus tendinopathy complain of pain or weakness when performing activities requiring external rotation. More diffuse pain over the general area of the superior trapezius is more commonly referred from the cervical spine (cervical strain or radiculopathy). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/239.html" rel="external">"Rotator cuff tendinopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5271.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Poorly localized pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pain that is poorly localized or vaguely described may be intrinsic to the shoulder but is often referred from other structures (ie, extrinsic) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Pain arising from intrinsic causes often occurs with associated stiffness or limited motion. Night pain commonly occurs with these conditions. Glenohumeral arthritis, avascular necrosis of the humeral head, pathologic bone cysts or tumors, large rotator cuff tears, and adhesive capsulitis are examples of shoulder pathology that can manifest poorly localized or generalized pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105723.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122049.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/241.html" rel="external">"Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/225.html" rel="external">"Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)"</a>.)</p><p>Shoulder pain can be referred from several regions, including the neck or abdomen. Cervical nerve root impingement can produce sharp pain radiating from the neck into the posterior shoulder area and arm. Referred pain may also be caused by a compression neuropathy or arise from bone  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55507" href="/z/d/graphic/55507.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Poorly localized shoulder pain in the setting of a normal shoulder examination should raise concern for intra-abdominal or other extrinsic pathology (eg, pain from gallbladder disease or acute coronary syndrome may radiate to the shoulder). Although uncommon, elbow pathology may refer to the shoulder.</p><p>Shoulder pain may also reflect psychological overtones of cases under litigation or malingering; however, such diagnoses should be entertained only after true pathology has been excluded.

Falls directly onto the shoulder can cause acromioclavicular separation. Falls or direct blows can cause a clavicle fracture. Falls onto an outstretched arm are the most common cause of proximal humerus fractures. Blunt trauma, sports injury, and, less often, violent muscular contractions such as those that occur with generalized seizures can cause glenohumeral dislocations. Generally, the patient can localize pain to the site of injury, and deformity may be present. Posttraumatic shoulder pain can also be referred from intra-abdominal injuries causing diaphragmatic irritation (eg, Kehr sign triggered by bleeding from liver or spleen).

The anatomy of the shoulder is complex and the differential diagnosis broad. Fortunately, patients with shoulder pathology most often present in stereotypical fashion. By following the basic approach outlined here  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82676" href="/z/d/graphic/82676.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), clinicians should be able to diagnose and either manage or refer appropriately the great majority of patients with shoulder complaints.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3206430477"><span class="h2">Step one: Traumatic versus nontraumatic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step is to determine whether a traumatic injury is present. Most often, this determination is straightforward based on the patient's history, although delayed presentations do occur, for example with mild acromioclavicular (AC) separations.

Plain radiographs are often obtained following trauma to diagnose fracture, dislocation, or type II or III AC joint sprain. </p><p>The most common shoulder injuries from minor blunt trauma include fractures of the clavicle and proximal humerus, dislocations of the glenohumeral joint, and sprains of the AC joint.</p><p>Should plain radiographs fail to reveal an injury in the setting of acute trauma, a soft tissue injury (eg, rotator cuff tear) is likely, and the clinician should perform an appropriate assessment as described in step three below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2152629087"><span class="h2">Step two: Extrinsic versus intrinsic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once acute fracture, dislocation, or AC injury has been excluded, the second step is to determine whether the patient's shoulder pain is a referred symptom caused by pathology extrinsic to the shoulder  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55507" href="/z/d/graphic/55507.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) or by intrinsic pathology. A careful history and preliminary examination should enable the clinician to make this distinction. Often, if the cause is extrinsic, the patient has difficulty localizing the pain.

Generally, the patient is able to localize the pain from extra-glenohumeral pathology to a specific site such as the bicipital groove for biceps tendinopathy or the AC joint for AC osteoarthritis. Weakness of the stabilizing muscles of the scapula is a notable exception, and this diagnosis can be difficult to make. A careful assessment of scapulothoracic motion and observation for any scapular winging  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68399" href="/z/d/graphic/68399.html" rel="external">picture 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef83145" href="/z/d/graphic/83145.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>) can aid diagnosis in such cases.</p><p>In cases of extra-glenohumeral pathology, passive range of motion of the glenohumeral joint should be normal, although assessment may be limited by pain or guarding.

The rotator cuff tendons  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72027" href="/z/d/graphic/72027.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>), particularly the supraspinatus tendon, are uniquely susceptible to the compressive forces of subacromial impingement (see <a class="local">'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a> above) and dominate the conditions affecting the shoulder, especially in patients over the age of 30 [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Improper athletic technique, poor muscular conditioning, poor posture, and failure of the subacromial bursa to protect the supporting tendons adequately may result in a progression of injury from acute inflammation, to calcification, to degenerative thinning, and finally to tendon tear.

Overhead reaching and positioning cause pain over the outer deltoid region. Atrophy of the muscles around the top and back of the shoulder may be apparent if symptoms are longstanding. Crepitus may be felt with attempts to abduct the arm beyond 60 degrees. Patients with rounded shoulders (a down-sloping acromial angle)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83224" href="/z/d/graphic/83224.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>), poor muscular development, repetitive overhead sport activity, and occupations that require repetitive work at or above the shoulder are at greatest risk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Tendinopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rotator cuff tendinopathy almost always represents chronic injury to the supraspinatus (abduction) and/or infraspinatus (external rotation) tendons.

Most patients do not describe an injury or fall. The patient typically places the hand over the outer deltoid, rubbing the muscle in an up-and-down direction when describing the pain. Common shoulder tendinopathy must be distinguished from frozen shoulder (loss of range of motion), rotator cuff tendon tear (persistent weakness), and biceps tendinopathy (painful arm flexion).

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/241.html" rel="external">"Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a rotator cuff tendon tear complain of shoulder weakness, pain over the anterolateral shoulder or sometimes the upper back, and a popping or catching sensation when the shoulder is moved. Night pain is common and often affects sleep because the patient is unable to keep the arm in a position that does not elicit pain (ie, without compression or rotation).</p><p>Injuries most commonly associated with acute rotator cuff tendon tears include falls onto the outstretched arm, falls directly onto the outer shoulder, vigorous pulling (such as on a lawn mower cable), and unusual heavy pushing and pulling. Acute, subacute, and chronic tears all occur most often in patients over the age of 40 with a history of impingement symptoms [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].</p><p>Shoulder function is preserved if the tear parallels the direction of the tendon fibers or is small in size. In such cases, the patient will complain only of shoulder pain, pain with direct pressure, and pain aggravated by active reaching, lifting, pushing, and pulling. However, if the tear is large, affecting both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons, and is transverse in direction (total interruption of the tendon with muscle retraction), the patient will complain of weakness, the typical symptoms of tendinopathy, and dramatic loss of function — an inability to reach overhead, lift with an outstretched arm, and an impairment of pushing and pulling.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h2">Labral tear</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many of the same mechanisms that produce rotator cuff injury can also produce tears of the labrum. Athletes who engage in repetitive overhead activities that load the shoulder (eg, baseball pitching, tennis serving, swimming) are at greater risk for such injuries, particularly superior labral tears oriented anterior to posterior (so-called SLAP lesions). Symptoms include deep shoulder pain, catching sensation, instability, and crepitus.

The most common cause is rotator cuff tendinopathy. Diabetes mellitus puts patients at significantly increased risk of developing adhesive capsulitis [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. Other diseases that increase the risk for frozen shoulder, most likely due to immobility, include stroke, Parkinson disease, and chronic pulmonary disease. Low pain tolerance, poor compliance with exercise therapy, and immobilization in a sling (eg, for treatment of a shoulder or elbow injury) can also contribute to the development of a frozen shoulder.</p><p>While the symptoms and signs of adhesive capsulitis and rotator cuff tendinopathy overlap, presentation often differs. While some patients with adhesive capsulitis have severe pain, all demonstrate decreased active and passive range of motion  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68745" href="/z/d/graphic/68745.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>) and typically complain of shoulder stiffness. Patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy typically complain of pain with active motion, while passive motion is often in the normal range (in the absence of guarding). The loss of motion associated with a frozen shoulder causes various degrees of impaired function, including limited reaching (eg, overhead, across the chest) and limited rotation (eg, unable to scratch the back, difficulty putting on a coat). Patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy suffer similar restrictions, but their limitations are due more to pain than an absolute loss of movement. Patients with either condition may experience increased pain at night either from direct pressure or shoulder movement.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h2">Acromioclavicular pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The acromioclavicular (AC) joint  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62016" href="/z/d/graphic/62016.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>) is another common site of pathology in patients with shoulder complaints. The joint is susceptible to arthritic change and trauma ("shoulder separation").

Repetitive lifting and, to a lesser extent, overhead reaching leads to irritation, microtearing, and, if untreated, degenerative change. Unusual or vigorous lifting in the setting of a chronically weakened tendon can lead to spontaneous rupture. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/229.html" rel="external">"Biceps tendinopathy and tendon rupture"</a>.)</p><p>The patient complains of anterior shoulder pain aggravated by lifting, carrying objects like shopping bags, and overhead reaching.

No patient without a shoulder deformity or a precipitating fall had an informative radiograph.</p><p>A subsequent study of 206 patients used the presence or absence of the following features: history of falling, swelling, rest pain, abnormalities in range of motion, and obvious deformities of the shoulder to help identify those in whom a shoulder radiograph was unlikely to be informative [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Among those without obvious shoulder deformities and swelling, the following three groups had relatively insignificant radiographs:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients without rest pain who had fallen.

(See <a class="local">'Trauma'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anterolateral pain</strong> – Anterolateral shoulder pain aggravated by reaching overhead is a common pain pattern. It is often associated with impingement syndrome and the various stages of rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear. Adhesive capsulitis (ie, frozen shoulder) is the most likely diagnosis when pain is accompanied by stiffness and a significant loss of movement in both active and passive motion of the shoulder. (See <a class="local">'Anterolateral shoulder pain'</a> above and <a class="local">'Rotator cuff injury'</a> above and <a class="local">'Labral tear'</a> above and <a class="local">'Adhesive capsulitis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Referred pain and extrinsic causes</strong> – Significant internal pathology including cardiac ischemia, hepatobiliary disease, and intraperitoneal bleeding may manifest with referred shoulder pain.
