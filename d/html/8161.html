         Mitral stenosis (MS) is a progressive disease that can lead to heart failure (most commonly presenting as dyspnea and sometimes causing fatigue and pulmonary edema) and additional severe complications (including systemic embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and death). Most cases of MS in adults are due to rheumatic heart disease, with symptoms appearing a variable number of years after one or more episodes of acute rheumatic fever, which are often undiagnosed. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8137.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although medical therapy can relieve symptoms of MS, it does not affect the obstruction to flow. The interventions to treat MS are percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy (PMBC) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ] and mitral valve surgery (repair, commissurotomy, or valve replacement). (See

         Mitral annular calcification (MAC) commonly occurs in older adults and generally has no significant hemodynamic effects, but it can cause MS or mitral regurgitation. Annular calcification alone does not result in severe MS, but when calcification extends into the mitral inflow and leaflets are thickened and calcified, a gradient may be produced. MS caused by MAC is not amenable to PMBC. Management of MS caused by MAC is discussed separately. (See

         Evaluation and management of MS may be optimized by a heart team approach widely used for a variety of valve conditions [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9

         ]. This multidisciplinary approach incorporates clinical evaluation, scoring systems (see
         <a class="local">
          'Scoring systems'
         </a>
         below), and procedural risk assessment to determine if mitral valve intervention is indicated and to guide choice of intervention (PMBC or mitral surgery). (See

        <p>
         Cardiac surgical consultation is recommended even if PMBC is likely indicated, as in rare cases PMBC is complicated by the induction of severe mitral regurgitation resulting in acute hemodynamic instability requiring emergency mitral valve surgery. The patient should be informed of this infrequent but possible risk, and cardiac surgical back-up is recommended; it is optimal if the surgeon has already consulted on the case and the type of prosthetic valve that would be implanted has been clarified.
        </p>
        <p>
         PMBC is most commonly performed in countries in which rheumatic fever is or has recently been prevalent; in such settings, procedure volume is often high and operator experience is often extensive. On the other hand, PMBC is infrequently performed in the United States and other countries in which acute rheumatic fever is rare; patients presenting with rheumatic MS in these countries with low prevalence of rheumatic fever are often immigrants from other countries where rheumatic fever persists [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Given the very low volume of patients with rheumatic MS treated by most clinical practices in the United States, professional societies have recommended that PMBC be performed at experienced valve centers (termed Comprehensive Valve Centers by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,10
         </a>
         ] and Heart Valve Centres by the European Society of Cardiology [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]) where expertise and experience for low-volume procedures such as PMBC can be concentrated. In addition, the one US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved system for PMBC, the Inoue balloon, is distributed by the manufacturer based on documented operator experience, and clinical representatives from the manufacturer are not generally present for the procedure (unlike procedures with more recently developed transcatheter valve therapies).

         Scoring systems based upon echocardiographic mitral features (valvular and subvalvular) are used to estimate the likelihood that a patient’s mitral valve will favorably respond to PMBC with hemodynamic and clinical improvement. Successful PMBC should reduce the severity of MS to a mild level and not produce moderate or greater MR. For patients who are candidates for both PMBC and cardiac surgery who have a high score (suggesting high risk of a suboptimal result from PMBC), cardiac surgery may be preferred. However, the choice of intervention is based upon the clinical context, including the patient’s surgical risk. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8139.html" rel="external">
          "Rheumatic mitral stenosis: Overview of management", section on 'Our approach'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         PMBC is effective in splitting the fused mitral commissures caused by rheumatic heart disease, but the procedure does not address other causes of hemodynamic obstruction associated with rheumatic mitral valve disease, such as severe subvalvular disease and extensive thickening and rigidity of the valve leaflets. Echocardiography enables identification of features associated with suboptimal PMBC results, such as asymmetry of commissural fusion (ie, the two commissures fused to differing degrees), severe fibrosis and calcification of fused commissures, and severe subvalvular disease. In the setting of asymmetry of commissural fusion or calcification, the force produced by the inflating balloon may be transmitted to sites beyond the commissures, which may result in tearing of the anterior leaflet causing acute severe MR.
        </p>
        <p>
         Various groups have developed criteria to predict the likelihood of PMBC success based on specific features in TTE and TEE studies.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         A role for intracardiac echocardiography in preprocedural assessment of subvalvular disease has been suggested but not established [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. An ideal scoring system would incorporate multiple features that can be easily and reproducibly extracted from echocardiograms and combine these to yield a score that has been validated to identify patients likely to have successful PMBC outcomes, those patients likely to have adverse PMBC outcomes, and those with uncertain PMBC success.
        </p>
        <p>
         Scoring systems are subject to the following limitations:

         <strong>
          Interobserver variability
         </strong>
         – Scoring systems require adequate image quality to enable qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements. These assessments and measurements are subject to interobserver variability, especially for observers not routinely performing these evaluations.

         <strong>
          Limited predictive value
         </strong>
         – Valve scores have limited predictive value. Some patients with unfavorable (high) scores may benefit from PMBC. Scores in the middle range may be less reliable than those at the extremes of the score spectrum. Even patients with optimum (low) scores are at risk for suboptimal outcomes. One reason for this is that some scores, such as the Wilkins score (see
         <a class="local">
          'Wilkins score'
         </a>
         below), predict the risk of insufficient valve opening by PMBC but do not address the risk of PMBC inducing MR. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Postprocedural MR'
         </a>
         below.)

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Clinical decision-making requires consideration of clinical factors beyond the PMBC outcomes predicted by echocardiographic scoring systems. For example, PMBC may be an option for some patients with unfavorable (high) valve scores and high surgical risk. (See

         When evaluating candidates for PMBC, the chosen scoring system(s) should estimate the risk of an insufficient increase in valve area as well as the risk of induction of MR. All scoring systems provide estimates of outcomes and are not definitive. While the Wilkins score has been used for over three decades to predict PMBC outcomes, newer scoring systems (including the Nunes, Sutaria, and multifactorial scoring systems discussed below) have been proposed to improve predictive accuracy [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In our program we use a hybrid approach starting with the Wilkins score and then adding the presence of commissural fusion to provide a clinically useful assessment of the likelihood of gradient improvement and freedom from inducing severe MR. Some scoring systems require special measurements that we do not routinely perform.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other options include using the Nunes score alone or combining the Wilkins score with assessment of commissural calcium and commissural area ratio (which is a component of the Nunes score) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16

The echocardiographic findings were validated with surgical pathology specimens in 39 patients undergoing surgical valve replacement for either failure of PMBC to relieve obstruction or induction of severe MR. The SVA score was more sensitive and specific than the MR-risk score in predicting these adverse outcomes.

         TEE is performed prior to PMBC to identify LA thrombus (most commonly seen in the LA appendage [LAA]), as it is more sensitive than TTE for this finding [

        <p>
         The presence of LA thrombus is a contraindication to PMBC because of the risk of dislodging the thrombus during the procedure. Such thrombi are not uncommon in patients with MS. The prevalence is related in part to whether or not the patients have been treated with

         If LA thrombus is detected (generally by TEE) in a potential candidate for PMBC, the procedure is postponed and anticoagulant therapy is administered. For most patients in this setting, we treat with vitamin K antagonist (VKA; eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ) with target international normalized ratio (INR) 3.0, range 2.5 to 3.5. Thrombus resolution is assessed by repeat TEE after six months of anticoagulation. Some patients with LA thrombus found on TEE immediately prior to planned PMBC are too symptomatic to wait six months. In such patients, repeat TEE may be performed after a shorter duration of anticoagulation (eg, one month).
        </p>
        <p>
         While improved imaging during PMBC, as with real-time three-dimensional (3D) TEE, may enable more careful catheter manipulation in the LA, it is not possible to ensure that the catheter tip will not end up unintentionally in the LAA during some part of the procedure. Given the risk of embolic stroke from an LA thrombus, PMBC is contraindicated when LA thrombus is present.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with MS with an indication for mitral valve intervention and LA thrombus that does not resolve with anticoagulant therapy, PMBC should not be performed; instead, mitral valve surgery (repair, commissurotomy, or replacement with LAA ligation) is performed if surgical risk is not prohibitive. Surgical mitral valve repair or replacement with LAA ligation may also be considered in patients unable to tolerate an adequate duration of anticoagulation. (See

         PMBC is typically performed via right femoral venous access with transseptal puncture to gain access to the left atrium and mitral valve. The FDA-approved Inoue system comes in three different balloon sizes, which are matched to the patient's height and weight. A single deflated Inoue balloon catheter (or a double-balloon system) is advanced from the venous circulation to the right atrium, across the interatrial septum via transseptal puncture to the left atrium, and finally across the stenotic mitral valve. Inflation and rapid deflation of the balloon opens the stenotic valve via separation of the fused commissures  (

          movie 1

         ). This mechanism is similar to that of surgical commissurotomy [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Fracture of calcific deposits in the leaflet tissue may also contribute to improved leaflet mobility and leaflet separation. More than one inflation is often needed, and the Inoue balloon system allows serial inflations with increasing fluid volumes to inflate the balloon.
        </p>
        <p>
         When PMBC is performed in patients with high or prohibitive cardiac surgical risk, sizing of the balloon and the degree of each inflation should be conservative, and a moderate reduction in MS severity should be accepted given the lack of surgical option if severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is induced.

         The standard approach to monitoring PMBC includes direct measurement of the transmitral pressure gradient and echocardiography with measurement of transmitral gradient using Doppler, mitral valve area (MVA) using planimetry, assessment of commissural splitting, and assessment of MR severity after each balloon dilation. The procedure is stopped when an adequate valve area has been achieved or if there is a significant increase in MR severity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of TTE, TEE, or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) during PMBC is influenced by local resources and experience. TTE can be used to assess the results after each inflation but is not useful in performing the initial transseptal catheterization.
        </p>
        <p>
         TEE can be performed during PMBC to guide the transseptal puncture, the PMBC procedure, and to monitor for complications [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,35
         </a>
         ]. TEE allows for direct assessment of the degree to which fused commissures have been split. Real-time 3D TEE is used in most centers to guide PMBC. This enables improved visualization of catheter manipulations, a more comprehensive assessment of the mitral valve before and after PMBC, and a more visually intuitive guidance. 3D TEE may identify commissural splitting and leaflet tears that are not visible on a two-dimensional study. Improved outcomes from a 3D approach have not yet been reported. However, TEE has the disadvantage that general anesthesia is generally required. (See

         The risk of complications for elective PMBC depends upon patient selection and operator experience and generally compares favorably with complication rates with surgical commissurotomy. The following complication rates have been reported for elective PMBC: mortality ≤0.5 percent, embolic events caused by air or thromboembolism (including stroke) 0 to 4 percent, cardiac tamponade 0 to 2 percent, and induction of mitral regurgitation (MR; new or worsening) 1.4 to 9.1 percent [

         Long-term outcomes are impacted by progressive reduction in mitral valve area (MVA). Twelve months after valvotomy, several hemodynamic parameters may show continued improvement, including further reductions in pulmonary artery systolic pressure and increases in cardiac output. Pulmonary vascular resistance declines and normalizes in many patients [

          46

         Differences in the prevalence of these predictive clinical factors likely explains observed differences in clinical outcomes for various patient populations in different countries. Studies from countries with prevalent acute rheumatic fever typically involve younger patients with lower echocardiographic scores, who therefore may have event-free survival rates at 5 to 10 years of well over 75 percent (comparable with that seen with surgical commissurotomy). In contrast, North American patient series tend to involve older patients with more severe valvular deformity and calcification and, consequently, a much lower event-free survival rate [

         PMBC has been performed in patients who have developed mitral valve restenosis after previous surgical commissurotomy. The immediate hemodynamic results and the long-term hemodynamics and outcome at 12 to 40 months appear to be similar to those seen with PMBC in unoperated MS [

        <p>
         As an example, one report described 232 patients who underwent PMBC a mean of 16 years after surgical commissurotomy: 82 percent had good immediate results (MVA ≥1.5 cm

         Of note, patients selected for PMBC with restenosis after surgical commissurotomy are a subset often without advanced deformity of the valve apparatus and without significant MR. Many patients with restenosis after surgical commissurotomy are further along in the chronic scarring process and some have other valvular disease requiring surgical intervention. Such patients generally require surgical MVR rather than PMBC.

         While successful PMBC may postpone mitral valve surgery for as long as a decade or more, restenosis requiring intervention (eg, repeat PMBC or mitral valve replacement) is likely to be necessary in the long term. Monitoring is recommended to assess for symptoms and signs of progressive mitral valve obstruction and to evaluate any concomitant valve disease. In older adults, restenosis is usually due to superimposed fibrosis and calcification of the valve leaflets rather than recurrent commissural fusion. In contrast, restenosis in younger adults may be due to recurrent rheumatic fever with recurrent commissural fusion; appropriate secondary prophylaxis against rheumatic fever is important in these patients.

         – Interventions to treat mitral stenosis (MS) include percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy (PMBC) and mitral valve surgery (repair, commissurotomy, or valve replacement). PMBC is predominantly used to treat rheumatic MS, although some types of congenital MS are also amenable to balloon dilation. MS caused by mitral annular calcification (MAC) is not amenable to PMBC.

         <strong>
          Scoring systems
         </strong>
         – Scoring systems based upon echocardiographic mitral features (valvular and subvalvular) are used to estimate the likelihood that a patient’s mitral valve will favorably respond to PMBC with hemodynamic and clinical improvement. However, all scoring systems provide estimates of outcome and are not definitive, and other clinical factors often come into play in considering PMBC. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The chosen scoring system(s) should estimate the risk of insufficient improvement in mitral valve area (MVA) as well as the risk of induction of mitral regurgitation (MR). We use a hybrid approach starting with the Wilkins score and then adding the presence of commissural fusion. (See

          Management of LA thrombus
         </strong>
         – If LA thrombus is detected by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in a potential candidate for PMBC, the procedure should be postponed while anticoagulant therapy is administered, as discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         A follow-up TEE is performed after six months of anticoagulation (sooner if the patient is too symptomatic to wait six months). If LA thrombus does not resolve with anticoagulation, the patient is referred for mitral valve surgery with LA appendage (LAA) ligation. (See

         – The risk of complications for PMBC depends upon patient selection and operator experience and generally compares favorably with complication rates with surgical commissurotomy. The following complication rates have been reported for elective PBMC: mortality ≤0.5 percent, embolic events caused by air or thromboembolism (including stroke) 0 to 4 percent, cardiac tamponade 0 to 2 percent, and induction of MR (new or worsening) 1.4 to 9.1 percent. The transseptal puncture commonly causes a trivial interatrial shunt, and hemodynamically significant shunts are rare. (See

          Outcomes
         </strong>
         – PMBC generally provides effective immediate relief of mitral valve obstruction in appropriately selected patients. Long-term outcomes are impacted by progressive reduction in MVA, which result in need for reintervention (in approximately 40 percent at 5- to 10-year follow-up, but rates vary widely). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Outcomes'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Post-PMBC care
         </strong>
         – While successful PMBC may postpone mitral valve surgery for a decade or more, restenosis requiring intervention (eg, repeat PMBC or mitral valve replacement) is likely to be necessary in the long term. Monitoring is recommended to assess for development of indications for reintervention (repeat PMBC or mitral valve surgery). (See
