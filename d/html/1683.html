The diagnosis of acquired cystic disease (ACD) of the kidney is established by ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although each procedure can produce false-negative results. CT and MRI offer increased sensitivity over ultrasonography in detecting small cysts [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. A diagnosis of ACD of the kidney requires involvement of both kidneys, with three or more cysts being present. ACD can be easily distinguished from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in patients with reduced glomerular filtration rate; the kidneys are small to normal in size among those with ACD, whereas they are typically extremely large among individuals with ADPKD.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, detection, and management of ACD of the kidney are presented in this topic. Diagnosis and management of ADPKD, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, and other kidney lesions are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1678.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1677.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6138.html" rel="external">"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2970.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90017.html" rel="external">"Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs): Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3634046202"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Often, acquired cystic disease (ACD) of the kidney can be detected prior to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and has been reported in patients with creatinine clearance as high as 70 mL/min [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, most cases occur in patients with creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], and the majority of patients diagnosed with ACD of the kidney have been on dialysis for 10 years or more [<a href="#rid1">1,6,7</a>].</p><p>The incidence of ACD increases progressively with duration of CKD and is present in most patients who have had CKD for a prolonged period [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In one study of 130 patients with advanced kidney disease or ESKD, the incidence of multiple cysts was 7 percent among those with CKD and 22 percent among those on maintenance dialysis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. An additional 30 to 50 percent had one to three kidney cysts, potentially representing an early form of the disease. The mean duration of dialysis was 15 months in patients with no cysts, 28 months in those with one to three cysts, and 49 months in those with ACD [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The risk may be higher in men as compared with women and in Black patients as compared with non-Black patients [<a href="#rid7">7,9-11</a>].</p><p>ACD of the kidney can occur in children as well as in adults; various reports have suggested that it is present in between 21 and 46 percent of pediatric patients with ESKD [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Although the incidence of ACD of the kidney depends upon the duration of CKD, it does not appear to be associated with the cause of CKD [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of acquired cystic disease (ACD) is incompletely understood. Nephron loss of any cause leads to compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining normal nephrons [<a href="#rid6">6,9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7181.html" rel="external">"Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>The cysts are limited to the kidney (in comparison with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [ADPKD]), suggesting that local, intrarenal events are of primary importance [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The cyst fluid, which is thought to derive from fluid secreted into the cyst, typically has a composition similar to that in the plasma; this finding, plus the presence of a brush border on the luminal membrane, suggests that the cysts arise primarily from proliferation of proximal tubular epithelial cells [<a href="#rid6">6,9</a>].</p><p>Compensatory kidney hypertrophy is driven by activation of proto-oncogenes and release of growth factors (such as epidermal and hepatocyte growth factors), which, over a prolonged period of time, can lead to tubular hyperplasia and cyst formation [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. In addition, one of these proto-oncogenes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in ACD [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Analysis of acquired cysts from patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) demonstrates vacuolated cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and also calcium oxalate crystals within cyst walls. These findings are consistent with malignant potential [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>The cysts may stabilize or regress following successful kidney transplantation, a setting in which the level of growth factors is reduced due to the restoration of normal kidney function. As a result, the outcome of ACD in patients following kidney transplantation is generally better than in patients maintained on chronic dialysis. In one prospective study, the incidence of cystic disease was lower (39 versus 56 percent), and the native kidneys were smaller and had lower cyst grades in transplant recipients when compared with patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. This benefit was limited to patients not receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9217" href="/z/d/drug information/9217.html" rel="external">cyclosporine</a>. Those treated with cyclosporine had an incidence of cystic disease similar to the patients on dialysis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">MANIFESTATIONS AND COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3404702393"><span class="h2">Clinical manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nearly 90 percent of patients with acquired cystic disease (ACD) are asymptomatic [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In one review, for example, only 14 percent of patients developed symptoms, with hematuria being most common, followed by lumbar pain and urinary tract infection [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>However, even in asymptomatic patients, longitudinal radiologic studies demonstrate a progressive increase in the number and size of cysts [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Rupture of a cystic blood vessel occurs in up to 50 percent of cases at some time. Although most such episodes are asymptomatic, local pain and gross hematuria can occur [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Less often, the hemorrhage may extend into the perirenal area and be severe enough to induce hypotension or death [<a href="#rid6">6,10,20-22</a>]. This complication is most likely to occur in patients with very large cysts.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Renal cell carcinoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as a complication of ACD varies in different reports [<a href="#rid10">10,18,19,23</a>]. Two prospective studies found an incidence of 4 percent (2 of 57) and 7 percent (2 of 30) over a 7- to 10-year period [<a href="#rid10">10,19</a>]. A review of published reports estimated an incidence of 0.18 percent per year [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>Most reports, however, may misrepresent the true incidence of RCC because they primarily rely upon screening radiography, particularly ultrasonography, for detection. Perhaps a better estimate was provided by a single-center study in which most kidney transplant patients underwent ipsilateral native nephrectomy at the time of transplant surgery [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Based upon strict pathologic criteria, RCC was found in 4.2 percent of 260 nephrectomies, which may be lower than the true incidence given that only one kidney was removed.</p><p>The carcinomas are usually limited to the kidney and, in approximately 25 to 50 percent of cases, are multiple and bilateral, a finding that is consistent with the diffuse nature of the disease [<a href="#rid6">6,9,18,25,26</a>]. Importantly, the bilateral presentation may not influence prognosis. Malignancy generally develops after at least 8 to 10 years of dialysis, although a shorter interval can be seen [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Men (male-to-female ratio 7:1) and patients with large cysts and an increased kidney size are at increased risk for malignant transformation [<a href="#rid18">18,28</a>]. Malignancy associated with ACD also can occur after transplantation [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Kidney transplant patients with ACD should be closely followed for this complication. Recommendations for the surveillance of such patients are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7304.html" rel="external">"Malignancy after solid organ transplantation"</a>.)</p><p>It has been suggested, however, that ACD and RCC are two disorders that represent separate diseases [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The overall incidence of RCC and distant metastases in all patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is approximately 1 to 2.6 percent and 0.2 to 0.5 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid25">25,29</a>]. Two large, prospective studies showed similar prevalence rates of RCC in Japan (1.7 percent) and the United States (1.6 percent) [<a href="#rid23">23,30</a>]. Although these values are more than 30 times higher than in the general population, they are not much higher than those reported in autopsy studies in the general population [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In addition, some patients with cancer do not have cystic disease, and some develop the malignancy prior to the institution of dialysis [<a href="#rid25">25,31</a>].</p><p>One study assessed the genetic abnormalities in RCCs occurring in patients with ESKD [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. These patients did not have the changes that are frequently seen in patients with sporadic RCC: inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3 or a mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene. Somatic mutations in von Hippel-Lindau have been found in 1.3 percent of RCCs in hemodialysis patients [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Another study of 33 RCCs obtained from patients with ESKD and ACD demonstrated amplification of chromosome 16q [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. However, in a study of 79 tumor samples from 69 patients with ESKD who have RCC, there were no genomic profile differences between the sporadic versus ESKD cases of clear-cell and papillary RCC.</p><p>ACD presents differently in kidney transplant recipients compared with the general population. A review of 1000 transplant recipients followed for 28 years showed that ACD is less common among transplant recipients compared with patients with ESKD as a whole (23 versus 80 percent, respectively). The prevalence of RCC is higher among transplant recipients with ACD as compared with those without (19 versus 0.5 percent), and 26 percent of those patients may have bilateral RCCs, indicating the need for a higher level of scrutiny [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H298806197"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with clinical manifestations of acquired cystic disease (ACD) of the kidney, such as hematuria, pain, or urinary tract infection, typically undergo kidney imaging with an ultrasound  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99887" href="/z/d/graphic/99887.html" rel="external">image 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef143143" href="/z/d/graphic/143143.html" rel="external">image 2</a>) or CT  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef143144" href="/z/d/graphic/143144.html" rel="external">image 3</a>) to evaluate their symptoms. However, since ACD of the kidney is typically asymptomatic, the diagnosis is usually made when patients with long-standing chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergo surveillance for ACD, during evaluation for kidney transplantation, or as an incidental finding when patients with CKD undergo imaging for a different indication.</p><p>ACD of the kidney is diagnosed when three or more cysts are present in each kidney in a patient with CKD and small- or normal-sized kidneys [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Most cysts are small (usually 0.5 cm or less in diameter), although some may be as large as 3 cm. The kidney cortex usually appears thin and, by ultrasound, echogenic, which corresponds to the long-standing CKD in affected patients.</p><p>ACD can be easily distinguished from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in patients with CKD; patients with ADPKD have enlarged kidneys and, frequently, cysts in other organs, such as the liver  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef143145" href="/z/d/graphic/143145.html" rel="external">image 4</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">SURVEILLANCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surveillance for acquired cystic disease (ACD) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) among patients with long-standing chronic kidney disease (CKD) depends in part upon the duration and severity of CKD and the anticipated life expectancy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2545862347"><span class="h2">Patients without a diagnosis of acquired cystic disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients without a known diagnosis of ACD of the kidney, our approach to surveillance depends in part upon whether the patient is a kidney transplant candidate and upon the patient's anticipated life expectancy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Potential kidney transplant candidates</strong> – In patients who are potential candidates for kidney transplantation, two of the authors of this topic obtain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or contrast-enhanced MRI as part of the transplant evaluation to identify ACD and assess for RCC.

As an example, the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usrds.org%2Fannual-data-report%2F&amp;token=lFzHfu5Xyr2WkFJhkf9tPw52xXrji5fupK91PCIEX0bsT15eBMzzCvaYC3Toc4rh9GGki%2F68NHngWSah5%2BQw3g%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=1683" target="_blank">mortality rate</a> among patients aged 75 years or older who are initiating dialysis is approximately 33 percent at 1 year, 50 percent at two years, 63 percent at 3 years, and 81 percent at 5 years. The mortality rate is substantially higher if the patient also has significant comorbidities such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease. This contrasts with lower mortality rates due to metastatic RCC among patients identified as having a small renal mass (&lt;1 percent at two to three years).

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> – The incidence of ACD increases progressively with duration of CKD and is present in most patients who have had CKD for a prolonged period. Although the incidence of ACD of the kidney depends upon the duration of CKD, it does not appear to be associated with the cause of CKD. ACD of the kidney can occur in children as well as in adults. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathogenesis</strong> – The pathogenesis of ACD is incompletely understood. The cysts are limited to the kidney, suggesting that local, intrarenal events are of primary importance. The cyst fluid, which is thought to derive from fluid secreted into the cyst, typically has a composition similar to that in the plasma; this finding, plus the presence of a brush border on the luminal membrane, suggests that the cysts arise primarily from proliferation of proximal tubular epithelial cells. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Manifestations and complications</strong> – Nearly 90 percent of patients with ACD are asymptomatic. Symptoms, when present, can include hematuria, lumbar pain, and urinary tract infection. Patients with ACD of the kidney may also develop renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RCCs are usually limited to the kidney and, in up to 50 percent of cases, are multiple and bilateral. (See <a class="local">'Manifestations and complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – ACD of the kidney is diagnosed when three or more cysts are present in each kidney in a patient with CKD and small- or normal-sized kidneys. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surveillance</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In patients <strong>without</strong> a known diagnosis of ACD of the kidney, our approach to surveillance for RCC depends in part upon whether the patient is a kidney transplant candidate and on anticipated life expectancy. (See <a class="local">'Patients without a diagnosis of acquired cystic disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Potential kidney transplant candidates</strong> – In patients who are potential candidates for kidney transplantation, two of the authors of this topic obtain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or contrast-enhanced MRI as part of the transplant evaluation to identify ACD and assess for RCC. The other author obtains an ultrasound as part of the transplant evaluation, rather than a CT or MRI, and performs a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI if a suspicious lesion is detected by ultrasound.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">If a kidney transplant candidate has ACD without evidence for RCC, then two of this topic's authors repeat the contrast-enhanced CT or MRI annually thereafter while the patient is on the waiting list. A third author of this topic repeats an ultrasound every six months while the patient is on the waiting list.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">If the patient does not have ACD, then imaging should be repeated every three to five years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Younger, healthier patients who are not undergoing kidney transplant evaluation</strong> – In patients who are not undergoing an evaluation for a kidney transplant, but who are younger and have few other comorbidities (and, therefore, a longer life expectancy), we perform surveillance for ACD and RCC. However, the benefit of surveillance in this setting is unproven, and not all experts recommend it. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Patients with poor overall health and short life expectancy</strong> – In patients with end-stage kidney disease and significantly comorbidity, mortality from kidney and cardiovascular disease is likely to far exceed the risk of dying from metastatic RCC. Thus, most experts do not obtain kidney imaging in such patients who have limited life expectancies, unless they present with new signs or symptoms (eg, hematuria or flank pain). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In patients <strong>with</strong> an established diagnosis of ACD, we continue surveillance; the frequency of continued surveillance depends upon the characteristics and size of the kidney cysts. (See <a class="local">'Patients with documented acquired cystic disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If a CT was performed, then high-risk lesions (eg, Bosniak class III and IV), if identified, should be evaluated and managed appropriately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67087" href="/z/d/graphic/67087.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If the patient had one or more kidney cysts that are larger than 3 cm that did not require reduction or resection, then we obtain annual imaging.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If the patient's cysts were all smaller than 3 cm, then we obtain repeat imaging every three years.</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Rahbari-Oskoui F, O'Neill WC.
