         Cancer of the endometrium is the most common gynecologic malignancy in resource-abundant countries and the second most common in resource-limited countries (where cervical cancer is more common). The stage at diagnosis, histologic subtype, and grade of endometrial carcinoma are used to assign risk for recurrent or persistent disease into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk. For patients with low-risk endometrial cancer, surgery is the standard treatment, and the prognosis is usually excellent; adjuvant therapy is typically not recommended for such patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will focus on the management of patients with low-risk endometrial cancer and will explain why adjuvant therapy is not recommended for patients with low-risk disease. An overview of endometrial cancer, as well as details on the treatment of intermediate- and high-risk endometrial cancers, are discussed separately.

         Patients with low-risk endometrial cancer who did not undergo nodal evaluation are considered unstaged but given that their risk of nodal involvement is low (&lt;5 percent), we do not perform surgical staging in this population (if not done as part of the primary surgery). Nodal evaluation of endometrial cancer is discussed separately. (See

         In this topic, patients with lower uterine segment involvement (but the absence of other risk features), are included in the low-risk disease population; lower uterine segment involvement alone does not qualify as intermediate-risk disease. This differs slightly from the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, in which involvement of the lower uterine segment is considered as part of the group with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer [

         Surgical staging with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), lymph node evaluation, and evaluation for extrauterine disease is the standard initial approach to most patients with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer. However, patients who desire fertility preservation may be candidates for medical therapy, and patients who are not candidates for surgery (eg, due to frailty or multiple comorbidities) may undergo primary radiation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3251.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Clinical rather than surgical staging may underestimate the extent of disease, particularly for higher-grade tumors. The best available data regarding the rate of unsuspected advanced disease in patients presumed to be stage I based on clinical evaluation are from a database study including 621 patients with endometrial cancer, among whom 22 percent were found to have disease outside the uterus [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The rate of nodal metastases increased with increasing tumor grade (grade 1: 3 percent; grade 2: 9 percent; grade 3: 18 percent). This seminal study, with its recognition of the potential for metastatic spread, prompted the shift from clinical staging to surgical staging of endometrial cancer. Subsequent studies have found a low risk of difference in the findings of frozen section versus permanent section of the uterus in endometrial cancer and in the identification of factors associated with a low risk for nodal metastases (well-differentiated endometrioid tumor with lack of myometrial invasion and small size) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. While these studies are reassuring regarding basing management on clinical staging and frozen sections, more precise assessment of risk may include other uterine histopathologic factors, which will not be determined definitively if the uterus is preserved.

         We recommend that all patients with pathologically confirmed low-risk endometrial cancer undergo surveillance following surgery rather than adjuvant therapy. While the primary risk in patients with low-risk endometrial cancer is local recurrence (eg, at the vaginal vault), this risk is low (≤5 percent) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-13
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale against adjuvant treatment is as follows:

         <strong>
          Radiation therapy
         </strong>
         – For patients with low-risk endometrial cancer, we do not pursue adjuvant radiation. While radiation therapy (RT) can reduce the risk of local recurrence, it does not improve overall survival. Patients with low-risk endometrial cancer have a low likelihood of recurrence (≤5 percent), and thus, the absolute likelihood of benefit of adjuvant radiation is small. Furthermore, adjuvant pelvic external-beam RT (EBRT) may increase the risk of treatment-related complications. While vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) is associated with less toxicity, there are no benefits to treatment to warrant its use in these patients.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a 2012 meta-analysis of eight trials enrolling patients with stage I endometrial cancer, among the 517 patients with low-risk disease, RT was associated with an increased risk of death related to endometrial cancer compared with observation (relative risk [RR] 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.7) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]; however, there were few deaths and the confidence interval was wide. Another study reinforced the lack of benefits and the heightened risks associated with EBRT for long-term survivors [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. In this study, 560 patients with uterine-confined endometrial cancer underwent brachytherapy and were randomly assigned to pelvic EBRT versus no further treatment. At a median follow-up of 20.5 years, EBRT did not improve survival, and among patients under 60 years, EBRT was associated with a higher mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.36, 95% CI 1.06-1.76). It was also associated with a higher rate of secondary malignancies and serious complications.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Similarly, VBT has failed to demonstrate benefits in low-risk disease. In a multi-institutional European study, 645 patients with grade 1 to 2 endometrioid endometrial cancer invading less than one-half of the myometrium were allocated to either surgical treatment alone or to surgery plus VBT [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Cancer-specific and overall survival were similar between groups. However, VBT was associated with an increase in genitourinary symptoms (eg, dysuria, frequency, incontinence [2.8 versus 0.6 percent]).

         <strong>
          Progestin therapy
         </strong>
         – We do not administer adjuvant progestin therapy for patients with low-risk endometrial cancer. However, progestin therapy is an option for patients who are willing to take the risk of less effective therapy to achieve fertility preservation. (See

         Because most endometrial cancer is associated with excess estrogen production, it has been hypothesized that progestin therapy may be effective adjuvant therapy. However, in a meta-analysis of four trials, the risk of death at five years between adjuvant progestin therapy compared with no further treatment was similar between groups [

         Understanding of the nonstandard nature of treatment, including risk of occult cancer and risk of recurrent and/or persistent cancer. A clinical challenge is that patients who are managed with a fertility-sparing approach are staged clinically, rather than with surgical exploration, and that the endometrium is not fully evaluated. This means that more advanced disease may be present than is appreciated by clinical assessment. (See

         The most common approach to fertility preservation for such patients is progestin therapy and deferral of surgical staging (including hysterectomy and BSO) until after completion of childbearing. Use of this approach is limited to patients with low-risk disease only, as the risk of recurrent or persistent disease is likely higher than with hysterectomy. Patients who are candidates should be counseled about the risks and benefits so they can make an informed decision. In addition, patients should be counseled that adherence to oral treatment regimens may be difficult, as suggested by at least one study of patients with gynecologic malignancies [

         Patients with Lynch syndrome – In our practice, we do not offer fertility preservation to patients with endometrial cancer who have Lynch syndrome. For such patients, tumorigenesis is secondary to a defect in mismatch-repair genes, not excessive estrogen stimulation [

         Patients with grade 2 and 3 tumors or myometrial invasion– While there are reports of patients with grade 2 to 3 differentiated tumors with superficial myometrial invasion being conservatively managed, the collective experience is insufficient to recommend fertility-sparing progestin therapy for this patient population [

         In one study of 621 patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer, no patients with grade 1 cancer limited to the endometrium had extrauterine spread at the time of surgical staging [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. However, the overall incidence of extrauterine spread in the study was higher, with 22 percent of patients having disease outside of the uterus (lymph node metastasis, adnexal disease, intraperitoneal spread, and or/malignant cells in peritoneal washings). In a United States database study evaluating fertility preservation in over 23,000 patients &lt;50 years old diagnosed with stage I endometrial cancer between 2004 and 2014, use of progestin therapy was associated with decreased five-year survival in patients with cancer involving &gt;50 percent of the myometrium; this is discussed in more detail below (see
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy relative to surgery'

         Observational data have suggested that fertility preservation yields comparable outcomes to hysterectomy for endometrial cancer that is limited to the endometrium, but not higher stages.

However, in subset analysis, patients with tumor confined to the endometrium or involving &lt;50 percent of the myometrium had equivalent five-year survival outcomes (97.5 in both treatment groups) and mortality risk, while survival was lower with progestins in those with cancer involving &gt;50 percent of the myometrium (75 versus 97.5 percent; HR for mortality 3.52, 95% CI 1.57-7.9) and stage I-not otherwise specified tumors (HR for mortality 3.91, 95% CI 1.41-10.82).

The risk of disease progression is higher without surgery, and surgical staging (which includes total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, lymph node evaluation, and evaluation for extrauterine disease) is more accurate compared with endometrial sampling and imaging alone.

         However, fertility preservation may be an appropriate alternative for patients with grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma confined to the endometrium, as determined by endometrial sampling and imaging. Such patients who wish to preserve fertility should be counseled about treatment with progestins with surgery deferred until after childbearing, including the risks of recurrent and persistent disease.
