Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the mainstay for monitoring prosthetic valves and can generally identify normal function as well as evidence of valve dysfunction (stenosis). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is helpful particularly for assessment of valve structure and prosthetic valve regurgitation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef120105" href="/d/graphic/120105.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), especially involving mechanical mitral and tricuspid prostheses as well as assessment of endocarditis for all valves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98560" href="/d/graphic/98560.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p>This topic will review echocardiography of prosthetic heart valves. Management of patients with prosthetic heart valves and prosthetic valve complications are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8121.html" rel="external">"Mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2138.html" rel="external">"Prosthetic valve endocarditis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8171.html" rel="external">"Antithrombotic therapy for mechanical heart valves"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8134.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of patients with prosthetic heart valves"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1227884"><span class="h1">MONITORING GUIDELINES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H604074390"><span class="h2">Baseline transthoracic echocardiogram</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We agree with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline recommendation to perform transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) six weeks to three months after valve implantation (when the hemoglobin has normalized) to evaluate valve hemodynamics and to establish a baseline for future comparison [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The TTE should include Doppler measurements of transvalvular velocities as well as assessment of valvular and paravalvular regurgitation. Adequate Doppler velocity recordings can generally be obtained despite acoustic shadowing from valve prostheses.</p><p>Transvalvular gradients for normally functioning prosthetic valves are dependent upon valve type, location, and size (as compiled in the 2009 American Society of Echocardiography <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fasecho.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F05%2F2009_Evaluation-of-Prosthetic-Valves.pdf&amp;token=4BrVyU5mWG5OaPUKU5XpYJcbp53uJLv%2B%2F1mD5iKBe2KiJ1gNPPiXv24lhC9UAoVvLeWfmXxghIEVaQ4QhqhZtOz9A7JQenRAsTs9SxkdUG%2FJQChAYL6ZPNTT8HTJlhxo&amp;TOPIC_ID=5333" target="_blank">guidelines</a>) as well as patient-specific factors [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A higher than expected initial gradient is often due to a high output state (eg, due to anemia) or patient-prosthetic mismatch and is only rarely due to early dysfunction of the prosthesis (eg, thrombus formation or hemodynamically significant valvular regurgitation). We suggest obtaining the postoperative baseline study after the patient’s hemoglobin has returned to baseline to avoid recording a gradient that is transiently higher than expected due to anemia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H604074403"><span class="h2">Change in clinical status</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The echocardiographer should be alert to the range of complications that can occur with prosthetic devices, including the following (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8121.html" rel="external">"Mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prosthetic obstruction due to thrombus, pannus ingrowth, leaflet thickening, or calcification of biologic prostheses.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prosthetic regurgitation due to paravalvular leak, prosthetic leaflet interference by thrombus, or vegetation  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64234" href="/d/graphic/64234.html" rel="external">movie 1C</a>) or leaflet tear of a bioprosthesis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prosthetic valve endocarditis with findings including vegetations and abscess formation  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef58762" href="/d/graphic/58762.html" rel="external">movie 1A</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef74517" href="/d/graphic/74517.html" rel="external">movie 1B</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prosthetic valve dehiscence with valve ring instability/"rocking."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mechanical structural failure (eg, strut fracture and component escape), which is rare with current valve types.</p><p></p><p>A TTE is recommended as the initial test in patients with prosthetic valves with a change in clinical status suggestive of valve dysfunction and/or endocarditis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Symptoms and signs of bioprosthetic valve degeneration, pannus formation, or endocarditis include new exertional dyspnea, a louder murmur, or a new murmur. Symptoms and signs of mechanical valve dysfunction due to thrombosis, pannus formation, or endocarditis include a new or louder murmur, new onset of dyspnea, and signs of heart failure, thromboembolism, and hemolysis. For patients with a prosthetic valve, a TTE may also be useful since it provides proper alignment for Doppler assessment of transvalvular velocities, gradient, and valve area. In patients with aortic prostheses, valvular regurgitation can be reliably detected on TTE. For all patients with a prosthetic valve, TTE may be useful for assessment of biventricular cavity size and systolic function as well as an estimate of pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Transesophageal echocardiography has much higher sensitivity for detection of prosthetic valve thrombi, vegetations, and extravalvular extension of infection as well as prosthetic mitral regurgitation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H604074544"><span class="h2">Surveillance of old bioprosthetic valves</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Since the incidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction markedly increases 10 years after implantation, we agree with the 2020 ACC/AHA valve guidelines, which state that a TTE is reasonable in patients with a bioprosthetic valve after the first five years and then again at 10 years, even in the absence of change in clinical status [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The guideline suggested annual TTE thereafter. However, in individuals at increased risk of early valvular degeneration, such as those with chronic renal failure, diabetes, and younger age at implantation, it is reasonable to perform echocardiography at five years postimplantation and then yearly thereafter [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Routine annual echocardiographic evaluation is not indicated in patients with mechanical valve prostheses with normal postoperative baseline examination and no signs or symptoms of valve dysfunction [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. However, follow-up echocardiography is indicated if there are signs or symptoms that suggest valve or ventricular dysfunction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H604074847"><span class="h1">KEY COMPONENTS OF THE ECHOCARDIOGRAM</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H604074867"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Echocardiographic evaluation of patients with prosthetic valves includes imaging of the valve and its seating; assessment of valve hemodynamics, including transvalvular velocities; identification and quantification of valve regurgitation (intravalvular and paravalvular); and measurement of cardiac chamber sizes, left ventricular wall thicknesses, and assessment of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function.</p><p>Prosthetic valves are generally inherently stenotic, so Doppler velocity recordings across normally functioning valves are similar to those of mild native valve stenosis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Normal function of the valve is confirmed by evaluation of the contour of the jet velocity, including the acceleration time (the time from onset of flow to maximal velocity), the effective orifice area (EOA), and the Doppler velocity index (DVI). Expected ranges for gradients and EOA for normally functioning prosthetic valves are included in appendices to the 2009 American Society of Echocardiography prosthetic valve <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fasecho.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F05%2F2009_Evaluation-of-Prosthetic-Valves.pdf&amp;token=4BrVyU5mWG5OaPUKU5XpYJcbp53uJLv%2B%2F1mD5iKBe2KiJ1gNPPiXv24lhC9UAoVvLeWfmXxghIEVaQ4QhqhZtOz9A7JQenRAsTs9SxkdUG%2FJQChAYL6ZPNTT8HTJlhxo&amp;TOPIC_ID=5333" target="_blank">guidelines</a>.</p><p>An increase in the transprosthetic velocity could be due to valvular obstruction, regurgitation, or an increase in cardiac output, whereas a decrease in either the EOA or the DVI is more specific for prosthetic obstruction. A Doppler velocity pattern demonstrating normal transprosthetic flow gradient and flow duration is usually sufficient to exclude a stenotic valve [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, the gradient may not be elevated in the setting of obstruction with low stroke volume.</p><p>The EOA is calculated using the continuity equation:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p>EOA  =  stroke volume  /  VTI<sub>PrV</sub></p></div></div><p>where VTI<sub>PrV</sub> is the velocity time integral through the prosthesis determined by continuous wave Doppler. The stroke volume is generally derived from an adjacent site as cross-sectional area (estimated from the associated diameter and assuming a circular area) multiplied by the VTI of flow measured by pulsed wave Doppler at that site. For prosthetic aortic and pulmonic valves, site for calculation of stroke volume is at the site of flow just proximal to the valve. For prosthetic mitral valves, stroke volume may be calculated at the aortic or pulmonary annulus if no significant regurgitation is present.</p><p>The DVI is a simplified method for evaluating aortic valve obstruction. The DVI is the ratio of the velocity proximal to the valve by pulsed wave Doppler to the velocity through the valve by continuous wave Doppler. Use of this index avoids the need to measure stroke volume [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. A DVI &lt;0.25 suggests significant valve obstruction.</p><p>Prosthetic aortic regurgitation (intravalvular or paravalvular) can generally be identified by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Prosthetic mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are usually difficult to assess on TTE due to acoustic shadowing and thus transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is preferred.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H604074874"><span class="h2">Role of TTE and TEE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TTE and TEE are complementary in the evaluation of prosthetic valves. As mentioned, acoustic shadowing caused by prosthetic material may limit TTE visualization of prosthetic discs/leaflets, vegetations, abscesses, and thrombi. In addition, while prosthetic aortic valve regurgitation is usually well visualized on TTE color Doppler imaging, prosthetic mitral regurgitation is frequently undetectable [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. As a result, TEE is the imaging method of choice when the TTE is technically inadequate or when there are borderline findings on the TTE in a patient in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of prosthetic malfunction [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. As an example, one study of 170 patients who underwent surgery for valve dysfunction found that diagnostic errors (ie, findings on the TTE that were not confirmed at surgery) occurred in 12 percent and were primarily related to paravalvular regurgitation [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Since TTE images are obtained anteriorly, they are usually sufficient for evaluation of aortic prostheses. However, since the atria are situated in the far field where resolution is low, they are shadowed by mechanical and to lesser extent, biological mitral prostheses, so the evaluation of mitral prosthetic function is limited. On the other hand, TEE images are taken from a position posterior to the heart, so the atrial side of the mitral and tricuspid valves can be well seen. TTE demonstrates the ventricular side of the valve that lies in its near field, whereas TEE does not. The presence of mitral and aortic devices in the same patient may make the task of the echocardiographer more difficult and may require both TTE and TEE.</p><p>The physician evaluating a prosthetic device with TEE should be aware of the range of abnormalities that are possible in these devices and should match those possibilities to the patient's presentation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98560" href="/d/graphic/98560.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).

They are usually seen with mitral prostheses within the left ventricular inflow and are likely due to degassing of carbon dioxide [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>The role of the TEE for evaluating the abnormalities associated with prosthetic valves will be reviewed here. The major complications encountered with these valves and the role of echocardiography in the evaluation of infective endocarditis are discussed fully elsewhere.

(See <a class="local">'Prosthetic aortic stenosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Causes of obstruction include pannus ingrowth, thrombus, and vegetation  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64234 graphicRef58762 graphicRef74517" href="/d/graphic/64234.html" rel="external">movie 1A-C</a>). Clinical clues to this possibility include the age of the valve and the adequacy of anticoagulation. In a bioprosthesis or heterograft, the leaflets themselves may become calcified and immobile. There has been an increasing recognition of subclinical thrombus formation on bioprosthetic valves, which appears to be more common in percutaneous valves than in surgically placed valves as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111633.html" rel="external">"Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, and obstruction: Management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110074.html" rel="external">"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Complications", section on 'Valve thrombosis'</a>.)</p><p>Once there is a high suspicion of obstruction, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be performed for etiologic definition with both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves, especially for mitral prostheses. Doppler transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the primary means to diagnose prosthetic valve obstruction; hemodynamic cardiac catheterization is not routinely needed [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. 3D-TEE may be helpful in identifying pannus, although its utility has not been well defined [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Computed tomography (CT) scan is an important adjunctive imaging modality.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the case of suspected aortic pannus, the distal end of the left ventricular outflow tract should be examined both with imaging and with color flow Doppler. Pannus tends to lie close to the valve ring and can be easily overlooked. There can be proximal flow acceleration present on color flow Doppler that suggests pannus, which, on further searching with a variety of frequencies, angles, and gain settings, will be detected.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the mitral position, the same procedure should be followed. Finding a high grade of spontaneous contrast in the left atrium, with or without thrombi, or finding thrombus around the sewing ring in the setting of adequate anticoagulation should heighten suspicion of pannus formation. Thin fibrillar strands may also be encountered adjacent to the mitral annulus and on the sewing ring of the valve. These structures are brightly reflective and highly mobile and may or may not be associated with a pathologic process.</p><p></p><p>Diagnosis and management of valve obstruction due to thrombus or pannus are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111633.html" rel="external">"Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, and obstruction: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Distinction between thrombus and pannus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common etiology for prosthetic valve obstruction is thrombus formation; pannus formation due to fibrous tissue ingrowth is far less common. In one surgical study of 112 obstructed mechanical valves, pannus formation was the underlying cause in 11 percent of valves, pannus formation in combination with thrombus was present in 12 percent, while thrombus alone was the etiology in the remaining cases [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Since treatment options for thrombus and pannus differ, it is important to distinguish between these two causes.

However, severe regurgitation may result from bioprosthetic valve leaflet degeneration or destruction from endocarditis, mechanical valve pannus, thrombus, or vegetation that interferes with mechanical leaflet function.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Physiologic regurgitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All mechanical valves exhibit some degree of obligatory regurgitation of up to 15 mL of blood [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The physiologic regurgitation associated with prosthetic valves appears only briefly and is due to retrograde volume displacement as the valve leaflets close. This type of regurgitation is detected by highly sensitive color flow Doppler imaging on TEE. In addition, a certain amount of more prolonged "leakage backflow" regurgitation occurs after the valve closes [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. These are often referred to as "washing jets," believed to inhibit the formation of thrombi.</p><p>In an evaluation of 136 mechanical prosthetic valves, TEE color flow Doppler imaging revealed regurgitant jets in 95 percent of the mitral prostheses and 44 percent of the aortic prostheses [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In contrast, TTE documented regurgitant jets in only 28 percent and 29 percent, respectively. The lower incidence of detected regurgitation in the aortic position may be explained by the shadowing of the left ventricular outflow tract in TEE imaging [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>Normally functioning mechanical valves, such as the bileaflet St. Jude prosthesis, usually have two to four centrally directed regurgitant jets. Features associated with these jets include a low intensity and only minimal penetration into the atrium, generally less than 3 cm [<a href="#rid15">15,18,19</a>]. The monodisc Medtronic-Hall valve has two jets, one of which is prominent and longer [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. Normally functioning bioprosthetic and heterografts are less likely to have these small regurgitant signals; when mild regurgitation is present, there is usually one central jet [<a href="#rid16">16,21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Pathologic regurgitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most pathologic regurgitation associated with mechanical valves is perivalvular. However, occasionally, disc closure may be impeded by a vegetation or thrombus leading to combined stenosis and regurgitation. If TTE does not reveal the offending mass or tissue, TEE should be performed.</p><p>Bioprostheses with leaflet degeneration may exhibit central pathologic regurgitation that is broad-based when severe. The bioprosthetic leaflets can usually be seen and are often thickened and calcified with possible perforation or disruption leading to a flail leaflet. Forward flow velocities measured by spectral Doppler may be increased due to the larger flow volume associated with regurgitation as well as concurrent obstruction.</p><p>A review of 134 patients with a prosthetic mitral valve attempted to derive echocardiographic indices of valvular dysfunction [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The results suggested that a peak transmitral E wave velocity exceeding 1.9 m/sec or a ratio of peak diastolic transmitral flow to left ventricular outflow tract velocity greater than 2.2 identifies prosthetic valve regurgitation (sensitivity 92 percent, specificity 78 percent), provided that the valve is not stenotic (pressure half-time less than 130 msec) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. On the other hand, a prosthetic valve with a peak E wave Doppler velocity of less than 1.9 m/sec, a ratio of peak diastolic transmitral flow velocity to left ventricular outflow velocity of less than 2.2, and a pressure half-time of less than 130 msec has a 98 percent chance of being normal (neither stenotic nor regurgitant).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H604075391"><span class="h4">Paravalvular regurgitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Trace or mild paravalvular regurgitation immediately following valve replacement is common with both mechanical and bioprosthetic prostheses and generally not progressive. Paravalvular regurgitation can develop late after valve replacement due to suture dehiscence, from a poorly seated ring, or from endocarditis leading to valve dehiscence. Hemolysis is a common complication of these leaks, especially when they occur with a mitral valve prosthesis [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. Paravalvular regurgitation should be suspected when a patient with a prosthetic valve presents with hemolytic anemia. Severe hemolysis can also occur after mitral valve repair, when regurgitation develops around the annuloplasty ring. A TEE is frequently required to detect paravalvular leakage. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7168.html" rel="external">"Non-immune (Coombs-negative) hemolytic anemias in adults", section on 'Intravascular devices'</a>.)</p><p>To recognize a paravalvular leak, TEE must be performed with a high color frame rate in several views from several angles outside the sewing ring [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. There should be a careful search for periprosthetic leaks around as much of the valve circumference as possible and an attempt made to define the extent of the regurgitation once it is identified. The origin of a periprosthetic leak may appear deceptively narrow when caused by disruption of a limited number of sutures. Three-dimensional echocardiography is helpful in mapping the extent of the paravalvular leak and has proven efficacious for guiding percutaneous device closure of these leaks.</p><p>The most severe form of paravalvular regurgitation is seen when there is dehiscence of a substantial portion of the sewing ring [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In this setting, there may be such severe regurgitation that the regurgitant flow is almost laminar. The sewing ring on echocardiography may be seen to rock with each cardiac cycle; mobile echo densities representing the liberated suture material often can be visualized.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H604076206"><span class="h2">Prosthetic valve dehiscence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prosthetic valve dehiscence is identified on echocardiography as a separation of the prosthetic ring from the native valvular annulus and is usually accompanied by paravalvular regurgitation. Valve dehiscence is most frequently caused by endocarditis. Rocking of a prosthetic valve is a sign of dehiscence, particularly in the aortic position. Rocking of a prosthetic mitral valve can be caused by dehiscence or by retained native posterior leaflet or posterior and anterior leaflets, with the latter generally not accompanied by paravalvular regurgitation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

It is important to differentiate pathologic prosthetic regurgitation, which is often perivalvular from the normal "physiologic" prosthetic regurgitation. Mechanical prosthetic valves displace blood when the occluder disc closes and may also have small holes in the occluders and at hinge points; the pattern is characteristic for the valve type [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Biologic valves may have minor degrees of central regurgitation, which are detectable due to the high sensitivity of color flow Doppler.</p><p>Grading the severity of pathological prosthetic aortic regurgitation can be challenging and an integrative approach is recommended  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119958" href="/d/graphic/119958.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. When there is significant dehiscence of the valve (more than 40 percent), a rocking motion is detected, which is usually associated with severe regurgitation. The following features suggest severe regurgitation: jet width &gt;65 percent, pressure half-time &lt;200 msec, holodiastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta, regurgitant volume &gt;60 mL, and a regurgitant fraction &gt;50 percent. In addition, chronic severe aortic regurgitation is a cause of left ventricular dilation.</p><p>While TTE can detect and often grade prosthetic aortic regurgitation, the cause is often not apparent.

Higher velocities are seen with bioprostheses. The mean gradient is usually &lt;6 mmHg. The pressure half-time is usually &lt;130 msec. EOA can be calculated using the continuity equation but is not as frequently used. DVI is calculated as the VTI<sub>PrMV</sub>/VTI<sub>LVOT</sub> and is normally &lt;2.2 for mechanical valves [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The DVI will be normal in high output states, but elevated in both the case of either mitral prosthetic stenosis or regurgitation [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

There may be increased rocking of the prosthesis associated with dehiscence of the sewing ring. The peak transmitral E wave velocity is increased as is the mean gradient, although the pressure half-time remains within normal range. The left ventricular volume may be increased and the ejection fraction is usually preserved. However, in the presence of significant mitral regurgitation, the forward stroke volume falls, which can be inferred by a decrease in the left ventricular outflow tract VTI.
