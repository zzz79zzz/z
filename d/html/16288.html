As with other medical "syndromes," there is controversy about the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition. While it is generally accepted that hyperventilation episodes (or "attacks") are frequently related to or associated with concomitant panic disorder, other precipitants may also be important.</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients presenting with hyperventilation syndrome. Detailed discussions of associated disorders are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14628.html" rel="external">"Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108804.html" rel="external">"Management of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14633.html" rel="external">"Psychotherapy for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/496.html" rel="external">"Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14616.html" rel="external">"Acute stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/292.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with dyspnea in the emergency department"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3018637632"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H730662519"><span class="h2">Tachypnea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Increased respiratory rate &gt;20 breaths per minute. The PaCO<sub>2</sub> cannot be predicted by tachypnea alone since PaCO<sub>2</sub> reflects the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> production and alveolar ventilation (PaCO<sub>2</sub> = VCO<sub>2</sub>/VA). Minute ventilation is determined by the product of respiratory rate multiplied by tidal volume, and alveolar volume is the difference between tidal volume and dead space. Thus, for any given respiratory rate, calculation of alveolar ventilation requires knowledge of respiratory rate and alveolar volume. Further, for any given minute ventilation, the size of the breaths will determine the PaCO<sub>2</sub> since larger breaths have a smaller dead space/tidal volume ratio.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3262714501"><span class="h2">Hyperpnea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Increase in the depth and rate of respiration leading to an increase in the minute volume of ventilation consistent with an increase in metabolism as reflected by CO<sub>2</sub> production. Thus, the PaCO<sub>2</sub> is normal in a patient with hyperpnea (an example of hyperpnea is the increase in ventilation that occurs during moderate exercise in concert with increased metabolic activity and systemic production of carbon dioxide).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3923813602"><span class="h2">Hyperventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Alveolar hyperventilation is present when alveolar ventilation is increased out of proportion to carbon dioxide production and the arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) decreases below the normal range (&lt;36 mmHg, or &lt;4.8 kPa). At the bedside, however, it is difficult to accurately gauge minute ventilation, and it is impossible to assess alveolar ventilation. The term “hyperventilation” is commonly used to characterize any patient who clinically appears to have increased total ventilation. In this chapter, we will use the term “hyperventilation” in this common clinical sense, but we will reemphasize the distinction between the physiological definition (alveolar ventilation out of proportion to CO<sub>2</sub> production, which requires an arterial blood gas for confirmation) and the common bedside impression.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2764630051"><span class="h2">Hyperventilation syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hyperventilation syndrome is a disorder with no widely accepted diagnostic criteria [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], but is most commonly characterized by respiratory symptoms (uncomfortable or difficult breathing), hyperventilation, and a general sense of distress or anxiety. Many questions have been raised about the term "hyperventilation syndrome" [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Some authors suggest that the term should be avoided, as it implies that hyperventilation is the primary cause of and trigger for a patient's symptoms [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Others cite that "hyperventilation syndrome" may at best describe multiple pathophysiologic processes rather than a unique, discrete clinical entity [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Nonetheless, "hyperventilation syndrome" is a term in wide use clinically and is descriptive of a common objective finding, ie, excess ventilation. There is likely great overlap between hyperventilation syndrome and "sighing syndrome," which has similar characteristics [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H104941447"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of hyperventilation syndrome is difficult to assess accurately, as estimates are based upon small sample sizes, varying diagnostic criteria, and its association with psychological symptoms. There is substantial overlap between hyperventilation syndrome, panic disorder, and anxiety disorder  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83782" href="/z/d/graphic/83782.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>)[<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The prevalence of hyperventilation syndrome has been reported to range from 25 to 83 percent in patients with an anxiety disorder [<a href="#rid1">1,6-8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14628.html" rel="external">"Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/496.html" rel="external">"Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Limited data suggest that hyperventilation syndrome occurs more commonly in women than in men [<a href="#rid3">3,9,10</a>]. In an emergency department cohort study of 616 patients clinically diagnosed with hyperventilation, 55 percent of patients were female, the median age was 36.5 years (range 16 to 85), and 30 percent had had a prior episode [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H966850495"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychopathology</strong> – An association between hyperventilation syndrome and psychological pathologies (such as panic disorder) is clear, but whether the psychological condition is primary or secondary is often unclear. Both respiratory and somatic symptoms are common in patients with psychological distress. In a small study, patients with idiopathic hyperventilation syndrome had higher depression and anxiety scores than control subjects [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Specifically, "disproportionate breathlessness" is associated with depression, anxiety, bereavement, resentment, and uncertainty about the seriousness of one's illness [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In addition, patients with anxiety disorder may react to sensations from the chest wall (eg, intercostal muscle tension) by hyperventilating [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Patients with anxiety may also complain of respiratory symptoms that can best be termed "sighing dyspnea," in which patients feel as if they are not getting enough air or oxygen or “as if I can’t fill my lungs with air.” Some describe a vague sub-xiphoid pressure sensation. This is described as "periodic deep sighing" in one review and as "frequent sighing and irregular breathing patterns, sometimes overlapping with hyperventilation" [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The diagnosis of panic disorder or other neuroses contributing to a patient's respiratory symptoms may be indicated by rapid shallow breathing, irregular respiratory patterns, sighing, and paroxysms of hyperventilation. These symptoms and the concomitant anxiety may be due to hyperventilation itself.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Regulatory systems</strong> – Abnormalities in ventilatory control are important in symptom development in some patients with hyperventilation syndrome. The reticular activating system in the brainstem, which regulates breathing patterns when individuals are awake, may be overactive in hyperventilation syndrome. Under normal conditions, healthy individuals demonstrate regular breathing with no voluntary effort. When asked to voluntarily increase minute ventilation, patients with hyperventilation syndrome may experience symptoms associated with hyperventilation syndrome. As an example, hyperventilation symptoms can be induced in such patients when they are instructed to breathe through a mouthpiece, while normal control subjects can do this, usually with an increase in ventilation, with no clinical symptoms [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The inability of patients with hyperventilation syndrome to breathe comfortably through a mouthpiece may indicate an overactive reticular activating system.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) or a hypersensitive fear network (the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and its brainstem projections) have also been proposed as mechanisms for the hyperventilation syndrome and its association with psychological symptoms [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. An activated hypersensitive fear network may result in an increased central respiratory drive, both as a manifestation of a "fight or flight" response and as a means to reduce arterial tension of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) levels and thereby decrease direct stimulation of the fear network. Sighing dyspnea may result from decreased sensitivity of alveolar stretch receptors that monitor inflation of the lung; typically, large tidal volume alleviates the dyspnea associated with disorders of the respiratory system characterized by increased airway resistance or decreased respiratory system compliance [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The multiple, repetitive, large-volume sighing breaths may reflect an overly sensitive deflation reflex, triggered by a different set of stretch receptors, or failure to achieve normal relief from large tidal volume.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurologic symptoms</strong> – The mechanism by which hyperventilation causes symptoms such as bilaterally symmetrical paresthesias, headache, lightheadedness, and tetany is not well established. One hypothesis is that these symptoms may be due to local vasoconstriction and/or cerebral vasoconstriction. Cerebral blood flow decreases in a linear fashion with decreasing PaCO<sub>2</sub>: a decrease of 1 mmHg of PaCO<sub>2</sub> is associated with a 2 percent decrease in cerebral blood flow [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Thus, a reduction in cerebral blood flow in the setting of hyperventilation, hypocapnia, and respiratory alkalosis may explain the neurologic symptoms associated with the hyperventilation syndrome such as paresthesias, headache, lightheadedness, and tetany [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. If true, these symptoms should rapidly respond to normalization of PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Another proposed mechanism is that acute changes in ionized serum calcium levels, triggered by respiratory alkalosis and the consequent binding of calcium to albumin, could result in paresthesias and/or tetany. There is no evidence (nor would it be anticipated) that hyperventilation results in changes in total serum calcium levels [<a href="#rid14">14,15,19</a>]. Hypophosphatemia has been noted in hyperventilating patients, however, and may contribute to tetany [<a href="#rid3">3,15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Vestibular and balance disorders may play an etiologic role for some patients with hyperventilation syndrome, accounting for symptoms of lightheadedness. Specifically, the distress associated with postural symptoms in the setting of vestibular pathology may also trigger hyperventilation. Furthermore, the vestibular system affects the activity of respiratory muscles in response to changes in body position. In patients with vestibular pathology, such responses may be exaggerated and result in inappropriate increases in ventilation [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pulmonary symptoms</strong> – An imbalance between sensory signals (from pulmonary and chest wall stretch receptors) and motor signals (from the motor cortex), called efferent-afferent dissociation, may be the cause of perceived dyspnea in hyperventilation syndrome; the greater the imbalance, the greater the severity of dyspnea [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. The sensation of dyspnea may then precipitate a voluntary increase in minute ventilation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pulmonary symptoms in some patients diagnosed with hyperventilation syndrome may be due to unrecognized pulmonary pathology. Intermittent, mild, clinically unrecognized airway obstruction due to asthma may account for some cases of hyperventilation syndrome [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. The difficulty in accurately diagnosing asthma, especially mild cases, contributes to delayed recognition of this diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/543.html" rel="external">"Asthma in adolescents and adults: Evaluation and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Functional laryngeal pathology</strong> – Laryngeal air leak due to vocal fold dysfunction is a possible mechanism by which unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy may contribute to the development of hyperventilation syndrome [<a href="#rid13">13,26</a>]. As an example, in a study including 10 patients experiencing permanent unilateral RLN palsy and dyspnea following thyroidectomy (for benign disease), eight were diagnosed with hyperventilation syndrome [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The extent to which vocal fold pathology contributes to hyperventilation syndrome is unclear, however, and further research into the relationship between neurologic, psychiatric, and structural causes of hyperventilation syndrome is needed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119345.html" rel="external">"Exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other </strong>– In one small case series at a single center including 147 patients with persistent dyspnea three months after COVID-19 infection, six were ultimately diagnosed with hyperventilation syndrome [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. A combination of the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhgs.uhb.nhs.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2FNijmegen_Questionnaire.pdf&amp;token=C0P0JrL4DHI43TgZoGhLrmPhrsJiWlS1Um6QcNZUY4bK%2FqR8%2FysjqQzL6FWfDHM2fWUMWCU5BX0PdIMglmOtGIAYt67F%2B9N8TWHylCzlNJU%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=16288" target="_blank">Nijmegen score</a> [<a href="#rid28">28</a>], hyperventilation challenge, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing were used to establish the diagnosis (see <a class="local">'Ancillary diagnostic testing'</a> below). The etiology by which COVID-19 may be associated with hyperventilation syndrome is unclear.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H104941454"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While the presentation of hyperventilation syndrome can vary significantly among individuals, the typical pattern is that of intermittent episodes of spontaneously resolving hyperventilation unassociated with or out of proportion to cardiopulmonary pathology. The cardinal feature of hyperventilation syndrome is a transient increase in minute ventilation, out of proportion to metabolic needs, that lasts several minutes to an hour and resolves spontaneously [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. While the underlying process is hyperventilation, patients report a variety of somatic and nonsomatic complaints simultaneous to the increased respiration.</p><p></p><p>Although there are rare case reports of post-hyperventilation apnea that have been associated with severe hypoxemia and even death [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>], episodes of hyperventilation generally resolve without complications.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8373026"><span class="h2">Somatic symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Somatic complaints associated with hyperventilation syndrome may include [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dyspnea (60 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dizziness or lightheadedness (13 to 50 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10,24</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chest pain or tightness (43 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Paresthesias (35 to 60 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10,24</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Palpitations (13 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Carpopedal spasm (9 percent)</p><p></p><p>In one series, a minority of patients (17 percent) were aware that they were hyperventilating [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Importantly, patients with hyperventilation syndrome are only intermittently symptomatic, and symptoms typically occur with unpredictable frequency.</p><p>Respiratory sensations associated with an acute episode may include dyspnea, air hunger, the sensation of an inability to inhale a complete breath, and/or a feeling of unsatisfying breathing (ie, a sensation that tidal volumes are too small despite each breath's volume being quite large). Patients experiencing an episode of hyperventilation syndrome typically will have a breathing pattern characterized by relatively slow, very deep breaths, sometimes punctuated by deep sighs. Patients with sighing dyspnea, which overlaps with hyperventilation, typically complain of "shortness of breath," "I can't get enough air or oxygen," or "I can't fill my lungs with air," often with some vague chest discomfort and often with an anxiety component. The sighs are typically not perceived by the patients who may instead report difficulty taking a deep breath [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p>Unlike patients with pulmonary vascular disease, who typically complain of dyspnea that develops or worsens with exertion, patients with hyperventilation syndrome typically report dyspnea at rest and the need to sigh frequently.</p><p>Although symmetric, bilateral paresthesias are the most common peripheral neurologic symptom in hyperventilation syndrome, carpopedal spasm was described in the original clinical reports of hyperventilation attacks and is still considered a feature of the syndrome [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Its presence may depend on the severity of hyperventilation, to the extent that carpopedal syndrome may be triggered by alkalosis-induced metabolic changes or cerebral vasoconstriction associated with hypocapnia. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Additionally, patients with hyperventilation syndrome who develop symptoms with voluntary hyperventilation or exercise typically experience delayed resolution of respiratory symptoms after exercise compared with normal subjects. Furthermore, the intensity of exertion may not correlate with the degree of dyspnea experienced by patients with hyperventilation syndrome; relatively minimal exertion may result in significant dyspnea [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8373033"><span class="h2">Psychological symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Episodes of acute hyperventilation are associated with anxiety and other psychological symptoms. Patients with hyperventilation may report [<a href="#rid10">10,24</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sense of impending doom and panic</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anxiety and fear</p><p></p><p>In a small series that used a formal interview instrument (Clinical Interview Schedule) to assess psychologic symptoms, 17 of 23 patients (78 percent) exceeded the threshold for anxiety or panic [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In many patients, these symptoms reflect a primary psychological pathology that is the cause of hyperventilation. In other patients, anxiety and somatoform symptoms are a result of hyperventilation and the accompanying metabolic changes that cause systemic disturbance. In one emergency department series of 616 patients with hyperventilation, fear was present in over 95 percent [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Furthermore, a sensation of being "afraid" was more prevalent in patients with hyperventilation syndrome and panic disorder than in patients with dyspnea due to pulmonary disease (without panic disorder or psychiatric contributions to dyspnea) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

The differential diagnosis is broad  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111013" href="/z/d/graphic/111013.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); the following are some of the processes that can be misinterpreted as hyperventilation syndrome during the early evaluation of patients presenting with hyperventilation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It is important to note, however, that the following differential diagnoses primarily represents causes of acute hyperventilation, which is a clinical and pathophysiologically distinct process from the recurrent, episodic hyperventilation that defines hyperventilation syndrome. In addition, these conditions are typically not associated with true hyperventilation (ie, acute respiratory alkalosis with normal alveolar-arterial oxygen difference) as opposed to an increase in total ventilation to compensate for gas exchange abnormalities, increased metabolic activity, or metabolic acidosis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Metabolic acidosis</strong> – Disorders that cause metabolic acidosis can lead to compensatory respiratory alkalosis (achieved by hyperventilation).

Kussmaul breathing, which is relatively deep and slow, is characteristic of both hyperventilation syndrome and the respiratory response to metabolic acidosis. One should note, however, that most of the conditions associated with an increased anion gap, with the exception of chronic kidney failure, are acute in nature and would not be associated with chronic hyperventilation.

Clues to the presence of heart failure include orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, an irregularly irregular rhythm, peripheral edema, a history of cardiac disease, crackles on chest exam, and increased jugular venous distension.

This is done by a combination of assessment of risk factors for PE, examination for evidence of hemodynamic compromise (eg, tachycardia &gt;100/minute), pulse oximetry, and D-dimer in appropriate patients. The majority of patients with PE have a widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, in contrast to patients with hyperventilation syndrome in whom gas exchange is generally normal. The hyperventilation associated with PE is likely due to stimulation of pulmonary and vascular receptors that increase the central drive to breathe. The decision to obtain computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography is based on the likelihood of PE according to probability scores or overall clinical suspicion.

Pulse oximetry may show decreased oxygen saturation, although oxygen saturation may be normal in a patient with otherwise normal lungs. A chest radiograph, or thoracic ultrasound by a trained clinician, is needed to exclude the diagnosis.

The latter is more often an inspiratory phenomenon, associated with audible stridor, and the oxygen saturation will usually be normal. Patients with PVFM can "pant" during an episode, whereas asthmatic patients cannot. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy during an acute PVFM attack is diagnostic, the key finding being that the vocal cords come together during inspiration, especially posteriorly, rather than move apart from the midline. Measuring peak expiratory flow or forced expiratory volume in one second can help in the assessment of asthma exacerbations but are dependent on patient effort and technique.

Generally, other features, such as cough, sputum production, and &gt;20 pack-year smoking history, provide clues to the diagnosis. It is also important to remember that tachypnea or hyperventilation from any cause in the setting of airflow obstruction (eg, COPD) may lead to dynamic hyperinflation and associated physiological changes that will cause or worsen dyspnea.

Lack of response to bronchodilators, monophonic wheeze, and inspiratory stridor are clues to upper airway obstruction, but their absence does not exclude this diagnosis. In addition, such patients may have arterial blood gas evidence of respiratory acidosis without an increased alveolar-to-arterial gradient.

Patients with cirrhosis may have impaired metabolism of lactic acid, such that infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can present with increased ventilation in response to metabolic acidosis. Identification of symptoms and signs suggesting infection (eg, fever) or specific to an infectious source (eg, productive cough, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms) and knowledge of underlying disorders can help lead to the correct diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1657.html" rel="external">"Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1247.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Clinical manifestations"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Central nervous system disorders</strong> – Patients will frequently hyperventilate after a grand mal seizure, particularly if metabolic acidosis developed during the seizure.

The combination of the patient's presentation, absence of findings to support an alternative diagnosis, and symptom resolution may be sufficient to diagnose hyperventilation syndrome in the majority of cases. However, the challenge to the clinician is that for patients presenting acutely with hyperventilation, a number of respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic, and infectious illnesses are in the differential diagnosis and must be excluded clinically or with further testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111013" href="/z/d/graphic/111013.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

In addition, the patient should be examined for signs of significant respiratory distress, such as the use of accessory muscles, inability to lie flat, distended jugular veins, profound diaphoresis, or altered mental status. Other physical findings that would suggest a cause other than hyperventilation include signs of dehydration, goiter, new loud murmur, S3 gallop, pericardial rub, abdominal tenderness, encephalopathy, or new peripheral edema. If any of these is present, particular care should be taken to exclude causes of dyspnea and hyperventilation due to alternative diseases.

These components of an advanced diagnostic evaluation are indicated only for a minority of patients with suspected hyperventilation syndrome and should be pursued in concert with a specialist (such as a pulmonologist). Such non-routine testing may include a hyperventilation provocation test (HVPT) and investigational carbon dioxide inhalation testing [<a href="#rid46">46-48</a>].</p><p>In the HVPT, subjects are asked to hyperventilate (typically for three to five minutes) in an effort to precipitate spontaneous symptoms. A patient's symptoms are assessed <strong>after</strong> voluntary hyperventilation and compared with the symptoms experienced by the patient during spontaneous "attacks." Compared with normal subjects, minute ventilation may be elevated, and normalization of PaCO<sub>2</sub> after voluntary hyperventilation may be delayed in patients with hyperventilation syndrome [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The HVPT has several limitations, however, and its clinical utility is uncertain [<a href="#rid2">2,49,50</a>]. One study reports that in a randomized trial the HVPT was positive in 85 of 115 subjects with suspected hyperventilation (74 percent), but that 56 of the 85 also had a positive placebo test (in which CO<sub>2</sub> levels were maintained during overbreathing) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p>In another study, HVPT was compared with CPET in 59 patients with hyperventilation syndrome; HVPT more consistently reproduced symptoms of hyperventilation syndrome as compared with CPET [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].

First described in 1982, this tool assesses symptoms and complaints potentially attributable to hyperventilation [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. The clinical utility of the Nijmegen questionnaire is uncertain in the evaluation of patients with suspected hyperventilation syndrome, however, as the correlation between a positive Nijmegen score and confirmed hyperventilation syndrome is variable [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].

Ask the patient to adjust their breathing so that the hand on the abdomen moves with greater excursion and the hand on the chest barely moves at all. Assure the patient that this is hard to learn and will take some practice to fully master. Ask the patient to breathe in slowly over four seconds, pause for a few seconds, and then breathe out over a period of eight seconds.
