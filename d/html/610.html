         Learning disorders (LD) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by difficulties mastering academic skills. Academic skills are substantially and measurably below those expected for chronologic age and interfere with academic or occupational performance [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. LDs are the most common form of learning disability in children.
        </p>
        <p>
         LDs have a multifactorial etiology [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. They typically manifest as a failure to acquire reading, writing, or math skills at grade- and age-expected levels. Learning problems that are outside of these traditional core domains, such as memory problems, attention problems, processing speed deficits, and difficulty managing social interactions, are not typically considered to be LDs. However, they may affect reading, writing, and math and may also require intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical features of LDs will be presented here. Educational definitions for LD, the evaluation of LD, educational interventions for LD, and the role of the primary care provider are discussed separately:

         This topic review uses the term "learning disorder (LD)" or "specific learning disorder," consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Specific learning disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by difficulties with academic skills in reading, writing, and/ or math that usually are mastered during the early school years. The skills are substantially and measurably below those expected for chronologic age and interfere with academic or occupational performance [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         "Learning disorder" and "learning disability" refer to the same neurodevelopmental conditions. There is a lack of consensus case definition. Between three commonly used definitions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53010" href="/z/d/graphic/53010.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), there is agreement that the core features include impairments in specific, academic skills that are normally mastered during the early school years. Impairment is determined by comparison with age-related norms of performance [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ] and/or the individual's overall intellectual potential [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-6
         </a>
         ]. We prefer the DSM-5-TR definition because of its stronger conceptual basis and therapeutic utility. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/626.html" rel="external">

         Learning disorders (LDs) are twice as common in children with chronic health conditions as in children without chronic health conditions. Children who receive special education services have greater rates of health care utilization than children who do not receive special education services [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. These correlations persist into adolescence and adulthood [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. As such, pediatricians are especially likely to encounter children with LD. However, they may not recognize those children unless they ask about learning problems specifically.

          Prevalence

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The prevalence of LD is difficult to determine because different criteria are used to define LD in different settings. However, data from the National Center for Education Statistics indicate that in 2020-2021, 15 percent of all public school students age 3 to 21 years received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Among students receiving IDEA services, 33 percent were categorized as having a specific learning disability and 19 percent as having a speech or language impairment. These statistics must be interpreted with caution; they indicate the proportion of students who were found eligible for specialized instruction, which is not the same as the number of students who meet criteria for a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) diagnosis of LD.
        </p>
        <p>
         Disorders of reading and written expression are the most common forms of LD. In a population-based study, the prevalence of reading disability among school-age children was estimated to be between 5 and 12 percent, depending upon the criteria used for definition (intelligence-achievement discrepancy versus low achievement, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In the same population, the prevalence of disorders of written expression was estimated to be between 7 and 15 percent [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. In separate studies, the prevalence of dyscalculia (math disability) was estimated to be between 3 and 6 percent of the school-age population [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15

         </span>
         Learning disorders (LDs) are caused by inborn or acquired abnormalities in brain structure and function and have a multifactorial etiology [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. LDs may be present at birth or acquired after birth as a result of illness, exposure to toxins, poor nutrition, medical treatment, sociocultural deprivation, or injury [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-25
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         LDs are not caused by eye problems [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ]. Although the eyes are essential to the receipt of visual input, it is the brain that processes visual stimuli and interprets visual images (eg, reverses letters, words, or numbers) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Neither LDs nor the processing of visual input is affected by the correction of subtle visual defects [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The pathogenesis of LDs is not known. Genetic and neuropathologic causes may be at the core of LD, particularly in the case of reading disability. However, the full expression of LD occurs as a result of these neuropathologic differences in conjunction with other intrinsic and environmental factors that affect learning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other intrinsic factors include brain functions, such as language skills, executive functions, and social cognition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Environmental factors include school factors (eg, student-teacher interactions; appropriately paced instruction; the student's past exposure to learning opportunities at school; level of stimulation provided by the learning materials; physical layout of the classroom setting) and home factors (eg, past exposure to learning at home, degree of support provided in the home for reading and homework completion, etc). [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29-33
         </a>
         ]. For a review of these factors and their association with socioeconomic status, see reference [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Neuropathologic causes for learning failure can be mitigated with appropriate specialized instruction and a supportive learning environment and can be aggravated when the learning environment is not supportive. Successful remedial educational interventions have been associated with changes in brain function specific to language processes [

         Specific reading disability (dyslexia) is estimated to occur in approximately 5 to 12 percent of school-age children, depending upon the criteria used for definition [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Dyslexia is a specific type of reading disorder caused by deficits in phonologic processing. Difficult/slow reading also can be caused by orthographic processing deficits (difficulty recognizing words by sight and needing to sound out every letter to read the word). The deficits are unexpected in relation to the student's chronologic age and persist even after receiving appropriate (general education) instruction.

         Reading disability typically presents initially with problems in decoding in the first year or two of school. Even when decoding is mastered, students with reading disability continue to present with dysfluent reading (slow or effortful decoding) in higher grades.

        <p>
         Dysfluent reading results in reading comprehension difficulty. Problems with reading comprehension usually present in the latter part of the primary school years, when the focus is on reading to learn rather than learning to read. Children with reading disability may have attention problems and may avoid reading. They can be identified by low overall reading achievement or by low reading ability in relation to their overall intelligence.

         Mathematics LDs (dyscalculia) are primarily due to weaknesses in number sense and in performing calculations. Math learning difficulty can also occur for other reasons, as outlined below. Math LD is estimated to occur in 3 to 6 percent of children [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14,43
         </a>

         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ], depending on the age of the student and the formula used to defined math LD.
        </p>
        <p>
         Success in math depends upon mastering of a range of skills. These skills are not necessarily acquired in a linear manner. The most important components of math LD include difficulties in mastering number sense, math calculations (adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying), and math facts (automatic retrieval) [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. In addition to these basic components, students with math LD can have difficulty with the language of math (correctly reading and understanding numbers and symbols), with word problems in math (correctly reading and understanding math word problems, correctly transcribing the word problems into a numerical equation), and with the visual-spatial and organizational demands of math [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Success in math is thus dependent on a broad range of neurodevelopmental functions. Each of these is summarized below:

          Calculation and retrieval of math facts
         </strong>
         – Math facts refer to the basic calculations taught in primary school (eg, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing). Common one- and two-digit math facts are usually memorized and then retrieved automatically from memory in later grades and in solving higher-order math problems. Difficulty performing math calculations is commonly related to problems with number sense. The student with poor math fact skills may not know how to complete math calculations and may over-rely on tangible aids, such as objects, pictures, or tables. Difficulty with the automatic retrieval of math facts is another manifestation of math disability and can also create difficulty in solving higher-order math problems. Teaching the rapid retrieval of math facts can be a specific focus for intervention and instruction.

These students fail to correctly transcribe math word problems into numerical equations.

Students with math LD also have difficulty planning and organizing their approach to math problems. They have difficulty with multistep problems; they may fail to verify answers and may settle for the first answer they reach for a given problem.

         ). Students with language impairment do not necessarily have difficulty with encoding and decoding (phonics) or handwriting, which are hallmark features of reading and writing disabilities. Although students with language-based LDs may be able to encode, decode, and print words as well as their peers, they may not have the vocabulary, grammar, or narrative skills needed to comprehend text or write a composition at the level expected for their age or grade.

         Students with language impairment also may have difficulties with classroom participation. They may not be able to understand and follow teacher directions, follow or participate in classroom discussion, and may even have difficulty communicating with peers in a social setting. These classroom participation behaviors are as important as reading and writing for the student's success at school. Language impairment and associated problems with classroom participation also mandate remediation and/or accommodations.

In contrast to the LD syndromes described above, which typically can be identified by the primary care provider, the primary care provider is not expected to identify NLD. A neuropsychology evaluation is usually needed to make the diagnosis.

         The clinical expression of LD is not simply a reflection of impairment in a given skill but results from the interaction of many factors, including co-occurrence with psychiatric conditions or internalizing and externalizing symptoms [

         The environment has an important impact on the clinical expression of LD. Classrooms that are organized and instruction that is systematic and predictable can help to mitigate the degree to which intrinsic learning weaknesses affect the child's learning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Teachers who are skilled at determining a student's capacity to understand, remember, and follow oral instructions and who can adjust the language load by simplifying instructions, providing repetition, and/or providing visual supports can reduce the impact of language delays on the child's learning and thereby improve the child's overall performance when they are expected to learn to read or count. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/614.html" rel="external">
          "Specific learning disorders in children: Educational management", section on 'Quality instruction'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Teachers who understand the impact of executive dysfunctions, which occur in children with ADHD and other disorders, can mitigate the impact of executive dysfunctions by providing extra monitoring, supervision, and organizational supports. All of these classroom strategies help to reduce the effort that the student has to make when addressing learning tasks related to their areas of weakness, regardless of LD type. However, the consistency with which such teaching strategies are practiced is highly variable. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/623.html" rel="external">
          "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Overview of treatment and prognosis", section on 'School-based interventions'

         Similarly, the home environment can affect the expression of learning problems. Home environments in which reading is practiced, or that provide structure (eg, rules and directions), predictability, and routine, can moderate the effects of language weaknesses and/or executive dysfunctions. These factors are not always considered to be a specific focus of educational intervention, but when they are implemented successfully, they help prepare the student to learn in the classroom. Language and executive dysfunction are particularly important areas to target for any student with an LD, regardless of the LD type [

         Pediatric health care providers should consider the possibility of LD in children who have risk factors and children who have problems at school (whether the problems are related to academic achievement, behavior, attention, or social interaction). LDs interfere with all aspects of life, not just academics [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59

         ]. Deficits in one area usually lead to, or are associated with, difficulties in another [

         Limited information is available about the persistence of LDs over time. For example, reading disability is estimated to have a diagnostic stability rate of 28 to 78 percent, depending upon the study [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66,67
         </a>
         ]. These estimates are too wide to be clinically meaningful and are explained, in part, by the varying criteria used to define reading disability, the age at which the original diagnosis was made, and by treatment effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diagnostic stability for reading disability is lower among younger children (eg, kindergarten and grade 1 students), suggesting that reading difficulty in younger children may have a variety of causes, some of which are more amenable to treatment than others. Among older children (eg, grade 3 and higher grades), reading disability tends to persist over time. Even though reading skills may improve, reading decoding and (more commonly) reading fluency skills continue to measure below normal. Variation in the clinical expression of reading disability over time makes consistent measurement and identification more problematic [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68-70
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Less information is available about the diagnostic stability of other types of LD. In one study, 65 to 70 percent of children who had difficulty with math throughout kindergarten had persistent math difficulty in grade 5 [
         <a href="#rid71">

         LD usually do not exist in isolation. They co-occur with other LDs, with internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and with many neurodevelopmental disorders [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55,56
         </a>
         ]. For this reason, the evaluation of LD must be broad and should include an evaluation for a range of coexistent conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a sample of 485 clinically referred children referred for evaluation, 65 percent had LD; writing disability was most common (92 percent) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Among children with writing disability, 15 percent had coexisting reading and math disability; 14 percent had coexisting reading disability; and 13 had coexisting math disability. In a separate study of 949 children with neurodevelopmental conditions, LD co-occurred in 71 percent of children with ADHD, 67 percent of children with autism, 79 percent of children with bipolar disorder, and 18 to 19 percent of children with oppositional defiant disorder, adjustment disorder, anxiety, and depression [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. These findings underscore the importance of a comprehensive assessment for a variety of LD syndromes and psychiatric conditions in all children with LD.
        </p>
        <p>
         The lack of consistent LD case identification makes it difficult to accurately determine the frequency of co-occurrence of LD with psychiatric conditions. However, the general trend for overlap is striking, with most studies suggesting LD in 20 to 70 percent of children with behavioral or psychiatric conditions (eg, ADHD, anxiety, depression) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41,56,72,73

These conditions can be identified by history, examination, and ancillary evaluation (eg, audiology, vision screening). Other conditions may require more specialized testing and/or referral. Qualitative observations and/or the student's report card often can identify LD, but psychometric testing is used to make a formal diagnosis.

          Terminology
         </strong>
         – The core feature of specific learning disorders (LDs) is an intrinsic cognitive difficulty that results in academic achievement at a level less than expected for the individual's age  (

         <strong>
          Risk factors
         </strong>
         – Risk factors for LD include family history of LD, poverty, prematurity, developmental and mental health conditions (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], depression), prenatal alcohol exposure, neurologic conditions (eg, seizure disorder, neurofibromatosis), chromosomal disorders (eg, fragile X syndrome, Turner syndrome), certain chronic medical conditions (eg, type 1 diabetes mellitus), and history of central nervous system infection or irradiation.

         <strong>
          Etiology and pathogenesis
         </strong>
         – LDs are caused by inborn or acquired abnormalities in brain structure and function and have a multifactorial etiology. They are not caused by eye problems. (See

         <strong>
          Factors affecting clinical expression
         </strong>
         – The clinical expression of LD is influenced by concomitant internalizing and externalizing symptoms and psychiatric conditions, the classroom environment (eg, amount of structure, skill of teacher), and the home environment (eg, amount of structure [eg, rules, directions], predictability, routine). (See

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Pediatric health care providers should consider the possibility of LD in children who have risk factors and children who have problems at school (whether the problems are related to academic achievement, behavior, attention, or social interaction). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Comorbidities
