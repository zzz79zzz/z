(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3870467489"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Appropriate prehospital assessment and management of children is challenging and requires dedicated resources to ensure the best outcomes [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In the past, it was common for emergency medical service (EMS) agencies to employ the "load and go" philosophy when providing prehospital care to an ill or injured child without strong emphasis on the provision of pediatric-specific stabilization. More recently, many agencies have improved the level of prehospital pediatric care and invested in training and equipment for their prehospital providers (eg, emergency medical technicians, paramedics). </p><p>In the United States, the federally supported Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) program has been and continues to be a major factor in promoting more intensive prehospital care within existing EMS systems [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The EMSC program's performance measures inform its priorities and are described on the EMSC Innovation and Improvement Center's (EIIC) <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Femscimprovement.center%2Fprograms%2Fpartnerships%2Fperformance-measures%2F&amp;token=aApbmDCKEEqGYOC8VBSeM4KZeb6E5KAI9DLczVNV%2BoUT6IUP7L6DVktVMu4f5XaRCCtm6Tw0j9rejm4Lq8y8wX%2BnkY9zL%2FqgiG3I4r98fdE%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870" target="_blank">website</a> [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The EMSC program has supported prehospital pediatric research, developed educational tools for prehospital providers, and assessed the availability of equipment, online medical direction, and offline protocols for pediatric patients [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. As a result, pediatric-focused offline protocols where providers can reference assessment tools, management pathways, or pediatric medication dosing or equipment types and sizing are more widely available. In addition, online medical direction by pediatric emergency medicine specialists with expertise in prehospital care is occurring in select EMS agencies throughout the United States. The EMS for Children program is integrating quality improvement methodology into its work through the EIIC [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7779219"><span class="h1">ONLINE MEDICAL CONTROL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Online medical control consists of physician direction, supervision, and authorization of prehospital treatment by phone, radio, or on the scene in real time. The physician may be located at a base station that is not located at the facility that will eventually receive the patient. In some settings, online medical control implies 24-hour availability of physicians to provide prehospital medical direction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)", section on 'Base station personnel'</a>.) </p><p>Physicians who will provide online medical control should have pediatric emergency medicine knowledge and skills, specific training in online medical direction, and detailed knowledge of pediatric protocols in use in their region. Medical control physicians must have a clear understanding of the abilities and limitations of the prehospital providers and overall system constraints. Although prehospital providers share this responsibility, medical control physicians must be careful not to direct prehospital personnel to act outside their scope of practice, which may be determined by the emergency medical services (EMS) medical director or state and county-wide protocols.</p><p>While online medical control does allow for customized prehospital medical care, relying on it for every encounter delays transport to definitive care and is labor-intensive. In many systems, much of prehospital care is provided through standard protocols. (See <a class="local">'Offline medical control'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1564299"><span class="h2">Medical direction training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To be most effective, physicians who provide online pediatric medical control should have a proper understanding of how to fulfill that role as well as specific knowledge of their local and regional EMS. Key actions to optimize their online medical direction include (see <a class="local">'Additional resources'</a> below):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintain pediatric emergency medicine knowledge and skills with emphasis on the specific types of critical illnesses and injuries that commonly require prehospital intervention (eg, respiratory diseases, seizures, trauma, poisoning). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Develop a general understanding of the structure of EMS in their region including how the EMS system is accessed (eg, United States: 911; European Union: 112; Australia: 000), dispatch protocols, and the scope of practice of specific transport personnel. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)", section on 'The EMS system'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)", section on 'Dispatch personnel'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)", section on 'Scope of practice'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obtain specific education on how to provide online medical direction. Many emergency physicians receive specific training during their emergency medicine residencies, fellowships in pediatric emergency medicine, or fellowships in emergency medical services. Others may take online medical direction courses offered by various organizations (eg, the National Association of EMS Physicians or the American College of Emergency Physicians).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Understand the local system or systems in which they practice including the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Type of system (eg, public, private or volunteer systems). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)", section on 'Types of EMS systems'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Organization of the dispatch system and prehospital response to an emergency call (eg, tiered versus non-tiered). In the context of EMS, tiered response refers to level of provider training and timing to dispatch of providers to a scene. Examples of tiered systems include: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Single-tiered: Dispatch of either a basic life support (BLS) or an advanced life support (ALS) team</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Two-tiered: Dispatch of a BLS team initially followed by an ALS team, if needed </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Three-tiered: BLS and ALS dispatched per two-tiered; dispatch of on-scene physician as needed</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Aside from mass-casualty incidents and prehospital personnel deaths, it remains rare for physicians in North America to be dispatched to the scene of an emergency, though this varies by region. This is in contrast to countries in Europe, where physicians may be routinely dispatched directly to the scene to provide care for the critically ill or injured patient [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Level of preparedness for pediatric encounters based upon initial and ongoing prehospital provider education, training, and experience.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The policies, capabilities and capacities of the region's EMS agencies and hospitals. For example, some hospitals may be more equipped than others to stabilize the acutely ill or injured child. Additionally, there are often regionalized centers to provide specific care to pediatric patients (eg, trauma centers, burn centers). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The regional laws governing EMS and emergency department (ED) operations. For example, consent and do-not-resuscitate laws are not consistent across jurisdictions and ignorance of the law does not protect the clinician from prosecution [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Communication channels and equipment used to connect providers on scene with medical directors and hospitals.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Policies and procedures for safe patient delivery at the hospital and safe transfer of patient care to the accepting medical teams.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1564306"><span class="h2">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to every prehospital notification of transport should be organized and consistent. The medical control physician should always be cordial during prehospital communications and available for updates during prehospital transport. Medical control physicians should:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Identify</strong> <strong>themselves to the caller as a medical control physician</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Identify the callers and clarify their capabilities (ie, scope of practice)</strong> – The medical control physicians may be contacted by different prehospital personnel including: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dispatcher, base station, EMS medical director, or provider on scene. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)", section on 'Dispatch personnel'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Basic life support (BLS) personnel (eg, emergency medical responder [EMR], first responder [FR], emergency medical technician [EMT]), advanced life support (ALS) providers (advanced EMT, paramedic, supervisor, nurse or physician) – If not already established, the medical control physician needs to assess the prehospital provider's ability to respond to medical direction for patient management and social, legal, or administrative issues during the transport. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)", section on 'Scope of practice'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Request patient information</strong> – Key information includes age, brief history, physical assessment with vital signs, and treatment provided and response. Prehospital providers often use physical assessment tools and scores such as the pediatric assessment triangle, the pediatric Glasgow coma scale  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662" href="/z/d/graphic/59662.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), or trauma triage scores  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52562" href="/z/d/graphic/52562.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) to rapidly communicate the severity of illness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6393.html" rel="external">"Initial assessment and stabilization of children with respiratory or circulatory compromise", section on 'Pediatric assessment triangle'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6459.html" rel="external">"Classification of trauma in children"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The length of this exchange will depend upon many variables including the safety of the scene, the provider's level of training, and the condition of the patient. It may be necessary to interrupt the prehospital provider during the communication to reorient the priorities to stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation. For example, a field report that the child is intubated does not ensure that the endotracheal tube (ETT) is properly placed. The clinician may need to stop and ask the provider what confirmatory measures have occurred to prove that the ETT is in the trachea, such as qualitative end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement or auscultation, before proceeding with the rest of the exchange.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When time permits, it is often necessary to remind the prehospital provider to involve the caregiver in the patient's assessment, especially when the patient is a child with special health care needs. Often the caregiver's assessment of mental status, respiratory effort, or color relative to the child's normal baseline is essential to determine proper prehospital interventions. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although there is key patient information the medical control physician needs to assist with care, it is critical to ensure that these communications are private. Some EMS radio communications are on public airwaves or channels; one should never use any patient identifiers on this type of call. Know the privacy status of EMS communications before engaging in online medical control.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ensure provider safety</strong> – The environment in which EMS providers practice is often not as safe and controlled as that of the medical control physician. The providers will typically ensure that their surroundings are safe from physical harm before proceeding with patient assessment and management. However, occasionally the medical control physician may recognize risk that was not noted by the provider (eg, exposure to transmittable infection diseases or toxins) and should remind the provider to don appropriate personal protective equipment. When a serious infectious disease exposure has occurred, the EMS agency's infection control officer should also be contacted once patient transport has been completed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Provide patient care recommendations</strong> – When making patient care recommendations, the clinician must understand the capabilities and constraints of the prehospital provider and the medications and equipment available to them. For example, it is <strong>not</strong> appropriate to order a BLS provider to perform endotracheal intubation because they are not licensed or trained to perform this procedure. Prehospital providers also typically operate under protocols that have been approved by their offline medical director. Depending upon the jurisdiction, they may or may not be able to perform actions that are not part of their protocol unless their medical director gives online approval. (See <a class="local">'Offline medical control'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When the medical control physician is unsure about the prehospital provider's capabilities, medications, or supplies, the best course of action is to ask the provider directly. In most EMS systems, it is ultimately the prehospital provider's responsibility to know and function within their scopes of practices.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additional considerations when making prehospital care recommendations include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Request length weight estimates (recommended) or, if length-based estimates are not available, age-based estimates when the actual weight is not known to provide appropriate pediatric drug dosing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6393.html" rel="external">"Initial assessment and stabilization of children with respiratory or circulatory compromise", section on 'Estimation of weight'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For safety, order by medication and patient weight (eg, milligrams, micrograms, or grams per kilogram) whenever possible. Ordering by volume may be problematic because medications may come in different concentrations. Some exceptions exist, including inhaled <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13272" href="/z/d/drug information/13272.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>, which is typically a standard volume updraft that does not vary by the weight of the child. If you must order by volume, make sure to ask for the concentration of the medication they carry.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The prehospital provider should repeat the drug and dose back to the medical control physician to ensure the order has been received and understood. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Recognize that the availability of equipment that is specific to children is often limited in the prehospital environment. In the United States, a recommended list of pediatric-sized equipment for ambulances has been developed [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Unfortunately, not all United States EMS agencies have the resources to comply with those recommendations. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Balance the benefits of carrying out physician orders on scene versus the risks of delaying transport to definitive care. (See <a class="local">'Timing of prehospital interventions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Allow time for the recommendation to be carried out before requesting a status update. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Remind the provider to reassess the child for changes in condition throughout transport.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Confirm the receiving hospital and estimated time of arrival (ETA)</strong> – In some circumstances (eg, level 1 trauma patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81002" href="/z/d/graphic/81002.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>)), the receiving hospital is predetermined by local or regional jurisdictions. In many systems, the prehospital providers have a good understanding of the facilities with the best pediatric resources. Otherwise, the medical control physician should select the receiving hospital that will provide the best care for the pediatric patient's condition while also limiting ambulance transport time. (See <a class="local">'Hospital destination'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Perform administrative duties </strong>– The medical control physician should ensure documentation of communication with the prehospital provider, including the correct transcription of any medication orders or recommended interventions. The requirements for documenting physician direction and medical management vary by system. The use of a recorded phone line is optimal for accurate documentation of physician involvement. A recorded system is also helpful when reviewing cases as part of quality improvement activities or managing complaints.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In some jurisdictions, the physician may bill for online ALS medical direction. The physician typically must be working in a hospital emergency department or critical care unit and provide documentation to support the appropriate billing. Patient billing should not be submitted for offline medical control. Billing for online medical control may be independent from the remainder of the ED evaluation and hospital services (eg, EMS ALS online direction is done at a hospital other than the receiving one) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ensure compliance with legal requirements </strong>– The medical control physician should provide the prehospital provider with recommendations that are in accordance with laws in that particular jurisdiction regarding (see <a class="local">'Difficult situations'</a> below):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reporting of child abuse </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Honoring of "do not resuscitate" orders</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ability of a patient to refuse treatment</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Actions to take if a legal guardian refuses medical transport</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7779305"><span class="h1">OFFLINE MEDICAL CONTROL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Offline medical control refers, in part, to the administration of emergency medical services (EMS) by an emergency medical services physician director using standardized prehospital care protocols [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. These protocols are in place to direct prehospital care and authorize specific medical treatments within a field provider's scope of practice without the need for real time communication. The prehospital provider often also has the ability to directly contact a medical control physician during prehospital treatment for care outside a written protocol, if questions arise, when directed by a protocol, or if a protocol does not specifically apply to the patient’s condition. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)", section on 'Base station personnel'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5796.html" rel="external">"Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)", section on 'EMS direction'</a>.) </p><p>Offline prehospital protocols facilitate rapid and effective treatment, standardize management actions for prehospital providers and provide a reference for EMS practice standards [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. The use of patient care protocols has also been shown to be effective in monitoring processes in medical care and providing a mechanism to provide feedback to emergency medical services personnel [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. </p><p>Many pediatric prehospital protocols exist, and there may be tremendous variation from region to region. In the United States, one of the most comprehensive collection of peer-reviewed model pediatric prehospital protocols has been developed by the National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO).

Furthermore, some governmental statutes recognize a mature minor exception that allows minors over a certain age, usually 14 years, to make medical decisions. However, the specific aspects of these exceptions vary according to region. Thus, it is critical that all physicians be familiar and in compliance with the laws of the locality in which they practice. </p><p>When illness and injury clearly could result in a minor's loss of life or limb, the physician should require transport over the objections of the minor.

For time-sensitive conditions, such as trauma, expediting transport may need to take priority over having a higher level of provider for the transport. As a general rule, ground transport is more readily available if an emergency facility is within 20 to 30 minutes of the scene, and air transport is better if there is rough terrain and/or a long distance between the scene and the emergency facility (which may be the case if a patient requires a specialty center such as a trauma or burn center). Sometimes a combination of air and ground transport is used. </p><p>The typical staffing (eg, emergency medical technician or paramedic) and equipment for basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) ambulances and the relative advantages of ground versus air prehospital transportation are discussed in detail separately.

Pediatric medical directors need to be aware of the dynamics of these family/prehospital provider interactions to really understand their systems' pediatric "non-transports."</p><p>In EMS systems that allow prehospital providers to treat children without transport afterwards on the basis of a non-urgent complaint, the following components are essential [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appropriate training of prehospital personnel with an emphasis on accurate pediatric assessment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clear policies and procedures to guide prehospital triage decisions</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Required online medical oversight</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Capacity in the local primary care network to provide early follow-up for children who are not transported</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ongoing quality improvement</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1564051"><span class="h1">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following resources are available to augment online and offline prehospital pediatric care:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Femscimprovement.center%2F&amp;token=0YqtR9aDKTO7nCIdojnDTbdQ7sh4z2lPcIXM4oixJI78MC08tkuabZ3fr0qlwPGY&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870" target="_blank">Emergency Medical Service for Children (EMSC)</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bcm.edu%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2014%2F74%2Femsc-naemsp-model-pediatric-protocols.pdf&amp;token=DEyvHBFFTGzxgFEOCALwCh8l1JoJNcQ6wkQlEWujosyZy6t6jTNKH3N2VRtqef1sGqBEPYd6yMOyQV5aEUlV%2FHaT1OImQE5lUkgjuXE8TQHMgX5luIk3p3Ud%2FJLrTXhg&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870" target="_blank">National Association of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Physicians model pediatric protocols</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moodlemedce.com%2Fpem-education%2Flogin%2Findex.php&amp;token=rKDm%2BdTiJ%2F4mqcciOFmq%2BW31bqBhFJVLRLj2hMVNcYRSWjDocH6urJvcX23uIEApHZed732pTTy%2BAe8345Lrkw%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870" target="_blank">Physician prehospital pediatrics course</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnaemsp.org%2Fresources%2Fstore%2F&amp;token=e26ulPw6uZQGAmHUSRiu7o1hbuVy7GAyUqTO6vhwNi5ccEMXkAmZNakn6KyfoC4A&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870" target="_blank">National Association of EMS Physicians base station course</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnasemso.org%2Fprojects%2Fmodel-ems-clinical-guidelines%2F&amp;token=K5nRCuJRCZXdxaiBf7%2FeJVyssFNxtor5Ctd2c2KpSv0Um5A5DO207dI6yHx8b%2Fenlph9UymFNNMr2wjUTmvFkw%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870" target="_blank">National Association of State EMS Officials Model EMS Clinical Guidelines</a></p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4245811762"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Online medical control</strong> – Online medical control consists of physician direction, supervision, and authorization of prehospital treatment by phone, radio, or at the scene in real time. The physician <strong>may</strong> be located at a base station that is not located at the facility that will eventually receive the patient. The general approach to real-time communication with a prehospital provider is discussed in detail above. (See <a class="local">'Online medical control'</a> above and <a class="local">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medical direction training</strong> – Physicians who provide online medical control should have pediatric emergency medicine knowledge and skills, specific training, a good understanding of the general approach to direction of prehospital treatment, and detailed knowledge of the regulations and pediatric protocols in use in their region. Medical control physicians should also have a clear understanding of the abilities of the prehospital providers, their limitations, and overall system constraints. (See <a class="local">'Medical direction training'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Offline medical control</strong> – Offline medical control refers, in part, to the administration of emergency medical services (EMS) by an EMS medical director through the use of prehospital care protocols. These protocols are in place to direct prehospital care and authorize specific medical treatments within a field provider's scope of practice without the need for real-time communication. (See <a class="local">'Offline medical control'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Examples of pediatric protocols developed for specific regions include the following (see <a class="local">'Medical and surgical emergencies'</a> above): </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maine.gov%2Fems%2Fprotocols-resources%2Fpre-hospital-care-protocols&amp;token=e66bY1%2BQ%2FFkcLACvAHZtg2QFVTTPvIR7SZWH4%2FrXn%2FJJo7Pkft8nb0X8abBk5JYuuoKj4YKs6RUc5nXwLTMDwohxZeYYqZwEoa9lPfpzPuE%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870" target="_blank">Maine</a></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthvermont.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FDEPRIP.Protocols+2018+FINAL+June+8.pdf&amp;token=sL%2Bp%2BgWoM5K8OZ3TcR7z2ftS1BHohh1vU4eTkb49tMDSJ9CeAF05RvzlxkyzVm0miGVMD%2FQdB%2FsfiON9FG9bVujAonj216BctfCjqqIXbZfRXCr1hLysyq3tFj1csqJp&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870" target="_blank">Vermont</a></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nh.gov%2Fsafety%2Fdivisions%2Ffstems%2Fems%2Fadvlifesup%2Fdocuments%2F2015patientcareprotocols.pdf&amp;token=3qbgSaItid8VO%2BbOOQbIAc446ljkaDe%2Flf0TWJqFQcWm2DiiLKoMD4gDvZyNxDFL1LnaFt6HSXdEZljRyf8%2FrKaCg3PrAZVC8Jh5TAue57lVZ1Wj7H04VS0H%2FGxOx9vP&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870" target="_blank">New Hampshire</a></p><p></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prehospital interventions</strong> – On-scene recommendations should include those treatments that are time sensitive, have clear benefit, are generally quick to perform  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83778" href="/z/d/graphic/83778.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Common prehospital pediatric procedures include cervical spine motion restriction, basic and advanced airway management, and vascular access. En route recommendations should include the continuation of those treatments started on scene and those that may add additional benefit without delaying transport time or further injury to child. (See <a class="local">'Timing of prehospital interventions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Difficult situations</strong> – Difficult prehospital situations may warrant engaging supervisors, law enforcement, or departmental medical directors. These include disagreement with a prehospital provider, treatment or transport refusal, advanced directives, and suspected child abuse. (See <a class="local">'Difficult situations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mode of transport</strong> – When deciding the mode of transport and destination hospital, key factors include (see <a class="local">'Ground versus air transport'</a> above): </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patient condition</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Type and location of the best facility providing definite care </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Safety of selected mode of transport </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Traffic </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Weather</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">During ambulance transport, children should be belt-restrained as determined by their medical condition  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83777" href="/z/d/graphic/83777.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) (see <a class="local">'Child restraints'</a> above).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The use of lights and sirens should be reserved for the most critically ill patients who remain unstable despite prehospital treatment. Except for specific traffic circumstances, use of lights and sirens does not save large amounts of time. Reducing its use decreases the risk of traffic collisions. (See <a class="local">'Lights and sirens'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hospital destination</strong> – In general, the optimal receiving facility for a critically ill or injured child should take care of large numbers of pediatric patients, have availability of expertise in the intensive care of children, and have trained pediatric subspecialists (eg, pediatric emergency medicine, pediatric critical care medicine, and pediatric surgery). General emergency departments are typically capable of managing acute airway emergencies and stabilizing other critical pediatric conditions prior to transfer for definitive care.
