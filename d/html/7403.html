         Amenorrhea (absence of menses) can be a transient, intermittent, or permanent condition resulting from dysfunction of the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries, uterus, or vagina  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59801" href="/z/d/graphic/59801.html" rel="external">

          table 2
         </a>
         ). It is often classified as either primary (absence of menarche by age 15 years or thereafter) or secondary (absence of menses for more than three months in girls or women who previously had regular menstrual cycles or six months in girls or women who had irregular menses).

         Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses at age 15 years in the presence of normal growth and secondary sexual characteristics. However, at age 13 years, if no menses have occurred and there is a complete absence of secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development, evaluation for primary amenorrhea should also begin. In addition, some girls with secondary sexual characteristics may present before age 15 years with amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain. These girls should be evaluated for possible outflow tract obstruction. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104218.html" rel="external">

         Primary amenorrhea is usually the result of a genetic or anatomical abnormality. However, all causes of secondary amenorrhea can also present as primary amenorrhea  (

         In geographies with a high incidence of tuberculosis, pelvic tuberculosis can also be a cause of primary amenorrhea [

         A logical approach to the woman with either primary or secondary amenorrhea is to consider disorders based upon the level of control of the menstrual cycle: hypothalamus and pituitary, ovary, and uterus and vagina  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752" href="/z/d/graphic/106752.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 3
         </a>
         ). In addition, steroid receptor abnormalities and deficiencies in enzymes of steroidogenesis cause primary amenorrhea at the level of the ovary and the adrenal gland.

         Primary amenorrhea is evaluated most efficiently by focusing on the presence or absence of breast development (a marker of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovary), the presence or absence of the uterus (as determined by ultrasound, or in more complex cases by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752" href="/z/d/graphic/106752.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 3

         If the serum FSH concentration is elevated, the probable diagnosis is gonadal dysgenesis and a karyotype should be obtained. The most common karyotypes observed are 45X Turner syndrome, 45X/46XX Turner mosaic, and 46,XY. In this scenario, a 46,XY karyotype is associated with a high risk for the development of gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma, and surgical removal of the gonads may be necessary. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104218.html" rel="external">
          "Causes of primary amenorrhea", section on 'Gonadal dysgenesis/primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)'

          ●
         </span>
         If FSH is normal and the ultrasound indicates that the uterus is absent, the probable diagnosis is müllerian agenesis or androgen insensitivity syndrome  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129896" href="/z/d/graphic/129896.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2
         </a>
         ). In the case of müllerian agenesis, the circulating testosterone is in the normal range for women, and in the case of androgen insensitivity, the circulating testosterone is in the male range and testes may be present in the inguinal area or found intra-abdominal on ultrasound. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104218.html" rel="external">

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If the FSH is normal, breast development is present, and the ultrasound or MRI detects accumulated blood in the uterus (hematometra) or vagina (hematocolpos), an obstructed outflow tract is present. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104218.html" rel="external">

          ●
         </span>
         If the FSH is low or normal and the uterus is present, further evaluation is guided by the degree of pubertal development. This could include distinguishing between constitutional delay of puberty and congenital GnRH deficiency, or investigating some of the common causes of secondary amenorrhea that also cause primary amenorrhea.

         Although there are several unique causes of primary amenorrhea, all causes of secondary amenorrhea can also cause primary disease (see

         Has she completed other stages of puberty, including a growth spurt, development of axillary and pubic hair, apocrine sweat glands, and breast development? Lack of pubertal development suggests deficient estradiol secretion, which could be due to a hypothalamic or pituitary disorder, ovarian failure, and/or a chromosomal abnormality.

         What is the woman's height relative to family members? Short stature may indicate Turner syndrome or growth hormone deficiency due to hypothalamic-pituitary disease.

         Were neonatal and childhood health normal? Neonatal crisis suggests congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Alternatively, poor health may be a manifestation of hypothalamic-pituitary disease.

         Are there any symptoms of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism) or virilization? The presence of acne or hirsutism is consistent with a diagnosis of PCOS, while virilization suggests more severe androgen excess, due to an androgen-secreting ovarian or adrenal tumor, or 5-alpha-reductase deficiency.

         Is she taking any drugs that might cause or be associated with amenorrhea? The medication may be taken for a systemic illness that itself can cause hypothalamic amenorrhea (eg, sarcoidosis). Alternatively, drugs such as heroin and

         The single most important step in the evaluation is to determine by physical examination (or ultrasonography or MRI if needed) if a uterus is present [

         </a>
         ]. In addition, the vagina and cervix should be examined for anatomic abnormalities. Anatomic abnormalities that can cause primary amenorrhea include an intact hymen, transverse vaginal septum, or vaginal agenesis, also known as müllerian agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which refers to congenital absence of the vagina with variable uterine development. It is usually accompanied by cervical and uterine agenesis; however, 7 to 10 percent of women have a normal but obstructed or rudimentary uterus with functional endometrium. (See

         All women with primary amenorrhea should have serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), FSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin (PRL) measured, similar to the approach for women with secondary amenorrhea  (

         ). Some clinicians suggest additional testing, including serum estradiol (E2) to assess estrogen status and free thyroxine (T4) to look for central hypothyroidism (in these cases TSH may be low or normal).
         <strong>

         However, serum E2 measurements may be variable in women with either early ovarian failure or functional hypothalamic amenorrhea during recovery, and they may not reflect exposure to estradiol over weeks. On the other hand, E2 can be helpful when trying to interpret FSH values. We measure free T4 only when central hypothyroidism is suspected.

         Additional testing depends upon the results of the physical exam; in particular, whether müllerian structures are present or absent.

         Most women with primary amenorrhea have a uterus; most of these have chromosomal abnormalities causing gonadal dysgenesis (ovarian insufficiency due to the premature depletion of all oocytes and follicles). For women with a uterus, further evaluation is determined by the initial lab results (most importantly FSH, and sometimes PRL or TSH), the presence or absence of breast development (usually a marker of ovarian function, except in the case of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome), and the presence or absence of any anatomic abnormalities on physical exam that suggest an outflow tract disorder  (

         A high serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration is indicative of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI; premature ovarian failure). A karyotype is then required and may demonstrate complete or partial deletion of the X chromosome (Turner syndrome) and/or the presence of Y chromatin. The presence of a Y chromosome material (SRY) is associated with a higher risk of gonadal tumors and makes gonadectomy mandatory  (

         In addition, evaluation for other diseases associated with the specific type of ovarian insufficiency should be performed.

Although 46,XX spontaneous POI typically presents as secondary amenorrhea, it can sometimes present as primary amenorrhea. If the etiology is thought to be autoimmune, additional evaluation for autoimmune thyroid and adrenal disease should be done. (See

         A low or normal serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration suggests a central hypothalamic-pituitary process, outflow tract disorder due to an anatomic abnormality, or an endocrine disorder (that more typically causes secondary amenorrhea). The presence or absence of breast development (an indicator of ovarian function and estrogen secretion) helps to further categorize these disorders  (

         Approximately 15 percent of girls with primary amenorrhea will have an anatomic abnormality identified on ultrasound or exam such as imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum, or müllerian agenesis (congenital absence of the vagina with variable uterine development). Cyclic pelvic or lower abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom in these girls. (See

         The evaluation of endocrine disorders that cause secondary amenorrhea are reviewed in detail separately. Although uncommon, all of these disorders can cause primary amenorrhea, including hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease, and PCOS. A high serum prolactin should be repeated once to confirm hyperprolactinemia prior to performing pituitary MRI. Hypothyroidism as a cause of hyperprolactinemia should be ruled out by measuring serum TSH. (See

         Treatment of primary amenorrhea is directed at correcting the underlying pathology (if possible), helping the woman to achieve fertility (if desired), and prevention of complications of the disease process (eg, estrogen replacement to prevent osteoporosis). A brief summary of treatment options is presented here, while the treatment of specific disorders is discussed in detail in the appropriate topic reviews.

         All women with primary amenorrhea should be counseled regarding its cause, potential treatment, and their reproductive potential. Psychological counseling is particularly important in patients with absent müllerian structures and/or a Y chromosome. (See

         Surgery may be required in patients with either congenital anatomic lesions or Y chromosome material. The etiology of the primary amenorrhea will determine the type of surgical procedure required. As an example, surgical correction of a vaginal outlet obstruction is necessary as soon as the diagnosis is made after menarche to allow passage of menstrual blood. Creation of a neovagina for patients with müllerian failure is usually delayed until the women are emotionally mature and ready to participate in the postoperative care required to maintain vaginal patency.

         Women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) should be counseled regarding the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. For young women, the benefits and risks of hormone therapy are markedly different than those for a 50-year-old woman. In general, in women of reproductive age with hypoestrogenism, hormone replacement is important to prevent bone loss and to prevent the potential excess risk of premature coronary heart disease. The management of POI is reviewed in detail separately. (See

         Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is not a common cause of primary amenorrhea. In these patients, treatment is directed toward achieving the patient's goals (eg, relief of hirsutism, resumption of menses, fertility) and preventing the long-term consequences of PCOS (eg, endometrial hyperplasia/cancer, obesity, and metabolic defects). The management of PCOS is reviewed in detail separately. (See

         Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea can usually be reversed by weight gain, reduction in the intensity of exercise, and/or resolution of illness or emotional stress. For women who want to continue to exercise or are unable to improve their nutritional health, estrogen-progestin replacement therapy should be given to those not seeking fertility as it has been demonstrated to improve bone mineral density [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Hormonal contraceptives do not appear to provide the same benefit. For women who desire regular menses, cyclic estrogen-progestin treatment, often in the form of a contraceptive formulation, can be prescribed.

         Women who want to become pregnant can be treated with exogenous gonadotropins or pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (not available in United States at this time, available in Europe), but increased caloric intake is simpler and clearly preferable. Furthermore, if a woman does not eat enough to have regular cycles and normal fertility, her nutrient intake during a hormonally induced pregnancy is likely to remain inadequate, increasing the probability of having a newborn who has a low weight for gestational age at birth.

         The same considerations apply to women with hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction that is not reversible (eg, congenital GnRH deficiency). For women who want to become pregnant, either exogenous gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH can be given. In a retrospective comparative study, pulsatile GnRH produced a higher rate of conception (96 versus 72 percent) and a lower rate of higher-order multiple gestations [

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses at age 15 years in the presence of normal growth and secondary sexual characteristics. However, at age 13 years, if no menses have occurred and there is a complete absence of secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development, evaluation for primary amenorrhea should also begin.

          Causes

         <strong>
          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – Primary amenorrhea is evaluated initially by determining the presence or absence of a uterus, the presence or absence of breast development (a marker of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovary, except in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome), and the serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level  (

         <strong>
          Uterus present
         </strong>
         – Most women with primary amenorrhea have a uterus  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ); most of these have chromosomal abnormalities causing gonadal dysgenesis (ovarian insufficiency due to the premature depletion of all oocytes and follicles). For women with a uterus, further evaluation is determined by the initial lab results (prolactin [PRL], thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], and, most importantly, FSH), the presence or absence of breast development (a marker of ovarian function, except in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome), and the presence or absence of any anatomic abnormalities on physical exam that suggest an outflow tract disorder  (

         <strong>
          High FSH
         </strong>
         – If there is a uterus and the FSH level is elevated, the probable diagnosis is gonadal dysgenesis, and a karyotype should be obtained. In this scenario, a 46,XY karyotype is associated with a high risk for the development of gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma, and surgical removal of the gonads is necessary. (See

         <strong>
          FSH low or normal
         </strong>
         – If the estradiol is low and the FSH is low or normal and the uterus is present, the probable diagnosis is secondary hypogonadism, which could be caused by constitutional delay of puberty, congenital gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency, or some of the common causes of secondary amenorrhea that also cause primary amenorrhea.

         <strong>
          Uterus absent
         </strong>
         – For those with absence of the uterus, further evaluation should include a karyotype and measurement of serum total testosterone. These tests should then allow the clinician to distinguish between abnormal müllerian development (a normal 46,XX karyotype with normal female serum testosterone concentrations) and androgen insensitivity syndrome (46,XY karyotype and normal male serum testosterone concentrations)  (
