         Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is a group of uncommon genetic disorders characterized by tubular damage and interstitial fibrosis in the absence of glomerular lesions, autosomal dominant inheritance, and inevitable progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).
        </p>
        <p>
         The genetics, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of the major subtypes of ADTKD are discussed in this topic.

         Slowly progressive kidney disease, with impaired kidney function typically appearing in the teenage years, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) onset that is highly variable, usually between the ages of 20 and 70 years, with a median age of 45 to 48 years.

         Kidney ultrasound reveals normal kidney size with increased echogenicity early in the disease course, with kidneys becoming smaller as chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses. Cysts develop at the same rate as in other chronic kidney diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         There are three known major genetic causes of ADTKD, all of which meet the above criteria, and each of which has distinguishing characteristics (

         ). These conditions have previously been given a number of names (eg, familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy [FJHN], medullary cystic kidney disease) that are now no longer used. We agree with the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus report that provides standard terminology for these conditions based on the underlying genetic defect [

         Uromodulin is produced exclusively in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle [

         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Uromodulin also appears to facilitate intracellular trafficking of both the furosemide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporter [

          10

         ] and in the United States [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Mutant uromodulin proteins are unable to assemble properly and cannot exit the endoplasmic reticulum [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-17
         </a>

        <p>
         Intracellular accumulation of abnormal uromodulin proteins can lead to tubular cell atrophy and death [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,15
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the abnormal uromodulin appears to impair the synthesis and secretion of normal uromodulin produced from the unaffected allele, resulting in a marked reduction in urinary uromodulin excretion [

         The two major pathophysiologic effects of

         pathogenic variants are hyperuricemia and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD):

         Hyperuricemia results from reduced urate excretion [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,19,20
         </a>
         ]. Uromodulin facilitates the intracellular trafficking of the furosemide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl transporter to the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Due to decreased uromodulin production, there is decreased apical expression of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, resulting in a mild natriuresis. This defect is postulated to result in mild sodium wasting and volume contraction. Compensatory proximal tubular sodium reabsorption then occurs, which restores volume status to normal. However, this results in a secondary increase in proximal urate reabsorption as urate reabsorption follows sodium reabsorption [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,19
         </a>
         ]. Clinically, this manifests as a reduced fractional excretion of uric acid and hyperuricemia.

         Progressive CKD may be related to tubular cell death in the thick ascending limb due to intracellular accumulation of mutant uromodulin [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,22
         </a>
         ]. Kidney biopsies reveal tubulointerstitial disease characterized by interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy [

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to its effects on water impermeability and ion transport in the thick ascending limb, rodent and human data suggest that uromodulin protects against urinary tract infection [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,23,24
         </a>
         ] and inhibits formation of kidney calculi. However, patients with ADTKD-
         <em>
          UMOD
         </em>
         do not have an increased incidence of urinary tract infection [
         <a href="#rid19">

         , like other types of ADTKD, is autosomal dominant; clinically affected individuals have one normal gene and one abnormal gene. The parent of an affected individual is affected, and there is a 50 percent chance that the children of an affected individual will have the condition. Of note, biallelic
         <em>
          REN
         </em>
         mutations cause autosomal recessive renal tubular dysgenesis, a severe disorder of renal tubular development characterized by persistent fetal anuria and pulmonary hypoplasia [

        <p>
         Renin is expressed in multiple segments of the kidney tubule, including the juxtaglomerular complex. In these cells, preprorenin is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is converted to prorenin [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Some prorenin is secreted, while the remainder is targeted to lysozymes, where it is further cleaved to active renin. Pathogenic variants may occur in the segment of the gene encoding the promoter, prosegment, or mature renin peptide [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,43

         pathogenic variants in the mature renin peptide cause deposition of the mutated renin in the endoplasmic reticulum.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the condition is autosomal dominant, a pathogenic variant occurs in one allele, while the other allele functions normally. Loss of production of normal renin by the mutated allele results in decreased production of renin. In addition, the cells producing renin are damaged due to intracellular accumulation of the mutated protein, further decreasing production of the hormone. Plasma renin levels in affected patients are low, although they may rise into the low-normal range during periods of stress. The low-renin state produces characteristic clinical findings. (See

         <em>

         The anemia precedes the development of CKD and is thought to result from decreased levels of angiotensin, as has been noted in some patients taking angiotensin inhibitors. The anemia resolves with adolescence, implying that sex hormones may compensate for the effect of low angiotensin levels on erythrocyte production. The anemia recurs as CKD progresses. (See

Some individuals present with hypouricosuric hyperuricemia, bland urinary sediment, and CKD. A key to the diagnosis is a careful and extensive family history for all possible manifestations and recognition that the parent of an affected child may be unaffected, while other family members have manifestations.

         The optimal approach to genetic testing for ADTKD is to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) or to order a kidney disease gene panel (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef142584" href="/z/d/graphic/142584.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         ). Several laboratories can perform this analysis; information can be found

         . Testing for multiple candidate genes at one time is more cost effective and efficient than testing one gene at a time (ie, cascade testing). Since ADTKD and many other genetic causes of kidney disease are rare, and the clinician may have limited experience with the differential diagnosis of these disorders, WES or gene panels can help to identify causative genes that the clinician may not have considered. In addition, companies that provide these testing services often provide pre- and postgenetic counseling for both the provider and the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sometimes, gene panels will identify a variant of unknown significance (VUS) that could potentially be causative, but there is not yet enough clinical evidence for certainty. When ordering an inherited kidney disease gene panel, we advise requesting VUS reporting if this is an option. If a VUS is identified that could potentially be causative, this can be discussed with a genetic counselor, who is often available from the company providing the gene panel. Consultation with an expert center in the clinical condition can also be beneficial. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96539.html" rel="external">

         Once ADTKD has been diagnosed in a family, an effort should be made to provide family members at risk for the disorder with information about ADTKD and genetic testing. Such information can be provided by a genetics counselor or nephrologist. We believe that it is important that other family members are informed of the family diagnosis because ADTKD is rare and many family members who are affected may be undiagnosed. These family members can undergo directed genetic testing for the specific pathogenic variant found in their family.

An overview of these measures is presented elsewhere. (See

         Most patients with ADTKD
         <em>
         </em>
         are normotensive and do not have substantial proteinuria. As a result, they are less likely to be treated with angiotensin inhibitors, which can slow the progression of proteinuric CKD. In patients who are hypertensive and have hyperuricemia,

Children with this disorder are often seen by nephrologists, nurses, and dietitians who are in the habit of prescribing a low-sodium diet to patients with CKD.

          Definition and classification
         </strong>
         – Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is a group of uncommon genetic disorders characterized by tubular damage and interstitial fibrosis in the absence of glomerular lesions, autosomal dominant inheritance, and inevitable progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). ADTKD is characterized by the following features (see
         <a class="local">

          Types of ADTKD
         </strong>
         – There are three genetic conditions that account for almost all cases of ADTKD, all of which meet the above criteria, and each of which has distinguishing characteristics (

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – A diagnosis of ADTKD should be suspected in any patient who presents with CKD, a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance of CKD (ie, at least one affected individual in at least two generations), and a bland urinary sediment with absent or minimal proteinuria. The diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef142584" href="/z/d/graphic/142584.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Kidney biopsy is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         diagnostic of any form of ADTKD and is generally not performed as part of the routine diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected ADTKD. (See

         <strong>
          Treatment
         </strong>
         – There is no specific therapy for patients with ADTKD. Treatment consists primarily of supportive care and management of the complications of CKD for all patients as well as additional measures that are specific to certain types of ADTKD:

         All patients with ADTKD should receive general measures for the management of CKD, including blood pressure control and treatment of complications including anemia, metabolic bone disease, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities. These measures are discussed elsewhere. (See

         Patients with ADTKD-

         who have established gout qualify for pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy. The selection, initiation, and duration of pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy are similar to that for the general population with gout and are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         who have not yet developed gout, we do not typically use pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy. However, some experts may offer urate-lowering therapy to patients who have marked hyperuricemia (&gt;9 mg/dL [&gt;535 micromol/L]) or a strong family history of early-onset gout, although there are no data to support this approach.
