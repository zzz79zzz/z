         ]. As of October 2008, guidelines from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the United States state that hospitals will no longer receive additional payments when patients develop stage 3 or 4 pressure-induced injuries, and hospital reimbursements are being adjusted by their pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury rate  (

         The selection of device for prevention is balanced by a variety of considerations, including the risk of pressure induced injury, ease of use, other patient characteristics, and cost (special beds may cost up to several hundred dollars per day to rent). Inexpensive static devices or overlays are acceptable in most situations, whereas dynamic support surfaces may be more appropriate in patients who are at high risk. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2884.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury", section on 'Risk factors'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Considerable caution is required in interpreting the literature on support surfaces, particularly older studies. Many studies compare a specialized support surface with a "standard" hospital mattress, but the modern "standard" hospital mattress differs from those used twenty years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a Cochrane review of support surfaces for prevention of pressure-induced injury, a total of 59 trials were included. There is reasonably good evidence to suggest that high-specification foam mattress or mattress overlays on operating tables and hospital beds reduce the incidence of pressure injuries compared with a standard hospital mattress and no overlay [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. However, many of the included studies are old, raising the concern cited above regarding a "standard" mattress. Pressure-relieving overlays on the operating table reduced the incidence of postoperative pressure injuries. In a meta-analysis of two trials, the use of a micropulse overlay system in the operating room significantly reduced the incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.70) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Two trials, though, indicated that foam overlays in the operating room caused adverse skin changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is less clear how different classes of support surfaces, or different products within a class of support surfaces, compare. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials have not consistently demonstrated superiority of one product class over another [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. Most studies only include two products out of the many possible comparisons. A network meta-analysis that considered all possible comparisons may then be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
         A review that included 68 studies with comparisons between 12 different types of support surfaces concluded that there is low-certainty evidence that reactive air surfaces, alternating air-pressure surfaces, and reactive gel surfaces reduce the incidence of pressure-induced injury compared with a foam mattress [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One particularly well-designed trial involving 1972 patients (PRESSURE trial) compared two dynamic devices, alternating pressure mattresses and alternating pressure overlays, and found no differences in the number of new pressure injuries (grade 2 or worse) or the median time for their development; patient satisfaction was higher for the mattress [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The PRESSURE 2 trial randomly assigned 2029 high-risk patients to a high-specification foam mattress or an alternating pressure mattress [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. The overall rate of stage 2 or greater pressure injuries was 7.9 percent; the alternating power mattress was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in pressure injuries (hazard ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.04). These two studies stand out for their large sample sizes and having sufficient power to address the study question.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dynamic support devices in high-risk patients may be cost effective. In a trial that randomly assigned 100 intensive care unit patients to an air-suspension bed or standard bed, the risk of developing pressure injuries was lower in those using the air-suspension bed (odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.08-0.41). In the PRESSURE 2 trial, the alternating pressure mattress had a 99 percent probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of 20,000 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year. The cost of dynamic support surfaces may be offset by reduced length of hospitalization, wound care that includes nursing time and wound care supplies, and possibly surgery [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. One study of air suspension beds in an intensive care unit found that this intervention resulted in cost savings of over $700 per patient.

         For patients who use wheelchairs, full-seat cushions are recommended. Donut cushions should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be used because they increase edema and venous congestion and concentrate the pressure to surrounding tissue [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Selection of customized chair cushions requires the services of a qualified seating specialist. The three main types of seat cushions include gel and foam seat cushions, nonpowered adjustable cushions, and powered adjustable seat cushions. Adjustable seat cushions contain a honeycomb of air cells that are first fully inflated, placed under the patient and then partially deflated via a release valve to better conform to the patient's body; the patient essentially floats on a cushion of air while sitting in the chair. Powered seat cushions include a motorized blower to circulate the air within the cushion. In a study of 232 nonambulatory nursing home residents, significantly fewer pressure injuries developed in those randomly assigned to use a skin protection cushion (air, viscous fluid and foam, or gel and foam cushion) compared with a standard segmented foam cushion (10.6 versus 17.6 percent) [

         Elevation of the head of the bed causes people to slide down in bed over 10 cm, resulting in friction and shear forces to tissues overlying the lower back and sacrum. Development of beds designed to reduce such migration is underway, and they are expected to be effective, especially when combined with proper positioning practices [

         Turning should be performed successively from the back, to one side, and then to the other side. The aim of repositioning is to reduce interface pressure and maintain microcirculation to areas at risk for pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury [

Timing and positioning should be documented. Prevention of progression of a stage 1 pressure-induced injury may require more frequent repositioning [

         Repositioning frequency should be based on a consideration of an individual's level of activity and ability to independently reposition. Typically, a two-hour interval is recommended for repositioning. It has been demonstrated that skin erythema and ischemic changes can occur in healthy adults in less than two hours on a standard mattress [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Skin and soft tissues with borderline perfusion at baseline can develop irreversible changes with even shorter intervals of pressure. Whether a two-hour frequency (versus a longer interval) is optimal is uncertain, particularly when a high-quality support surface is being used [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. A Cochrane systematic review from 2020 included only three trials evaluating the effects of any repositioning schedule with respect to the incidence of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury in the adult population [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. In one study, the incidence of new lesions was no different for repositioning every two versus every three hours on a standard mattress or between every four and every six hours on viscoelastic foam [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. A later study of 942 at-risk nursing home residents managed on a high-density foam mattress found no differences in incidence for those turned at two-, three-, or four-hour intervals [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. However, each of these studies were underpowered to detect meaningful differences. A later trial including 992 individuals who were not at severe risk of pressure injury from nine nursing homes managed on a high-density foam mattress compared repositioning intervals of two, three, and four hours [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>

         Continuous lateral rotation was originally developed to enhance respiratory function in hospitalized patients but has been advocated by some for the prevention and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries. Continuous lateral rotation is achieved with a mechanized bed that continuously rotates around its longitudinal axis. Observational studies indicate modest improvements in healing rates when continuous lateral rotation is added to an advanced therapy surface [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Conceptually, the advantage gained by this automated approach to pressure reduction could be offset by the presence of continuous shearing forces. Technical parameters, such as bed rotation frequency and bed tilt angle, need to be better defined. Continuous rotation therapy is not likely to replace the need to reposition the patient every two hours, and there is insufficient evidence to support its use.

         Excess moisture increases friction and contributes to shear forces being transmitted to deeper tissues, thus making the skin more susceptible to breakdown. Excess moisture may arise from other sources, including sweat and drainage from nearby wounds. In addition, chemicals in urine and feces may irritate skin. The use of proper dressing can help limit drainage. Specialized support surfaces, including low-air-loss and air-fluidized beds, can also help to control the microenvironment. (See

         For patients who are incontinent, it is important to protect the skin from constant exposure to urine or feces. In general, underpads or adult briefs, combined with consistent skin cleansing, are adequate for managing incontinence. The tabs can be left open at the sides of the incontinence briefs to allow air circulation. An alternative method is to place absorptive pads under the patient without a diaper so that any incontinence episode can be readily detected and addressed.

         </span>
         No single individual involved in patient care is able to prevent pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries. Rather, prevention requires a coordinated effort of multiple disciplines. Failures are less common when effective systems for staff education are in place [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. When an ulcer does occur, problems contributing to its development should be identified and methods for solving these problems implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sufficient staffing levels are necessary for effective prevention, and it is easy to understand why some failures will inevitably occur given that each patient must be repositioned in bed over 4000 times per year [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. Adequate staffing and the availability of resources in nursing facilities may depend upon the business model (for-profit versus not-for-profit) of the facility.
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials and observational studies found a significantly lower risk for not-for-profit facilities compared with for-profit facilities (odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-0.98) [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57

         <a href="#rid58">
          58,59
         </a>
         ]. For-profit facilities have strong incentives to minimize expenditures, and, although the average effect supported not-for-profit facilities, the authors noted variability in the quality of nursing home care due to a variety of factors, including managerial styles, business motivations, and organizational behavior. In an observational study of 12,473 certified nursing facilities in the United States evaluating over two million residents, the quality of nursing care was the primary factor contributing to an increased prevalence at facilities with a high concentration of patients from underserved populations [

         Based upon cost modeling, several studies have found the use of pressure redistribution surfaces to be cost effective or even cost saving.
        </p>
        <p>
         One study simulated admissions to an acute care hospital and compared enhanced prevention practices versus standard care [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Preventive measures resulted in greater quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and saved money. These findings were confirmed in a subsequent analysis showing that preventive measures targeted towards high-risk patients saved money while increasing QALYs; a strategy of prevention-for-all resulted in the greatest increase in QALYs at a cost of USD $2000 per QALY [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. A randomized clinical trial of specialized beds in an intensive care unit that found fewer pressure injuries and lower costs associated with preventive intervention .
        </p>
        <p>
         The cost effectiveness of using support surfaces on emergency department (ED) stretchers and beds as an early measure for prevention in older adult patients admitted through the ED was also studied [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The model projected an incidence of emergency department-acquired pressure injuries of 1.9 percent with current practice and 1.5 percent with early preventive strategies, which corresponded to a number-needed-to-treat of 238 patients. Early prevention was more effective and less costly than standard practice even for short emergency department stays (ie, one hour), with a mean cost-saving of $32 per patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another study modelled the cost effectiveness of viscoelastic overlays in patients requiring surgical procedures lasting longer than 90 minutes [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. An intraoperative prevention strategy that decreased the incidence by 0.51 percent corresponded to a number-needed-to-treat of 196 patients. The average cost of using the operating table overlay was calculated to be $1.66 per patient. For the projected decrease in the incidence, the cost savings averaged $46 per patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         An evaluation of preventive strategies used in long-term nursing home care also found that support surfaces are cost effective [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Multiple strategies were evaluated, including pressure redistribution surfaces, oral nutritional supplements for high-risk residents with recent weight loss, skin emollients for high-risk residents with dry skin, and skin cleansing for high-risk residents requiring incontinence care. Preventive strategies cost, on average, $11.66 per resident per week. The lifetime risk of developing a pressure-induced injury was reduced with the use of preventive strategies, and the number-needed-to-treat was calculated to be 45 for pressure redistribution surfaces, 63 for skin cleansing, 158 for skin emollients, and 333 for nutritional supplementation. Pressure redistribution surfaces and skin cleansing reduced the mean lifetime cost by $115 and $179 per resident, respectively. The cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained was less than $50,000 for support surfaces and skin cleansing but exceeded $50,000 for nutritional supplements and skin emollients.

          Pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries
         </strong>
         – Pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries are among the most common conditions encountered in hospitalized patients or those requiring long-term institutional care. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         <strong>
          Patient repositioning
         </strong>
         – Pressure redistribution is the most important factor for prevention. For individuals who must stay in bed, we suggest repositioning at least every two hours to relieve tissue pressure (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Proper positioning and turning techniques should be used to minimize friction and shear forces. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Static positioning'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Pressure reduction
         </strong>
         – For patients at increased risk (identified by clinical assessment or risk scales) for developing pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries, we recommend the use of pressure-reducing products (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">
          Grade 1A
         </a>
         ). The choice of product, including overlays, foam, gel supports, or dynamic devices, will depend upon patient risk factors and the availability of resources. Dynamic supports, such as air-fluidized beds, may be cost effective in high-risk patients. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Additional measures
         </strong>
         – Other measures that may be helpful for prevention in selected patients include improving mobility (physical therapy, decreased use of sedatives), improving skin perfusion, providing proper skin care including minimizing excess moisture, correcting malnutrition, and possibly using preemptive dressings on areas of risk. (See
         <a class="local">

          Education and support
         </strong>
         – Education of clinical staff and patients and their families or other caregivers along with a team staff approach and quality initiative policies are essential to reduce the development of pressure sores. (See
