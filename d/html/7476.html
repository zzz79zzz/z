         Gynecomastia, a benign proliferation of the glandular tissue of the male breast, is diagnosed on examination. Although it has been variably defined as breast tissue &gt;0.5, &gt;1, and &gt;2 cm in diameter, a clinically useful definition of gynecomastia is palpable breast tissue that extends outside the area under the nipple and is ≥2 cm or as recent breast tissue growth (virtually always accompanied by tenderness) independent of size. Some boys and men are bothered by &lt;2 cm of palpable nontender breast tissue whereas others are unperturbed by ≥2 cm of palpable nontender breast tissue. Many boys and men will report breast tenderness as bothersome or worrisome.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many causes of gynecomastia, but the pathophysiology is always an increase in the ratio of estrogen to androgen activity in the breast.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical features and evaluation of gynecomastia will be reviewed here. Epidemiology, causes, pathogenesis, and management of gynecomastia and an overview of gynecomastia in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See

         In true gynecomastia, a ridge of glandular tissue will be felt that is reasonably symmetrical to the nipple-areolar complex. Breast glandular tissue can usually be detected when the size exceeds 0.5 cm in diameter. There are four typical features on examination: the glandular tissue is centrally located, symmetrical in shape, usually bilateral, and tender to palpation (during the early, growth phase) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72334" href="/z/d/graphic/72334.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         A study of 506 adolescent and adult males presenting to emergency departments with trauma who underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed that some breast glandular tissues in males is a normal finding with 90

        </p>
        <p>
         Although gynecomastia is usually bilateral, it is often asymmetric, and some patients present with unilateral enlargement. One side may enlarge weeks to months before the other [

         Most gynecomastia is discovered incidentally on physical examination, but adolescents commonly experience painful, tender gynecomastia. In contrast, gynecomastia-associated pain is usually not severe in adults, and most men are asymptomatic. Varying degrees of tenderness and nipple sensitivity with rubbing against a shirt are more common than pain. However, severe symptoms in men are a potential indication for earlier therapeutic intervention, even though these symptoms are usually self-limited, because fibrotic changes begin to develop after 6 to 12 months.

         We recommend against breast imaging unless there is concern for possible breast cancer (new onset or rapid growth of a unilateral, nontender, and/or fixed mass that is eccentric to an areola). The mammographic features of gynecomastia are described as "a fan-shaped density emanating from the nipple, gradually blending into surrounding fat" [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. It may have extensions into surrounding fat and an appearance similar to that of a heterogeneously dense female breast.
        </p>
        <p>
         The usual imaging studies are mammography and ultrasound. Mammography is difficult to perform for men with gynecomastia &lt;4 cm. Both imaging modalities have good sensitivity and specificity for detection of breast malignancy, but mammography is more sensitive, and ultrasonography is more specific [

         We do not perform biopsy and histologic examination unless the physical examination and imaging show signs of malignancy. Histologic studies show that the glandular changes in the breast are the same regardless of etiology, and the extent of glandular proliferation depends upon the intensity and duration of the growth stimulation. The histologic picture changes from the growth phase to the late fibrotic phase.

There is also an increase in the amount of stroma, stromal fibrosis, and a disappearance of the inflammatory reaction. Pain and tenderness are uncommon during this stage.

         The diagnosis of gynecomastia is made on physical examination as a palpable mass of tissue at least 0.5 cm in diameter underlying the nipple. (See

         ]. For men with large breasts, the authors recommend having the man lie recumbent with hands resting behind his head. Gynecomastia is felt as a concentric, rubbery-to-firm mobile disk of tissue located directly beneath the areolar area. The disk can be "flipped up" to locate the edge of the rubbery tissue. Feeling an edge of rubbery tissue at the interface of normal and glandular tissue confirms the presence of gynecomastia.

         Gynecomastia must be distinguished from pseudogynecomastia (lipomastia) that is due to an increase in breast fat, not glandular tissue. These patients have diffuse breast enlargement without any subareolar glandular tissue. When examining the patient with pseudogynecomastia, the fingers will not meet any resistance until they reach the nipple. There is no discrete rubbery mass and no palpable disc edge in pseudogynecomastia (

         Gynecomastia must be differentiated from other causes of breast masses, most importantly, breast cancer. Gynecomastia can be distinguished from breast cancer by physical examination. Breast cancers are typically unilateral, nontender, hard and immobile masses that are found eccentric to the nipple-areolar complex. In addition, they are firm-to-hard in texture and may be associated with skin dimpling, nipple discharge, and ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         We perform mammography or breast ultrasonography in the patient with unilateral breast enlargement where there is uncertainty whether the palpable, nonfat tissue represents gynecomastia or another lesion. If uncertainty persists, we suggest referral to a surgeon with experience in managing male breast cancer and other breast lesions (eg, neurofibroma, dermoid cyst, hematoma).
        </p>
        <p>
         Men with Klinefelter syndrome with a hard, immobile breast mass deserve careful attention because they have a 20- to 60-fold increase in breast cancer risk compared with normal men. Although the relative risk is increased, their absolute risk of breast cancer is still considerably lower than it is in women. Therefore, we do not suggest routine mammographic screening for men with Klinefelter syndrome. (See

         Gynecomastia associated with a mild elevation of serum estradiol and a normal LH is a common laboratory finding and does not indicate a tumor that secretes hCG or estradiol. Gynecomastia due to thyroid hormone is almost always clinically evident with symptoms and signs of thyrotoxicosis. However, thyrotoxicosis is associated with a usual pattern of high-normal or elevated serum FSH and LH, high or high-normal serum total testosterone, high serum SHBG, and low or low-normal free serum testosterone (

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Gynecomastia, a benign proliferation of the glandular tissue of the male breast, is caused by an increase in the ratio of estrogen to androgen activity. A clinically useful definition of gynecomastia is palpable breast tissue that extends outside the area under the nipple and is ≥2 cm, or as recent breast tissue growth (virtually always accompanied by tenderness) independent of size. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – Most gynecomastia is discovered incidentally on physical examination, but adolescents commonly experience painful, tender gynecomastia. Gynecomastia can usually be detected when the size of the glandular tissue exceeds 0.5 cm in diameter, but virtually always when the size of the glandular tissue exceeds 2 cm in diameter. There are four typical features on examination: the glandular tissue is centrally located, symmetrical in shape, usually bilateral, and tender to palpation (during the early growth phase) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72334" href="/z/d/graphic/72334.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

         ). (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Histologic studies show that the glandular changes in the breast are the same regardless of etiology, and the extent of glandular proliferation depends upon the intensity and duration of the growth stimulation. The histologic picture changes from the growth phase to the late fibrotic phase. (See

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of gynecomastia is made on physical examination as a palpable mass of tissue of 2 cm or more, usually underlying the nipple. Breast glandular tissue that is nontender and 2 to 4 cm is a frequent finding in the normal population, and this finding does not generally require diagnostic evaluation. Of note, some individuals are bothered by &lt;2 cm of palpable breast tissue while others are not bothered by &gt;2 cm of palpable breast tissue that is nontender. The examination is performed by placing the thumb and forefinger on each side of the breast and slowly bringing them together (

          Pseudogynecomastia

         – Gynecomastia needs to be distinguished from pseudogynecomastia (lipomastia, diffuse breast enlargement without any glandular tissue). When examining the patient with pseudogynecomastia, the fingers will not meet any resistance until they reach the nipple. There is no discrete mass (
