The differentiation of the small number of patients with life-threatening headaches from the overwhelming majority with benign primary headaches (ie, migraine, tension, or cluster) is an important problem in the ED. Failure to recognize a serious headache can have serious consequences, including permanent neurologic deficits, loss of vision, and death.</p><p>A careful history and physical examination remain the most important parts of the assessment of the headache patient; they help the clinician to determine whether the patient is at significant risk for a dangerous cause of their symptoms and what additional workup is necessary.</p><p>This topic will discuss how to approach adults presenting to the ED with headache, with an emphasis on those components of the history and physical examination that characterize high-risk headaches.

The essential job of the emergency clinician is to identify these patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107496" href="/z/d/graphic/107496.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Headaches in such patients are commonly referred to as secondary to distinguish them from benign intrinsic causes (ie, migraine, cluster, and tension), which are referred to as primary. <span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-120064">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-120064" href="/pathway/120064?topicRef=287&amp;source=see_link">Headache: Initial evaluation of adults in the emergency department</a>.)</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">High-risk historical features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following historical features are warning signs to the presence of a secondary headache  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78567" href="/z/d/graphic/78567.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sudden-onset</strong> headache – While some dangerous causes of headache may present with a gradual increase in pain, any severe, persistent headache that reaches maximal intensity within a few <strong>seconds</strong> or <strong>minutes</strong> after the onset of pain warrants aggressive investigation [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), for example, often presents with the abrupt onset of excruciating pain. Other serious etiologies of sudden-onset headache include reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes, carotid and vertebral artery dissections, venous sinus thrombosis, pituitary apoplexy, acute angle-closure glaucoma, unruptured cerebral aneurysms, colloid cyst of the third ventricle, and hypertensive emergencies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81710" href="/z/d/graphic/81710.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). In contrast, migraine headaches generally begin with mild to moderate pain and then gradually increase to a maximal level over one to two hours. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3346.html" rel="external">"Overview of thunderclap headache"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cluster headache may sometimes be confused with a serious headache since the pain from a cluster headache can reach full intensity within minutes. However, cluster headache is transient (usually lasting less than one to two hours) and is associated with characteristic ipsilateral autonomic signs, such as tearing, miosis, or rhinorrhea. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3326.html" rel="external">"Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Of note, many dangerous causes of headache can present with gradual-onset headache, including herpetic or Lyme meningitis, brain tumor, brain abscess, hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Furthermore, dangerous causes may present with atypical timing, and symptoms may overlap. As examples, most patients with cervico-cranial artery dissections and venous sinus thrombosis present with gradual-onset headaches, and some patients with acute-angle closure glaucoma develop headaches that simulate migraine and can be intermittent [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1296.html" rel="external">"Aseptic meningitis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1103.html" rel="external">"Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1297.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain abscess"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3833.html" rel="external">"Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4835.html" rel="external">"Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5257.html" rel="external">"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>No similar headaches in the past</strong> – The absence of similar headaches in the past is another finding that suggests a serious disorder. The "first" and "worst headache of my life" are descriptions that sometimes accompanies an intracranial hemorrhage or central nervous system (CNS) infection. A new or unusual headache in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or cancer is particularly worrisome, as it suggests an intracranial lesion or infection [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. On the other hand, patients suffering from migraine usually have had similar headaches in the past, and by definition, one cannot definitively make a diagnosis of migraine without at least four prior episodes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3348.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Concomitant infection</strong> – Infection in an extracranial location (such as the paranasal or mastoid sinuses, pharynx, or inner ear) may serve as a nidus for the development of meningitis or intracranial abscess. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1287.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1297.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain abscess"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Altered mental status or seizure</strong> – Any change in mental status, personality, or fluctuation in the level of consciousness suggests a potentially serious abnormality. Syncope or near-syncope at headache onset is suggestive of SAH. Headache associated with seizure is also concerning for intracranial pathology. Preeclampsia and PRES can cause headache and seizure and may present up to six weeks following delivery. In the patient with a headache and altered mental status, it is important to check for hypoglycemia using a point-of-care (eg, fingerstick) glucose concentration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5104.html" rel="external">"Stupor and coma in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2219.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6814.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Headache with exertion</strong> – The rapid onset of headache with exertion (eg, sexual intercourse, exercise), raises the possibility of carotid artery dissection, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction, or intracranial hemorrhage. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3344.html" rel="external">"Migraine-associated stroke: risk factors, diagnosis, and prevention"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3363.html" rel="external">"Exercise (exertional) headache"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age over 50</strong> – Patients over 50 years of age with new onset or progressively worsening headache are at significantly greater risk of a dangerous cause of their symptoms, including an intracranial mass lesion and giant cell arteritis [<a href="#rid1">1,3,6,11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8225.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of giant cell arteritis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HIV and immunosuppression</strong> – HIV and other immunosuppressed patients with headache are at significant risk for intracranial disease, including toxoplasmosis, stroke, brain abscess, meningitis, and malignancy of the CNS. Clinicians should have a low threshold to perform aggressive workups on such patients, particularly if high-risk features such as new-onset seizure or altered mental status are present [<a href="#rid10">10,12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3718.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with HIV and central nervous system lesions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Visual disturbances</strong> – Occasionally, patients with significant ophthalmologic disease, most notably acute angle-closure glaucoma, present with a complaint of headache. A careful history and physical examination, including measurement of intraocular pressures, is usually sufficient to determine whether this is the source of pain. Headache may precede visual changes or eye pain in acute angle-closure glaucoma. Headache associated with visual disturbances may also be associated with giant cell arteritis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and PRES. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6903.html" rel="external">"Angle-closure glaucoma", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8225.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of giant cell arteritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5257.html" rel="external">"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4835.html" rel="external">"Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy and postpartum state</strong> – Although primary headache syndromes remain the most common cause of headaches in this group, other pregnancy-related diagnoses should be considered. Preeclampsia is the most common of these; the presentation of preeclampsia can overlap with PRES [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Less common etiologies include venous sinus thrombosis, pituitary apoplexy, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Venous sinus thrombosis is most common postpartum. Worse headache upon standing postpartum suggests either a postdural puncture headache (if the patient had a spinal anesthetic) or spontaneous intracranial hypotension (in patients without a spinal anesthetic) due to dural tears sustained during labor-related pushing [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4797.html" rel="external">"Headache during pregnancy and postpartum"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6814.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1103.html" rel="external">"Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Location of pain</strong> – Location of the pain is not particularly useful in the diagnosis. However, head pain that spreads into the lower neck (ie, occipitonuchal headache) and between the shoulders may indicate meningeal irritation due to either infection or subarachnoid blood; it is not typical of a benign process [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Some secondary headaches are well localized. As an example, headache from acute angle-closure glaucoma is commonly centered around the involved eye, while headache from giant cell arteritis is often, but not always, focused in a temple. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6903.html" rel="external">"Angle-closure glaucoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8242.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Family history</strong> – The headache patient with a family history of SAH among first- or second-degree relatives is at significantly greater risk of SAH [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Simultaneous headaches in multiple family members suggest carbon monoxide poisoning. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90075.html" rel="external">"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathogenesis", section on 'Genetic risk'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medications</strong> – Clinicians should inquire about medication use, particularly anticoagulants, glucocorticoids, oral contraceptives, and analgesics. Use of anticoagulants or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, increases the risk of intracranial bleeding. Another consideration in patients taking anticoagulants is a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, if the indication for the medication was a venous thrombotic event. Sympathomimetics are also associated with intracranial bleeding. Analgesics can mask severe symptoms or sometimes exacerbate migraine headache through a rebound effect (medication overuse headache). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3347.html" rel="external">"Acute treatment of migraine in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1103.html" rel="external">"Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Anticoagulants </strong>– All anticoagulants confer an increased bleeding risk, including bleeding into the brain. Patients on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> have a higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage compared with those on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and patients on any oral anticoagulant plus antiplatelet agents have an increased risk compared with those not on these agents. Details pertaining to the risk of bleeding associated with particular medications are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119889.html" rel="external">"Risks and prevention of bleeding with oral anticoagulants"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">All anticoagulated patients with head trauma, even minor trauma, should undergo computed tomography (CT). Many patients with a new nontraumatic headache will fall into the older age group for whom imaging is already recommended. Other anticoagulated patients with an intracranial hemorrhage will fall into another high-risk category (eg, thunderclap onset or new neurological deficits). Apart from age and trauma, there are no high-quality data to help determine whether to perform a routine cranial CT on anticoagulated patients. Factors that influence this judgment include other known risk factors such as age, hypertension, degree of anticoagulation, and prior stroke or known vascular lesions such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Illicit drugs</strong> – A number of illicit drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, and other sympathomimetic agents, increase the risk of stroke and intracranial bleeding.

In addition, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) in an arterial blood gas is normal, as it measures dissolved oxygen (which is not affected by CO), not oxygen bound to hemoglobin (which is). Chronic low-dose CO exposure may also cause headache, more often during winter months.

Examination typically reveals a red eye with ciliary flush and no discharge, a pupil fixed in mid-dilation, and a cornea that is edematous or "steamy" appearing (not normally translucent)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80395" href="/z/d/graphic/80395.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>). Elevated intraocular pressure confirms the diagnosis. Unnecessary neurologic workup and imaging delay treatment of this sight-threatening emergency.

However, nearly 10 percent of patients present with isolated headache or neck pain [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. In the absence of a thunderclap onset, Horner syndrome, or symptoms or signs of brain ischemia or infarction, other clues include recent (even minor) trauma and the history (given by almost all patients with migraine who describe the headache from a dissection) as different from prior headaches [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>Because headache (and neck pain) are so common, establishing the diagnosis of arterial dissection is very difficult in patients who present with pain <strong>only</strong> (ie, without neurologic findings) and who do not have any of the clues described above. As it is neither feasible nor desirable to evaluate every such patient with cerebrovascular imaging, occasionally patients may be misdiagnosed on a first visit.
