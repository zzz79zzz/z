         It is important to rapidly determine if the "alcohol" ingestion is ethanol or one of the toxic alcohols (eg, methanol, ethylene glycol). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/336.html" rel="external">
          "Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning: Pharmacology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Infants or young children who have ingested enough ethanol to cause a peak serum concentration ≥50 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) are at risk for profound hypoglycemia and require emergency evaluation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6486.html" rel="external">
          "Ethanol intoxication in children: Epidemiology, estimation of toxicity, and toxic effects", section on 'Estimation of serum ethanol'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other information should include the specific ethanol-containing substance, amount ingested, time of ingestion, and any co-ingestions. If the volume and concentration of ethanol ingested is known, then the serum ethanol concentration and degree of toxicity can be estimated  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69276" href="/z/d/graphic/69276.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) (

          calculator 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6486.html" rel="external">
          "Ethanol intoxication in children: Epidemiology, estimation of toxicity, and toxic effects", section on 'Estimation of toxicity'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Witnesses of the ingestion and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel who may have recovered containers at the scene should be interviewed. In addition, caretakers should be questioned regarding medications in the house. The patient's or caretaker's pharmacy may provide valuable information regarding prescribed medications, the date of the most recent refill, and the total number of pills dispensed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Parents or caregivers of intoxicated toddlers should be asked about ethanol-containing beverages or household products that may have been transferred from or left unsecured in their original containers. Common scenarios include the following:

         Older intoxicated children and adolescents often binge drink in a social setting that is outside of adult supervision (eg, parties, concerts). Key concerns include co-ingestion or exposure to other drugs, coexistence of trauma (particularly head trauma), and sexual assault. Often, EMS reports regarding the patient's environment or state of undress can assist in identifying physical or sexual assault.
        </p>
        <p>
         Children and adolescents with depression or other mental illness are at high risk for intoxication. In some instances, ethanol may be ingested as part of a suicide attempt. In these circumstances, further mental health evaluation is indicated after the child recovers from intoxication. Ethanol is also a common substance used to facilitate sexual assault ("date rape"). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2765.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims in the emergency department", section on 'Laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging'

        </p>
        <p>
         Ethanol poisoning in infants less than one year of age raises the concern of intentional ethanol administration or serious neglect by a caretaker because infants usually lack the developmental skills, such as mobility and dexterity, to self-administer ethanol. Thus, this finding warrants involvement of social services [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Co-ingested sedative-hypnotic agents (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioids, gamma hydroxybutyrate [GHB]) markedly increase the risk of deep coma with respiratory failure after ethanol ingestion.

         Similar to other sedative-hypnotics, ethanol intoxication commonly manifests as altered behavior, lethargy, coma, ataxia, slurred speech, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268" href="/z/d/graphic/71268.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). A characteristic sickly sweet breath odor is often prominent. Degree of lethargy is highly correlated with serum ethanol concentration in older children and adolescents  (

         All patients warrant complete physical examination to identify associated injuries, especially head trauma, and findings that are the result of abuse  (

         Older children and adolescents may show signs of depression or other mental illness once their mental status allows for detailed psychiatric assessment. (See

         A history of ingestion from the caregiver or patient and characteristic physical findings, such as sickly sweet breath odor, altered mental status, and nystagmus with lateral gaze typically are sufficient to establish the diagnosis of ethanol intoxication. Detection of ethanol on the breath or in the serum provides additional confirmation.

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         There are many causes of coma that deserve consideration when evaluating the patient with suspected ethanol intoxication  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65571" href="/z/d/graphic/65571.html" rel="external">
          table 6
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Other than toxicants, isolated or concomitant hypoglycemia or traumatic brain injury is the most likely cause of abrupt onset of lethargy of coma in children or adolescents. All children and adolescents with altered mental status should undergo measurement of rapid blood glucose and assessment for external signs of head trauma. In patients for whom traumatic brain injury is a strong possibility based upon clinical findings, computed tomography of the head may be warranted. Asymmetric structural lesions (eg, brain tumor, focal hemorrhage, or infection) are typically identified by focal findings on a careful neurologic examination followed by appropriate neuroimaging. Symmetrical structural lesions often have accompanying signs of increased intracranial pressure, especially headache. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6225.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of stupor and coma in children"
         </a>
         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6566.html" rel="external">
          "Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children: Initial evaluation and management", section on 'Imaging'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Among toxic agents that may cause coma, other toxic alcohols (isopropyl alcohol, methanol), although chemically distinct, may mimic ethanol's toxic effects. Methanol and ethylene glycol, in particular, are important agents to consider since they have great toxic potential and frequently require antidotal therapy. They differ from ethanol in their inducement of profound metabolic acidosis, which typically takes hours to develop. In addition, ethanol may mask co-ingestion of other toxic alcohols. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/336.html" rel="external">
          "Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning: Pharmacology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The combination of central nervous system depression and respiratory depression closely resembles the toxic syndrome seen with opioid intoxication  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268" href="/z/d/graphic/71268.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Many other sedative-hypnotic and psychoactive agents may also produce somnolence and respiratory depression and are often co-ingested with ethanol recreationally or with suicidal intent, especially in adolescents. Thus, even when serum or breath testing confirm ethanol ingestion, the possibility of sedative-hypnotic or opioid intoxication co-ingestion remains. An isolated ethanol overdose rarely causes profound respiratory depression requiring invasive airway management or cardiopulmonary instability. In such cases, the presence of co-ingestants should be investigated. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other studies'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Administration of
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12628" href="/z/d/drug information/12628.html" rel="external">
          naloxone
         </a>
         reverses the effects of opioid intoxication but will have minimal or no effect on central nervous system depression caused by ethanol or other sedative-hypnotic agents. However, naloxone may alleviate respiratory depression enough in patients with concomitant ethanol and opioid intoxication so that endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation can be avoided. Patients who respond to naloxone warrant close monitoring of respiratory status and frequently require redosing. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6504.html" rel="external">
          "Opioid intoxication in children and adolescents", section on 'Naloxone'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Sedative-hypnotic intoxication is virtually indistinguishable clinically from ethanol intoxication. Rapid immunoassay screening of the urine can identify benzodiazepines and barbiturates, but a negative screen does not exclude exposure to benzodiazepines. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/314.html" rel="external">
          "Benzodiazepine poisoning", section on 'Role of laboratory benzodiazepine testing'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), an illicit sedative-hypnotic that is often ingested recreationally and has also been implicated in date rape, can cause psychomotor agitation and profound coma of short duration (several hours). GHB is commonly co-ingested with ethanol and is not detected on rapid immunoassay urine toxicology screens, although it can be detected in the urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Effects from GHB are not reversed by
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12628" href="/z/d/drug information/12628.html" rel="external">
          naloxone
         </a>
         . Thus, diagnosis of GHB intoxication is primarily made by history or characteristic clinical findings of agitation prior to, following, or in abrupt alternation with coma of short duration. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/307.html" rel="external">
          "Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) intoxication", section on 'Diagnosis'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Diabetic ketoacidosis may be mistaken for ethanol intoxication because of the presence of ketones on the breath. However, it is easily differentiated from ethanol poisoning by the typical history of polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia in patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus or past medical history of diabetes mellitus in combination with laboratory findings of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5809.html" rel="external">
          "Diabetic ketoacidosis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'

        </p>
        <p>
         Meningitis and encephalitis can also present with altered mental status but are usually accompanied by fever and other signs of infection that help distinguish these entities from ethanol intoxication. (See

         If low, blood glucose should be corrected and then serially monitored, particularly in cases of younger children or others with limited glycogen stores who may be at risk for recurrent hypoglycemia. The specific clinical scenario, such as the time since ingestion and the age of the child, should determine the frequency of blood-glucose determinations, but these should be obtained until the patient demonstrates a pattern of stable blood sugars with normal oral glucose intake.

         Measurement of serum ethanol concentration is an essential diagnostic step when evaluating symptomatic infants and young children after ethanol exposure. In adolescents with moderate to severe intoxication, who have ingested only ethanol, the concentration can help estimate duration of symptoms. In addition, degree of lethargy is highly correlated with serum ethanol concentrations in older children and adolescents  (

         Asymptomatic patients over two years of age or minimally symptomatic adolescents do not usually require serum ethanol levels.

         Quantitative and qualitative testing for ethanol is readily available in most hospitals. Headspace gas chromatography may be used to measure blood or serum ethanol. An enzymatic oxidation method also exists to measure serum ethanol levels. Most hospital laboratories use serum to perform the "blood" ethanol test. The serum-to-blood ethanol ratio varies from 1.12 to 1.18 depending upon ethanol concentration in the blood specimen [

         Severe ethanol intoxication may require a prolonged period of supportive care. Elimination of ethanol occurs three to four times faster with hemodialysis [

         ]. However, improvement in clinical outcome following hemodialysis for ethanol intoxication has not been demonstrated. Possible candidates for hemodialysis include patients with liver disease that significantly decreases ethanol metabolism or those with serum ethanol concentrations greater than 450 mg/dL (100 mmol/L) [

         A suspicion of intentional administration of ethanol to a child warrants involvement of an experienced child protection team (eg, social worker, nurse, physician with more extensive experience in the management of child abuse), if available. In many parts of the world (including the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia), a mandatory report to appropriate governmental authorities is also required. (See

         We recommend that asymptomatic infants and young children with an ethanol ingestion sufficient in volume to produce a peak serum concentration greater than 50 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) undergo rapid blood glucose testing (

         ). Based upon the pharmacokinetics of ethanol and typical timing of hypoglycemia after its ingestion, these patients should be observed in a medical facility until six hours after ingestion and have at least one repeated rapid blood glucose measurement prior to discharge. Estimation of the ethanol volume that is ingested can be difficult. Thus, some clinicians may choose to evaluate all asymptomatic young children with ethanol exposure in this manner regardless of the reported amount. (See

         Most ethanol exposures in young children involve small amounts of household products (eg, perfumes, colognes) and do not result in significant toxicity. In the US, many of these ingestions are observed at home with phone advice provided by experienced poison specialists when the expected peak ethanol concentration is &lt;50 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) [
         <a href="#rid13">

         The clinician should rapidly determine if the "alcohol" ingestion is ethanol or one of the toxic alcohols (eg, methanol, ethylene glycol). If isolated ethanol ingestions is confirmed, the clinician should establish whether infants or young children have ingested enough ethanol to cause a peak serum concentration ≥50 mg/dL (11 mmol/L), the concentration at which profound hypoglycemia may occur.

         Ethanol intoxication commonly manifests as lethargy, coma, ataxia, slurred speech, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression  (

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – A history of ingestion from the caregiver or patient and characteristic physical findings, typically are sufficient to establish the diagnosis of ethanol intoxication. Detection of ethanol on the breath or in the serum provides additional confirmation and helps differentiate ethanol intoxication from other causes of altered mental status. (See

          Differential diagnosis

         – All children and adolescents with altered mental status should undergo measurement of rapid blood glucose and assessment for external signs of head trauma. In patients for whom traumatic brain injury is a strong possibility based upon clinical findings, computed tomography of the head may be warranted. Even when ethanol ingestion is confirmed by serum or breath testing, the possibility of sedative-hypnotic or opioid intoxication co-ingestion remains. (See
