         Radiation affects functions of cells, tissues, organs, and the whole person. A basic knowledge of radiation physics is necessary for understanding the clinical manifestations of radiation exposure and injury.

         Radiation is the transfer of energy through space as high-speed particles and/or electromagnetic waves. Radiation can be ionizing or nonionizing.

         Ionizing radiation has sufficient energy to displace electrons, thereby creating charged particles (eg, ions). It is released by unstable atoms that have an excess of energy, mass, or both, which emit the excess energy to become stable. Ionizing radiation has very short wavelengths, ranging from nanometers to a million millionth of a meter (10
         <sup>
          -12
         </sup>
         ). It includes higher frequency ultraviolet (UV) radiation, X-rays, gamma rays, and particulate ionizing radiation (eg, alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons).

          Alpha particles
         </strong>
         – Alpha particles are helium nuclei (ie, two protons and two neutrons) that have been stripped of their electrons; they have an atomic mass of four daltons (Da). Alpha particles do not penetrate clothing, skin, or paper, but they are harmful when ingested or inhaled. Radionuclides that emit alpha particles include polonium-210, radon-222, radium-226, thorium-232, plutonium-236, uranium-238, and americium-241  (

         </sup>
         that of a proton or neutron. Beta particles can penetrate into subcutaneous tissues but are blocked by wood or brick. They are particularly harmful when ingested or inhaled. Examples of beta emitters include tritium, cobalt-60, strontium-90, technetium-99, iodine-129, iodine-131, and cesium-137.

          Neutrons

          Protons
         </strong>
         – Protons are a component of all nuclei, which have an electrical charge of +1 and a mass of one Da; the number of nuclear protons is equivalent to the atomic number of an atom. Due to their high mass (ie, nearly 2000 times greater than the mass of an electron), they require complex equipment (such as a cyclotron) to accelerate them to energies that are useful for the treatment of cancer.

          X-rays and gamma rays
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         X-rays and gamma rays are pure electromagnetic energy that is measured as photons, and they have no mass or electrical charge. They penetrate tissues and expose all organs but are blocked by a concrete wall. X-rays generally have a longer wavelength than gamma rays, but there is no common definition that distinguishes X-rays from gamma rays. X-rays are generally emitted by electrons rather than the atomic nucleus, whereas gamma rays may be released from the nucleus.

        <p>
         Ionizing radiation displaces electrons from multiple orbits, creating unstable atoms (eg, radionuclides); this contrasts with chemical reactions, in which electrons are removed from the outermost orbits of an atom. As the radionuclide emits energy (ie, disintegrates), it transforms into a different isotope of the same element through a process known as radioactive decay. Decay products are often radioactive and achieve stability after subsequent decays, releasing energy as particles or rays at each step. Such decay chains are characteristic for a radionuclide.

         Nonionizing radiation has enough energy to move or vibrate atoms, but it lacks the energy to displace electrons from their orbit. Nonionizing radiation has long or very long wavelengths, ranging from a fraction of a micrometer to millions of meters, and includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, and the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum into the UV light range.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonionizing radiation does not penetrate human tissue, poses no risk of contamination, and is easily shielded by sunscreens, sunglasses, and clothing. Nonionizing radiation causes damage to cells through direct transfer of thermal energy. Sunburn is a classic example, but nonionizing radiation can also cause corneal or retinal burns and microwaves can produce heating of tissues. Clinical effects of nonionizing radiation are discussed separately. (See

         Radiation exposure may result from background radiation, medical exposure, industrial exposure, and accidental or deliberate nuclear events (eg, nuclear reactor incidents, detonation of nuclear weapons, or terrorist activity with intentional release of radioactive material [eg, dirty bomb]). Radiation exposure is increasing in the general population, primarily due to heightened use of medical imaging. The risk of radiation exposure attributable to imaging is discussed separately. (See

         Effects on the whole person are also influenced by the dose, schedule, and route of exposure; volume of exposed tissue (ie, partial-body versus whole-body); and shielding. The lethality of ionizing radiation varies with the dose rate (ie, doses received over a shorter period of time cause more damage), distance from the source (the dose rate decreases as the square of the distance from the source; the inverse square law), and shielding [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. As examples, alpha particles can be stopped by a sheet of paper or a layer of skin, beta particles by less than one inch of plastic, and gamma rays by inches to feet of concrete or an inch of lead. Exposure to ionizing radiation can be reduced by minimizing the
         <strong>

         of exposure, maximizing the
         <strong>

          Lethal dose
         </strong>
         – Lethality of radiation varies with the type of radiation, degree of exposure, and access to medical care. Lethality is expressed as the LD50: the median radiation dose at which 50 percent of exposed patients die within 30 days. The LD50 for energetic, penetrating gamma rays is estimated to be 4.5 Gy [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. However, it is important to recognize that considerably higher doses of radiation are tolerated with therapeutic irradiation (eg, doses ≥12 Gy for treatment of malignancies) than with unintentional exposures, in which shielding is random.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Unshielded exposure to ≥10 Gy is uniformly lethal within six months [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ].
         <strong>
         </strong>
         A comprehensive review of individuals who were accidentally exposed to ionizing radiation and who received contemporary supportive care, including cytokine therapy, indicated that virtually all persons exposed to ≥5 to 6 Gy died within one year after exposure [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>

For patients who have rapid access to surgical and burn intensive care units, reverse isolation wards, and bone marrow transplantation, the LD50 can rise to 10 Gy; with access to blood transfusions and antibiotics, the LD50 is 4.5 Gy; whereas for patients who have access only to basic first aid, the LD50 is 2.5 Gy [

          Tissue exposure
         </strong>
         – Biologic effects of radiation depend on the types of exposed tissues. Short-lived cells are more vulnerable to radiation-induced triggering of apoptosis or necrosis and inhibition of cell renewal. Highly proliferative cells, such as spermatocytes, hematopoietic precursors, circulating lymphocytes, and intestinal crypt cells are among the most critically affected cell types. As examples, the threshold doses for testis (0.15 Gy) and bone marrow (0.5 Gy) are lower than those for other organs.

         effects with predictable thresholds for tissue reaction and severity of injury (eg, bone marrow suppression). Radiation also has a random ("stochastic") effect, whereby the dose affects the probability of an effect rather than severity of injury. Stochastic effects do not have an apparent threshold dose, which implies that any dose, no matter how low, can have an effect. An example of a stochastic effect is radiation-induced carcinogenesis, which has a generally long but variable time from exposure to effect.

         Ionizing radiation can damage macromolecules (eg, DNA, RNA, proteins) and cellular components (eg, plasma membrane). Radiation effects can be direct (eg, single- or double-strand DNA breaks) or indirect (by interacting with water or other molecules to produce free radicals). The chance of damage to a cellular target varies with the amount of ionization created along the track of radiation. Sources of radiation with low linear energy transfer (LET), such as X-rays and gamma rays, produce sparse ionization, while high LET radiation sources, such as alpha particles and neutrons, cause dense ionization.

         Irradiation occurs when an individual is exposed to penetrating radiation from an external source. The radiation may pass through the body or be absorbed by it. Irradiated individuals are not radioactive (ie, do not emit radiation) and they pose no risk to others, as long as they are not also contaminated with radioactive particulate matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         Effects of radiation are influenced by whether the patient received whole-body versus partial-body irradiation [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Whole-body exposure occurs when the entire body surface area is exposed to penetrating ionizing radiation. Manifestations of whole-body irradiation as acute radiation syndrome are described below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Acute radiation syndrome'

        </p>
        <p>
         Partial-body (or local) radiation exposures involve irradiation of a part of the body, which results in local radiation injury (eg, to skin, gonads, eyes), as discussed below. (See

         Radiation injury is most likely to be recognized because of an individual's proximity to a known exposure incident; this exposure may or may not be accompanied by a public announcement, indication of exposure from a monitoring device, clinical symptoms, or laboratory findings soon after the event. Radiation exposure and/or contamination is most common in individuals who work with radioactive material, such as radiologic equipment or medical waste disposal. However, a passer-by or an individual who inadvertently handles such a source may also be exposed to radiation with or without contamination. For others, radiation injury may result from proximity to or being downwind of a known radiation incident (eg, nuclear power plant release, core melt-down, or nuclear explosion).
        </p>
        <p>
         Recognition of a radiation incident may also be triggered by unexplained clinical and/or laboratory findings in an individual or a cluster of people that are consistent with acute radiation injury and/or multiorgan dysfunction. However, recognition of radiation injury under these circumstances requires a high degree of suspicion and awareness of the clinical features of radiation injury. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         When a radiologic event is announced publicly or a patient with suspected radiation injury has arrived to the facility, hospital personnel should activate the facility's emergency medical response plan and obtain the necessary inhouse radiation safety personnel (ie, staff from Nuclear Medicine, Radiation Oncology, Radiology, and Radiation Safety) or obtain expert consultation through a regional poison control center (in the United States, call 1-800-222-1222 to be connected to the nearest poison control center; contact information for poison centers around the world is provided separately (see

         Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) occurs hours, days, or weeks after whole-body exposure (or large partial-body exposure) to sufficient penetrating radiation to cause clinically apparent injury [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         ]. Initial clinical features are nonspecific  (

         In the absence of a known exposure, recognition of acute radiation injury requires a high degree of suspicion based on clinical findings and/or laboratory evaluation.

         The signs and symptoms of ARS are related to the type of radiation and the absorbed dose of radiation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The threshold whole-body dose for ARS in adults is approximately 1 Gy (100 rad); lower doses are not expected to cause clinically apparent ARS. A whole-body dose of 4.5 Gy is lethal to 50 percent of exposed persons (LD50) and a dose of ≥10 Gy is typically associated with 100 percent mortality [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. All forms of ionizing radiation can cause internal tissue damage after ingestion, inhalation, or transfer through a wound. X-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons penetrate the skin and can cause deep tissue injury after either external exposure or contamination. By contrast, external exposure to high energy beta particles (without ingestion or inhalation) can cause serious skin damage but does not cause deep tissue injury, unless they are of high energy and are delivered at a high dose. Alpha particles are blocked by clothing and intact skin and are typically harmful only when they are internalized via a wound, abrasion, ingestion after transfer from the hands to foodstuffs, or inhalation. Effects of radiation exposure also vary with the dose rate of radiation, shielding, and availability of medical care. (See

Very large skin doses may cause permanent hair loss, damage to sebaceous and sweat glands, atrophy, fibrosis, keloids, changes in skin pigmentation, and progressive fibrosis of the vasculature that may take months or years to fully evolve [

         Ionizing radiation has predictable dose- and time-dependent effects on hematopoiesis that are manifest as cytopenias (ie, neutropenia, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) with resultant clinical consequences, including infections, weakness, and bleeding  (

        <p>
         Clinical manifestations of radiation-induced hematopoietic toxicity become apparent at doses &gt;2 to 4 Gy (200 to 400 rad), but recovery may occur if bone marrow stem and progenitor cells are not completely eradicated [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,25
         </a>

         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>

Anemia develops from gastrointestinal blood loss, hemorrhage into organs and tissues, and bone marrow aplasia. Radiation can also have long-term consequences for immune function and is associated with the development of various myeloid malignancies (eg, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myeloid leukemia, or acute myeloid leukemia).

         At doses as low as 1.5 Gy (150 rad), a prodromal syndrome of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia may be observed. Exposure to higher doses leads to more severe and/or persistent GI manifestations within five days of initial exposure [

         Radiation injury may also occur in an asymptomatic individual days to weeks after a known exposure, and it should be suspected in individuals without a known exposure event who exhibit otherwise unexplained findings suggestive of radiation injury (eg, unexplained erythroderma, gastrointestinal symptoms, cytopenias, and/or altered neurologic function).

         The diagnosis of radiation injury is based on the presence of clinical findings that are consistent with the type, amount, and timing of radiation exposure  (

DRESS has a latency of two to eight weeks, a time frame that may be confused with radiation injury. DRESS is diagnosed by the presence of rash, fever, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral blood eosinophilia and lymphocytosis in a patient who was exposed to a new drug up to six weeks earlier. The history of drug exposure and presence of lymphadenopathy, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and lymphocytosis should distinguish DRESS from ARS. (See

Thallium toxicity can present with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, erythema, and skin rash; hair loss may progress to widespread alopecia over two to three weeks. Features peculiar to thallium exposure include the appearance of transverse white lines on the nails (Mees' lines), painful glossitis, scaling lesions on the palms and soles, acneiform eruptions of the face, paresthesias, dementia, and psychosis. The diagnosis of thallium toxicity is made by documenting an elevated blood thallium level.

         Children, especially infants and preschool children are more likely than adults to develop acute radiation injury because of their rapid growth and, thus, greater sensitivity to the biologic effects of radiation on rapidly dividing tissues [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. In addition, fetal radiation exposure can have major consequences. The dose to the gravid uterus is approximately 65 to 70 percent of that to the body surface, which affords some protection to the fetus from external radiation exposure. However, when internal radiation contamination is present, the fetus may receive a high dose due to its proximity to the maternal bladder. The thyroid begins to take up iodine after 12 weeks, which adds to the potential for injury. The effects of ionizing radiation on the fetus include growth retardation; congenital malformations; embryonic, fetal, or neonatal death; and carcinogenesis. Specific dose thresholds for these effects are discussed separately. (See

         Radiation is the transfer of energy through space, which can occur in ionizing and nonionizing forms. Ionizing radiation is released by atoms that have an excess of energy, mass, or both (unstable atoms) in the form of X-rays, gamma rays, or particulate ionizing radiation (eg, alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons). The ability to penetrate human tissues and/or be shielded varies with the form of ionizing radiation, as described above. (See

         Radiation can be expressed as the rate of disintegrations, which is measured in becquerels (Bq) or curies (Ci)  (

         ). Radiation is also measured as dose rate (the amount of radiation delivered per unit time), which is expressed as grays (Gy) or radiation absorbed doses (rads), and as dose equivalents (the product of the absorbed dose rate and a weighting factor that reflects the relative biologic effectiveness on tissues), which is expressed as sieverts (Sv) or rems.

         Biologic effects of radiation depend on the type of radiation; dose, schedule, and route of exposure; and the types of tissues that are exposed. Radiation injury may result from external irradiation or from internal or external contamination. Children, especially infants and preschool children, are more likely than adults to develop acute radiation injury because of their rapid growth and greater sensitivity to the biologic effects of radiation on rapidly dividing tissues (See

         Radiation injury is most likely to be recognized because of an individual's proximity to a known exposure incident; this exposure may or may not be accompanied by a public announcement, indication of exposure from a monitoring device, clinical symptoms, or laboratory findings soon after the event.

         Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) occurs hours, days, or weeks after whole-body exposure (or large partial-body exposure) to sufficient penetrating radiation to cause clinically apparent injury. Initial clinical features are nonspecific, progress through three phases (ie, prodromal, latent, and manifest), and vary according to the degree and type of radiation exposure  (

         After stabilization of life-threatening conditions, evaluation for radiation injury should include a history of symptoms that may be related to radiation exposure, physical examination, selected laboratory studies, and information about the nature of the radiation exposure event. (See

         Early findings related to ARS are generally nonspecific but, depending primarily on dose, may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bleeding, fatigue, fever, and mental status changes in the hours to days following radiation exposure. Physical examination findings of burns, bruising, bleeding, or neurologic deficits within a few days of radiation exposure suggest a high dose. (See
         <a class="local">

         Laboratory studies should include type and screen, urinalysis, baseline prothrombin time (PT) with international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and serial measures of complete blood count (CBC) with differential, electrolytes, and renal and liver function. (See

         Diagnosis of ARS is based on the presence of clinical findings  (

         ) that are consistent with the type, amount, and timing of radiation exposure, and laboratory studies (eg, serial lymphocyte counts) that support the diagnosis. Radiologic survey with a detection device (eg, Geiger-Mueller counter) can also identify asymptomatic patients with radiation contamination who are at risk for radiation injury. (See
         <a class="local">

         In the absence of a known radiation exposure incident, the differential diagnosis is broad and may include gastroenteritis, heat stroke, viral infections, medications, autoimmune disorders, and nutritional deficiencies. (See
