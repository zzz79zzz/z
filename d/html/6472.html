Conversely, the comprehensive health maintenance visit should not substitute for the PPE unless it includes the necessary components of the sports history and physical examination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108.html" rel="external">"Guidelines for adolescent preventive services"</a>.)</p><p>However, the PPE may serve a as an entry point into the health care system for adolescents without a medical home. In such cases, it is an opportunity to address the youth's health more broadly. The AAP guidelines encourage providers to include questions on topics such as drug use, sexual activity, violence, and mental health since these issues pose more serious threats to the health of teens than do injuries incurred during sports participation [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Whether it is feasible and/or appropriate to explore some of these areas depends, in part, on the setting. (See <a class="local">'Setting'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3845415039"><span class="h2">Avoid unnecessary restriction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One goal of the PPE is to remove unnecessary restriction on sports participation or exercise. Inappropriate restrictions can prevent children from establishing healthy lifestyle habits at a young age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6474.html" rel="external">"Physical activity and strength training in children and adolescents: An overview", section on 'Benefits of regular physical activity'</a>.)</p><p>Examples of unnecessary restrictions include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Children and adolescents with suspected heart disease may be restricted from sports participation pending further evaluation. However, restrictions are often not given an endpoint, which unnecessarily prolongs the child's exclusion from sports and exercise. Most children with chronic cardiovascular conditions can participate in sports at some level after an appropriate evaluation has been performed and proper preventative measures have been instituted, if warranted. (See <a class="local">'Cardiovascular conditions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another example is inappropriately restricting children with obesity from sports participation until they lose weight because of concern regarding risk for heat injury. Obesity is a risk factor for heat injury, and acclimatization is indicated in preparation for summer practices; however, exercise is an important component of obesity management, and restricting exercise in children with obesity is counterproductive. (See <a class="local">'Obesity'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15848.html" rel="external">"Prevention and management of childhood obesity in the primary care setting"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Osgood-Schlatter disease is another common condition for which inappropriate limitations are often imposed. Avoidance of sports activity is neither necessary nor recommended in Osgood-Schlatter disease since inactivity can lead to deconditioning, which increases the risk of recurrence or other injury after returning to sports participation. (See <a class="local">'Osgood-Schlatter disease'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6289.html" rel="external">"Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity avulsion)", section on 'Activity continuation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1546097382"><span class="h2">Timing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ideally, the preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) should take place four to six weeks before the season starts, permitting time to evaluate and treat medical problems and/or rehabilitate musculoskeletal injuries before sports participation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Frequency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most sports medicine clinicians recommend performing a complete PPE before each new level of participation (eg, middle school, junior high, high school, and college), with yearly updates of the history and targeted physical examinations [<a href="#rid3">3,6</a>]. Requirements for the frequency of PPE vary by state, but most state high school athletic associations require annual evaluations [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Setting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The PPE may be performed in the office setting or through a station approach. Both methods are acceptable and each has advantages and disadvantages [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Office setting</strong> – Examination in the office setting by the athlete's primary care provider has the advantages of privacy, continuity of care, and the provider's knowledge of past medical and family history. However, the complete examination is time consuming and may have insufficient focus on the important sports-related components of the PPE.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Station approach</strong> – In the station approach, the athlete is examined by multiple examiners through a series of stations specific to individual components of the evaluation. The station approach is time efficient, sports oriented, and inexpensive, and has a high yield for identifying abnormalities; however, it generally does not afford confidentiality and may not provide for continuity of care. If the station approach is used, the providers should have access to the athletes comprehensive medical and injury history [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2570056705"><span class="h2">Examiner</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The PPE should be performed by an examiner with appropriate training and experience in evaluating the musculoskeletal system in children. Pediatric providers routinely conduct PPEs, yet many lack specific training in sports medicine or the performance of these examinations [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The clinician performing the PPE should have a low threshold for referring athletes to a sports medicine specialist if pain or other limitations are noted in the screening musculoskeletal portion of the PPE. Similarly, the threshold for referral to a pediatric cardiologist should be low when concerns are noted in the cardiovascular assessment. (See <a class="local">'Musculoskeletal examination'</a> below and <a class="local">'Cardiovascular examination'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h1">COMPONENTS OF THE EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) includes a targeted medical and family history and a targeted physical examination, with emphasis on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Evaluation forms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American College of Sports Medicine, American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine, and American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine have endorsed a standardized preparticipation athletic evaluation form that addresses important aspects of the history and examination [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. It is available through the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aap.org%2Fen%2Fpatient-care%2Fpreparticipation-physical-evaluation%2F&amp;token=0qs8gg6xvKKmO7VT99Uh13y8jRaT2NgouiJsrj8juGvZA3DqJXaG59Oi9nX8PDsV9y9rpWVXdApSOStyb6HLG46CSdwUFiLsZevyQSkwqho%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6472" target="_blank">AAP website</a>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Medical history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The medical history is the most sensitive and specific component of the PPE for detecting conditions that preclude participation in sports [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Personal and family history and review of systems detect approximately 75 percent of conditions that restrict participation or require further evaluation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Parent/caregivers should review the family history with the athlete if they will not be present for the examination.</p><p>The history should include a general medical history, injury history, and a cardiovascular history, including pertinent family history. Particular attention should be paid to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Past medical history, including conditions currently being treated</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior surgery and sequelae</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of function in one of any paired organs (eg, eye, testis, kidney)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of heat-related illness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Current medications, supplements, or herbal therapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immunization history</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recent illness history, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Menstrual history in female athletes</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of rapid increase or decrease in body weight and the athlete's perception of his or her current body weight</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Injury history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Injuries are common in sports participation and if not adequately rehabilitated, can predispose the athlete to further injury. Simple screening questions are generally more sensitive than the musculoskeletal examination for detecting injuries and other orthopedic problems [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The examiner should inquire about:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Past injuries, including musculoskeletal injuries, concussions, and spine injuries</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of time from participation and current sequelae of prior injuries (eg, paresthesias from spinal injury)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Previous exclusion from sports for any reason</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Cardiovascular history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cardiovascular history is aimed at identifying conditions that predispose athletes to sudden death. These conditions are rare and often difficult to detect.</p><p>Questions of importance in the cardiovascular history include [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/960.html" rel="external">"Screening to prevent sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes", section on 'History and physical examination'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of hypertension, cardiac murmur, high cholesterol, Kawasaki disease, or myocarditis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of syncope, near syncope, dizziness, angina, or palpitations during exercise – The athlete should be asked if they have ever passed out; nearly passed out; felt lightheaded; or had chest pain, an irregular heartbeat, or excessive, unexpected, or exceptional unexplained shortness of breath or fatigue during or after exercise [<a href="#rid3">3,10,11</a>]. The presence of any of the above symptoms that cannot be explained (eg, by vasovagal presyncope) requires exclusion from participation in competitive sports pending cardiac evaluation, and the patient should also be counseled to avoid strenuous exercise until that evaluation is complete. (See <a class="local">'Noninvasive cardiovascular testing'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of chest pain – Chest pain is a common complaint in children and adolescents and is usually due to benign causes. Findings that suggest a more serious etiology  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96306" href="/d/graphic/96306.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and that require further evaluation include (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96737.html" rel="external">"Causes of nontraumatic chest pain in children and adolescents"</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Chest pain in association with fever.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pain that interrupts sleep.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>True anginal pain (ie, characterized by substernal, deep, pressure-like pain that radiates to the arm or jaw, is associated with dyspnea, and causes the athlete to stop activity).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pain associated with palpitations and/or syncope during exercise.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Abnormal findings on physical examination </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, if the athlete has recent onset of chest pain (within 48 hours of performing the PPE), evaluation for the etiology may be appropriate, as discussed separately.

(See <a class="local">'Cardiovascular history'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Concussion-like symptoms</strong> – Because concussion-like symptoms are frequently reported even among children and adolescents without prior head injury [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], a baseline assessment of symptoms (eg, Sport Concussion Assessment Tool [SCAT-3]) may be warranted as part of the PPE for athletes participating in contact sports. This can reduce over-diagnosis of postconcussion syndrome in youth who may have baseline symptoms such as fatigue, sleep difficulties, poor concentration, and headache. In a cross-sectional sample of high school students without a history of concussion, 19 percent of boys and 28 percent of girls reported having a symptom constellation consistent with postconcussion syndrome [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

If there is a history of injury or abnormalities reported on the screening questionnaire, the joint or region in question should be examined in detail. In addition, we suggest complete examination of high-risk areas (ie, shoulder, knee, and ankle); however, there is no evidence that this increases the sensitivity of the evaluation or predicts future injuries [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The screening musculoskeletal examination includes the following components:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General inspection</strong> – The examination requires the athlete to wear clothing that permits inspection of the shoulders and extremities. The screening orthopedic examination begins with inspection of the adolescent standing with arms at the sides, facing the examiner. The observer is looking for asymmetry. Specifically:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A tilt of the head to one side can indicate a primary cervical spine injury, primary or secondary trapezius strain, or other cervical muscle spasm. Ask the athlete if any maneuver hurts or, if the parent/caregiver or coach is in the room, ask them if this is a change in the athlete's posture. If pain occurs with movement or restriction of movement, the athlete is not permitted to participate in contact sports until further evaluation. Participation in noncontact sports is appropriate if participation does not exacerbate pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6433.html" rel="external">"Approach to neck stiffness in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prominence of one acromioclavicular joint may indicate a previous acromioclavicular joint sprain (shoulder separation). The athlete can participate in all sports if no tenderness to palpation at the joint is present and if the range of motion and strength of the shoulder are normal. The joint should be padded during participation so that the force, such as in direct contact of the shoulder with another athlete, can be distributed anterior and posterior to the acromioclavicular joint.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Asymmetric shoulder heights may indicate trapezius strain or spasm secondary to neck or shoulder injury, paraspinous strain, primary spine injury causing secondary paraspinous muscle spasm, limb length discrepancy, or scoliosis. The athlete is not permitted to participate in contact sports until the etiology is established and appropriate treatment, if necessary, is completed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Asymmetric iliac crest heights indicate scoliosis, leg length discrepancy, asymmetric pelvic rotation, or lumbar paraspinous muscle spasm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Atrophy of the vastus medialis obliquus, demonstrated by asking the athlete to contract their quadriceps muscles putting the knee in full extension, is characteristic of any leg injury that leads the athlete to avoid normal use.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A prominent, tender tibial tuberosity indicates Osgood-Schlatter disease.

Ask the athlete to look at the floor (cervical flexion), the ceiling (cervical extension), over left and right shoulders (left and right rotation), and put the right ear on the right shoulder and the left ear on the left shoulder (right and left lateral flexion). Any athlete with limitation of range of motion, weakness, or pain with neck examination is excluded from contact sports until further evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6528.html" rel="external">"Overview of cervical spinal cord and cervical peripheral nerve injuries in the child or adolescent athlete"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6531.html" rel="external">"Overview of musculoskeletal neck injuries in the child or adolescent athlete"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Shoulder</strong> – Ask the athlete to raise the arms from the side and touch hands above the head, keeping elbows extended (full abduction). Asymmetric elevation of the shoulder before 90 degrees of abduction or inability to fully abduct the arms to 180 degrees could be caused by shoulder weakness or instability.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ask the athlete to hold the arms in front of the body while the examiner presses down on the hands (resisted forward flexion) and then repeat this procedure at 90 degrees of abduction. Weakness, atrophy, or fasciculations of anterior and middle deltoid muscles and pain or weakness with these maneuvers may indicate neurologic, skeletal, or muscular injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ask the athlete to put the hands behind the neck and bring the elbows back as far as possible (abduction and external rotation of the shoulder). Inability to perform this maneuver fully or apprehension about performing it, coupled with a history of the shoulder "slipping out" or "going dead," suggests previous shoulder subluxation or dislocation that has not been adequately rehabilitated or may need surgical correction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Athletes with limitation of motion in any of the above maneuvers should be further evaluated before they are cleared for participation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elbow</strong> – Ask the athlete to extend and flex the elbows with arms to the side (90 degrees abduction). Then, with the elbows flexed at 90 degrees and the hands pointing forward, ask the athlete to pronate and supinate. Asymmetry or loss of motion in any of these maneuvers suggests previous injury. Further evaluation is necessary before the athlete can be cleared for participation, especially in throwing sports.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hands</strong> – Ask the athlete to spread the fingers and then to make a fist. Look for decreased finger flexion, swollen joints, or finger deformities as residuals of previous injuries. The need for further evaluation of hand injuries and recommendations for sports participation are based upon the severity of the injury and the sport the athlete wishes to play.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Back</strong> – Inspect the back from behind and in front of the athlete, looking for manifestations of scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis rarely is a contraindication for sports participation unless the angle of curvature is severe (eg, &gt;40 degrees). If the spine is painful by history or tender to palpation, the diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis should be reconsidered; the definitive diagnosis should be established before clearance for sports participation is provided. If the athlete reports lumbar pain and there is pain in the midline in the lumbar region with lumbar extension, lumbar spondylolysis should be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2852.html" rel="external">"Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes", section on 'Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Knee and hip</strong> – Ask the athlete to squat by placing the buttocks on the heels and then, remaining in this position, to take four steps forward ("duck walk"), turn around, and take four steps back to the starting position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Prominent, tender tibial tuberosities, diagnostic of Osgood-Schlatter disease and common in young adolescents, may cause pain when the athlete tries to squat in full knee flexion. Athletes with Osgood-Schlatter should not be disqualified from play but should participate in a rehabilitative program that includes stretching of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, strengthening of the quadriceps muscles, and wearing a protective pad over the tibial tuberosity. The athlete should miss little if any sports participation with this treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6289.html" rel="external">"Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity avulsion)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The inability to do the "duck walk" maneuver should prompt a more thorough knee and hip examination and exclusion from painful activities until a definitive diagnosis and rehabilitation plan are established. Most diagnoses of knee problems can be made on the basis of history and physical examination. Consultation with a sports medicine specialist may be necessary to determine the need for additional studies, such as radiographs and/or magnetic resonance imaging, especially if the knee and hip condition does not improve with rehabilitation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ankle</strong> – Ask the athlete to hop as high as they can five times on each foot. The inability to hop five times on an ankle without pain or instability indicates an undiagnosed or unrehabilitated ankle or foot injury.

Therapy consists of conservative measures (a protective pad around the tibial tuberosity, analgesic medications) and physical therapy. Continued sports participation is encouraged in most children with Osgood-Schlatter disease, provided that the pain can be tolerated. This is one of the few pediatric conditions where it is acceptable to exercise with pain.
