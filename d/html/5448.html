Great strides have been achieved in infertility therapy, particularly the development of assisted reproductive technology (ART).</p><p>Once the cause of infertility is identified, therapy aimed at correcting reversible etiologies and overcoming irreversible factors can be implemented. The couple is also counseled on lifestyle modifications to improve fertility, such as smoking cessation, reducing excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption, and appropriate frequency of coitus (every one to two days around the expected time of ovulation)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73570" href="/d/graphic/73570.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5411.html" rel="external">"Natural fertility and impact of lifestyle factors"</a>.)</p><p>The patient should be involved in fertility treatment choices. These choices involve four major factors: effectiveness (eg, live birth rate), burden of treatment (eg, frequency of injections and office visits), safety (eg, risk of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple gestation), and financial costs [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the treatment of female. The evaluation of female infertility, as well as the causes and treatment of male infertility, are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5408.html" rel="external">"Female infertility: Causes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5445.html" rel="external">"Female infertility: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7473.html" rel="external">"Causes of male infertility"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7452.html" rel="external">"Treatments for male infertility"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender-expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1743822359"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The only absolute contraindications to infertility therapy are contraindication to pregnancy and contraindication to use of the drugs or surgeries used to enhance fertility. The ethics of restricting infertility therapy for other reasons, such as parental child-rearing ability, severe obesity, lifestyle issues (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption), are controversial and beyond the scope of this review [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. The parent's marital status, sexual orientation, and HIV status should not be used to deny fertility treatment [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OVULATORY DISORDERS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies ovulatory disorders into three groups  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69734" href="/d/graphic/69734.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>WHO class 1 – Hypogonadotropic hypogonadal anovulation is the least common, occurring in 5 to 10 percent of cases.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually fall into this category.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>WHO class 3 – Hypergonadotropic hypoestrogenic anovulation occurs in 10 to 30 percent. Women with primary ovarian insufficiency (previously called premature ovarian failure) or gonadal dysgenesis, comprise the majority of these cases.</p><p></p><p>Hyperprolactinemic anovulation is a separate category; gonadotropin concentrations in this condition are usually normal or decreased.</p><p>Oligoovulation unrelated to ovarian failure can usually be treated successfully with ovulation induction; these women achieve fecundability nearly equivalent to that of normal couples (ie, 15 to 25 percent probability of achieving a pregnancy in one menstrual cycle) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. However, normal fecundability is achieved at the expense of an increased risk of multiple pregnancy.</p><p>The method of ovulation induction selected should be based upon the underlying cause of anovulation and the efficacy, costs, risks, and potential complications associated with each method as they apply to the individual woman.

WHO class 1 patients respond best to therapy involving lifestyle modification or gonadotropins. Some WHO class 3 patients respond to gonadotropin therapy and in vitro fertilization (IVF), but those who fail require oocyte donation. A synopsis of these therapies is reviewed below; recommendations regarding the choice and dosing of first-line, second-line, and further therapy for ovulation induction according to WHO class are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7407.html" rel="external">"Overview of ovulation induction"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Weight modulation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women who are far above or below ideal body weight are prone to ovulatory dysfunction and subfertility [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Weight modulation in these women can enhance fertility.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">High body weight</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women with elevated baseline weight or body mass index (BMI) greater than 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and anovulatory infertility are advised to lose weight  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80542" href="/d/graphic/80542.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13478.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). For obese women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the loss of just 5 to 10 percent of body weight is sufficient to restore ovulation in 55 to 100 percent of these women within six months [<a href="#rid9">9-13</a>]. Weight loss is an inexpensive, low-intervention modality with no side effects and with other health benefits and thus should be a first-line treatment for obese anovulatory women  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56718" href="/d/graphic/56718.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7421.html" rel="external">"Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults"</a>.)</p><p>A large, multicenter trial of obese (BMI ≥29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and infertile women reported no difference in rates of vaginally delivered term singletons at 24 months among women who received a six-month structured weight-loss intervention prior to infertility treatment and control women who went directly to infertility treatment [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In the trial, women who underwent a six-month lifestyle intervention to lose weight prior to fertility treatment were more likely to conceive spontaneously compared with control women (26 versus 16 percent). The women in the intervention groups also underwent fewer fertility treatment cycles compared with the control women (679 versus 1067 treatment cycles). However, weight reduction was not associated with increased fecundability, as the overall term singleton vaginal birth rates and live birth rates were the same between groups. In addition, there were no differences in the obstetric outcomes of gestational diabetes or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy between intervention and control groups. Study limitations include that target weight loss was reached by only 38 percent of women in the intervention group and the intervention discontinuation rate was 22 percent. It is not known if greater weight reduction per person, increased proportion of women reaching target weight loss, or increased patient continuation rates would increase fecundability. However, we continue to advise weight loss for infertile women with an elevated BMI because weight reduction appears to aid spontaneous conception and reduce the need for fertility treatment, in addition to providing long-term benefits for overall health. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5411.html" rel="external">"Natural fertility and impact of lifestyle factors", section on 'Overweight and obesity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Low body weight</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anovulatory women with low BMI (less than 17 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80542" href="/d/graphic/80542.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13478.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>), with eating disorders, or strenuous exercise regimens, may develop hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and/or hypothalamic amenorrhea (WHO class 1) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Psychogenic stress may also disrupt the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator and impair ovarian function as a result of reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion [<a href="#rid16">16-21</a>]. Such women should be advised to gain weight, modify diet, and reduce exercise; however, these women are often reluctant to alter their behaviors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7393.html" rel="external">"Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2094.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment"</a>.)</p><p>The importance of modifying suboptimal behavior was underscored in a randomized trial of women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. These women were randomly assigned to either observation or 16 sessions of intrapersonal therapy that assessed eating behavior, nutritional intake, energy expenditure, exercise, and attitudes. The goal of therapy was to correct nutritional deficiencies, energy deficit, and problematic attitudes. Treatment was effective: ovarian function recovered in 87 percent of women who received therapy, but in only 25 percent of women who did not receive the intervention. However, as discussed above, women with eating disorders, other psychiatric conditions, or compulsion to excessive exercise are often unable to change these behaviors after just a brief exposure to counseling.</p><p>Patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to eating disorders or intensive exercise who do not respond to behavioral modification may conceive with pulsatile GnRH therapy [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Pulsatile GnRH therapy for ovulation induction has been approved by the FDA, but no pharmaceutical company makes it available in the United States at this time. This treatment is available in Europe. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7407.html" rel="external">"Overview of ovulation induction", section on 'Pulsatile GnRH therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Ovulation induction agents</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Clomiphene</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9281" href="/d/drug information/9281.html" rel="external">Clomiphene</a> citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with both estrogen antagonist and agonist effects that increase gonadotropin release. It is an effective method of inducing ovulation and improving fertility of oligoovulatory women in WHO class 2 (normogonadotropic normoestrogenic ovulatory dysfunction). By comparison, clomiphene is often ineffective in WHO class 1 (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) and class 3 (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism) patients.</p><p>Ovulation induction with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9281" href="/d/drug information/9281.html" rel="external">clomiphene</a> is reviewed in detail elsewhere.

Advantages of these agents over clomiphene include (1) production of fewer follicles and lower estradiol levels, thereby decreasing the risk of multiple gestation, and (2) shorter half-life (50 hours versus 5 days), resulting in reduced antiestrogen effects on the endometrium and cervical mucus. In patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome, a multicenter randomized double-blind trial showed that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10064" href="/d/drug information/10064.html" rel="external">letrozole</a> was superior to clomiphene in inducing ovulation and live birth [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. This topic is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7425.html" rel="external">"Ovulation induction with letrozole"</a>.)</p><p>Aromatase inhibitors in combination with gonadotropins have also emerged as novel ovarian stimulants for performing IVF in women with breast cancer. A presumed advantage of ovarian stimulation with aromatase inhibitors is that the resultant peak estradiol levels are close to those observed in natural cycles.</p><p>The FDA has not approved aromatase inhibitors for treatment of infertility.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18552914"><span class="h3">Gonadotropin therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gonadotropin therapy is used in normogonadotropic (WHO class 2) anovulatory women who have not ovulated or conceived with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9281" href="/d/drug information/9281.html" rel="external">clomiphene</a> treatment and/or insulin sensitizing agents, and in hypogonadotropic (WHO class 1) anovulatory women with hypopituitarism or as second-line therapy in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea. In one trial of normogonadotropic anovulatory women who did not conceive with six cycles of clomiphene citrate therapy, subsequent treatment with gonadotropins was associated with an increased livebirth rate compared with continued treatment with clomiphene (52 versus 41 percent) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. However, compared with clomiphene, treatment with gonadotropins requires close hormonal and sonographic monitoring, is expensive, and typically carries a higher risk of multiple gestation. Dosing protocols, monitoring, side effects, and outcomes of gonadotropin therapy are discussed in detail elsewhere.

A consensus group has recommended against the routine use of metformin for ovulation induction except in women with glucose intolerance [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. However, the addition of metformin in this setting may help facilitate weight loss and ovulation. In addition, metformin may provide additional metabolic effects that are beneficial for pregnancy.

However, reocclusion rates are high.</p><p>For women with severe tubal disease (bilateral hydrosalpinx, both proximal and distal occlusion, extensive adhesions) and for older women, we recommend IVF as the initial approach because tubal surgery is unlikely to be successful in these patients. Hydrosalpinges should be removed prior to IVF to optimize outcomes. These treatments are discussed briefly below.</p><p>It is important to make a definitive diagnosis of bilateral proximal tubal occlusion, as HSG may yield false positive results due to tubal spasm.

A retrospective case-controlled study found that controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with intrauterine insemination (IUI) in women with unilateral proximal tubal occlusion resulted in pregnancy rates statistically similar to those in patients with unexplained infertility (31 versus 43 percent), while patients with unilateral mid-distal or distal tubal occlusion had significantly lower pregnancy rates (19 versus 43 percent) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Procedures for improving tubal patency</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9564392"><span class="h3">Distal obstruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgery for the treatment of tubal factor infertility is most successful in women with distal tubal obstruction. Fimbrioplasty, the lysis of fimbrial adhesions or dilatation of fimbrial strictures, and neosalpingostomy, the creation of a new tubal opening in a distally occluded tube, may be performed via laparotomy or laparoscopy.

Therefore, IVF is preferable, if available. When IVF is not available or not acceptable, proximal tubal occlusion may be treated with hysteroscopic or fluoroscopic tubal catheterization or with tubocornual anastomosis by laparotomy (a laparoscopic approach is possible but requires significant expertise). An advantage of the minimally invasive hysteroscopic approach over fluoroscopy-directed selective salpingography is the capability to perform concomitant laparoscopy with tubal lavage, allowing the clinician both to confirm the diagnosis of proximal occlusion and to treat any coexisting tubal adhesions prior to performing hysteroscopic cannulation [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>Tubal catheterization is accomplished with a coaxial catheter system where the outer catheter is directed at the tubal ostium and used to perform a selective salpingogram. If tubal occlusion is observed, the inner catheter is advanced along a guide wire to gently overcome the blockage. In bilateral proximal occlusion, the procedure is successful in 85 percent of tubes and 50 percent of patients conceive, but one third of the tubes re-occlude [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>]. The procedure should be terminated if gentle pressure does not open the tube as over 90 percent of unsuccessful cases are due to true anatomic occlusion from salpingitis isthmica nodosa, chronic salpingitis, or obliterative fibrosis [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. </p><p>For women with unilateral proximal tubal obstruction, at least one study reported similar pregnancy rates for these women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination (COH-IUI) compared with women with bilaterally patent tubes and unexplained infertility also undergoing COH-IUI [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Thus, for women with unilateral tubal occlusion for whom IVF is not an option, COH-IUI appears to be a reasonable alternative.

The improvement in pregnancy and live birth rates is likely due to the removal of a source of embryotoxic substances or fluid into the uterus disrupting implantation. It has been hypothesized that the surgical removal of hydrosalpinges might decrease blood supply to the ovaries and compromise ovarian reserve, but this has not been studied. In a meta-analysis of seven trials, proximal tubal occlusion and salpingectomy each resulted in increased rates of ongoing pregnancy following IVF in women with hydrosalpinges (tubal occlusion risk ratio 3.22, 95% CI 1.27-8.14 and salpingectomy risk ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.27-3.95) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Although tubal occlusion resulted in more ongoing pregnancies compared with salpingectomy, the small number of trials and procedures limits the ability to determine procedure superiority. Further investigation is required to assess whether alternative surgical treatments for hydrosalpinx removal (salpingostomy, tubal occlusion, needle drainage of hydrosalpinx at oocyte retrieval) are more effective than salpingectomy.

We generally use this stepwise approach, except in the setting of multiple infertility factors (eg, significant male factor component, decreased ovarian reserve, pelvic factors) because the presence of multiple factors has a large negative effect on conservative therapy. For these cases, we would probably go straight to in vitro fertilization rather than apply less resource-intensive approaches. In addition, moving directly to in vitro fertilization in patients with high-stage endometriosis seems prudent. A treatment algorithm for infertile patients with early and advanced stage endometriosis is provided separately.

Subfertility was defined as failure to conceive within one year and cervical mucus abnormality was based upon postcoital testing.
