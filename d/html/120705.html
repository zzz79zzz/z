Most children and adolescents with goiter have normal thyroid function, but some are hypothyroid or hyperthyroid, depending on the cause and stage of the disorder  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77604" href="/z/d/graphic/77604.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In the United States and other iodine-sufficient areas of the world, the most common causes of acquired goiter in children and adolescents are chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis and colloid goiter. Worldwide, iodine-deficiency goiter is far more common. Once a goiter is detected, the diagnostic evaluation is aimed at identifying the underlying cause and assessing thyroid function. Both of these factors will determine management.</p><p>The causes of and clinical approach to acquired goiters in children are discussed below. Congenital goiter, which has different causes and typically presents in newborns and infants, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5844.html" rel="external">"Approach to congenital goiter in newborns and infants"</a>.)</p><p>Thyroid nodules and cancers, and the causes of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in children, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5835.html" rel="external">"Thyroid nodules and cancer in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5841.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Graves disease in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5838.html" rel="external">"Acquired hypothyroidism in childhood and adolescence"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1546338212"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3422195827"><span class="h2">Thyroid volume in healthy children and adolescents</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Goiter refers to enlargement of the thyroid gland; the most accurate method to determine thyroid gland volume is by ultrasonography  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79028" href="/z/d/graphic/79028.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The volume of each lobe is calculated from measurements of the depth (d), width (w), and length (l) of each lobe by the formula: V (mL) = d × w × l (cm) × 0.52 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The thyroid volume is the sum of both lobes; the volume of the isthmus is not included. Thyroid volume should then be compared with reference ranges for age to determine if it is normal or enlarged.</p><p>Normal thyroid volume increases with age throughout childhood and also depends on iodine intake. In an extensive study of children from an iodine-sufficient area of Italy, the mean thyroid volume increased with age from 3.1 mL at 7 years to 6.3 mL at 14 years of age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79028" href="/z/d/graphic/79028.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Thyroid size correlates with body surface area; among children 6 to 14 years of age, the upper 95<sup>th</sup> percentile was 6.2 mL per m<sup>2</sup> in one series [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The influence of iodine intake is seen in a report of 6- to 12-year-old children from Japan, where intake of iodine is relatively high (median urinary iodine 281.6 mcg/L) and thyroid volumes were smaller, increasing from 1.5 mL to 3.8 mL over this age period [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Clinically, we use the "rule of thumb" to evaluate thyroid size in older children: Each lobe of the normal thyroid gland is approximately the size of the terminal phalanx of the child's thumb.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15589395"><span class="h2">Mechanisms for goiter</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Goiter may be caused by several different mechanisms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion, resulting from hypothyroidism, in which TSH acts as a thyroid growth factor  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77604" href="/z/d/graphic/77604.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Activation of TSH receptors, which result in thyroid hyperplasia and increased thyroid hormone secretion. This may be caused by TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies (as in Graves disease) or by genetic mutations that activate the TSH receptor. (See <a class="local">'Graves disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>TSH-independent processes, such as inflammation associated with thyroiditis, benign and malignant tumors, or infiltrative diseases.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H728266789"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Asymptomatic</strong> – A goiter may be discovered during a routine neck examination (eg, carried out for a sports physical). In other cases, some prominence or enlargement in the neck may first be noted by a caregiver or by the child and then brought to the attention of the clinician. Most asymptomatic children with an incidentally discovered goiter are euthyroid.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptomatic</strong> – Less commonly, a child presents with symptoms of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or neck tenderness. Rarely, a large goiter is associated with symptoms due to compression of nearby structures, including difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), shortness of breath (dyspnea), cough, and change in characteristics of the voice (dysphonia).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1279452071"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4201484760"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The history should include onset and duration of goiter and change in size or characteristics, such as nodule formation. Specific questions that may help to identify a cause include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ingestion of excessive iodine – High levels of iodine are found in some health food supplements (eg, kelp), drugs such as expectorants and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12587" href="/z/d/drug information/12587.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a>, topical antiseptics containing iodine (eg, povidone-iodine), and certain radiocontrast agents.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Risk of iodine deficiency – Patients living in an area with endemic goiter, children on parenteral nutrition lacking iodine, or those who are on a very restrictive diet may develop iodine deficiency. Examples of a restrictive diet include veganism with concomitant avoidance of processed foods and iodized salt. Data and a map indicating areas of iodine deficiency worldwide are available from the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.org%2Fscorecard.htm&amp;token=%2FX4g7%2BsewxmWp4CuQuIf4qrMy%2FbdLpwvyQy0w1f345795FWG9XjvBP6V%2BHE9OF2n&amp;TOPIC_ID=120705" target="_blank">Iodine Global Network</a> website.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ingestion of certain drugs – Some anticonvulsants (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12698" href="/z/d/drug information/12698.html" rel="external">phenobarbital</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12702" href="/z/d/drug information/12702.html" rel="external">phenytoin</a>), <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a>, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with the development of hypothyroidism, which may be accompanied by a goiter.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family history – A family history of goiter with or without overt symptoms of hypothyroidism suggests the possibility of autoimmune thyroiditis. A family history of goiter with euthyroidism is also characteristic of colloid goiter.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antecedent illness – A history of an antecedent upper respiratory infection, most commonly viral, and then presenting with fever and neck pain is typically seen with subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain disease). A febrile illness with acute onset of pharyngitis and neck pain (sometimes occurring postoperatively after neck surgery) suggests acute suppurative thyroiditis.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2868622230"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physical examination should include a careful examination of the neck and thyroid gland, with an estimate of size of each lobe and determination of the presence or absence of nodules, tenderness or pain, and cervical adenopathy.</p><p>Vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure may provide clues to the presence of hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Care should be taken to evaluate recent height velocity, height and weight percentiles, weight-for-height or body mass index, and pubertal development in adolescents.</p><p>Important clues include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diffuse thyroid enlargement – The most common cause of childhood goiter, chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis, is characterized by diffuse thyroid enlargement with a bosselated (bumpy), nontender gland on palpation. (See <a class="local">'Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thyroid nodules or masses – Goiter with multiple nodules is most commonly associated with autoimmune thyroiditis or toxic multinodular goiter. Thyroid cancer most commonly presents as a solitary nodule without goiter, though most solitary nodules are benign. Nodules discovered by palpation should undergo ultrasound examination, both to better establish the size and echo characteristics of the nodule and to evaluate for other nonpalpable nodules. Individuals with low TSH (suggesting a hyperfunctioning nodule) should be evaluated with thyroid scintigraphy in addition to thyroid ultrasound [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Patients with large nodules (&gt;1 cm) or with risk factors for thyroid cancer should undergo fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to evaluate for thyroid cancer. (See <a class="local">'Further evaluation of nodules or cysts'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thyroid tenderness – Most types of goiter in children are nontender to palpation, although slight tenderness may be associated with the most common cause, which is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Marked tenderness on palpation is a hallmark of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain disease) and of acute suppurative thyroiditis. (See <a class="local">'Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (early)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Acute suppurative thyroiditis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Compressive symptoms – Some children with very large goiters may develop compressive symptoms, including difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), shortness of breath (dyspnea), cough, and change in characteristics of the voice (dysphonia).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism – Overt hypothyroidism in children is characterized by decreased height velocity and, if the hypothyroidism is prolonged, short stature. Adolescents may present with delayed pubertal development. Less commonly, some children will have an associated "pseudoprecocious puberty," characterized by breast development and vaginal bleeding in females and macro-orchidism in males. Other manifestations tend to be nonspecific, such as weight gain, fatigue, and constipation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5838.html" rel="external">"Acquired hypothyroidism in childhood and adolescence"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism – Common clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism include emotional lability, increased sweating, heat intolerance, increased frequency of bowel movements, sleep disturbances, deterioration in school performance, some acceleration of linear growth, tachycardia, hyperreflexia, and failure to gain weight despite an increase in appetite. Children with hyperthyroidism caused by Graves disease may have associated features of Graves ophthalmopathy, which include exophthalmos, decreased extraocular movements, excessive retraction of the eyelids causing lid lag and stare, and conjunctival chemosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5841.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Graves disease in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1631968489"><span class="h2">Initial testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laboratory testing of thyroid function should be performed in all children and adolescents discovered to have a goiter, regardless of whether clinical manifestations of hypo- or hyperthyroidism are present. All children should also have tests for thyroid antibodies. Thyroid ultrasonography should be performed in children with palpable thyroid nodules, asymmetry of the gland, or suspicious cervical adenopathy [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. We also suggest ultrasonography for baseline evaluation of children with positive thyroid antibodies but without these features, although practice varies on this point.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H999001895"><span class="h3">Thyroid function tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial testing should include measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4). If there is a clinical suspicion of hyperthyroidism, measurement of serum total triiodothyronine (T3) should be included because it may be the first thyroid hormone to be elevated and often it is proportionally more elevated than the free T4. It is important to compare thyroid test results with age-appropriate reference intervals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2338268721"><span class="h3">Thyroid antibody tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with goiter who are likely euthyroid or with a clinical suspicion of hypothyroidism, we suggest including measurement of antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) and antithyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies in the initial blood draw. These tests evaluate for autoimmune thyroiditis, which is the most common cause of goiter in children and adolescents. Most patients with autoimmune thyroiditis are euthyroid, but some are hypothyroid. (See <a class="local">'Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto)'</a> below.)</p><p>Specific antibody testing is directed by clinical evidence of hypo- or hyperthyroidism:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confirmed hypothyroidism – If the anti-TPO and/or anti-Tg antibody tests are negative and thyroid function tests confirm hypothyroidism, we suggest measurement of thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb or TSHR-Ab) using a thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) assay. This assay measures both blocking and stimulating antibodies and if positive in the setting of hypothyroidism, suggests the mechanism of the hypothyroidism may be TSH receptor-blocking antibodies. (See <a class="local">'Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suspected or confirmed hyperthyroidism – For patients with suspected or confirmed hyperthyroidism (low TSH), we recommend measurement of TRAb using either a thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) assay or a TBII assay. A positive result in a patient with hyperthyroidism confirms the diagnosis of Graves disease. (See <a class="local">'Graves disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3891897123"><span class="h3">Ultrasonography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although practice varies on this point, we obtain a thyroid ultrasound for most children with a goiter discovered by physical examination; the primary purpose is to obtain accurate baseline dimensions (transverse, depth, and longitudinal diameters are used to calculate volume). Sonography characteristics may also provide clues to the underlying etiology. As examples, chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis typically shows a "moth-eaten" pattern of scattered hypo- or hyperechogenicity  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef132429" href="/z/d/graphic/132429.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) and the presence of colloid cysts on ultrasonography supports the diagnosis of colloid goiter. We do not routinely do thyroid ultrasound on children with a goiter and a diagnosis of Graves hyperthyroidism. We also suggest ultrasonography for baseline evaluation of children with positive thyroid antibodies but without detection of goiter on examination, although, again, practice varies on this point. (See <a class="local">'Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Colloid goiter'</a> below.)</p><p>Ultrasonography is also useful to identify thyroid nodules or cysts not found on neck examination prompted by discovery of a goiter. In one single-center experience, thyroid nodules were detected by ultrasound examination in 15 percent of children with goiter [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Thyroid cysts are uncommon in children and may be either simple cysts or mixed solid and cystic nodules. Simple cysts are benign and do not require further evaluation. Mixed solid/cystic nodules are usually the result of hemorrhagic degeneration of a thyroid adenoma and may warrant further evaluation by FNA. FNA is also appropriate for some solid nodules with characteristics suggesting cancer risk  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130959" href="/z/d/graphic/130959.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Further evaluation of nodules or cysts'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H812680107"><span class="h2">Subsequent testing for selected patients</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H137230799"><span class="h3">Tests of iodine status</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tests of iodine status should be performed if excessive iodine exposure is suspected from the history and may be performed if the child has otherwise unexplained hypothyroidism. The most accurate test to assess iodine status is measurement of 24-hour urinary iodine and creatinine. Measurement of a spot urine iodine and creatinine, yielding an iodine-to-creatinine ratio, or measurement of serum iodine levels may also be used to assess for iodine excess or deficiency.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3986178545"><span class="h3">Radionuclide uptake and scan</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A radionuclide study is not indicated for most children and adolescents at discovery of a goiter. It may be indicated in selected hyperthyroid children, including those suspected to have Graves disease who present with a suppressed TSH level but with negative TRAb (TSI and/or TBII), and in all children with suspected autonomously functioning "hot" nodules or toxic multinodular goiter. We recommend iodine-123 (I-123) for diagnostic studies because it allows a quantitative measure of uptake, typically performed at 4 and 24 hours after administration (as opposed to iodine-131, which is used to treat certain forms of thyroid cancer). A precise quantitative measure of uptake is not possible if technetium-99m pertechnetate is used, because this isotope is not "organified," ie, does not attach to tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin.</p><p>The radionuclide uptake and scan helps to identify certain disorders:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nil or decreased radionuclide uptake</strong> – This result in a hyperthyroid patient suggests a "destructive thyroiditis" with autonomous release of stored thyroid hormones. This may occur in the hyperthyroid phase of chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis (termed painless or silent thyroiditis) or the early phase of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain disease). Decreased radioactive iodine uptake also occurs in the late phase of Hashitoxicosis, as the gland undergoes destruction by the autoimmune thyroiditis [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5841.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Graves disease in children and adolescents", section on 'Destructive thyroiditis with thyrotoxic phase'</a> and <a class="local">'Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (early)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elevated (or normal) radionuclide uptake with diffuse hyperplasia</strong> – This result in a hyperthyroid patient is consistent with Graves disease and supports that diagnosis even if TSI and/or TBII are negative.

Within these populations, most children with iodine-induced goiters probably have chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, and they develop a goiter because the damaged thyroid cannot adapt to a high iodine intake.

Most children with Graves disease will have elevated uptake at 4 and 24 hours following administration of I-123, but even quantitatively, "normal" uptake in the setting of a low TSH indicates abnormal thyroid autonomy consistent with Graves disease.

Autonomous nodules are usually large enough to be palpable by the time they cause hyperthyroidism [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. The diagnosis is established by an I-123 uptake and scan. An autonomously functioning nodule appears as an area of increased uptake within the nodule and decreased or absent uptake in the remainder of the gland.

(See <a class="local">'Radionuclide uptake and scan'</a> above.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In some cases, the multinodular goiter is part of McCune-Albright syndrome, which is caused by somatic activation of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) stimulatory alpha subunit that activates adenylyl cyclase [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. These mutations result in thyroid hyperplasia or formation of nodules and, ultimately, in toxic nodular goiter, typically presenting in childhood [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

Most commonly, this is a "destructive" thyroiditis with unregulated release of preformed, stored thyroid hormone (so-called painless or silent thyroiditis). It typically occurs at the initial presentation of autoimmune thyroiditis, though it can manifest later in the disease course. At presentation, patients have clinical features of thyrotoxicosis, with a nontender (or mildly tender) goiter to palpation and without features of Graves ophthalmopathy. Laboratory testing shows a suppressed serum TSH, elevated free T4 and T3, positive anti-TPO and/or anti-Tg antibodies, and negative TRAb. The diagnosis is confirmed by decreased I-123 uptake. (See <a class="local">'Radionuclide uptake and scan'</a> above.)</p><p>The thyrotoxic phase is transient, typically lasting several weeks to three months.</p><p>Antithyroid drug treatment is not indicated or effective for painless thyroiditis. Symptomatic patients may be treated with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker until the thyrotoxic phase resolves. Patients should have thyroid function tests monitored at approximately monthly intervals since some patients recover to euthyroidism, but others will become hypothyroid.

These patients presented with hyperthyroidism and elevated radioactive iodine uptake and were responsive to antithyroid drug treatment; most had evidence of Graves eye disease. Over a few months, the hyperthyroidism transitioned to hypothyroidism due to autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland.</p><p>In children, Hashitoxicosis is also difficult to distinguish from Graves disease initially. Affected children present with goiter, thyrotoxicosis (suppressed TSH), and positive anti-TPO and anti-Tg antibodies [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. If radioactive iodine uptake is elevated, the thyrotoxicosis is due to thyroid hormone overproduction. By contrast, low or nil uptake on the scan indicates destructive thyroiditis. (See <a class="local">'Radionuclide uptake and scan'</a> above and <a class="local">'Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (early)'</a> below.)</p><p>Most patients with elevated radioactive iodine uptake will respond well to antithyroid drugs (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5854.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of Graves disease in children and adolescents"</a>). The diagnosis of Hashitoxicosis becomes apparent only when autoimmune hypothyroidism develops. Children with low or nil uptake are typically managed with beta adrenergic receptor blocker drugs alone.

It should be suspected in any child with a viral prodrome followed by a painful, tender goiter with hyperthyroidism (suppressed serum TSH) and negative TRAb (TSI and/or TBII). The diagnosis can be confirmed by radionuclide uptake and scan, in which I-123 uptake is decreased. (See <a class="local">'Radionuclide uptake and scan'</a> above.)</p><p>The course of this disorder in children is similar to that in adults, with an early, painful hyperthyroid phase, followed by euthyroid and then hypothyroid phases (see <a class="local">'Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (late)'</a> above) and finally recovery.

Worldwide, goiter due to iodine deficiency is far more common.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial laboratory tests and diagnostic implications </strong>– For diagnostic purposes, it is helpful to categorize the causes of acquired goiter depending on whether the patient is euthyroid (normal thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), hypothyroid (elevated TSH), or hyperthyroid (low TSH)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77604" href="/z/d/graphic/77604.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). However, for some disorders, thyroid function varies depending on the severity or stage of the disease.

Some children have subclinical or overt hypothyroidism or, less commonly, hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of antithyroid antibodies (antithyroid peroxidase [TPO] or antithyroglobulin [Tg]), but 10 to 15 percent of patients with this disorder have negative antibody testing. Management depends on thyroid function; patients who are hypothyroid should be treated with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12550" href="/z/d/drug information/12550.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> according to standard protocols.

These are diffuse goiters, usually occurring in adolescent females. They may be familial, but their cause is unknown. These goiters usually gradually decrease in size over several years, without treatment. (See <a class="local">'Colloid goiter'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Graves disease</strong> – Children who present with a goiter and hyperthyroidism most likely have Graves disease; less commonly, they may have chronic autoimmune thyroiditis with a thyrotoxic phase ("Hashitoxicosis" or painless thyroiditis), a toxic adenoma, or toxic multinodular goiter. (See <a class="local">'Graves disease'</a> above and <a class="local">'Toxic adenoma or multinodular goiter'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ultrasonography and further steps</strong> – In our practice, we perform ultrasonography in most children with goiter discovered by physical examination to obtain accurate baseline dimensions. Sonographic characteristics also may help identify the underlying etiology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indications</strong> – Ultrasonography should be performed for children with palpable thyroid nodules, asymmetry of the gland, or suspicious cervical adenopathy. In addition, we obtain a thyroid ultrasound for most children with a goiter, although practice varies on this point.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If autoimmune thyroiditis is suspected despite negative antithyroid antibodies (eg, due to goiter and acquired hypothyroidism), ultrasound may help establish this diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef132429" href="/z/d/graphic/132429.html" rel="external">image 1</a>).
