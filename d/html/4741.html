         Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is the most common of the clinically indolent NHLs defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in years. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4716.html" rel="external">
          "Classification of hematopoietic neoplasms"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of FL depends on the stage of disease at presentation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479" href="/z/d/graphic/97479.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Patients with stage I disease are candidates for radiation therapy (RT), which is curative in a percentage of patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, patients with stage III or IV FL (sometimes called "advanced stage") are not cured with conventional therapies. Treatment of this group is more akin to the long-term management of a chronic disease with a focus on symptom control. Most patients with stage III or IV FL will receive a number of different treatment modalities (eg, immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, RT) in various combinations, often separated by several years without active therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of patients with stage II FL is more variable. We typically offer treatment similar to that used for stage III or IV FL, while other clinicians offer treatment similar to that used for stage I FL. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83847.html" rel="external">
          "Initial treatment of stage II to IV follicular lymphoma", section on 'Stage II FL'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment also depends on the histologic grade of the tumor as determined by the number of centroblasts per high power field. The recommendations presented here pertain to patients with histologic grade 1, 2, or 3a FL; patients with grade 3b FL are treated with regimens used for other clinically aggressive lymphomas (eg, diffuse large B cell lymphoma). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Grade 3 FL'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial treatment of stage I FL is discussed here. The initial treatment of stage II to IV FL and the management of relapsed or refractory FL are presented separately, as are the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and pathobiology of FL.

         Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, and serologic testing for hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Some contributors routinely test for hepatitis C virus prior to starting systemic therapy for advanced stage disease.

         Baseline imaging can be performed using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of diagnostic quality or whole body combined fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT). FDG PET/CT is strongly preferred for patients with suspected stage I disease being evaluated for radiation therapy (RT) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Since FL is a typically FDG-avid tumor, involved areas should show activity on PET scan allowing for the identification of those unlikely to be cured by RT due to more widespread disease. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is a less expensive alternative for patients who will be treated with systemic therapy. CT of the neck is added if lymph nodes in the neck are palpable on physical examination.

         For patients with suspected stage I disease, unilateral bone marrow biopsy is performed to rule out bone marrow involvement. We generally do not perform a bone marrow biopsy in patients with more advanced disease as it very rarely impacts the staging and response assessment of most patients with more advanced stage disease on imaging [

         Individuals with childbearing potential should receive counseling about the potential effect of treatment on their fertility and options for fertility-preserving measures (eg, sperm banking). (See

         The speed with which treatment should begin varies with the individual patient's condition and treatment options. In general, it is far more important to attain accurate staging information and correct or control comorbidities than it is to immediately start therapy. Although oncologic emergencies and severe disease-related complications are more common in the clinically aggressive and highly aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes, the physician must always be alert to their potential presence and be prepared to deal with them urgently and effectively.

         Our approach to patients with stage I FL depends on the histologic grade and location of disease  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). This approach is generally consistent with that of major guidelines, including those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and the British Society for Haematology [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-11

         Stage I FL; grades 1, 2, or 3a – We prefer treatment with radiation therapy (RT) administered with curative intent as long as all involved sites can be contained within a radiation field with minimal toxicity. If RT is not feasible, we prefer initial observation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Radiation therapy (RT)'

         Stage I FL; grade 3b – We prefer treatment with regimens used for other clinically aggressive lymphomas such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, for patients with stage II FL of grade 1, 2, or 3a, we prefer treatment similar to that used for stage III or IV FL. Other clinicians offer radiation to a subset of these patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83847.html" rel="external">
          "Initial treatment of stage II to IV follicular lymphoma", section on 'Stage II FL'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         While the recommendations presented here apply to most patients with FL, modifications to this approach are necessary when FL arises in children, in certain extranodal locations (eg, primary intestinal FL, primary cutaneous FL), and when FL-type cells are found incidentally without true lymph node involvement (ie, "in-situ" FL). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Special situations'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Only approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with FL will present with stage I or II disease [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. As such, there have been few prospective trials of therapy in this population and most of the data on this subgroup of patients come from retrospective analyses. Interpretation of these studies is complicated by the rare occurrence of spontaneous complete remissions. Spontaneous partial remissions occur in approximately 20 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         Radiation therapy – RT results in 10-year overall survival (OS) rates of 60 to 80 percent; median survival is approximately 19 years [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Some patients may have a prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) with RT alone. Short- and long-term toxicities associated with RT are dependent on the site of disease, radiation field, and dose. Limited studies suggest adjuvant therapy that incorporates
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">
          rituximab

         may prolong PFS but does not appear to improve survival after local RT. (See

          16

         Observation – Observation is a reasonable alternative to RT if significant morbidity is expected from RT based on the location of the tumor or if the patient chooses against RT. Patients who choose this approach are expected to progress sooner than those who select immediate therapy. By postponing treatment, the patient avoids potential toxicity; however, the increased size of the tumor at the time of progression may also limit treatment options at the time of progression. This approach may be most appropriate for the many stage II patients who are not ideal candidates for RT due to the location of their disease and expected toxicities. (See

         <a href="#rid18">

         Observational studies with long-term follow-up suggest that approximately half of patients presenting with stage I FL can be cured with RT. These studies reported 10-year OS rates of 60 to 80 percent, with 10-year relapse-free survival rates of 45 to 60 percent, and median survival of approximately 15 to 20 years [

         Outcomes may be even better with modern staging and radiation protocols. The historical series described above included patients treated several decades ago, mostly before the availability of modern imaging for staging, and were primarily treated with outdated radiation fields, doses, and techniques. Patients identified as having stage I or II FL using more rigorous staging techniques have superior PFS than those identified with less rigorous staging [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. In a multicenter retrospective study of patients staged with PET/CT and treated with definitive RT, estimated five-year freedom from progression rates were 74 percent among the 410 patients with stage I FL and 49 percent among the 102 patients with stage II FL [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>
         ]. The favorable results compared with historical series may in part be due to stage migration associated with more accurate staging. However, studies have had mixed results. Another retrospective study with rigorous staging did not demonstrate a difference in PFS when it compared systemic therapy versus RT in patients with stage I (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.28-1.17) or stage II (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.39-2.23) disease [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. However, the wide confidence intervals illustrate the uncertainty in these estimates and the estimated 44 percent improvement in those with stage I disease would be clinically meaningful, if true. These results should be interpreted cautiously given its retrospective design and lack of treatment randomization.

        <p>
         Short- and long-term toxicities associated with RT are dependent on the site of disease, radiation field, and dose. Contemporary RT strategies that use smaller radiation fields, conformal techniques with daily image guidance, and lower doses have been able to maintain local disease control rates and are expected to result in less toxicity [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31,32

         The following bullets describe large database analyses that have compared the outcomes of patients with stage I or II FL treated with and without RT. These studies must be interpreted with caution due to potential unobserved confounders and potential selection bias.

        <p>
         When RT is given as a single modality with curative intent, the clinical target volume (CTV) definition is more generous than in the setting of combined modality therapy in which microscopic disease is addressed by systemic therapy. As an example, in a patient with stage I FL of the groin, the CTV should include adjacent vessels that contain lymphatic tissues, as well as adjacent nodes that may harbor microscopic disease. For extranodal FL, organ involvement may be multifocal and limitations in imaging sensitivity may mandate inclusion of the whole organ as part of the CTV.
        </p>
        <p>
         The CTV definition should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and take into account the quality and accuracy of imaging, potential changes in volume since staging imaging, patterns of the disease spread and likelihood of microscopic involvement of neighboring structures. The expansion from CTV to planning target volume (PTV) allows for uncertainties in planning or treatment delivery and is designed to ensure that the RT dose is actually delivered to the CTV. This expansion also needs to be individualized, depending on the immobilization device, body site, and patient cooperation. In general, the CTV to PTV expansion ranges from 0.5 cm to 1 cm.

        <p>
         A phase 3 study evaluating the optimal radiation dose on local control randomly assigned radiation at lower doses (24 Gy in 12 fractions) or higher doses (40 to 45 Gy in 20 to 23 fractions) for 261 sites of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (60 percent FL) [

         Another phase 3 randomized, noninferiority trial (FoRT) compared 4 Gy in two fractions versus 24 Gy in 12 fractions as curative (40 percent) or palliative treatment of 614 sites of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (86 percent FL) [
         <a href="#rid38">

Included in the study were 52 patients with localized, potentially curable disease. Among 42 patients with an evaluable response, the two-year cumulative incidence of local progression was 9 percent at a median follow-up of 1.7 years.

         Observation with treatment at the time of progression (ie, watch and wait) is an acceptable treatment option for patients with stage I or II FL. This is a particularly attractive option if significant morbidity is expected from RT based on the location of the tumor or if the patient chooses against RT.

Six had relapsed locally at a median of 4.2 years from diagnosis, all of whom achieved a second complete remission with RT. Seven relapsed in a distant location after a median of one year. Of the patients who underwent initial therapy, none relapsed locally, but seven relapsed at distant sites.

         These retrospective studies suggest that a percentage of a highly selected patient population may be spared the morbidities associated with RT if observation is used as an initial approach. However, given the potential for cure with RT, we reserve observation for patients who would require RT to areas with high complication rates.

         FL tumors are graded on a scale from 1 to 3 according to the number of centroblasts per high powered field. Those with &gt;15 centroblasts per high power field are categorized as grade 3. Grade 3 FL is subdivided into grade 3a, in which centrocytes are present, and grade 3b, in which there are solid sheets of centroblasts [

          45

         FL grade 3b is often referred to as follicular large cell lymphoma. In contrast to lower grade FLs, this histologic variant has a lesser tendency to involve the bone marrow or peripheral blood and often presents with larger lymphoid masses. Although the follicular architecture is preserved, the clinical presentation, behavior, and outcome with treatment more closely approximates that of DLBCL.

         Radiation of the small bowel is associated with chronic radiation enteritis manifested by malabsorption and diarrhea. This toxicity can be minimized by using a technique that avoids whole abdominal irradiation. For this technique, a radiopaque clip is placed by endoscopy at the location of the tumor and this clip is then used to identify and treat involved bowel plus a margin of normal tissue to 24 Gy. (See

         An initial response assessment is performed approximately one month following the completion of planned therapy (or sooner if the outcome is unfavorable). This evaluation includes a history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, and lactate dehydrogenase). In addition, a whole body combined fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) is performed six to eight weeks after the completion of chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy and 8 to 12 weeks after radiation [

        <p>
         FDG PET/CT is the preferred modality as it provides a more precise estimation of disease burden than CT alone and may provide prognostic information [

         Following the completion of therapy, restaging, and documentation of complete or partial remission, patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for treatment complications and assess for progression. The frequency and extent of these visits depends on the comfort of both the patient and physician. There have been no prospective, randomized trials comparing various schedules of follow-up.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to patient surveillance is to schedule patient visits every three months during the first year and then every three to six months thereafter. At these visits we perform a history and physical examination, complete blood count, chemistries, and lactate dehydrogenase. The role of routine imaging in the longitudinal follow-up of asymptomatic patients after response assessment is uncertain, and routine imaging in this population is discouraged [

        <p>
         Relapsed disease can be suggested by findings on the physical examination and changes on imaging studies but can only be confirmed by biopsy. Biopsy also evaluates for histologic transformation to more aggressive disease. As such, a biopsy should always be obtained to document relapsed disease before proceeding to further therapy.

          Stage I FL
         </strong>
         – For most patients with stage I FL, we suggest radiation therapy (RT) to a dose of 24 Gy in 2 Gy fractions delivered with curative intent rather than treatment with chemoimmunotherapy, immunotherapy, or an initial period of observation (

This preference is based on observational studies that suggest cure with RT is less likely in this population. Other clinicians offer RT to a subset of these patients. (See
