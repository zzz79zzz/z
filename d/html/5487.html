         An ectopic pregnancy is an extrauterine pregnancy. While the majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube, nontubal sites include cervical, interstitial, ovarian, and abdominal pregnancy. Other abnormally implanted pregnancies, including hysterotomy (ie, cesarean, myomectomy) scar pregnancies can also occur. In rare cases, a multiple gestation may be heterotopic (include both an intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy). Rupture of an ectopic pregnancy can result in life-threatening hemorrhage.

         The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy are reviewed here with a focus on tubal pregnancy. Medical and surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy are reviewed elsewhere. Related topics regarding ectopic pregnancy are discussed in detail separately, including:

         The most common clinical presentation of ectopic pregnancy is first-trimester vaginal bleeding and/or abdominal pain [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

        <p>
         Clinical manifestations of ectopic pregnancy typically appear six to eight weeks after the last normal menstrual period but may occur later, especially if the pregnancy is at an extrauterine site other than the fallopian tube. Normal pregnancy discomforts (eg, breast tenderness, frequent urination, nausea) are sometimes present. Early pregnancy symptoms may be less common in patients with ectopic pregnancy because progesterone, estradiol, and human chorionic gonadotropin levels may be lower than in normal pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An ectopic pregnancy may be unruptured or ruptured at the time of presentation to medical care. Tubal rupture (or rupture of other structures in which an ectopic pregnancy is implanted) can result in life-threatening intraabdominal hemorrhage. Rupture may present with severe or persistent abdominal pain or symptoms suggestive of ongoing blood loss (eg, feeling faint or loss of consciousness).
        </p>
        <p>
         The following large studies are examples of the frequency of findings in ectopic pregnancy:

         In a retrospective study of 2026 pregnant patients who presented to the emergency department with first-trimester vaginal bleeding and/or abdominal pain, 376 (18 percent) were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Of these 376 patients, 76 percent had vaginal bleeding and 66 percent had abdominal pain.

         The volume and pattern of vaginal bleeding vary, and there is no bleeding pattern that is pathognomonic for ectopic pregnancy. Bleeding may range from scant brown staining to hemorrhage. Bleeding is usually intermittent but may occur as a single episode or continuously.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vaginal bleeding associated with ectopic pregnancy is typically preceded by amenorrhea [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. However, some patients may misinterpret bleeding as normal menses and may not realize they are pregnant prior to developing symptoms associated with ectopic pregnancy. This is particularly true in patients who have irregular menses or who do not keep track of menstrual cycles. The presumptive source of such bleeding is sloughing of the decidualized endometrium rather than bleeding from the tube itself.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bleeding occurs in many other conditions in early pregnancy. (See
         <a class="local">

         </a>

         The timing, character, and severity of abdominal pain vary, and there is no pain pattern that is pathognomonic for ectopic pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pain is usually located in the pelvis and may be diffuse or localized to one side. Pain tends to present between five and seven weeks of gestation as the tube becomes sufficiently distended. Patients may describe their pain as continuous or intermittent, dull or sharp, or mild or severe. Tubal rupture may be associated with an abrupt onset of severe pain. In cases in which there is intraperitoneal blood that reaches the upper abdomen or in rare cases of abdominal pregnancy, the pain may be in the middle or upper abdomen. If there is sufficient intraabdominal bleeding to reach the diaphragm, referred pain may be felt in the shoulder. Blood pooling in the posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas) may cause an urge to defecate.

         Evaluate the patient for hemodynamic instability since rupture of the structure in which the ectopic pregnancy is implanted typically causes hemorrhage. Failure to diagnose ectopic pregnancy before tubal rupture increases maternal morbidity and mortality and limits treatment options.

         Determine the site of the pregnancy (ie, whether an intrauterine pregnancy [IUP] or ectopic pregnancy). In rare cases, the pregnancy is heterotopic. In the absence of definitive evidence of an IUP or ectopic pregnancy on ultrasound, it is sometimes impossible to differentiate between an early IUP, an ectopic pregnancy, and an early failed IUP. These pregnancies are referred to as a pregnancy of unknown location. (See

         Patients with ectopic pregnancy may become hemodynamically unstable if there is a rupture of, and hemorrhage from, the structure in which the pregnancy is implanted, usually the fallopian tube [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. However, in young healthy patients, vital signs, including postural changes, may be normal early in the course of significant bleeding due to compensatory mechanisms [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Rupture should be suspected in patients with a sudden onset of severe and persistent abdominal or pelvic pain, or symptoms or signs suggestive of hemodynamic compromise (eg, feeling faint, hypotension, tachycardia). The typical findings of rupture are abdominal or pelvic pain, shoulder pain due to diaphragmatic irritation by blood in the peritoneal cavity, and, eventually, hypotension and shock.
        </p>
        <p>
         Physical examination is often unremarkable or may reveal lower abdominal tenderness. If rupture with significant bleeding has occurred, the abdomen may be distended and the patient may have diffuse, localized, and/or rebound tenderness.
        </p>
        <p>
         If rupture is suspected, the patient should be transferred to a center where resuscitation and immediate surgical treatment can be provided. A complete pelvic examination in the emergency department is not always possible and may be deferred until the patient is in the operating room. The pelvic examination and expected findings are described below. (See

         An abdominal ultrasound can be used to quickly assess for intraperitoneal hemorrhage. In the absence of abdominal trauma, identification of intraperitoneal bleeding in a patient of reproductive age should be considered a potential ruptured ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. A hemodynamically unstable patient with this finding should undergo urgent surgical consultation and exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
         If intraperitoneal hemorrhage is not found on focused abdominal ultrasound, a ruptured ectopic pregnancy is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's hemodynamic instability.
        </p>
        <p>
         If heavy vaginal bleeding is present and is thought to be the cause of the hypovolemia, the patient may require emergency surgical management with uterine aspiration for a suspected incomplete abortion. If neither hemoperitoneum nor heavy vaginal bleeding is present, further evaluation for other causes of hypotension and shock is required. (See

         On bimanual pelvic examination, the adnexa should be palpated gently since excessive pressure may rupture an ectopic pregnancy. Cervical motion, adnexal, and/or abdominal tenderness may be present, and an adnexal mass can be detected in some patients; however, this examination is often unremarkable in a patient with a small, unruptured ectopic pregnancy. The uterus may be somewhat enlarged but will likely be smaller than appropriate for gestational age. Uterine enlargement in patients with ectopic pregnancy may be due to endocrine changes of pregnancy, rare cases of heterotopic pregnancy, or incidental uterine pathology (most commonly, uterine fibroids).

         In pregnant patients, hCG can be detected in serum as early as six days after the luteinizing hormone surge (approximately 21 to 22 days after the first day of the last menstrual period in patients with 28-day cycles).

         The hCG concentration in a normal IUP rises in a curvilinear fashion until approximately 41 days of gestation, after which it rises more slowly until approximately 10 weeks, and then declines until reaching a plateau in the second and third trimesters [

         The discriminatory zone is the serum hCG level above which a
         <strong>
          gestational sac
         </strong>
         should be visualized when an IUP is present. It is important to emphasize that a patient should not be diagnosed or treated for an ectopic pregnancy based on a single serum hCG level.
        </p>
        <p>
         For TVUS, we use a discriminatory zone of 3510 mIU/mL.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         However, results and discriminatory zone vary by laboratory and institution, and some institutions set the discriminatory zone at 2000 mIU/mL [
         <a href="#rid19">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Setting the discriminatory zone at 3510 mIU/mL increases the ability to diagnose a live IUP on TVUS, if present, but also increases the risk of delaying a diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy. In a study of 651 patients with first-trimester bleeding or pain, among live IUPs, a gestational sac was seen at differing hCG levels in the following proportion of pregnancies: 1500 mIU/mL (80 percent had a gestational sac visualized), 2000 mIU/mL (91 percent), and 3510 mIU/mL (99 percent) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]; 1 percent of IUPs will not be visualized on TVUS when the discriminatory zone is set at 3510 mIU/mL.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to note that there is a variation in the level of hCG across pregnancies for each gestational age, and the discriminatory levels are not always reliable and thus should be used with caution. In addition, other factors can affect the early detection of a gestational sac, including the skill of the ultrasonographer, the quality of the ultrasound equipment, and the presence of physical factors (eg, fibroids, multiple gestation, large body habitus).

         For a hemodynamically stable patient in whom a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy or IUP cannot be made based on the initial TVUS (ie, pregnancy of unknown location), follow-up is often with serial hCG and repeat ultrasound. (See

Strict histopathologic criteria are used to distinguish ovarian pregnancies from those originating in the fallopian tube. The exact diagnosis is not clinically important since these pregnancies are usually treated by surgical excision of the involved organs.

         The interstitial portion of the fallopian tube is the proximal segment that is embedded within the muscular wall of the uterus  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55921" href="/z/d/graphic/55921.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). A pregnancy implanted at this site is called an interstitial pregnancy; the term "cornual pregnancy" is also widely used (but less preferred) to describe a pregnancy at this location. Originally, cornual pregnancy referred only to pregnancies implanted in either the horn of a bicornuate or didelphys uterus, a rudimentary horn of a unicornuate uterus, or in one side of a septated or partially septated uterus.
        </p>
        <p>
         An interstitial pregnancy can be difficult to distinguish on ultrasound from an IUP that is eccentrically positioned (and sometimes referred to as angular pregnancy). The key finding is that an interstitial pregnancy is extra-endometrial. As interstitial pregnancies advance, ultrasound may show a bulge at the interstitial region without a communication to the endometrial cavity; typically there will be no myometrium surrounding a portion of the gestational sac. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5410.html" rel="external">
          "Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Grossly, an interstitial pregnancy appears as a gestational swelling lateral to the insertion of the round ligament. The unique anatomic location of an interstitial pregnancy often leads to a delay in diagnosis, although an average delay of only four days in comparison with tubal pregnancies was reported in a large series [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the interstitial portion of the fallopian tube can dilate more readily than other portions of the tube, pain usually presents later in gestation (between 8 and 10 weeks), with rupture occurring in approximately 20 to 50 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35-37
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the maternal mortality rate associated with tubal pregnancy is decreasing, the rate for interstitial pregnancies remains at 2.0 to 2.5 percent because of misdiagnosis of these gestations as IUPs.

         Routine prenatal care does not include serial measurement of serum hCG or early TVUS. The exceptions to this are patients at high risk of an ectopic pregnancy, including those with an IVF pregnancy; pregnancy after reconstructive surgery of the fallopian tube; or prior history of ectopic pregnancy.

         ) with serial serum hCG levels and TVUS. We use the same clinical protocol as for a hemodynamically stable patient with a pregnancy of unknown location and start with the first missed menses or after embryo transfer for IVF.

          Sites of ectopic pregnancy
         </strong>
         – An ectopic pregnancy is an extrauterine pregnancy. Almost all ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube, but other possible sites include cervical, interstitial, ovarian, or abdominal. Other abnormally implanted pregnancies, including hysterotomy (ie, cesarean, myomectomy) scar pregnancies, can also occur. In rare cases, a multiple gestation may be heterotopic (include both an intrauterine pregnancy [IUP] and an extrauterine pregnancy). (See

          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding are the most common symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy should be suspected in any patient of reproductive age with these symptoms, especially those who have risk factors for ectopic pregnancy  (

          table 1

         ). However, over 50 percent of patients are asymptomatic before tubal rupture and do not have an identifiable risk factor for ectopic pregnancy. (See

         Rupture should be suspected in patients with a sudden onset of severe and persistent abdominal pain, symptoms of faintness, or vital signs suggestive of hemodynamic compromise (eg, hypotension, tachycardia). These patients should be evaluated immediately in an emergency department. (See

          Hemodynamically stable patients

         The discriminatory zone is the serum hCG level above which a gestational sac should almost always be visualized on ultrasound when an IUP is present. This level varies by laboratory and institution. For TVUS, we use a discriminatory zone of 3510 mIU/mL. However, a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy cannot be made based on a single hCG result. (See
