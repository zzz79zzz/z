The clinical presentation of CAP varies, ranging from mild pneumonia characterized by fever and productive cough to severe pneumonia characterized by respiratory distress and sepsis. Because of the wide spectrum of associated clinical features, CAP is a part of the differential diagnosis of nearly all respiratory illnesses.</p><p>This topic provides a broad overview of the epidemiology, microbiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of CAP in immunocompetent adults. Detailed discussions of each of these issues are presented separately; links to these discussions are provided within the text below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3389522833"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pneumonia is frequently categorized based on site of acquisition  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130821" href="/d/graphic/130821.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Community-acquired pneumonia</strong> (CAP) refers to an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma acquired outside of the hospital.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nosocomial pneumonia</strong> refers to an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma acquired in hospital settings and encompasses both <strong>hospital-acquired pneumonia</strong> (HAP) and <strong>ventilator-associated pneumonia</strong> (VAP).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>HAP refers to pneumonia acquired ≥48 hours after hospital admission.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>VAP refers to pneumonia acquired ≥48 hours after endotracheal intubation.</p><p></p><p>Health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP; no longer used) referred to pneumonia acquired in health care facilities (eg, nursing homes, hemodialysis centers) or after recent hospitalization. The term HCAP was used to identify patients at risk for infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens. However, this categorization may have been overly sensitive, leading to increased, inappropriately broad antibiotic use and was thus retired. In general, patients previously classified as having HCAP should be treated similarly to those with CAP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7020.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2094207429"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1252700429"><span class="h2">Incidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CAP is one of the most common and morbid conditions encountered in clinical practice [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. In the United States, CAP accounts for over 4.5 million outpatient and emergency room visits annually, corresponding to approximately 0.4 percent of all encounters [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. CAP is the second most common cause of hospitalization and the most common infectious cause of death [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Approximately 650 adults are hospitalized with CAP every year per 100,000 population in the United States, corresponding to 1.5 million unique CAP hospitalizations each year [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Nearly 9 percent of patients hospitalized with CAP will be rehospitalized due to a new episode of CAP during the same year.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1270121591"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Older age</strong> – The risk of CAP rises with age [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. The annual incidence of hospitalization for CAP among adults ≥65 years old is approximately 2000 per 100,000 in the United States [<a href="#rid7">7,9</a>]. This figure is approximately three times higher than the general population and indicates that 2 percent of the older adult population will be hospitalized for CAP annually  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118032" href="/d/graphic/118032.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic comorbidities</strong> – The comorbidity that places patients at highest risk for CAP hospitalization is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with an annual incidence of 5832 per 100,000 in the United States [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Other comorbidities associated with an increased incidence of CAP include other forms of chronic lung disease (eg, bronchiectasis, asthma), chronic heart disease (particularly congestive heart failure), stroke, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and immunocompromising conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118033" href="/d/graphic/118033.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7,10,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Viral respiratory tract infection</strong> – Viral respiratory tract infections can lead to primary viral pneumonias and also predispose to secondary bacterial pneumonia.

As examples, exposure to contaminated water is a risk factor for <em>Legionella </em>infection, exposure to birds raises the possibility of <em>C. psittaci </em>infection, travel or residence in the southwestern United States should raise suspicion for coccidioidomycosis, and poor dental hygiene may predispose patients with pneumonia caused by oral flora or anaerobes. In immunocompromised patients, the spectrum of possible pathogens also broadens to include fungi and parasites as well as less common bacterial and viral pathogens. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1402.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1401.html" rel="external">"Approach to the immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates"</a>.)</p><p>While the list above details some of most common causes of CAP, &gt;100 bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic causes have been reported. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6990.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults", section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2598048080"><span class="h2">Important trends</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both the distribution of pathogens that cause CAP and our knowledge of these pathogens are evolving. Key observations that have changed our understanding of CAP and influenced our approach to management include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decline in </strong><strong><em>S. pneumoniae</em></strong><strong> incidence</strong> – Although <em>S. pneumoniae </em>(pneumococcus) is the most commonly detected bacterial cause of CAP in most studies, the overall incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia is decreasing. This is in part due to widespread use of pneumococcal vaccination, which results in both a decline in the individual rates of pneumococcal pneumonia and herd immunity in the population. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7013.html" rel="external">"Pneumococcal pneumonia in patients requiring hospitalization", section on 'Prevalence'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because pneumococcal vaccination rates vary regionally, the prevalence of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> infection also varies. As an example, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> is estimated to cause approximately 30 percent of cases of CAP in Europe but only 10 to 15 percent in the United States, where the population pneumococcal vaccination rate is higher [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic</strong> – SARS-CoV-2 is an important cause of CAP and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Increased recognition of other respiratory viruses</strong> – Respiratory viruses have been detected in approximately one-third of cases of CAP in adults when using molecular methods [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The extent to which respiratory viruses serve as single pathogens, cofactors in the development of bacterial CAP, or triggers for dysregulated host immune response has not been established.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low overall rate of pathogen detection</strong> – Despite extensive evaluation using molecular diagnostics and other microbiologic testing methods, a causal pathogen can be identified in only half of cases of CAP. This finding highlights that our understanding of CAP pathogenesis is incomplete. As molecular diagnostics become more advanced and use broadens, our knowledge is expected to grow.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Discovery of the lung microbiome</strong> – Historically, the lung has been considered sterile. However, culture-independent techniques (ie, high throughput 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid [rRNA] gene sequencing) have identified complex and diverse communities of microbes that reside within the alveoli [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. This finding suggests that resident alveolar microbes play a role in the development of pneumonia, either by modulating the host immune response to infecting pathogens or through direct overgrowth of specific pathogens within the alveolar microbiome. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1950805862"><span class="h2">Antimicrobial resistance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Knowledge of antimicrobial resistance patterns and risk factors for infection with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens help inform the selection of antibiotics for empiric CAP treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118967" href="/d/graphic/118967.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong><em>S. pneumoniae</em></strong> may be resistant to one or more antibiotics commonly used for the empiric treatment of CAP.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Macrolide resistance rates vary regionally but are generally high (&gt;25 percent) in the United States, Asia, and southern Europe.

In the United States, &lt;20 percent of isolates are resistant to penicillin and &lt;1 percent to cephalosporins.

Risk factors for MRSA have two patterns: health care associated and community acquired. The strongest risk factors for MRSA pneumonia include known MRSA colonization or prior MRSA infection, particularly involving the respiratory tract. Gram-positive cocci on sputum Gram stain are also predictive of MRSA infection. Other factors that should raise suspicion for MRSA infection include recent antibiotic use (particularly receipt of intravenous antibiotics within the past three months), recent influenza-like illness, the presence of empyema, necrotizing/cavitary pneumonia, and immunosuppression  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118967" href="/d/graphic/118967.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In contrast with health care-associated MRSA, community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections tend to occur in younger healthy persons [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Risk factors for CA-MRSA infection include a history of MRSA skin lesions, participation in contact sports, injection drug use, crowded living conditions, and men who have sex with men. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3157.html" rel="external">"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adults: Epidemiology"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">CAP caused by CA-MRSA can be severe and is associated with necrotizing and/or cavitary pneumonia, empyema, gross hemoptysis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. These features may be attributable to infection with toxin-producing CA-MRSA strains. In the United States, these strains tend to be methicillin resistant and belong to the USA300 clone.

Antibiotic resistance is common among pseudomonal strains, and empiric therapy with more than one agent that targets <em>Pseudomonas</em> is warranted for at-risk patients with moderate to severe CAP  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118967" href="/d/graphic/118967.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).

In this model, respiratory pathogens are transmitted from person to person via droplets or, less commonly, via aerosol inhalation (eg, as with <em>Legionella</em> or <em>Coxiella </em>species). Following inhalation, the pathogen colonizes the nasopharynx and then reaches the lung alveoli via microaspiration. When the inoculum size is sufficient and/or host immune defenses are impaired, infection results. Replication of the pathogen, the production of virulence factors, and the host immune response lead to inflammation and damage of the lung parenchyma, resulting in pneumonia  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118722" data-inline-graphics="118722" href="/d/graphic/118722.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p>With the identification of the lung microbiome, that model has changed [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. While the pathogenesis of pneumonia may still involve the introduction of respiratory pathogens into the alveoli, the infecting pathogen likely has to compete with resident microbes to replicate. In addition, resident microbes may also influence or modulate the host immune response to the infecting pathogen. If this is correct, an altered alveolar microbiome (alveolar dysbiosis) may be a predisposing factor for the development of pneumonia.</p><p>In some cases, CAP might also arise from uncontrolled replication of microbes that normally reside in the alveoli. The alveolar microbiome is similar to oral flora and is primarily comprised of anaerobic bacteria (eg, <em>Prevotella</em> and <em>Veillonella</em>) and microaerophilic streptococci [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. Hypothetically, exogenous insults such as a viral infection or smoke exposure might alter the composition of the alveolar microbiome and trigger overgrowth of certain microbes. Because organisms that compose the alveolar microbiome typically cannot be cultivated using standard cultures, this hypothesis might explain the low rate of pathogen detection among patients with CAP.</p><p>In any scenario, the host immune response to microbial replication within the alveoli plays an important role in determining disease severity. For some patients, a local inflammatory response within the lung predominates and may be sufficient for controlling infection. In others, a systemic response is necessary to control infection and to prevent spread or complications, such as bacteremia. In a minority, the systemic response can become dysregulated, leading to tissue injury, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and/or multiorgan dysfunction.</p><p>The pathogenesis of CAP is discussed in greater detail separately.

Signs of pneumonia on physical examination include tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and adventitious breath sounds, including rales/crackles and rhonchi. Tactile fremitus, egophony, and dullness to percussion also suggest pneumonia. These signs and symptoms result from the accumulation of white blood cells (WBCs), fluid, and proteins in the alveolar space. Hypoxemia can result from the subsequent impairment of alveolar gas exchange. On chest radiograph, accumulation of WBCs and fluid within the alveoli appears as pulmonary opacities  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65658 graphicRef86363" href="/d/graphic/65658.html" rel="external">image 1A-B</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Systemic signs and symptoms</strong> – The great majority of patients with CAP present with fever. Other systemic symptoms such as chills, fatigue, malaise, chest pain (which may be pleuritic), and anorexia are also common. Tachycardia, leukocytosis with a leftward shift, or leukopenia are also findings that are mediated by the systemic inflammatory response. Inflammatory markers, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin may rise, though the latter is largely specific to bacterial infections. CAP is also the leading cause of sepsis; thus, the initial presentation may be characterized by hypotension, altered mental status, and other signs of organ dysfunction such as renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, and/or thrombocytopenia [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p>Although certain signs and symptom such as fever, cough, tachycardia, and rales are common among patients with CAP, these features are ultimately nonspecific and are shared among many respiratory disorders (see <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). No individual symptom or constellation of symptoms is adequate for diagnosis without chest imaging. For example, the positive predictive value of the combination of fever, tachycardia, rales, and hypoxia (oxygen saturation &lt;95 percent) among patients with respiratory complaints presenting to primary care was &lt;60 percent when chest radiograph was used as a reference standard [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>Signs and symptoms of pneumonia can also be subtle in patients with advanced age and/or impaired immune systems, and a higher degree of suspicion may be needed to make the diagnosis. As examples, older patients may present with mental status changes but lack fever or leukocytosis [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. In immunocompromised patients, pulmonary infiltrates may not be detectable on chest radiographs but can be visualized with computed tomography.</p><p>The clinical and diagnostic features of CAP and sepsis are discussed in detail separately.

However, follow-up clinic visits are good opportunities to review the patient's risk for lung cancer based on age, smoking history, and recent imaging findings  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131579" data-inline-graphics="131579" href="/d/graphic/131579.html" rel="external">algorithm 8</a>).</p><p>This approach is similar to that outlined by the ATS/IDSA, which recommend not obtaining a follow-up chest radiograph in patients whose symptoms have resolved within five to seven days [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

Other indicators include an increase in subjective symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea) usually in combination with objective criteria (eg, decline in oxygenation, persistent fever, or rising white blood cell). Various criteria have been proposed to define clinical failure but none widely adopted [<a href="#rid46">46-48</a>].</p><p>Reasons for clinical failure generally fall into these categories:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Progression of the initial infection</strong> – For some patients, CAP can lead to overwhelming infection despite appropriate antibiotic treatment. In some, this indicates a dysregulated host immune response. In others, this may indicate that the infection has spread beyond the pulmonary parenchyma (eg, empyema, lung abscess, bacteremia, endocarditis).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other possibilities include infection with a drug-resistant pathogen or an unusual pathogen not covered by the initial empiric antibiotic regimen. Alternatively, failure to respond to treatment may signify the presence of an immunodeficiency (eg, new diagnosis of HIV infection).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Development of comorbid complications</strong> – Comorbid complications may be infectious or noninfectious. Nosocomial infections, particularly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), are common causes of clinical failure. In addition to HAP, others include catheter-related bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and <em>C. difficile</em> infection [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cardiovascular events are also common complications and include acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and stroke [<a href="#rid50">50-52</a>]. Older age, preexisting cardiovascular disease, severe pneumonia, and infection with certain pathogens (ie, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and influenza) have each been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events [<a href="#rid50">50,53-55</a>]. Recognition that cardiovascular events and other systemic complications can occur during the acute phase of CAP is also changing our view of CAP from an acute pulmonary process to an acute systemic disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7016.html" rel="external">"Morbidity and mortality associated with community-acquired pneumonia in adults", section on 'Cardiac complications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Because of these possibilities, we generally broaden our initial antibiotic regimen for patients who are progressing despite appropriate empiric treatment and evaluate for alternate diagnoses, less common or drug-resistant pathogens, and/or infectious and cardiovascular complications.

We generally characterize these patients as having nonresolving pneumonia. Potential causes of nonresolving CAP include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Delayed clinical response</strong> – For some patients, particularly those with multiple comorbidities, severe pneumonia, bacteremia, and infection with certain pathogens (eg, <em>S. pneumoniae</em>), treatment response may be slow. Eight or nine days of treatment may be needed before clinical improvement is evident.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Loculated infection</strong> – Patients with complications such as lung abscess, empyema, or other closed space infections may fail to improve clinically despite appropriate antibiotic selection.

Mortality can be directly attributable to CAP (eg, overwhelming sepsis or respiratory failure) or can result indirectly from cardiovascular events or other comorbid complications (eg, advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) [<a href="#rid56">56</a>].</p><p>Long-term complications resulting from pneumonia are increasingly recognized and there is a shift in the medical community to define pneumonia as a systemic illness that can lead to chronic disease [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. While the precise incidence of long-term complications is not known, the more common long-term sequelae involve the respiratory tract and cardiovascular system [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].</p><p>In the United States, pneumonia (combined with influenza) is among the top 10 most common causes of death [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Thirty-day mortality rates vary with disease severity, ranging from less than 1 percent in ambulatory patients to approximately 20 to 25 percent in patients with severe CAP. In addition to disease severity, older age, comorbidities (eg, COPD, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease), infection with certain pathogens (eg, <em>S. pneumoniae</em>), and acute cardiac complications are each associated with increased short-term mortality [<a href="#rid50">50,59,60</a>].</p><p>CAP is also associated with increased long-term mortality [<a href="#rid7">7,61-63</a>]. In one population-based study evaluating 7449 patients hospitalized with CAP, mortality rates were 6.5 percent during hospitalization, 13 percent 30 days after hospitalization, 23 percent at six months after hospitalization, and 31 percent at one year after hospitalization [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. During the same study year, an estimated 1,581,860 patients were hospitalized in the United States. Extrapolating mortality data to these patients, the number of deaths in the United States population will be 102,821 during hospitalization, 205,642 at 30 days, 370,156 at six months, and 484,050 at one year [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Causes of long-term mortality are primarily related to comorbidities and include malignancy, COPD, and cardiovascular disease [<a href="#rid56">56</a>].</p><p>Data associating CAP with long-term mortality indicate that CAP is not only a common cause of acute morbidity and mortality but also a disease with important chronic health outcomes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1190177860"><span class="h1">PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The three primary pillars for the prevention of CAP are [<a href="#rid64">64-66</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Smoking cessation (when appropriate)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Influenza vaccination for all patients</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pneumococcal vaccination for at-risk patients</p><p></p><p>Each is discussed in detail separately.

(See <a class="local">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors</strong> – Risk factors include age ≥65 years, chronic comorbidities, concurrent or antecedent respiratory viral infections, impaired airway protection, smoking, alcohol abuse, and other lifestyle factors (eg, crowded living conditions). (See <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Microbiology</strong> – The most commonly identified causes of CAP include respiratory viruses (particularly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the pandemic), typical bacteria (eg, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae,</em> <em>Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis</em>) and atypical bacteria (eg, <em>Legionella</em> spp, <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae</em>). <em>Pseudomonas</em> and methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) are less common causes that predominantly occur in patients with specific risk factors. (See <a class="local">'Microbiology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Making the diagnosis</strong> – Diagnosis requires demonstration of an infiltrate on chest imaging in a patient with a clinically compatible syndrome (eg, fever, dyspnea, cough, and leukocytosis). For most patients, a posteroanterior and lateral chest radiograph is sufficient. Computed tomography scan is reserved for selected cases. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Making the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alternate and concurrent diagnoses</strong> – While the combination of a compatible clinical syndrome and an infiltrate on chest imaging are sufficient to establish an initial clinical diagnosis of CAP, these findings are nonspecific. Remaining attentive to the possibility of an alternate or concurrent diagnosis as a patient's course evolves is important to care. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Determining severity of illness</strong> – For patients with a working diagnosis of CAP, the initial steps in management are defining the severity of illness and determining the most appropriate site of care  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113076" href="/d/graphic/113076.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). For most patients, we determine our approach to microbiologic testing based on this assessment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118966" href="/d/graphic/118966.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).
