         Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an advanced form of life support that is mostly used in patients with severe respiratory or cardiac failure when conventional treatments fail. While in the past ECMO was associated with poor outcomes and high complication rates, technical advances coupled with accumulating data that describe successful outcomes have resulted in increased ECMO use over time.

         V-V ECMO is a form of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) that is mostly used for temporary support of patients with acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure. The term V-V refers to the configuration of the circuit in which blood is removed from a large central
         <strong>
          vein
         </strong>
         (
         <strong>
          V
         </strong>
         -V). This blood is oxygenated extracorporeally and reinfused into the same or a different
         <strong>
          vein
         </strong>
         (V-

         Patients suited to V-V ECMO include patients who have severe, acute, and potentially reversible hypoxemic or mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure despite optimization of conventional management (eg, lung-protective ventilation [≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight and plateau airway pressure 30 cm H

         <sub>
          2

         <sub>

         O) or those who demonstrate intolerance of lung-protective ventilation, such as refractory hypoxemia or severe acidemia [

          4,5

         ]. These features are mostly encountered in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but can also be seen in acute respiratory failure due to other conditions. Data to support ECMO in ARDS are derived from randomized trials that suggest benefit while data for other indications are mostly derived from observational studies and clinical experience. These data are discussed in detail below. (See

         Major randomized trials have suggested benefit associated with ECMO in patients with severe acute respiratory failure, which have mostly included patients with ARDS [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. Most commonly cited are the conventional ventilatory support versus ECMO for severe acute respiratory failure (CESAR) trial and the ECMO for severe ARDS (EOLIA) trial. Despite trial limitations, we believe on balance that ECMO benefits those who meet the above criteria despite optimal conventional management, especially when ECMO is combined with ventilator settings targeting lower volumes and airway pressures than commonly used, and when administered early in the course of ARDS (eg, within the first seven days of invasive mechanical ventilation). (See

         Meta-analyses – Several meta-analyses that have incorporated CESAR and EOLIA data have reported benefit from ECMO in patients with severe ARDS [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,9-14
         </a>
         ]. Two meta-analyses reported the 60-day mortality rate was lower in patients receiving V-V ECMO (34 versus 47 percent; risk ratio [RR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.92) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,14
         </a>
         ]. Another meta-analysis reported a reduction in mortality at 90 days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.6–0.94) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         CESAR trial – The CESAR trial randomized 180 patients with acute, potentially reversible respiratory failure (mostly ARDS) to ongoing usual care or transfer to a single ECMO-capable center for consideration of ECMO after a period of optimization. The combined outcome, death or severe disability at six months, was significantly lower in the ECMO referral group than the usual care group (37 versus 53 percent; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.05-0.97) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, only 70 percent of patients in the conventional group received lung-protective ventilation, and approximately one quarter of those transferred for consideration of ECMO never received it, either because of death or improvement with conventional management. There was also a risk associated with transfer to the ECMO-capable center (ECMO support was not used to facilitate transfer), with three patients dying while awaiting transfer and two others who died during transport. Limitations of this trial included heterogeneous ventilation strategies in the conventional treatment arm, lack of universal application of ECMO in the intervention arm (by design), and a cohort that did not consist solely of patients with ARDS.

         Select patients with advanced, irreversible underlying lung disease who have acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory failure and require gas exchange support as a bridge to lung transplantation (BTT) may be candidates for V-V ECMO. Because physical deconditioning is considered by many centers to be a strong relative contraindication to lung transplant eligibility, ECMO may also be considered as a means of optimizing physical conditioning via participation in physical therapy in patients with decompensated respiratory failure before the development of significant debility [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28-30
         </a>
         ]. Factors that contribute to making the decision to use V-V ECMO as BTT are described separately. (See

        <p>
         Data to support this indication are limited [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31-37
         </a>
         ]. In an older review of 14 retrospective studies, one-year survival rates among those receiving ECMO as BTT ranged from 50 to 90 percent [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. However, most patients were mechanically ventilated and had prolonged hospitalizations (three to six weeks), which may not reflect updated practice in many centers. The successful use of ambulatory V-V ECMO with concomitant endotracheal extubation has since been reported, with one cohort study demonstrating ambulation to be a strong independent predictor of successful ECMO as BTT [
         <a href="#rid32">

        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal timing for initiation of ECLS as BTT has not been determined. We use our clinical judgement regarding timing of and criteria for initiation of ECMO as BTT. Performing ECLS too early may unnecessarily expose the patient to complications of ECLS while delaying initiation may result in the patient no longer being an appropriate transplant candidate despite ECLS support.

         We also ensure that ECMO is aligned with the patient goals of care by discussing it with the patient (if feasible) and their surrogates/caregivers. We also explain the alternatives including escalating to or continued use of invasive mechanical ventilation or palliation. (See

         There are several configurations for V-V ECMO  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef140301" href="/z/d/graphic/140301.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Choosing among them is at the discretion of the clinical team and institutional practice and may be influenced by anatomic factors, such as the presence of contractures of the extremities or vascular pathology (eg, deep venous thrombosis) and anticipated amount of extracorporeal support needed. Patency of the vessels is confirmed by ultrasound prior to insertion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most commonly, we use an initial two-site cannulation approach  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef140301" href="/z/d/graphic/140301.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ), which is a common default configuration used by many experts. For this configuration, most commonly, the drainage cannula is placed in a femoral vein and threaded up into the inferior vena cava (IVC) until the tip is 1 to 2 cm above the right atrial-IVC junction; the reinfusion cannula is placed in an internal jugular vein (usually the right) with its tip in the superior vena cava (SVC) [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, the tips of the cannulae lie in close proximity to one another but are typically far enough apart to avoid untoward recirculation between the drainage and reinfusion cannulae (see
         <a class="local">
          'Troubleshooting circuit dysfunction'
         </a>
         below). This is typically a bedside procedure that does not need fluoroscopy, with cannula placement guided by ultrasonography and positioning confirmed by chest radiography postprocedure.

         the SVC and IVC, thereby maximizing venous drainage; the reinfusion port is situated in the right atrium with reinfusion flow directed toward the tricuspid valve  (

          43
         </a>
         ]. This configuration is associated with reduced recirculation compared with a two-site configuration but is technically harder to place, often requiring fluoroscopic and/or transesophageal echocardiographic guidance for accurate placement, and the rate of extracorporeal blood flow is limited by relatively smaller drainage and reinfusion lumens sharing the diameter of the cannula despite an overall larger cannula size.

         A two-site femoral cannulation approach, where the drainage cannula is placed in one femoral vein and threaded up into IVC until the tip is 1 to 2 cm below the right atrial-IVC junction; the reinfusion cannula is placed in the contralateral femoral vein with its tip near but below the right atrial-SVC junction. Maintaining the drainage cannula tip below the reinfusion cannula tip helps minimize recirculation. We consider this approach when internal jugular venous access is technically infeasible.

         Less commonly used is a single-site venous-to-pulmonary arterial (V-PA) dual-lumen cannula (technically classified as venoarterial rather than V-V support), akin to a pulmonary artery catheter in its positioning, that has been proposed for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with concomitant severe right ventricular dysfunction  (

         For two-site V-V ECMO, typical drainage cannula sizes range from 23 to 29 French, with reinfusion cannulae ranging from 18 to 22 French. We select cannula sizes based on the patient's anticipated extracorporeal blood flow needs. For the majority of our patients with ARDS, we use a 29 French drainage cannula and a 22 French reinfusion cannula. Dual-lumen, single-site devices are also available in a range of sizes (up to 32 French).
        </p>
        <p>
         In V-V ECMO, because of the dependence of oxygenation on the rate of ECMO blood flow  (

          table 4

         ), larger-sized drainage cannulae are typically used for hypoxemic patients, especially those with higher anticipated cardiac outputs (eg, those with a larger body surface area or those in, or at risk for, vasodilatory shock or other high cardiac output states). Preliminary data suggest that larger cannulae may be associated with improved outcomes, although prospective data are needed to validate these findings [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. However, smaller cannulae may be selected based on lower anticipated needs. While some experts estimate cardiac output based on body size, actual cardiac output may differ substantially from these estimates in critically ill patients. We use judgment based on the overall clinical picture and the patient's anticipated physiologic needs but err on the side of larger drainage cannulae.

         For patients receiving V-V ECMO, there is no universally agreed upon strategy for ventilator management, with practice varying among clinicians and centers. However, experts generally agree on using a lung-protective strategy that minimizes ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) beyond what can typically be achieved with conventional mechanical ventilation alone. Data to support such a lung-protective approach is stronger for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared with those mechanically ventilated for other reasons.

         ), we typically use an "ultra-lung-protective" ventilator strategy (ie, tidal volumes and airway pressures below conventional practice in ARDS without the use of ECMO). The rationale for this strategy is based on criteria in the EOLIA trial that suggested benefit when V-V ECMO was combined with an "ultra-protective" strategy in patients with severe ARDS [

         In general, we make the specified adjustments to the tidal volume, respiratory rate, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and fraction of inspired oxygen in tandem with ECMO titration immediately after cannulation. When patients are cannulated at referring hospitals and must be transported to their destination institution, we make more gradual initial adjustments to PEEP and tidal volumes (over a few hours); this avoids alveolar derecruitment during transport while still minimizing exposure to excessively high airway pressures and tidal volumes.

         – For patients receiving ECMO as bridge to lung transplantation (BTT), we attempt to completely liberate patients from invasive mechanical ventilation (ie, endotracheal extubation) if feasible. The rationale is that this is achievable in many patients when ECMO is sufficient for gas exchange and mechanical ventilatory support is no longer needed for work of breathing. In such situations, this may facilitate the patient's participation in physical therapy in preparation for lung transplantation in order to optimize and maintain transplant candidacy. This strategy can also be occasionally performed in some patients with severe ARDS prior to decannulation from ECMO, although endotracheal extubation and early mobilization have yet to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with ARDS receiving ECMO support [

         Due to the high risk of thrombosis, patients receiving V-V ECMO should be anticoagulated in order to maintain circuit patency, provided there is no contraindication [

         (UFH; eg, 5000 units) just prior to cannula insertion and start a continuous intravenous UFH infusion postcannulation. We use a low-level anticoagulation strategy targeting an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of approximately 40 to 60 seconds, although aPTT values may vary from center to center and should reflect local practice.

        <p>
         These anticoagulation targets may be superseded by other indications that warrant higher levels of anticoagulation (eg, venous thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, thrombosis in other sites) or by the need to temporarily suspend the use of anticoagulation in the setting of bleeding or a procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
         In circumstances where anticoagulation is temporarily contraindicated, we maintain ECMO blood flow rates &gt;3 L/minute to minimize hemostasis or hemolysis (especially within the pump head) and closely monitor the patient for evidence of circuit thrombosis that might necessitate circuit exchange. When feasible, we use an anticoagulant at prophylactic doses until the risk for bleeding normalizes and therapeutic anticoagulation can be resumed. (See

         Some centers use activated clotting time, factor Xa levels, or thromboelastography as monitoring tools for optimal anticoagulation levels.

         For patients receiving ECMO for ARDS, we use similar red blood cell transfusion thresholds to those in the general critically ill population (eg, hemoglobin below 7 g/dL) [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. This practice is supported by a prospective cohort study of adults receiving ECMO support for ARDS, in which transfusion of packed red blood cells was associated with reduced mortality only when the pretransfusion hemoglobin was below 7 g/dL [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. This transfusion strategy, when combined with low anticoagulation targets and auto-transfusion of circuit blood at the time of decannulation, has been associated with minimal transfusion requirements and favorable overall survival [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. However, in transplant candidates, the transfusion threshold may be set at a lower hemoglobin level to avoid allosensitization, with a transfusion trigger based on end-organ function (as a surrogate for adequate oxygen delivery) and exercise tolerance. (See

          Fluid and electrolyte management
         </strong>
         – As for most patients with ARDS, we prefer conservative fluid management with buffered or nonbuffered crystalloids, with diuresis as needed to manage pulmonary edema. Such a strategy has been associated with a lower 90-day mortality in a large cohort of patients receiving ECMO for refractory respiratory or cardiac failure [

         – In patients receiving ECMO, higher doses of sedatives and analgesics may be necessary to achieve the same sedation targets as patients not receiving ECMO; this may be due to both sequestration of more lipophilic and protein-bound medications within the circuit and higher volumes of distribution [

         We consider prone positioning as a mechanism that facilitates additional lung protection during V-V ECMO, when needed, but we do not advocate its routine use.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prone positioning during V-V ECMO has been shown in observational trials to improve respiratory mechanics, oxygenation, and possibly mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63-65
         </a>
         ]. However, a randomized trial suggested no benefit from the routine application of prone positioning during V-V ECMO for ARDS patients in whom an "ultra-protective" invasive mechanical ventilation strategy (similar to EOLIA) was employed [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. In a multicenter randomized trial of 170 patients with severe ARDS who were receiving V-V ECMO for less than 48 hours, routine early use of prone positioning (a minimum of four sessions for at least 16 hours each) was associated with similar outcomes as supine positioning. Reported outcomes included rate of successful ECMO weaning at 60 days (44 percent each), ECMO duration (28 versus 32 days), intensive care unit length of stay, and 90-day mortality (51 versus 48 percent). Adverse events were similar among the groups. Cardiac arrest was greater in the supine group, but event rates were low, decreasing confidence in the validity of this outcome. Limitations that may have impacted the results include the large proportion of patients who had received proning before enrollment (&gt;90 percent), the high proportion of COVID-19 ARDS patients (94 percent), and a lack of blinding. Further trials are needed to determine the impact of prone positioning, if any, during V-V ECMO in non-COVID-associated ARDS.

          Recirculation
         </strong>
         – Recirculation is a phenomenon in which reinfused oxygenated blood is drawn back into the circuit without passing through the systemic circulation, thereby decreasing the contribution of ECMO to systemic oxygenation [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69
         </a>
         ]. This phenomenon is more commonly and more strongly associated with two-site configurations  (

         ).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Recirculation is assessed by monitoring the oxygen saturation of blood entering the membrane (SpreO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ). There is typically always some degree of recirculation, and this only warrants intervention if it is having a significant impact on systemic oxygenation (eg, inadequate systemic oxygenation and SpreO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Typically, it is the result of drainage and reinfusion cannulae being too close to each other, which can be assessed by chest radiography, and is usually managed by retracting one of the cannulae (typically the drainage cannula) by 1 to 2 cm or more if appropriate. Prior to actual retraction of the cannula, gently pulling back on the cannula while it is still sutured to the skin may mimic actual retraction and offer a sense of whether recirculation would improve (as evidenced by a decrease in SpreO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         and an improvement in systemic oxygenation). Other causes of recirculation include high blood flow rates with excess drainage pressure and increases in intrathoracic pressures.

         – Entrainment of air may occur anywhere along the portion of the circuit under negative pressure (prepump) where there is loss of circuit integrity or through other venous access points (peripheral or central intravenous lines) that are left open or damaged. A less common mechanism through which gas may enter the circuit is known as cavitation, which occurs when a high negative pressure within the drainage cannula or tubing draws a large amount of gas out of solution, or in the setting of a high sweep gas flow rate and a low blood flow rate. In general, cavitation can be minimized by avoiding extremes in negative pressure on the venous side of the circuit.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Once entrained, air may pass into the membrane lung, which serves as a gas trap. However, large amounts of air may, on occasion, pass through the membrane lung and be delivered to the patient, resulting in air embolism.

         Bleeding is a common complication during ECMO support, the rates of which are site-specific and can be life-threatening [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,8,50,71
         </a>
         ]. Cannula site and surgical site bleeding are as high as 8 percent while gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage are less common.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bleeding is most often in the setting of the administration of continuous anticoagulation and is more often driven by circuit-related or patient-driven platelet dysfunction (eg, acquired von Willebrand syndrome [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]) or thrombocytopenia. Conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and vessel or cardiac perforation may also contribute to bleeding rates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meticulous surgical technique, maintaining platelet counts &gt;20,000/microL (or &gt;50,000/microL for procedures), and targeting a conservative activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT; eg, approximately 40 to 60 seconds) reduce the incidence of bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most instances of bleeding are minor and may resolve with conservative management (eg, additional suture, manual pressure). For most major bleeding events (eg, bleeding requiring more than two units of packed red blood cells, hemodynamic instability, life-threatening organ involvement), we temporarily reduce or hold anticoagulation for a few hours (or longer, as needed) until the bleeding has stopped. Bleeding from surgical wounds or into accessible body cavities may warrant prompt surgical exploration with use of electrocautery as needed to achieve hemostasis. Under rare circumstances, when the risk of death from bleeding is so high that it outweighs the risk of circuit thrombosis, plasminogen inhibitors (eg, aminocaproic or

         Thrombus formation with or without embolization is a known complication of ECMO that is more likely to occur when anticoagulation is not being administered, although thrombosis may still occur in the presence of systemic anticoagulation. Maintaining targeted aPTT and vigilant observation of the circuit for signs of clot formation, with increases in anticoagulation targets as tolerated, help minimize thromboembolism in most patients.

         Circuit thrombosis – We routinely observe the circuit for signs of clot formation, including routine visual inspection of all cannulae, tubing, and connectors, and monitoring the pressure gradient across the membrane lung. An increase in the pressure gradient across the membrane lung (eg, &gt;60 mmHg), when normalized for blood flow rate, raises suspicion for substantial clot within the membrane. Large or mobile clots require immediate circuit or component exchange. (See

         Once the underlying disease process has sufficiently improved and it is assessed that the patient is adequately supported with conventional mechanical ventilation, we wean V-V ECMO. Criteria include improved lung compliance (eg, tidal volume 6 mL/kg predicted body weight [PBW] with plateau airway pressure ≤30 cm H

         ; eg, 0.3 to 0.5] without major changes in cardiac output).
        </p>
        <p>
         In most patients, ECMO weaning involves transitioning to ongoing invasive mechanical ventilation. This may involve increases in the FiO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         , tidal volume, or respiratory rate to maintain acceptable oxygenation and ventilation in parallel with decreasing support from the extracorporeal device. Less commonly, patients may have been endotracheally extubated while receiving ECMO support and may be transitioned to spontaneous breathing with or without ventilatory assistance.

          Terminology
         </strong>
         – Venovenous (V-V) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of extracorporeal life support. V-V ECMO is mostly used for temporary support of patients with acute respiratory failure. The term V-V refers to the configuration of the circuit, which is comprised of a drainage cannula that removes blood from a large central
         <strong>
          vein
         </strong>
         (
         <strong>
          V
         </strong>
         -V). This blood is oxygenated extracorporeally and reinfused into the same or a different
         <strong>
          vein

         (V-

          Patient selection

         – Candidates for V-V ECMO include patients who have severe, acute, and potentially reversible hypoxemic or mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, despite optimization of conventional management (eg, lung-protective ventilation [≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight and plateau airway pressure 30 cm H
         <sub>
          2

         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O) or patients who demonstrate intolerance of lung-protective ventilation, such as refractory hypoxemia or severe acidemia. (See

Placement is performed by an expert in cannulation (eg, surgeon or cardiac interventionalist) under image-guidance, and a chest radiograph is performed after insertion to check for appropriate placement.

          Mechanical ventilation settings
         </strong>
         – In parallel with titration of ECMO settings, we begin to adjust mechanical ventilation settings. For most patients, we suggest an "ultra-lung-protective" ventilator strategy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140695" href="/z/d/graphic/140695.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ) rather than the typical low-volume, low-pressure strategy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). This approach is based upon the ventilatory strategy used in one of the major ECMO ARDS trials that we also apply to non-ARDS patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Invasive mechanical ventilation'

         <strong>
          Anticoagulation
         </strong>
         – Patients receiving V-V ECMO require anticoagulation due to the high risk of systemic and circuit thrombosis. The agent used, target level of anticoagulation, and monitoring vary. Anticoagulation is typically performed using
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">
          unfractionated heparin
         </a>
         (UFH). We typically administer an initial bolus of UFH (eg, 5000 units) just prior to cannula insertion and start a continuous intravenous UFH infusion postcannulation. We suggest using a low-level anticoagulation strategy targeting an activated partial thromboplastin time of approximately 40 to 60 seconds (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). (See

         <strong>
          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – To ensure a properly functioning circuit and detect complications early, we examine patients daily and periodically throughout the day. We obtain daily complete blood count and chemistries, systemic ABG, coagulation studies, and chest radiography. If hemolysis is suspected, we obtain plasma-free hemoglobin, urinalysis, and peripheral smear. ECMO circuits are continuously monitored to ensure all components are functioning properly using pre- and post-membrane line pressures, drainage line pressure, cannula position, and signs of infection or thrombus. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Daily assessment and circuit monitoring'

         <strong>
          Complications
         </strong>
         – Common complications are bleeding, thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, hemolysis, vascular injury, intracranial bleeding or stroke, and infections. These and other complications are listed in the table  (

         <strong>
          Weaning
         </strong>
         – We consider weaning when patients have improved lung compliance (tidal volume 6 mL/kg predicted body weight with plateau airway pressure ≤30 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O), improving radiograph appearance, and adequate oxygenation at low fraction of inspired oxygen. Weaning in the majority of patients involves turning off the sweep gas flow (an "off-sweep challenge") for 30 minutes and obtaining a systemic ABG. If the patient meets select criteria, we decannulate the patient (See
         <a class="local">
          'Weaning'

         above.)
