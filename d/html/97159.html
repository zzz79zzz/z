Most reference laboratories establish the lower pediatric limit of normal serum potassium between 3 and 3.5 mEq/L. However, symptoms are unlikely to occur in most healthy children until serum potassium is below 3 mEq/L.</p><p>The etiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of pediatric hypokalemia are reviewed here. Hypokalemia in adults is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2297.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2341.html" rel="external">"Causes of hypokalemia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2305.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult patient with hypokalemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7909922"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypokalemia is relatively common among hospitalized pediatric patients, especially those who are critically ill [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. In one study of 667 children cared for in a single-center pediatric intensive care unit in the United States during the calendar year 2006, 40 percent of the patients had a serum potassium level below 3.5 mEq/L [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This included patients with severe hypokalemia, defined as potassium level less than 2.5 mEq/L (4 percent); moderate hypokalemia, defined as potassium level 2.5 to less than 3 mEq/L (12 percent); and mild hypokalemia, defined as potassium level from 3 to less than 3.5 mEq/L (24 percent). Hypokalemia was associated with diagnoses of cardiac disease, kidney failure, or shock [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>In resource-limited countries, severe hypokalemia (potassium level &lt;2.5 mEq/L) is often observed in children with diarrhea and severe acute malnutrition and is associated with an increased risk of mortality [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1662454214"><span class="h1">POTASSIUM BALANCE AND LEVELS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7910133"><span class="h2">Definition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Potassium is primarily an intracellular cation with cells containing approximately 98 percent of total body potassium. Hypokalemia is defined as serum level below the normal value, which is usually defined as 3.5 mEq/L, although the threshold varies with age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86501" href="/d/graphic/86501.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Degrees of hypokalemia are defined as following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe hypokalemia – Potassium level less than 2.5 mEq/L</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moderate hypokalemia – Potassium level between 2.5 and 3 mEq/L</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mild hypokalemia – Potassium level between 3 and 3.5 mEq/L</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7910153"><span class="h2">Homeostatic mechanisms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Homeostatic mechanisms regulate potassium balance in order to maintain high intracellular levels required for cellular functions (metabolism and growth), and low extracellular concentration to preserve the steep concentration gradient across the cell membrane needed for nerve excitation and muscle contraction. In children, positive potassium balance is needed for growth, whereas in adults, homeostasis is directed towards a zero potassium balance.</p><p>After a bolus of potassium intake, normal physiologic processes preserve the intra- and extracellular balance via intracellular potassium movement, which is regulated by cell membrane Na-K-ATPase (mediated by insulin, and alpha- and beta-2 adrenergic agonists), and urinary potassium excretion (primarily mediated by aldosterone). Although normal serum and plasma potassium concentrations in children and adolescents are similar to levels in adults, infants have a higher normal range of potassium because of their reduced urinary potassium excretion, which is caused by their relatively increased aldosterone insensitivity and decreased glomerular filtration rate  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86501" href="/d/graphic/86501.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2377.html" rel="external">"Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults", section on 'Brief review of potassium physiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7910171"><span class="h2">Pathogenesis of hypokalemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypokalemia in children is caused by derangements of the homeostatic mechanisms that normally regulate potassium balance, which are the same as those that occur in adults. Understanding the underlying physiology is helpful in the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of children with hypokalemia.</p><p>Pediatric hypokalemia is due to one or a combination of the following mechanisms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased potassium intake</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased intracellular movement of potassium</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive loss of potassium via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidney, or skin</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1662454255"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the following sections, the causes of pediatric hypokalemia are classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic process  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98036" href="/d/graphic/98036.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1662454269"><span class="h2">Decreased intake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Decreased intake alone is unlikely to cause hypokalemia in healthy children. However, prolonged decreased intake (eg, malnutrition or anorexia) in combination with increased potassium losses via the kidney or gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to significant potassium depletion.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1662454283"><span class="h2">Increased intracellular uptake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As noted above, the normal distribution of potassium between cells and the extracellular fluid is primarily maintained by the Na-K-ATPase pump in the cell membrane. Increased activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump and/or alterations in other potassium transport pathways can result in transient hypokalemia due to increased potassium entry into cells from the extracellular space.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alkalosis</strong> – Either respiratory or metabolic alkalosis can be associated with hypokalemia. In this setting, intracellular potassium movement is promoted to maintain electroneutrality as hydrogen ions exit the cell in response to the increase in extracellular pH. In general, serum potassium concentration falls by less than 0.4 mEq/L for every 0.1 unit rise in pH.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In children with metabolic alkalosis, there is also an increased loss of urinary potassium. This is due to a rise in plasma bicarbonate concentration, resulting in a filtered bicarbonate load above its reabsorptive threshold, which leads to increased distal delivery of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12795" href="/d/drug information/12795.html" rel="external">sodium bicarbonate</a>. At the distal tubule, sodium is exchanged for potassium, causing the increased loss in urinary potassium. (See <a class="local">'Increased distal delivery of sodium and water'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Increased insulin activity</strong> – Insulin promotes intracellular potassium movement by increasing the activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump and is used therapeutically to treat severe hyperkalemia [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In particular, insulin administration in children with diabetic ketoacidosis results in a fall in serum potassium due to the increased insulin-mediated intracellular movement of potassium. One small study also reported that insulin increased renal potassium excretion [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5808.html" rel="external">"Diabetic ketoacidosis in children: Treatment and complications", section on 'Serum potassium'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hypokalemia due to insulin-mediated potassium transcellular movement can also be seen in the refeeding syndrome after prolonged starvation or in children and adolescents with eating disorders [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15778.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: The refeeding syndrome", section on 'Pathogenesis and clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2874.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children younger than two years in resource-abundant settings: Management", section on 'Prevention of nutritional recovery syndrome'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elevated beta-adrenergic activity</strong> – Nonselective (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13394" href="/d/drug information/13394.html" rel="external">isoproterenol</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13272" href="/d/drug information/13272.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>) and selective (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13290" href="/d/drug information/13290.html" rel="external">albuterol</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12826" href="/d/drug information/12826.html" rel="external">terbutaline</a>) beta-adrenergic agents promote intracellular movement of potassium by increasing Na-K-ATPase pump activity. The use of these agents in children can decrease serum potassium levels and, in some cases, result in hypokalemia [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5748.html" rel="external">"Acute asthma exacerbations in children younger than 12 years: Inpatient management", section on 'Laboratory studies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypokalemic periodic paralysis</strong> – Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a rare neuromuscular condition that presents with sudden episodes of severe muscle weakness associated with hypokalemia. In these patients, the potassium level can drop rapidly to below 2 mEq/L. Symptoms may be triggered by events associated with increased adrenergic tone, such as exercise, stress, and high-carbohydrate meals.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is due to defects in muscle calcium and sodium channels. Most cases are hereditary and are primarily associated with a mutation in the gene that codes for the alpha-1 subunit of the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel in skeletal muscle. These patients typically present in late childhood or adolescence. Acquired cases have been reported in patients with hyperthyroidism (referred to as thyrotoxic periodic paralysis) and typically present in older patients between 20 and 30 years of age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5150.html" rel="external">"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5154.html" rel="external">"Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other drugs (besides beta-adrenergic agonists)</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Heavy metals – Barium toxicity is a rare cause of hypokalemia, caused by blockade of potassium channels limiting their efflux from cells. Barium salts are found in fireworks and rodent toxins [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Barium sulfate is the formulation used in radiographic procedures and is not absorbed from the gut. Cesium has been reported as a rare cause of hypokalemia in adults due to its use as an alternative therapy for cancer but has not been reported in children [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Antipsychotic drugs – Hypokalemia has been reported in association with the use of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12770" href="/d/drug information/12770.html" rel="external">risperidone</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="89427" href="/d/drug information/89427.html" rel="external">quetiapine</a> in adults. Given the increasing use of this medication in children and adolescents, a high index of suspicion should be present in children with hypokalemia or cardiac arrhythmias who are prescribed these medications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2341.html" rel="external">"Causes of hypokalemia in adults", section on 'Antipsychotic drugs'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13147" href="/d/drug information/13147.html" rel="external">Chloroquine</a> intoxication is an uncommon cause of severe hypokalemia in children due to intracellular movement of potassium [<a href="#rid13">13-16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16103510"><span class="h2">Gastrointestinal losses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>GI losses are the most common cause of hypokalemia in children. In particular, diarrheal potassium content (20 to 50 mEq/L) is relatively high compared with other body fluids [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In resource-limited countries, acute diarrhea with hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of death [<a href="#rid4">4,18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13956.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited settings", section on 'Fluid and electrolytes'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, upper GI losses (eg, vomiting, nasogastric drainage) are initially minimal as the potassium content is relatively low (5 to 10 mEq/L). However, the loss of gastric secretions results in metabolic alkalosis that leads to increased urinary potassium losses. As noted above, metabolic alkalosis leads to increased distal delivery of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12795" href="/d/drug information/12795.html" rel="external">sodium bicarbonate</a>, which in combination with hypovolemia-induced hyperaldosteronism results in enhanced potassium excretion as potassium is exchanged for sodium. (See <a class="local">'Increased distal delivery of sodium and water'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1662454342"><span class="h2">Increased urinary losses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Urinary potassium excretion is primarily due to secretion of potassium in the distal nephron by the principal cells in the connecting tubule and cortical collecting tubule. In the distal tubule, sodium is reabsorbed under the influence of mineralocorticoids (primarily aldosterone) and potassium is exchanged to preserve electroneutrality. Increased urinary potassium loss contributing to hypokalemia is typically due to one or both of the following mechanisms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased delivery of sodium and water to the distal nephron</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased mineralocorticoid activity</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1662454349"><span class="h3">Increased distal delivery of sodium and water</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children, the following conditions are associated with urinary potassium losses leading to lower serum potassium as a result of increased distal delivery of sodium.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diuretics</strong> – Diuretic therapy (loop and thiazide diuretics) impairs sodium reabsorption in more proximal nephron segments leading to distal delivery of sodium. In addition, volume depletion leads to increased aldosterone activity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonreabsorbable ions</strong> – Nonreabsorbable anions are accompanied by sodium, resulting in distal delivery of sodium, which is exchanged with potassium. Pediatric settings in which the presence of nonreabsorbable anions results in increased distal delivery of sodium include excess filtered bicarbonate in patients with excessive vomiting or with proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis (RTA), beta-hydroxybutyrate in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, and hippurate following toluene abuse (glue sniffing). (See <a class="local">'Gastrointestinal losses'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1792.html" rel="external">"Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis", section on 'Serum potassium'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6502.html" rel="external">"Inhalant misuse in children and adolescents", section on 'Hypokalemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Osmotic diuresis</strong> – Osmotic diuresis can also result in increased distal delivery of sodium, resulting in hypokalemia. This is most commonly seen in children with diabetic ketoacidosis who have glucose osmotic diuresis due to glycosuria because the filtered load exceeds the proximal tubular reabsorptive capacity. Administration of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12570" href="/d/drug information/12570.html" rel="external">mannitol</a> is a less frequent cause of hypokalemia due to osmotic diuresis. Hypovolemia may also result from osmotic diuresis if there is inadequate fluid replacement, which leads to increased aldosterone activity and enhanced distal potassium secretion. (See <a class="local">'Increased mineralocorticoid activity'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genetic tubular disorders</strong> – Bartter and Gitelman syndromes are autosomal recessive diseases that are caused by mutations in genes encoding tubular transport proteins involved in sodium reabsorption. In these patients, sodium absorption is disrupted leading to increased distal delivery of sodium, resulting in metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia, similarly to findings seen in patients who receive chronic diuretic therapy. In addition, the volume depletion leads to increased levels of renin and aldosterone, which further enhances urinary potassium losses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2344.html" rel="external">"Inherited hypokalemic salt-losing tubulopathies: Pathophysiology and overview of clinical manifestations"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tubular injury</strong> – Tubular injury due to tubulointerstitial diseases or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13162" href="/d/drug information/13162.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> results in decreased sodium reabsorption in more proximal nephron segments, leading to distal delivery of sodium, where potassium is exchanged for sodium. In one small case series of pediatric patients, tubulopathy due to cisplatin, which resulted in reduced potassium, persisted for months to years following completion of chemotherapy [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7231.html" rel="external">"Cisplatin nephrotoxicity", section on 'Salt wasting'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1662454356"><span class="h3">Renal tubular acidosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In distal (type 1) RTA, increased urinary potassium loss is due to enhanced potassium secretion needed to maintain electroneutrality because of the impaired distal acidification (ie, defective secretion of protons)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58428" href="/d/graphic/58428.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

In many instances, the diagnosis is made incidentally when plasma or serum electrolytes are obtained during an evaluation for another condition, especially in children with levels between 3 and 3.5 mEq/L, whereas levels below 3 mEq/L are more often associated with clinical signs and symptoms.</p><p>It is important to note that potassium levels may vary by measurement technique. Normal values are typically based on measurements from central hospital automated blood biochemistry autoanalyzers. In intensive care unit and emergency department settings, there is increasing utilization of point-of-care testing blood chemistry analyzers that allow rapid and accurate assessment of potassium levels from whole blood samples, with results that are similar to those found with blood gas analyzers [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].

Settings in which there is a transcellular movement of potassium into the cell can lead to the false assumption of total body potassium depletion. This may lead to unnecessary potassium repletion rather than correcting the underlying cause of increased intracellular potassium uptake (eg, alkalosis or administration of insulin).

Magnesium can be lost at the same time as potassium with gastrointestinal (GI) losses or with diuretic use. Hypomagnesemia can also promote renal potassium wasting directly in the distal tubule and can also prevent reabsorption of filtered potassium at the loop of Henle [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Magnesium supplementation may need to be considered in this setting, especially with difficulty correcting hypokalemia.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topic (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/87109.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Hypokalemia (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H74508"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition</strong> – Hypokalemia is defined as a serum or plasma potassium level below the normal value, which is usually defined as 3.5 mEq/L. Normal serum potassium concentrations in children and adolescents are similar to levels in adults. However, infants have a higher normal range of potassium because of their reduced urinary potassium excretion, caused by their relatively increased aldosterone insensitivity and decreased glomerular filtration rate  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86501" href="/d/graphic/86501.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Causes</strong> – Pediatric hypokalemia is caused by derangements of the normal hemostatic mechanisms that regulate potassium balance and include the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98036" href="/d/graphic/98036.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Decreased dietary potassium intake is unlikely to cause hypokalemia in healthy children. However, prolonged decreased intake can contribute to potassium depletion caused by other disorders.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intracellular potassium uptake results in transient hypokalemia. Increased potassium entry into the cells is promoted by the following conditions: alkalosis, increased insulin activity (eg, exogenous insulin administration) and beta-adrenergic activity (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13290" href="/d/drug information/13290.html" rel="external">albuterol</a> administration), and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. (See <a class="local">'Increased intracellular uptake'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Increased gastrointestinal (GI) loss is the most common cause of pediatric hypokalemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Increased urinary losses is usually due to either increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron in exchange for potassium (eg, diuretic therapy, genetic tubular disorders [Bartter and Gitelman syndromes], and osmotic diuresis) or increased mineralocorticoid activity (eg, hyperaldosteronism due to hypovolemia). (See <a class="local">'Increased urinary losses'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> – Clinical manifestations vary depending on the severity and acuity of hypokalemia. Symptoms generally do not become manifest until the serum potassium is below 3 mEq/L, unless there is a rapid significant fall in serum potassium. Clinical findings include muscle weakness and paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73888" href="/d/graphic/73888.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a>), and polyuria due to impaired urinary concentration. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of hypokalemia is made by the detection of a serum or plasma potassium level that is below the normal range of 3.5 mEq/L. In many instances, the diagnosis is made incidentally when serum or plasma electrolytes are obtained during an evaluation for another condition, especially in children with levels between 3 and 3.5 mEq/L, whereas levels below 3 mEq/L are more often associated with clinical signs and symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – After acute management of symptomatic severe hypokalemia, further evaluation focuses on determining the etiology as subsequent care is based on the underlying cause of hypokalemia. The assessment includes a focused history and physical examination. In most cases, the history is sufficient to determine the underlying cause. However, additional laboratory testing may be needed in patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef98041" href="/d/graphic/98041.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Evaluation to determine underlying etiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – The acuity and degree of the hypokalemia influence the clinical approach to therapy. The goals of therapy are to prevent or treat life-threatening complications (arrhythmias, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, and diaphragmatic weakness) associated with severe hypokalemia, replace the potassium deficit, and correct the underlying cause. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Severe or symptomatic</strong> – Patients with severe or symptomatic hypokalemia (arrhythmias, marked muscle weakness, or paralysis) require urgent potassium supplementation. For these patients, we recommend intravenous (IV) administration of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13037" href="/d/drug information/13037.html" rel="external">potassium chloride</a>, particularly in those who are unable to take oral medication (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). In this setting, an infusion with a potassium concentration of no more than 40 mEq/L is given at a rate <strong>not</strong> to exceed 0.5 to 1 mEq/kg of body weight per hour. The goal is to raise the potassium level by 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/L. These patients require continuous ECG monitoring to detect changes due to hypokalemia and also possibly rebound hyperkalemia during replacement therapy. (See <a class="local">'Determining need and timing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Others</strong> – In asymptomatic patients, the need for potassium supplementation is based on the underlying cause and severity of hypokalemia. If potassium supplementation is needed, we recommend that oral potassium therapy be given (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). The formulation of potassium is also dependent on the underlying condition. (See <a class="local">'Formulation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Determining need and timing'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Cummings BM, Macklin EA, Yager PH, et al.
