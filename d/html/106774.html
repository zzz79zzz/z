This gives rise to a biologically aggressive malignancy, with heightened sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy; as a result, these patients may achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. However, concurrent administration of agents that block activation of these pathways enhances the cancer's chemosensitivity, significantly increasing the pCR rate. Clinical trial results from the last several years suggest that new approaches, including newer HER2-targeted agents and combinations of HER2-targeted therapies, more effectively block HER2-activated signaling, enhancing the susceptibility of HER2-positive breast cancers and expanding options for neoadjuvant therapy based on the patient's risk factors and overall medical condition.</p><p>This topic will review issues pertaining specifically to administration of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Where clinical guidance is provided in this topic, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual is used  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848" href="/z/d/graphic/110848.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); however, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/800.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>General principles of NACT, including patient selection for neoadjuvant therapy, assessment of response to therapy, and surgical management after NACT, are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14225.html" rel="external">"General principles of neoadjuvant management of breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Adjuvant treatment for patients with HER2-positive disease, including those who received neoadjuvant treatment, is also discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer", section on 'Patients who were treated with neoadjuvant therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3102275113"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is appropriate for many patients with locally advanced breast cancer, regardless of subtype, because response to treatment may allow both less extensive surgery and improved surgical outcomes. We generally define locally advanced as clinical stage III cancers as well as the subset of clinical IIB cancers with T3 disease. In addition, patients with earlier-stage, HER2-positive cancers (clinical stage I or II) may also be candidates for neoadjuvant therapy. Our approach to HER2 testing and interpretation of the results is summarized in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131428" href="/z/d/graphic/131428.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), and is consistent with American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Patients with stage I or II HER2-positive cancers may also be appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy if one or more of the following criteria apply:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient desires breast-conserving surgery (BCS) but is not a candidate for BCS or is likely to have a suboptimal cosmetic outcome with BCS due to tumor location or size relative to the size of the patient's breast, and may be a better candidate if neoadjuvant therapy decreases the extent of the cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient has limited axillary nodal involvement by clinical assessment (cN1), for which axillary lymph node dissection would be standard surgical management, but could be a candidate for sentinel lymph node biopsy alone if converted to clinically node-negative (ycN0) with neoadjuvant therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Surgery must be postponed awaiting consultation with plastic surgery regarding breast reconstruction, results of genetic testing or resolution of an intercurrent illness, including pregnancy, and the patient and treating clinicians do not wish to delay initiation of treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postoperative treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="88427" href="/z/d/drug information/88427.html" rel="external">ado-trastuzumab emtansine</a> (T-DM1) would be considered if the patient were found to have residual invasive disease in the breast or axillary nodes following NACT with single or dual HER2-targeted therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer", section on 'Patients who were treated with neoadjuvant therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer", section on 'T-DM1'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>These considerations are particularly suited to patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, given the high rates of both clinical and pathologic response seen with neoadjuvant therapy, particularly if treatment includes a HER2-directed agent [<a href="#rid2">2,4,5</a>].</p><p>Adjuvant chemotherapy with HER2-targeted therapy is the standard of care for almost all patients with HER2-posiitve breast cancer who undergo surgery first; treatment recommendations for these patients are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer", section on 'Treatment overview'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2417353637"><span class="h1">OUTCOME MEASURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to outcome measures such as recurrence rate, disease-free survival, and overall survival (OS), which are used to assess treatment efficacy in the adjuvant setting, pathologic response, especially the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, is a useful measure of treatment efficacy in comparing regimens among patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy. While some of the clinical trials discussed below used different definitions of pCR, including the absence of residual invasive disease in the breast regardless of the status of the axillary nodes (ypT0/is Nany), the most widely accepted definition of pCR requires the absence of residual invasive disease in the breast and the absence of cancer in any sampled axillary nodes (ypT0/is ypN0). Although a surrogate other outcome measure, achievement of pCR is associated with highly significant improved rates of event-free survival (EFS) and OS in patients with HER2-positive disease [<a href="#rid1">1,6,7</a>].</p><p>In a 2016 meta-analysis of 36 trials enrolling nearly 5800 patients with HER2-positive disease who received neoadjuvant therapy, those who achieved a pCR (ypT0/is N0) had superior EFS and OS compared with those who did not (hazard ratio [HR] EFS 0.37, 95% CI 0.32-0.43; HR OS 0.34, 95% CI 0.26-0.42) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The association was even stronger in the hormone receptor-negative (HR-negative) subgroup (HR EFS 0.29, 95% CI 0.24-0.36). A subsequent meta-analysis confirmed improved EFS and OS in all subsets of HER2-positive patients who experienced a pCR, but demonstrated that pretreatment clinical stage remains prognostic even among pCRs, with baseline T3 to 4 and node-positive patients having higher event and mortality rates than baseline T1 to 2 or node-negative patients [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Among patients who failed to achieve pCR, pretreatment T stage, nodal status, and hormone receptor (HR) status were all prognostic for EFS and OS, with HR-negative patients having poorer outcomes than HR-positive patients. The same authors assessed the association between trial-level improvements in pCR rates and EFS/OS and found a weak correlation between these outcomes, suggesting that while achievement of pCR (or not) may be a valid prognostic variable for an individual patient, and may be useful in terms of selecting treatment in the adjuvant setting, changes in pCR rates may not be a useful surrogate for longer-term outcomes when comparing neoadjuvant regimens [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Tumor prognostic features'</a> below.)</p><p>Among patients with HER2-positive cancers who do not achieve a pCR with neoadjuvant therapy, those with minimal residual invasive disease at surgery have a better prognosis than those with more extensive residual disease. Though not yet validated in prospective clinical trials, retrospective analyses using the Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) scoring system, which stratifies patients by the extent of residual invasive disease in the breast and axillary nodes, have shown it to be predictive of relapse-free survival at 5 and 10 years in patients with HER2-positive cancers and that patients with minimal residual disease (RCB class I) have improved outcomes compared with the overall group of non-pCRs [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2915041628"><span class="h1">COMPONENTS OF THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Standard neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive disease consists of chemotherapy and HER2-directed therapy, specifically <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10101" href="/z/d/drug information/10101.html" rel="external">trastuzumab</a>, with or without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="85639" href="/z/d/drug information/85639.html" rel="external">pertuzumab</a> (see <a class="local">'Chemotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Biologic therapy'</a> below). The role of pertuzumab is discussed in further detail below. (See <a class="local">'Addition of pertuzumab'</a> below.)</p><p>While all systemic therapy given for non-metastatic invasive breast cancer is intended to reduce the risk of distant recurrence, the rationale for administering it in the neoadjuvant setting is to shrink the breast tumor prior to surgery, potentially allowing for less extensive surgery and improved cosmetic outcomes, to downstage a clinically positive axilla and to assess response to treatment, which may influence adjuvant therapy recommendations [<a href="#rid12">12-16</a>]. As noted above, HER2-positive disease (along with triple-negative disease) is associated with a high likelihood of both clinical and pathologic response. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H487979734"><span class="h2">Chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with HER2-positive cancers in whom neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is indicated, very few large, randomized studies have compared different NACT regimens, particularly in regards their impact on EFS or overall survival (OS). As a result, a number of NACT regimens may be considered appropriate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4247129000"><span class="h3">Standard regimens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While any of the neoadjuvant regimens described below can be considered as standard options for HER2-positive breast cancer, our preferred regimens are <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a> every three weeks for six cycles with concurrent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10101" href="/z/d/drug information/10101.html" rel="external">trastuzumab</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="85639" href="/z/d/drug information/85639.html" rel="external">pertuzumab</a> (TCHP) or weekly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> with carboplatin, administered either every three weeks or weekly, with concurrent trastuzumab and pertuzumab (wPCbHP), given their demonstrated efficacy and avoidance of the risks and toxicities associated with anthracyclines.

They may also have long-term prognostic significance, and may someday help to direct therapy. At the present time, however, outside of a clinical trial, we do not recommend altering a HER2-positive patient's planned neoadjuvant regimen based on these features.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hormone receptor status</strong> – In essentially all studies to date of neoadjuvant treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer, pCR rates are higher in HR-negative than in HR-positive cancers. Despite the lower pCR rates, patients with HR-positive/HER2-positive cancers who achieve a pCR still experience improved event-free survival (EFS) relative to those who do not [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Moreover, data from adjuvant trials in HER2-positive disease demonstrate that HR-positive patients receive the same improvement in disease-free survival with the addition of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10101" href="/z/d/drug information/10101.html" rel="external">trastuzumab</a> as those with HR-negative cancers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One hypothesis regarding the lower pCR rates seen in patients with HR-positive/HER2-positive cancers is that binding of estrogen to cytoplasmic estrogen receptors activates signaling pathways that bypass HER2 blockade, which has been referred to as "cross-talk." To test this hypothesis, the NSABP B-52 trial assessed the impact of the addition of estrogen deprivation with an aromatase inhibitor (plus ovarian suppression in premenopausal women) on pCR rates achieved with six cycles of TCHP in HR-positive/HER2-positive cancers. Among 311 patients, pCR rates were similar with (46 percent) or without (41 percent) estrogen deprivation, and did not differ between pre- and postmenopausal women [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. The addition of estrogen deprivation also did not affect the toxicity of the neoadjuvant regimen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Thus, while the results of this study do not support the routine administration of antiestrogen therapy during neoadjuvant therapy for HR-positive/HER2-positive breast cancer, it also showed no contraindication to its use. Administration of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs to suppress ovarian function during chemotherapy to preserve ovarian function and fertility is discussed elsewhere.

Data suggest that this may explain the lower pCR rates seen in HR-positive/HER2-positive cancers better than the "cross-talk" hypothesis mentioned above. For example, among all HER2-positive patients treated on CALGB 40601, only 31 percent displayed a HER2-enriched gene expression pattern, while 60 percent typed as luminal A or luminal B, 5 percent as basal-like, and 3 percent as normal-like or claudin-low [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. Among HR-positive cancers, the percentage of HER2-enriched tumors was only 17 percent, with the remaining 83 percent being luminal subtypes.

Sixty-seven percent of their patients were classified as HER2-enriched (85 percent of their HR-negative patients and 49 percent of their HR-positive patients); among these, the pCR rate was 41 percent. By contrast, the pCR rate in their non-HER2-enriched patients, most of whom were classified as luminal A or B, was only 10 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These results suggest that patients with HER2-posiitve cancers that do not display a HER2-enriched gene expression pattern are less likely to achieve pCR with neoadjuvant HER2-targeted therapy. Despite this, data from the N9831 adjuvant trial suggest that patients with luminal subtype HER2-positive cancers (21 percent of the study population) receive the same benefit in terms of improvement in disease-free survival from the addition of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10101" href="/z/d/drug information/10101.html" rel="external">trastuzumab</a> to adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.52) as did patients with HER2-enriched tumors (HR 0.68); only the small subset (7 percent) of patients with basal-like cancers did not appear to benefit from the addition of trastuzumab [<a href="#rid73">73</a>].
