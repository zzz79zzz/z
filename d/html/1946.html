         Although cancer screening is widely recommended for the general population, these recommendations are not necessarily applicable to patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who are receiving maintenance dialysis. Unfortunately, the high mortality among patients on dialysis from causes other than malignancy means that cancer screening is often not appropriate for such patients. This topic will review cancer screening among patients with ESKD who are receiving maintenance dialysis.

         The overall incidence of cancer in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is reportedly higher than that in the general population [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-8

         ]. A systematic review of 22 cohort studies including 1,443,684 patients on dialysis found a pooled standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for overall cancer of 1.40 (95% CI 1.36-1.45) when compared with the general population [

         The risk of myeloma (SIR 4.15) was higher among patients on dialysis, whereas the risks of leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma were not significantly different between patients on dialysis and those in the general population.

         The magnitude of the excess risk of cancer associated with dialysis varied substantially between studies. This heterogeneity possibly reflects true differences between countries but could also be due to residual confounding by unmeasured characteristics that affected some studies more than others.

         Malignancy is more common among patients on hemodialysis than among those on peritoneal dialysis [

         ], approximately three times more common in older patients (over 65 years old) compared with younger patients, and less common in patients with diabetes, probably due to increased mortality from cardiovascular disease and other causes. Patients with a history of cancer prior to initiating dialysis have a relatively high risk (approximately 14 percent) of cancer recurrence or developing a new malignancy after dialysis initiation [

         Placement on the waiting list for kidney transplantation should be preceded by investigations to rule out serious comorbidities, including active malignancy. Once patients on dialysis are active on the waiting list, international guidelines recommend routine screening for common cancers (such as colorectal, breast, cervical, and prostate cancer) as per the general population [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The rationale for screening in this situation is to maximize the likelihood of a successful outcome following transplantation rather than to reduce the risk of death from cancer per se. Thus, unlike the situation in the general population, a detailed discussion of patient preferences and the benefits and harms of screening is not generally required.

         Screening for lung, kidney, and bladder cancer is not advised for all transplant candidates but may be appropriate in selected patients, as discussed elsewhere:

         For most patients on dialysis who are not candidates for kidney transplantation, there is no role for routine cancer screening given their high mortality from causes other than malignancy [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Rationale against screening'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, cancer screening as recommended for the general population may be appropriate for selected patients, such as those with longer life expectancy who are not interested in kidney transplantation or who are not transplant candidates because of psychosocial issues rather than medical comorbidities. The potential benefits of screening may also outweigh its potential harms in patients with an unusually high risk of cancer (eg, due to a known genetic predisposition, such as
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         ,
         <em>
         </em>
         or a strong family history of cancer). In such patients, we engage in shared decision-making about cancer screening and individualize screening based on factors such as patient preferences, expected lifespan, and cancer risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the decision is made to proceed with cancer screening, screening methods and strategies for the general population may be used, as discussed in separate topic reviews, recognizing that net benefit will likely be lower.
        </p>
        <p>
         We generally do not screen for acquired cystic disease of the kidney, given that there is no evidence that this practice is beneficial.

         We advise against routine cancer screening for most patients on dialysis who are not kidney transplant candidates due to their limited life expectancy and high mortality from causes other than cancer. In addition, the unknown efficacy of commonly used screening tests, potential harms resulting from false-positive results and unnecessary investigations, uncertain outcomes with cancer treatment, and lack of cost effectiveness of screening in this patient population all argue against routine screening.

         Patients on maintenance dialysis have a high mortality rate from causes other than malignancy and therefore may not be expected to survive long enough to develop the cancer or its consequences. Thus, cancer screening is unlikely to be beneficial for most patients [

         Despite the higher risk of developing particular tumors among patients on dialysis, malignancy is a relatively rare cause of death in this patient population.

Certain screening tests may have high false-positive rates in patients on dialysis, which may lead to inappropriate and possibly harmful testing without benefit for the patient. As examples:

          Fecal occult blood testing
         </strong>
         – The use of fecal occult blood testing for colon cancer screening may result in high false-positive test results among patients on dialysis because they have a higher incidence of nonmalignant gastrointestinal abnormalities than the general population. A positive stool guaiac test, for example, occurs at a higher frequency in patients on dialysis due to an increased incidence of gastritis, gastrointestinal telangiectasias, and other causes of gastrointestinal blood loss. In one series, the incidence of guaiac-positive stools was three times higher in asymptomatic patients on dialysis compared with non-end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) controls (15 versus 5 percent) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Colonoscopy performed in follow-up of abnormal results from fecal occult blood testing appears to be associated with at least a 10-fold higher risk of serious complications in patients on dialysis than in the general population [

          Mammography

         – Vascular calcification, which is common among patients on maintenance dialysis, may complicate the interpretation of screening mammograms for breast cancer and potentially increase the risk of false-positive tests [

          Tumor markers
         </strong>
         – Most tumor markers are glycoproteins with relatively high molecular weights (3400 to 5000 kD), and they are ineffectively removed by dialysis [

          22

         Data examining outcomes among patients on dialysis who receive cancer therapy are limited, and it is unclear if treatment results in outcomes that are comparable to those of patients who are not on dialysis.

         Patients on maintenance dialysis who receive surgical treatment for certain cancers may have worse outcomes than those not receiving dialysis. As an example, in a retrospective study of 42,403 patients with colorectal cancer undergoing surgical tumor resection, of whom 265 (0.6 percent) were receiving dialysis, patients undergoing dialysis had higher risks of postoperative mortality, reintubation, prolonged ventilatory support, sepsis, deep surgical site infection, pneumonia, and septic shock [

         Cancer screening is not cost effective in the maintenance dialysis population. As an example, one analysis compared cancer screening in patients with ESKD with screening in the general population and examined the screening benefits of mammography, Papanicolaou tests, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Each test was assumed to have 100 percent sensitivity and specificity, and if detected, cancer was assumed to be instantly treated and cured. These assumptions biased the study in favor of cancer screening in general. The following results were reported:

         <span class="glyph">

         The costs per unit of survival benefit conferred by cancer screening were 1.6 to 19.3 times greater among patients with ESKD compared with the general population.

         The net gain of life expectancy in patients with ESKD via these screening programs was calculated to be five days or less. Similar survival gains could be obtained by reducing the baseline ESKD mortality rate by 0.02 percent.

          Cancer risk
         </strong>
         – The overall incidence of cancer in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is reportedly higher than that in the general population. Malignancy is more common among patients on hemodialysis than among those on peritoneal dialysis, approximately three times more common in patients aged &gt;65 years compared with younger patients, and less common in patients with diabetes.

          Approach to screening
         </strong>
         – Although cancer screening is widely recommended for the general population, these recommendations are not necessarily applicable to patients with ESKD receiving maintenance dialysis. Our approach is as follows:

          Patients active on the transplant waiting list
         </strong>
         – Patients on dialysis who are active on the waiting list for kidney transplantation should receive routine screening for common cancers (such as colorectal, breast, lung, and prostate cancer) as per the general population. The rationale for screening in this situation is to maximize the likelihood of a successful outcome following transplantation rather than to reduce the risk of death from cancer per se. (See

         <strong>
          Patients who are not transplant candidates
         </strong>
         – For most patients on dialysis who are not candidates for kidney transplantation, there is no role for routine cancer screening given their high mortality from causes other than malignancy. However, cancer screening may be appropriate for selected patients, such as those with longer life expectancy who are not interested in kidney transplantation or who are not transplant candidates because of psychosocial issues rather than medical comorbidities. The potential benefits of screening may also outweigh its potential harms in patients with an unusually high risk of cancer. In such patients, we engage in shared decision-making about cancer screening and individualize screening based upon factors such as patient preferences, expected lifespan, and cancer risk. (See

          'Patients who are not transplant candidates'
