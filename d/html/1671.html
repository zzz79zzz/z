These disorders, including acute inflammatory, chronic inflammatory, and degenerative arthropathies, as well as radiographic calcification, comprise the spectrum of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>].</p><p>Treatment of CPPD disease is discussed here. The pathogenesis, etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1665.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis and etiology of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1668.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H272267598"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This topic review uses the nomenclature for calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease outlined by the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) consensus panel [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. Differences between this nomenclature and older classifications (eg, pseudogout, chondrocalcinosis, pyrophosphate arthropathy) are described in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1668.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease", section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H272267743"><span class="h1">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to treatment of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease depends on the subtype, which is based on clinical manifestations and acuity. Asymptomatic patients who have evidence of cartilage calcification (also called chondrocalcinosis) on imaging do not need any specific treatment.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute symptoms – Patients with intermittent episodes of inflammatory arthritis are categorized as having acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis. Treatment of acute episodes consists of supportive measures as well as intraarticular or systemic antiinflammatory therapy. The choice of antiinflammatory therapy is based upon factors such as the patient’s clinical presentation (eg, number of joints) as well as the potential adverse effects of each agent. Prophylaxis against acute flares may be indicated for patients with frequent episodes (≥3 episodes/year). (See <a class="local">'Acute CPP crystal arthritis (pseudogout)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Prophylaxis for acute CPP crystal arthritis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic symptoms – Patients with persistent symptoms of inflammatory arthritis are categorized as having chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis and may benefit from more prolonged antiinflammatory therapy. Patients with preexisting osteoarthritis (OA) or severe joint degeneration who have evidence of CPPD are generally treated for these conditions without specific therapy targeted against CPPD. (See <a class="local">'Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Osteoarthritis with CPPD'</a> below and <a class="local">'Severe joint degeneration'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Patients who have a disease associated with CPPD  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65287" href="/d/graphic/65287.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) should receive specific therapy directed at the underlying disorder; however, such interventions usually do not reverse CPPD disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1668.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease", section on 'Post-diagnostic evaluation for associated diseases'</a> and <a class="local">'Treatment of associated diseases'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatments for CPPD disease and gout (acute monosodium urate crystal deposition disease) share many similarities. However, while urate-lowering therapy is used to prevent or reverse deposition of monosodium urate in patients with gout, there are no known therapies that prevent or reverse deposition of CPP in patients with CPPD disease.</p><p>In general, treatment approaches for various forms of CPPD disease are modeled after the treatment of conditions with similar manifestations (eg, gout for acute CPP crystal arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis [RA] for chronic CPP crystal arthritis). However, the evidence directly examining and supporting specific treatments in CPPD disease is quite limited. The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) panel has issued guidance around treatment strategies, which generally concurs with our approach outlined below [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ACUTE CPP CRYSTAL ARTHRITIS (PSEUDOGOUT)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The treatment of an attack of acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis (previously known as pseudogout) consists of supportive measures for symptomatic relief as well as antiinflammatory therapy for most patients, as discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3601671212"><span class="h2">Supportive measures for all patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis should receive supportive measures for symptomatic relief. These include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Application of ice or cool packs (for no more than 20 minutes at a time) to the affected joints.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rest of the affected area for 48 to 72 hours. This involves restriction of weightbearing activity and possibly immobilization with splinting, depending on the specific joint affected.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of analgesic medications (such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> or opioids) or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at analgesic rather than antiinflammatory doses for pain relief. These medications should not substitute for systemic antiinflammatory therapy when indicated. Patients with involvement of smaller and more peripheral joints (eg, knuckles, wrists) may benefit from the addition of topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9348" href="/d/drug information/9348.html" rel="external">diclofenac</a>.</p><p></p><p>The use of these strategies is based largely upon our clinical experience and that of other experts. Since attacks of acute CPP crystal arthritis are usually self-limited, supportive measures may be sufficient to treat the acute flare in patients with contraindications to all of the available antiinflammatory therapies [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4169181773"><span class="h2">Initial antiinflammatory therapy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3209667518"><span class="h3">Selection of agent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We use antiinflammatory therapy for most patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis. While supportive measures may provide some relief, they are often insufficient. The aim of antiinflammatory therapy is to prevent the pain and disability associated with acute CPP crystal arthritis, and treatments are generally well tolerated and widely available. Options include glucocorticoids (intraarticular or systemic), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a>, NSAIDs, and interleukin 1 (IL-1) antagonists.</p><p>Therapy should be started as close to the onset of symptoms as possible to prevent the flare from worsening. The choice of antiinflammatory therapy depends upon the number of joints affected, whether local glucocorticoid injection is feasible, whether patients can take oral medications, and whether there are contraindications to the major types of oral antiinflammatory therapy. It also depends on whether there is concern for a concurrent septic joint (eg, signs and symptoms of systemic inflammation, rash, or associated foci of infection)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143296" href="/d/graphic/143296.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients for whom there is concern for a concomitant septic joint, we avoid immunosuppressive agents that could worsen infection, such as glucocorticoids and anti-IL-1 therapy, as well as NSAIDs, given the increased risk of bleeding should the patient require surgical intervention. We treat with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a> rather than with other antiinflammatory therapies. Patients should be evaluated and treated as appropriate for septic joint, as detailed elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Colchicine'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7666.html" rel="external">"Septic arthritis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with low suspicion of a septic joint, we use the following approach:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with one or two affected joints that are amenable to arthrocentesis, we suggest thorough joint aspiration and treatment with intraarticular glucocorticoids rather than systemic antiinflammatory therapy. If an experienced provider is not available to perform this procedure, we treat with systemic antiinflammatory therapy. (See <a class="local">'Intraarticular glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Joint fluid aspiration and glucocorticoid injection usually provide relief in pain and swelling within 8 to 24 hours; this therapy also avoids complications associated with systemic therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with more than three affected joints <strong>or</strong> one or two affected joints that are not amenable to arthrocentesis (eg, knuckles), we suggest systemic antiinflammatory therapy rather than intraarticular glucocorticoids.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If the patient can take oral medications, we treat with either oral glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a>. There is no strong evidence to suggest clinical benefit of one of these agents over another for acute CPP crystal arthritis. Selection of therapy should therefore be based on the patient’s history of treatment response in prior flares and an evaluation of the risks of therapy, including medication adverse effects and contraindications for an individual patient based on comorbidities and other medications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef143472" href="/d/graphic/143472.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Notably, acute CPP crystal arthritis is most common in older adults, who are more likely to have comorbid conditions and polypharmacy that can complicate treatment choice. (See <a class="local">'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a class="local">'NSAIDs'</a> below and <a class="local">'Colchicine'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If the patient cannot take oral medications, we treat with intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids in the inpatient setting or intramuscular (IM) glucocorticoid injection in the outpatient setting.

(See <a class="local">'Anti-interleukin 1 therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>There is little high-quality evidence to guide the optimal antiinflammatory therapy for acute CPP crystal arthritis. Our approach, which is largely consistent with the recommendations of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) expert consensus group [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], is primarily based upon the clinical experience of the authors and editors of this topic as well as data supporting the use of systemic antiinflammatory therapies in patients with gout, given the similarities between the mechanisms of acute CPP crystal and acute monosodium urate crystal-induced inflammation. A more detailed discussion of the studies comparing antiinflammatory treatment regimens in gout is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1666.html" rel="external">"Treatment of gout flares"</a>.)</p><p>Data directly comparing antiinflammatory therapies for acute CPP crystal arthritis are limited. In an open-label, multicenter trial in over 100 hospitalized patients aged 65 years and older with an acute flare of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) arthritis within 36 hours of symptom onset, patients randomly assigned to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a> (1.5 mg on day 1 and 1 mg on day 2) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> (30 mg daily) for two days had similar improvements in self-reported pain at 24 hours [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Adverse effect profiles differed among the treatment groups, with more patients on colchicine reporting diarrhea and more patients on prednisone experiencing hypertension and hyperglycemia [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Limited data on certain IL-1 inhibitors suggest that these agents may improve clinical symptoms of acute CPP crystal arthritis, and thus we reserve their use for patients who cannot take or do not respond to other therapies. While data from large clinical trials are not available, a systematic review noted that 80 percent of patients receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9246" href="/d/drug information/9246.html" rel="external">anakinra</a> for acute CPP crystal arthritis experienced clinical improvement [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. A small double-blind trial in which patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis were randomly assigned to three days of anakinra or oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> showed lower pain scores among patients receiving anakinra, but this did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to the study being underpowered [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4069433204"><span class="h3">Glucocorticoids</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1854154337"><span class="h4">Intraarticular glucocorticoids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intraarticular glucocorticoids are generally used for patients who have acute CPP crystal arthritis affecting one or two joints that are amenable to arthrocentesis and glucocorticoid injection. (See <a class="local">'Selection of agent'</a> above.)</p><p>Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection should be performed only when the likelihood of a septic joint, which can be mistaken for acute crystal-induced synovitis, has been deemed unlikely. Characteristics that make an infection less likely include the absence of systemic signs and symptoms, such as fever, or a suspected focus of infection. Absence of infection is further supported by a lack of microorganisms on Gram stain of synovial fluid and sterile synovial fluid and blood cultures. In patients with suspected infection, glucocorticoid injection should be deferred until synovial fluid culture is negative, and interventions other than glucocorticoid injection should be employed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1668.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1668.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>For injections into large joints, including the knees and shoulders, we use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10015" href="/d/drug information/10015.html" rel="external">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (1 mL, 40 mg) mixed with 1 or 2 mL of 1% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a>. When smaller joints are involved, smaller doses of the respective glucocorticoid preparations can be utilized. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7986.html" rel="external">"Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7985.html" rel="external">"Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?", section on 'Choice of glucocorticoid preparation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7985.html" rel="external">"Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?", section on 'Should the glucocorticoid be mixed with a local anesthetic?'</a>.)</p><p>Joint fluid aspiration and glucocorticoid injection usually provide relief in pain and swelling within 8 to 24 hours. Patients who experience worsening symptoms shortly after aspiration and injection, do not improve within 48 to 72 hours, or develop additional inflamed joints may require escalation to systemic antiinflammatory therapy. (See <a class="local">'Initial antiinflammatory therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1422680991"><span class="h4">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Systemic glucocorticoids are an option for antiinflammatory therapy in patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis affecting three or more joints, or one to two joints that are not amenable to arthrocentesis, when there is low concern for septic arthritis. The route of glucocorticoids depends on the patient's ability to take oral medications and whether care is in the inpatient or outpatient setting. (See <a class="local">'Selection of agent'</a> above.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Oral glucocorticoids</strong> – We use oral glucocorticoids unless patients are unable to take oral medications, regardless of the clinical setting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Dosing and duration</strong> – When using oral glucocorticoids for acute CPP crystal arthritis, we use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> (or other equivalent oral glucocorticoid) in doses of 30 to 50 mg once daily or in two divided doses until flare resolution begins. We then taper the dose of glucocorticoids, usually over 5 to 10 days.

Asymptomatic patients with evidence of cartilage calcification (also called chondrocalcinosis) on imaging do not need any specific treatment. (See <a class="local">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute CPP crystal arthritis (pseudogout)</strong> – Treatment for acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis consists of supportive measures for symptomatic relief (eg, applying ice, resting the affected area, taking analgesic medications) as well as antiinflammatory therapy for most patients. (See <a class="local">'Supportive measures for all patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Initial antiinflammatory therapy</strong> – We use antiinflammatory therapy for most patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis. While supportive measures may provide some relief, they are often insufficient. (See <a class="local">'Selection of agent'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Concomitant septic arthritis can be present; suggestive features may include signs and symptoms of systemic inflammation (eg, fever), rash, and a nearby foci of infection (eg, cellulitis). In patients with possible acute CPP crystal arthritis and septic joint, we treat with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a> rather than with other antiinflammatory therapies. Patients should be evaluated and treated as appropriate for septic joint, as detailed elsewhere.

(See <a class="local">'Intraarticular glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients with a presentations that is not amenable to arthrocentesis (eg, multiple joints, knuckles) and when an experienced clinician is not available to perform this procedures, reasonable alternatives include we use oral glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a>. Selection of therapy should be based on the patient’s prior treatment response and an evaluation of the potential adverse effects and contraindications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef143472" href="/d/graphic/143472.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a> above and <a class="local">'NSAIDs'</a> above and <a class="local">'Colchicine'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">If the patient cannot take oral medications, we treat with intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids in the inpatient setting or intramuscular (IM) glucocorticoid injection in the outpatient setting. (See <a class="local">'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">We reserve treatment with interleukin 1 (IL-1) inhibitors (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9246" href="/d/drug information/9246.html" rel="external">anakinra</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8906" href="/d/drug information/8906.html" rel="external">canakinumab</a>) for patients who cannot receive glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a>; clinical experience with these drugs is more limited. (See <a class="local">'Anti-interleukin 1 therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Resistant disease</strong> – We consider patients to have resistant disease if they have moderate to severe symptoms that are persistent or worsening despite 48 to 72 hours of treatment. The management of such patients depends upon the prior initial therapy used and the risks of various therapies for an individual patient  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143295" href="/d/graphic/143295.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Resistant disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Prophylaxis</strong> – For patients with three or more attacks of acute CPP crystal arthritis annually, we suggest prophylactic therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a> rather than limiting treatment to the period of each acute attack (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). In patients with an intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs are an alternative option.

In patients with an inadequate response to NSAIDs alone after several weeks of therapy, second-line therapies include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a>, low-dose oral glucocorticoids, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ).
