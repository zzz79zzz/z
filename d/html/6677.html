The goal of treatment is to treat or prevent significant bleeding, not to normalize the platelet count. However, bleeding risk can be difficult to estimate. </p><p>The overall risk of critical or severe bleeding in ITP is relatively low (on the order of 1 percent for intracerebral hemorrhage) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Risk is greatest in individuals with the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prior bleeding</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Platelet count &lt;10,000/microL</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Older age, especially &gt;60 years</p><p></p><p>We first consider whether treatment is indicated and then determine the urgency of treatment. Subsequent steps depend on the response to treatment, which treatments have been used, and how long thrombocytopenia has been present. </p><p>Our approach is consistent with a 2019 clinical practice guideline from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) and a 2019 international consensus report [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H84892402"><span class="h2">Definitions of bleeding severity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Definitions of bleeding severity and other terms are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129433" href="/d/graphic/129433.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The following definitions are used herein:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Critical bleeding</strong> – Bleeding into a critical anatomical site or bleeding that causes hemodynamic instability or respiratory compromise [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Includes intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, pericardial, or intramuscular bleeding with compartment syndrome. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severe bleeding</strong> – Bleeding that results in a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more or requires transfusion of two or more units of blood but does not meet the definition of critical bleeding. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Minor bleeding</strong> – Bleeding that does not meet criteria for severe or critical bleeding. Examples include skin bleeding or non-severe mucous membrane bleeding.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3738577880"><span class="h2">Whom to treat (indications for therapy)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In individuals with ITP, the need for therapy to raise the platelet count is based on a rapid clinical assessment that includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of bleeding, and if present, the site, acuity, and severity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Platelet count</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other bleeding risk factors</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What treatments have been given previously for bleeding or thrombocytopenia, and their effectiveness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What treatment has been given for the current episode</p><p></p><p>All individuals with critical or severe bleeding require treatment to raise the platelet count and stop the bleeding. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Critical bleeding requires immediate treatment that includes platelet transfusion, along with intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), glucocorticoids, and other treatments as needed  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef130648" href="/d/graphic/130648.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

(See <a class="local">'Severe bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Some individuals with minor or no bleeding despite being thrombocytopenic may not require treatment. Instead, close observation and attention to other bleeding risk factors may be reasonable  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef130855" href="/d/graphic/130855.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Therapy to increase the platelet count in individuals who are not bleeding is generally appropriate if the platelet count is &lt;20,000/microL and generally not used if the platelet count is ≥30,000/microL. One rare exception is the very rare patient with ITP who has antiplatelet antibodies that interfere with platelet function. These patients classically present with bleeding out of proportion to the degree of thrombocytopenia. Their management is complex and requires involvement of a hemostasis expert.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H799891598"><span class="h2">How to treat (choice of therapy)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once a decision has been made to treat, the choice of therapy depends on the severity of bleeding and the bleeding risk. These features will dictate the rapidity with which the platelet count needs to be increased and the treatment to choose, as discussed in the sections below.</p><p>Treatments may include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Therapies to raise the platelet count</strong> – (See <a class="local">'Therapies to raise the platelet count'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other hemostatic products</strong> – (See <a class="local">'Other hemostatic therapies'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatments to address other bleeding risk factors</strong> – It is always prudent to evaluate other potential factors that may be contributing to bleeding and address them. This may include medications that increase bleeding risk (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], anticoagulants), other comorbidities (kidney or liver disease, infection), or other risk factors (lack of balance that could increase risk of falling; high-risk behaviors like climbing ladders). This applies to all severities of bleeding and to persistent thrombocytopenia without bleeding, especially if the platelet count is &lt;50,000/microL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment of another condition that may be responsible for secondary ITP</strong> – (See <a class="local">'Evaluation for secondary ITP'</a> below and <a class="local">'H. pylori testing'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H33618199"><span class="h3">Critical bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immediate treatment is required for critical bleeding (bleeding into a critical anatomical site or that causes hemodynamic instability or respiratory compromise), including the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef130648" href="/d/graphic/130648.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Platelet transfusions</strong> – Platelet transfusion is the fastest way to increase the platelet count in critical bleeding. The typical dose is one apheresis unit or four to six units of pooled platelets. Repeated transfusions may be appropriate while waiting for other therapies to take effect, as individuals with ITP tend to have only brief, attenuated responses to platelet transfusion due to rapid immune-mediated destruction of transfused platelets. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> may potentiate the response to platelet transfusion [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].

Severe bleeding can occur with a platelet count between 20,000 and 50,000/microL and should be treated similarly to bleeding with a count &lt;20,000/microL, but other reasons for bleeding should also be sought and treated, as thrombocytopenia is unlikely to be the sole reason of bleeding.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3286067588"><span class="h3">Minor bleeding and severe thrombocytopenia without bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The platelet count threshold for initiating ITP treatment should be individualized and may vary based on bleeding history, age, comorbidities, occupation, lifestyle, need for antithrombotic therapy, and values and preferences. Our general approach to treating minor bleeding and severe thrombocytopenia without bleeding is similar  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef130855" href="/d/graphic/130855.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). </p><p>Not all patients with thrombocytopenia require therapies to increase the platelet count; treatment is used for individuals at increased risk of bleeding, which is based on a number of factors including platelet count, comorbidities, patient values and concerns, and tolerability of therapies [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We treat the majority of individuals with platelet counts &lt;20,000/microL, and especially those with counts &lt;10,000/microL, even if they have no bleeding symptoms. This is based on the increased risk of bleeding with counts below 20,000/microL and the greater risk below 10,000/microL. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We treat the majority of individuals with minor bleeding. The platelet count is typically &lt;50,000/microL, often lower. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In some experts' experience, mucosal bleeding (also called "wet purpura"), especially blood blisters in the mouth, can be a predictor of more serious bleeding, and we typically treat these patients fairly urgently, compared with other patients with minor bleeding. Almost always these patients have a platelet count of &lt;20,000/microL. Data to support an association between mucosal bleeding and more serious bleeding are limited. As an example, in a retrospective study involving 112 individuals with ITP who presented to the emergency department with bleeding and a platelet count &lt;20,000/microL, the six individuals with oral mucosal bleeding subsequently developed more serious bleeding [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Typical initial treatment involves administration of a glucocorticoid (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a>, 40 mg orally or intravenously once per day for four days, <strong>or</strong> <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a>, 1 mg/kg daily for one to two weeks, followed by a gradual taper). Rationales for choosing one or the other approach and supporting evidence are presented below. (See <a class="local">'Choice of glucocorticoid and dosing'</a> below.)</p><p>We generally do not treat individuals with platelet counts ≥30,000/microL who are not bleeding. Unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia should be avoided, because of the risk of treatment-related toxicity with little to no reduction in bleeding risk.
