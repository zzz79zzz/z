It tends to occur more often in younger individuals, with an annual incidence of up to 12.6 percent in patients ages 20 to 24 years [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4197246216"><span class="h1">POTENTIAL CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As postcoital bleeding can originate anywhere from the external genitalia to the upper reproductive tract, all causes of genital tract bleeding must be considered  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74527" href="/d/graphic/74527.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

Sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis, can cause cervicitis. Chlamydia cervicitis has been reported in approximately 2 percent of patients with postcoital bleeding [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. In addition, upper tract infections, such as pelvic inflammatory disease or endometritis, have been reported [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5460.html" rel="external">"Acute cervicitis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5477.html" rel="external">"Vaginitis in adults: Initial evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Noninfectious</strong> – Noninfectious causes are numerous  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74527" href="/d/graphic/74527.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Gynecologic etiologies are the most common causes of postcoital bleeding and include [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cervical ectropion</strong> – 34 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Cervical ectropion is the presence of columnar epithelium on the ectocervix and is commonly found in postpubertal adolescents, pregnant individuals, and those using estrogen-containing contraceptives (eg, oral estrogen-progestin pills, vaginal ring, or transdermal patch)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105122" href="/d/graphic/105122.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5428.html" rel="external">"Benign cervical lesions and congenital anomalies of the cervix"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other common, but less frequent, noninfectious gynecologic causes of postcoital bleeding include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Contraception </strong>– These can include changes in bleeding patterns from hormonal contraception as well as increased cervical ectropion from exogenous estrogen exposure. Intrauterine device (IUD)-related bleeding can occur with both correctly or malpositioned devices. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7399.html" rel="external">"Combined estrogen-progestin contraception: Side effects and health concerns", section on 'Unscheduled bleeding'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Atrophic vulvovaginal changes </strong>– These may present during lactation or after menopause.

Granulation tissue typically presents as a red, raised, lobular lesion and can be quite friable, which results in bleeding with contact. When formed at the site of obstetric lacerations, it is often painful to palpation. When biopsied, vaginal granulation tissue histologically shows abundant vascular growth, epithelial erosion, and intense inflammation [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111631.html" rel="external">"Postpartum perineal care and management of complications", section on 'Separation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Vulvar skin conditions </strong>– These include dermatitis or inflammatory conditions (eg, lichen planus or sclerosus).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5563.html" rel="external">"Vulvar dermatitis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5558.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lichen sclerosus: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5662.html" rel="external">"Lichen planus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3255383008"><span class="h2">Malignancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Malignancy as a cause of postcoital bleeding occurs in less than 5 percent of patients [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. When postcoital bleeding is a result of malignancy, cervical cancer is the most common, but vulvar, vaginal, and uterine cancers can also cause the symptom  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126441" href="/d/graphic/126441.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cervical cancer</strong> – The risk of underlying malignancy in individuals who present with postcoital bleeding depends on a patient's age, Pap history, menopausal status, and demographics (ie, access to Pap screening). With improved cervical cancer screening, fewer cervical cancers are diagnosed due to symptoms, and more are found in asymptomatic individuals. A systematic review of 910 studies that included a wide range of clinical settings and access to Pap testing reported that as many as 39 percent of patients with cervical cancer have postcoital bleeding [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. When analysis was limited to studies from developed countries, an estimated 11 percent of patients with cervical cancer reported postcoital bleeding. The authors then estimated the risk of cervical cancer in a patient presenting with postcoital bleeding based on age and prevalence of both postcoital bleeding and cervical cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126441" href="/d/graphic/126441.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Among the highest-risk age group for cervical cancer, postcoital bleeding was still only associated with a risk of 1 in 2400. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3179.html" rel="external">"Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other gynecologic malignancy</strong> – Less commonly, postcoital bleeding can be associated with vulvar, vaginal, and uterine cancers. Gynecologic cancers often cause tissues to be more friable; friction from intercourse or vaginal sexual activity can cause bleeding from friable tissue at the vulva or vagina that was previously unrecognized. Seventy to 90 percent of cases of endometrial cancer present with abnormal uterine bleeding [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. It is not known how many of these would present with postcoital bleeding only. Endometrial cancer should be considered as a cause for postcoital bleeding, especially in postmenopausal individuals. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5421.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with postmenopausal uterine bleeding"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1620562468"><span class="h2">Other</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other causes of postcoital bleeding include direct trauma or abuse. However, in approximately one-half of patients, no cause will be identified [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See <a class="local">'No identified diagnosis (idiopathic)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H586805604"><span class="h1">INITIAL DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Goals of the initial evaluation include identifying an obvious cause and excluding possible malignancy. However, the risk that postcoital bleeding represents a malignancy is quite low, and, in fact, most cases of postcoital bleeding will have no discernable cause. Despite the relatively common frequency with which this symptom is reported, there are no evidence-based guidelines for evaluation and management. We take the following approach:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3353217059"><span class="h2">History</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Is the patient actively bleeding?</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Yes</strong> – Acute ongoing postcoital bleeding can prompt individuals to seek urgent care, and they should be evaluated expediently when they do so. Postcoital bleeding resulting from vaginal tears or lacerations can be profuse and even life-threatening [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. This is more likely in individuals who have had vaginal penetration for the first time; when there has been sexual trauma or abuse; in the setting of low estrogen states, such as after menopause or in lactating individuals; in patients with other tissue abnormalities, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; or in patients who have undergone hysterectomy or other vaginal surgery [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. It is critical to assess the extent of trauma and volume of bleeding and need for emergency treatment, or transfer the patient if such treatment cannot be provided on site. (See <a class="local">'Active heavy bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>No</strong> – In most cases, postcoital bleeding is self-limited and will have ceased prior to presentation in the outpatient setting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assess reproductive status and possibility of pregnancy</strong> – Menstruating and reproductive-age individuals should be asked about their last menstrual period and if there is any chance that they could be pregnant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> – Postcoital bleeding is much more common among pregnant individuals due to increased vascular supply to the genital tract as well as a larger and more friable cervical ectropion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5428.html" rel="external">"Benign cervical lesions and congenital anomalies of the cervix", section on 'Ectropion'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">While vaginal bleeding in normal pregnancy is common, these patients should also be evaluated for pregnancy-related complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6799.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of gestation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Postpartum</strong> – Postpartum individuals may have friable granulation tissue at the site of repaired obstetric lacerations that can bleed. In addition, we ask about breastfeeding status as the hypoestrogenic state can result in atrophic changes with resultant postcoital bleeding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Postmenopausal</strong> – Postmenopausal individuals should be evaluated in a fashion similar to that which is recommended for postmenopausal bleeding in general, unless an obvious vaginal source of bleeding is found.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elaboration of symptoms</strong> – Questions to ask about bleeding include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Amount</strong> – What is the approximate volume of bleeding (eg, spotting, menstrual-like flow, or heavy bleeding)?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Frequency</strong> – Does postcoital bleeding occur with every episode of vaginal sexual activity or only sometimes? If it does not occur consistently, does it seem to occur with specific activities or partners?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Associated symptoms</strong> – Is the bleeding associated with pain, vaginal dryness, or vaginal discharge?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Given the overall benign nature of postcoital bleeding, bleeding that is minimal or that occurs rarely is less likely to represent pathology. While work-up and examination to exclude malignancy, sexually transmitted infections, and anatomic abnormalities is still performed, these patients will be more likely to have a benign or idiopathic etiology. Postcoital bleeding associated with pain or dryness is more likely to be due to atrophic changes, lacerations, granulation tissue, or inadequate lubrication. Patients with concomitant pelvic pain should raise a clinician's suspicion for pelvic inflammatory disease. Patients who report coexisting vaginal discharge are more likely to have an infectious etiology, such as vaginitis or cervicitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraceptive method</strong> – Combined estrogen-progestin contraceptive (oral pill, vaginal ring, and transdermal patch) methods can result in an enlarged cervical ectropion, which is a common cause of postcoital bleeding. Alternatively, progestin-only methods (implants, intrauterine devices [IUDs], injections, and pills) are commonly associated with breakthrough bleeding. In some individuals, this bleeding only becomes apparent with sexual activity. IUDs can contribute to postcoital bleeding through endometrial thinning (progestin-releasing IUDs), malposition, and inflammation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5474.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of unscheduled bleeding in individuals using hormonal contraception"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116579.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine contraception: Background and device types", section on 'Impact of device type on bleeding pattern'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5422.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine contraception: Management of side effects and complications"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Menstrual abnormalities</strong> – Postcoital bleeding is differentiated from other menstrual abnormalities. Individuals with other menstrual abnormalities, including intermenstrual bleeding or heavy menstrual bleeding, are evaluated for those symptoms. Heavy or prolonged bleeding increases the suspicion for uterine fibroids or adenomyosis. Intermenstrual bleeding is associated with hormonal contraceptives; infections, such as vaginitis or cervicitis; endometrial polyps or fibroids; or malignancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3263.html" rel="external">"Abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age patients: Terminology, evaluation, and approach to diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pap screening history and results</strong> – Individuals should be asked about the timing of their last screening and result as well as their history of abnormal Paps or cervical dysplasia treatments, such as loop electrosurgical excision procedure, cervical cryotherapy, or cervical conization (cold knife cone biopsy). Individuals who have not been adequately screened or who have been previously treated for cervical dysplasia are at increased risk of a cervical precancer or cancer. The incidence of cervical cancer in patients who have had recent normal testing is low (0.6 percent) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7575.html" rel="external">"Screening for cervical cancer in resource-rich settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History of bleeding or a known bleeding disorder</strong> – Symptoms of a bleeding diathesis can include easy bruising, bleeding gums, bleeding from paper cuts or other minor trauma, or heavy menstrual bleeding since onset of menses.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ask about history of sexual trauma or abuse </strong>– A trauma-informed approach is advised, which is discussed in related content. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106947.html" rel="external">"Human trafficking: Identification and evaluation in the health care setting", section on 'Trauma-informed care'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3024876940"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physical examination is performed with the goal of identifying an etiology for the patient's complaint. A detailed discussion of the gynecologic pelvic examination is presented elsewhere.
