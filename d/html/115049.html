         The World Health Organization published guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis infection (TBI) in 2020 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]; in 2022 these were incorporated into the WHO Operational Handbook for Tuberculosis [
         <a href="#rid2">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published recommendations for TBI screening of populations with increased prevalence of TBI in 2023 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

          Definitions and natural history

         – TB terminology is inconsistent in the literature and in practice  (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The distinction between TB infection and TB disease is important [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,4
         </a>
         ]. In most individuals,
         <em>
          Mycobacterium tuberculosis
         </em>
         infection is either cleared or contained (via innate and acquired immune defense mechanisms). Individuals whose immune system initially contains the organism are asymptomatic and noninfectious though likely harbor potentially viable organisms [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. This situation is referred to as TB infection; the older term "latent TB" may be misleading since such individuals are infected with viable mycobacteria in various stages of containment by the host immune system [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Containment of TB infection is a dynamic process; organisms have the potential to overcome immune defenses and subsequently cause symptomatic disease. Treatment of TBI prior to development of TB disease kills contained organisms, thereby reducing the risk of developing TB disease (termed reactivation TB) by as much as 90 percent [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Treatment of TBI has the potential to protect the health of the infected individual as well as the public by reducing the number of potential future sources of infection to others [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10

         Screening for TB (testing for TB infection) is reserved for individuals who are at increased risk of developing TB disease and would thus benefit from treatment  (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●

         Individuals at moderate or slightly increased risk of reactivation  (

          table 3
         </a>
         ) who reside in an area where TB is prevalent  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111123" href="/z/d/graphic/111123.html" rel="external">
          table 4

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         For individuals who have undergone testing but fall outside the above categories, the decision to treat for TB infection should be individualized, as risk may outweigh potential benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, repeat TBI testing among individuals with prior negative test results should be performed only in the setting of new exposure since the last assessment (such as new contact with a case of untreated respiratory TB disease, occupational exposure, or extended travel in regions where TB is endemic).

         </span>
         Testing for TB infection should be performed in asymptomatic individuals for whom new infection is suspected  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116497" href="/z/d/graphic/116497.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). High-priority groups for evaluation include close and casual contacts of patients with untreated respiratory TB disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74584" href="/z/d/graphic/74584.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The definition of 'close contact' varies between guidelines; however, all emphasize that the approach to contact identification should be tailored to the specific circumstances (infectiousness of index TB patient, environment within which the exposure occurred, and susceptibility of those exposed) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. We define a 'close contact' as an individual who shares an enclosed space with a patient with untreated respiratory TB disease for ≥4 hours per week; this definition has been in large randomized trials [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15
         </a>
         ]. In addition, another study suggested that defining high-priority close contacts as individuals sharing an enclosed space for ≥4 hours per week may be used as a measure of risk [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. This includes those living in the same household or frequent visitors to the house; it may also include contacts at work or school. Because the risk of developing TB disease is very high in the first few years following exposure and new infection, all close contacts should be evaluated for TBI regardless of age  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74584" href="/z/d/graphic/74584.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Most public health TB programs evaluate close contacts first and expand the contact investigation to casual contacts if evidence of transmission is found. Casual contacts may be defined as individuals with less than four hours of contact per week. This may include health care workers (HCWs) and/or contacts at work or school. Evidence of transmission is defined by detection of TB disease among contacts (secondary TB disease) or observing prevalence of positive tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) that is greater than expected. In general, source TB patients with positive sputum smear are more contagious; casual contacts of smear-negative patients are usually not evaluated unless they are immunocompromised.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the first test is negative, close contacts of patients with pulmonary TB disease should undergo a second test 8 to 10 weeks later. Many TB programs test casual contacts only once at eight to ten weeks after last exposure. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8005.html" rel="external">
          "Use of the tuberculin skin test for diagnosis of tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults", section on 'Repeat and serial testing'

        <p>
         The risk of disease in the first two years following infection is age dependent. The decline of risk with increasing age reflects greater innate and acquired immunity [

         In regions with low TB incidence rate, most HCWs in facilities with low TST conversion rate need not undergo routine serial TB screening. In such settings, HCWs should undergo initial TB screening with individual risk assessment and symptom evaluation. For individuals without documented prior TB disease or TBI, baseline TB testing with an IGRA or a TST should be performed. Thereafter, in the absence of a known exposure or ongoing transmission, no routine serial TB testing at any interval after baseline is warranted [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. TST interpretation thresholds are summarized in the table  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Serial TB screening may be reasonable for HCWs at increased risk for occupational exposure to TB (such as pulmonologists or respiratory therapists) or for HCWs in certain settings (such as emergency departments). Such policies should be individualized based on factors such as the regional and institutional incidence of pulmonary TB, whether delays in initiating airborne isolation have occurred, or whether prior serial screening has demonstrated ongoing transmission; such determinations may be made in consultation with local or state health departments [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The approach to serial testing is described below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to serial testing'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the setting of a recognized exposure, HCWs with a baseline negative TBI test and no prior TB disease or TBI should undergo testing (IGRA or TST) when the exposure is identified; if IGRA is newly positive, or TST is newly positive at ≥5 mm, this should be interpreted as evidence of new TB infection. If the test is negative, another test should be performed 8 to 10 weeks after the last exposure [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. In this case, we define TST conversion if the induration of the repeat TST measures ≥10 mm and has increased by ≥6 mm over the previous test (ie, the initial negative TST) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Alternatively, one test may be performed 8 to 10 weeks following the end of exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
         For HCWs with untreated new TBI, treatment is encouraged unless medically contraindicated [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. HCWs with new TBI who do not complete treatment should be monitored annually with symptom evaluation to detect early evidence of TB disease and to re-evaluate the risks and benefits of TBI treatment [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. In addition, these HCWs should be educated about the signs and symptoms of TB disease that should prompt immediate evaluation between screenings.
        </p>
        <p>
         The above approach reflects guidelines issued by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Tuberculosis Controllers Association in 2019 [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ], which serves as an update to the prior 2005 guidelines  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121332" href="/z/d/graphic/121332.html" rel="external">
          table 6

         ) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. This approach is supported by a number of factors. TB incidence rates in the United States declined by 42 percent between 2005 and 2017 (from 4.8 to 2.8 per 100,000 population) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the 2019 guideline statement refers to an unpublished systematic review of eight studies including more than 63,000 HCWs; there was no disease occurrence among these individuals [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, the use of TSTs and IGRAs for serial testing of HCWs has been associated with a number of limitations [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The role of IGRA for serial testing in HCWs is uncertain, in large part due to high rates of false conversions in most studies in HCWs undergoing serial testing with IGRA. This issue is discussed further separately. (See

         can be used to estimate the likelihood that an individual with a positive TST or IGRA has a true-positive test, and the cumulative lifetime risk of developing TB disease in that individual, taking into consideration various conditions that increase risk of reactivation; it also factors in the age-related risks of

         <a href="#rid25">

         ]. This algorithm has been validated in a cohort of including more than 37,000 foreign-born individuals in Canada; however, risks may be overestimated in the highest risk groups [

        </p>
        <p>
         False-positive tests occur more commonly with TST but also can occur with IGRA. True-positive tests are more likely in individuals with relevant epidemiologic exposure (such as close contact with a case of contagious TB or residence in a high-incidence country). True-positive tests are very uncommon in individuals born in the United States (or other low-incidence countries) after 1960 who have no other risk of exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, individuals at increased risk of reactivation require a single test for diagnosis of TBI; if the result is negative, no further testing is needed. Given that the likelihood of TB infection is very low in most individuals born in the United States since 1960, the likelihood of a false-positive test result must be considered carefully. Dual testing (with IGRA as well as TST) can be useful in certain circumstances. (See

          30
         </a>
         ]. In individuals with conditions conferring moderate or slightly increased risk who would be treated with isoniazid, we carefully assess the balance of risks and harms in individuals &gt;50 years of age (especially individuals &gt;65 years of age). Guidelines in the United States [

However, use of concomitant medications may be more likely among older patients, increasing risk of drug-drug interactions.

         Routine TBI testing is warranted for patients with hematologic malignancies, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, given substantially increased risk for reactivation in these groups. In patients with solid tumors, a risk-stratified approach is reasonable, since the risk for reactivation appears to be lower. Among patients at low risk for hepatotoxicity (based on age, other comorbid illnesses, and chemotherapy regimen), we perform TBI testing for individuals with an expected five-year survival &gt;25 percent. Among patients at increased risk for hepatotoxicity, we perform TBI testing for individuals with an expected five-year survival &gt;50 percent.

         ), either the IGRA or TST may be used; in such cases, the higher false-positive rate of the TST is acceptable. A dual testing strategy (perform one test and, if negative, perform the other) may be used, in which case a positive result from either test would be considered positive.

         The National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) issued guidance for screening, diagnosis, and treatment of TB infection in 2021 [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. In this guidance, IGRAs are preferred for most non-United States-born patients who received (or may have received) BCG vaccination; for other individuals, either a TST or IGRA may be used, depending on availability and cost. The NTCA advises against routine use of dual testing (with both TST and IGRA), but that this approach may be considered for patients at risk for a poor immune response to these tests, for patients at risk of severe forms of TB disease, and for patients in whom TB infection is strongly suspected. The NTCA also suggests that if patients at low risk for TB infection required testing, either an IGRA or TST should be used; if the result is positive, a second test (with the same or a different method) should be performed to confirm the test result and enhance specificity.

         Updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of TB infection were published by the World Health Organization in 2020 [

         WHO guidelines state that either TST or IGRA may be used to test for TBI, and neither test is preferable over the other for predicting progression to TB disease [

         ]. Performing TSTs may require fewer resources than IGRAs and may be more familiar to practitioners in resource-constrained settings; however, global TST shortages have reduced use of TST in scaling up programmatic management of TBI. The WHO operational Handbook provides guidance for implementation of testing for TB infection, including the newer tuberculosis antigen-based skin tests (TBST) [

         There is no clear advantage of the IGRA or the TST for predicting future risk of TB disease; the decision to select a test should be based on the setting, cost and availability. In very high-risk populations, there may be an advantage of performing both TST and IGRA, to enhance sensitivity if a first test is negative. In general, among individuals with a given risk factor, those with positive IGRAs have higher rates of TB disease than those with positive TST, likely reflecting greater specificity of IGRA  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130580" href="/z/d/graphic/130580.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The key value of a test for TBI is the accuracy of the test in predicting future TB disease, since this risk determines the need for TBI treatment. There have been many longitudinal studies evaluating the risk of TB disease in untreated individuals with a positive TST and/or IGRA. In many of these studies, participants underwent more than one test at the outset, allowing comparison of the predictive accuracy of different tests. Several systematic reviews of these studies have been performed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reviews have focused on studies performing TST and at least one IGRA in specific populations that are frequently candidates for TBI testing: children, immunocompromised individuals, and migrants from high- to low-TB incidence countries. In one review including 17 studies, children with positive IGRA had higher risk of TB in two studies but not three others, there was no difference between TST and IGRA in pooled risk of TB among immunocompromised individuals, and three studies including migrants demonstrated inconsistent results [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. Subsequently, the same authors found that sensitivity to predict future incident TB was greatest with the TST if a cut-point of 5 mm was used (in migrants and children), while the QFT had highest sensitivity in immunocompromised individuals. In all three populations, the highest specificity was observed using a TST of 15 mm as criteria for a positive test [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Meta-analyses have estimated the risk of disease in persons with positive and negative TST or IGRAs [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,52,53
         </a>
         ]. In one study including data from 18 studies and more than 80,000 individuals tested for TB infection, TB disease occurred in 4.0 percent (95% CI 2.6-6.3 percent) of untreated individuals with positive TB infection tests compared with 0.2 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.4 percent) of all untreated individuals with negative TB infection tests [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Findings of earlier reviews differed from one another; one concluded there were no significant differences between TST or IGRA [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ], and another concluded that IGRA had significantly higher positive predictive values [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. These disparate findings reflected differences in inclusion criteria, quality assessments, and meta-analysis methods. However, in both reviews the pooled risk of TB disease among individuals with a positive IGRA was 2.1 percent; emphasizing that the great majority of individuals with a positive IGRA do not develop TB disease. Therefore, the decision to treat also must be based on clinical and epidemiologic assessment of risk for progression to TB disease, not just the test result. These studies also emphasize that while no test can completely exclude the possibility of developing TB disease, a negative TST or IGRA is useful to identify individuals at much lower risk of TB disease.

         Use of IGRA as a confirmatory test for TST has been shown to be effective in contact tracing. In this approach, individuals with positive TST undergo subsequent IGRA testing; TBI treatment is offered only to those with positive IGRA  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116497" href="/z/d/graphic/116497.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). In one study including more than 1800 contacts in school-based outbreaks in Korea, one-third of TST-positive schoolchildren were also IGRA positive; this strategy identified all TST-positive schoolchildren who later developed TB disease [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. In another study including more than 870 household contacts in Spain, this sequential testing strategy was found to be noninferior to tuberculin testing alone for TB prevention [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. These studies suggest that this strategy may be reasonably used to identify those at highest risk of developing TB disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         If an IGRA test is needed to confirm a TST result, it has been suggested that blood be drawn for IGRA within three days of TST placement (ie, at the time of the TST reading), due to a potential concern that prior TST may boost subsequent IGRA results. However, in a systematic review including five studies and more than 200 individuals persons, no significant boosting effect from prior TST on subsequent IGRA results was observed [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. In theory, TST boosts IGRA results only in individuals with prior exposure to
         <em>
          M. tuberculosis
         </em>
         antigens; it is well established that the TST itself does not induce a cell-mediated immune response to
         <em>
          M. tuberculosis
         </em>
         . However, the studies that described boosting of IGRA by TST were not designed to distinguish whether this occurred only in those with true TBI. Regardless of remaining uncertainties regarding potential boosting, a positive IGRA result obtained after prior TST should be interpreted as a positive test for TBI.

If a first test is positive, but the risk of TBI treatment is high or the pretest likelihood of TBI is very low, a positive second test (with an assay of the alternative type, eg, using TST for the second test if IGRA was used for the first test, or vice versa) increases the risk of TB disease. Similarly, if a first test is negative, but the likelihood of TBI is high, or, if infected, the risk of disease is high (eg, in a patient with immunosuppression), then results of a second test (with an assay of the alternative type) may be useful; in such a case, a discordant result on the second test implies a higher risk of disease than concordant negative tests. The risk of TB disease is highest with concordant positive results, lowest with concordant negative results, and intermediate with discordant results [

         The approach to TBI testing varies by country. Some guidelines favor use of the TST over IGRA, some favor use of either assay interchangeably, and some favor a two-step approach (TST followed by IGRA) in certain circumstances  (

         In high TB incidence countries, there is no added value in using IGRAs to diagnose TBI, as the focus of prevention and control is to identify and treat active cases. In low TB incidence countries, given the evidence available, IGRAs could be used in contact-tracing algorithms applying the two-step approach (following TST, in TST-positive subjects).

         Serial testing (eg, annual screening) is warranted for residents and employees of homeless shelters and correctional facilities, given the risk of TB exposure in these settings. In addition, serial testing may be reasonable in some health care facilities for HCWs at increased risk for occupational exposure to TB (such as pulmonologists or respiratory therapists) or for HCWs in certain settings (such as emergency departments) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19

         Approximately half of the lifetime risk of reactivation occurs in the first one to two years following infection, so it is important to target those who convert their TST or IGRA for treatment. (See

          "Treatment of tuberculosis infection (latent tuberculosis) in nonpregnant adults without HIV infection"

         United States guidelines recommend use of either TST or IGRA for serial testing screening  (

         ) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Conversion of a TST or IGRA from negative to positive indicates new infection. Given the difficulties of interpretation of serial IGRA testing, we favor use of TST for TBI screening in individuals who are tested on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the TST is used, a two-step TST protocol should be followed (ie, if the first TST is negative, then a second TST is performed within one to four weeks). For the TST, conversion is defined as a new positive test (with an increase of ≥10 mm) in the size of the TST reaction compared with the previous two years. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8005.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         For the IGRA, conversion is defined as a change from a negative to a positive result as determined by the cut point of the assay used; however, the use of a simple IGRA conversion cut point may be problematic due to inherent variability of these tests [

          Indications for sputum testing
         </strong>
         – Patients with relevant clinical manifestations (cough &gt;2 weeks' duration, fevers, night sweats, weight loss) and/or abnormal chest radiograph should submit three sputum specimens (obtained via cough or induction at least eight hours apart and including at least one early-morning specimen) for acid-fast bacilli smear, mycobacterial culture, and nucleic acid amplification testing [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69

         ]. Symptoms related to extrapulmonary sites should also be evaluated as appropriate. (See

         For specimens collected in a health care setting, standard respiratory precautions should be used (negative pressure room and N95 mask for health care workers). For inpatients (who should be in a respiratory isolation room), sputum collection should be performed within the room. For outpatients, sputum should be collected with care to minimize exposure to others. (See

          Chest radiograph interpretation
         </strong>
         – The chest radiograph is normal in 85 percent of patients with TB infection [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. A chest radiograph is considered abnormal if it demonstrates parenchymal abnormalities, particularly opacification of the upper lobe or superior segment of the lower lobe. Radiographs demonstrating stable upper lobe fibro-nodular disease or calcified granulomas are considered to demonstrate evidence of previous TB disease and indicate the patient is at increased risk of reactivation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60941" href="/z/d/graphic/60941.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a systematic review including 25 studies of patients with TBI, 15 percent (95% CI 12-18 percent) had findings on chest radiograph suggestive of prior TB infection (such as calcified nodules, noncalcified nodules, pleural thickening, and fibrotic scarring) [

         These lesions may be difficult to distinguish TBI from lesions of TB disease; therefore, in the setting of any radiographic abnormality, we have a low threshold for pursuing sputum testing. For individuals with negative sputum for AFB smear and TB culture, then the person is considered to have 'inactive TB' which is associated with increased future risk of reactivation. These individuals warrant treatment of TB infection (See

         This approach is based on a meta-analysis including more than 9000 patients with HIV infection who were not on ART (among whom the prevalence of TB disease among patients with HIV infection was 5 percent) in which absence of these clinical manifestations had a negative predictive value of 98 percent [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67

         The approach to balancing the risk of disease and the risk of treatment depends in part on the treatment regimen utilized. The relationship between the risk of adverse events and increasing age is well documented for
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8577" href="/z/d/drug information/8577.html" rel="external">
          isoniazid

         . In individuals with conditions conferring moderate or slightly increased risk who would be treated with isoniazid, we carefully assess the balance of risks and harms in individuals &gt;50 years of age (especially individuals &gt;65 years of age). For other TBI regimens, such as isoniazid-rifapentine for three months or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9864" href="/z/d/drug information/9864.html" rel="external">
          rifampin

         for four months, the relationship between the risk of adverse events and increasing age is less clear. Until further data on the age-related risks of adverse events with these regimens are available, it is reasonable to adhere to the same cautions as for isoniazid. (See
