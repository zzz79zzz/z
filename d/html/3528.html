The key prognostic indicators are peak volume of oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) and prognostic scores such as the Heart Failure Survival Score and the Seattle Heart Failure Model. Many other predictors of poor prognosis have been identified, including New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and hyponatremia. However, use of an individual clinical factor to identify high risk is frequently problematic, given the complexity of HF and the multiple neurohumoral, hemodynamic, and electrophysiologic factors that may contribute to morbidity and mortality. Use of multivariable models has significantly improved our ability to identify high-risk patients.

This group of diseases includes hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, glycogen storage diseases, and genetic deficiencies such as Fabry disease. Transplant evaluation in these patients requires a careful work-up to identify the underlying disease, as post-transplant care may need to be modified. Additionally, for infiltrative disorders, the involvement of other organs needs to be assessed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4943.html" rel="external">"Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies"</a>.)</p><p>The post-transplant outcomes of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are excellent and comparable to patients with dilated cardiomyopathies or coronary artery disease [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Patients with sarcoidosis also have excellent post-transplant outcomes, but generally those patients who have been transplanted did not have active extracardiac disease [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Patients with hemochromatosis may require combined heart and liver transplant. The infiltrative cardiomyopathy that has generated the most interest in the last few years has been amyloidosis. With amyloid, it is imperative to identify the etiology as either being due to light chain AL amyloid or a transthyretin genetic mutation (TTR). The ISHLT guidelines support cardiac transplantation for AL amyloid patients in conjunction with stem cell transplantation performed as soon as possible after recovery from the heart transplantation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. These patients should be carefully selected with predominantly cardiac involvement (51c,D) [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].

Thus, heart transplantation is performed for diverse cardiovascular lesions with poor prognosis. Patients with both complex intracardiac abnormalities and significant irreversible pulmonary vascular obstructive disease may require heart/lung transplantation.

Many programs have routinely excluded patients over the age of 60 to 65, but most feel that physiologic age is more important than chronologic age. Some centers will perform transplants up to age 70 years with the older patients required to meet additional selection criteria such as less than two prior open heart procedures, preserved renal function, no prior cerebrovascular events, and preserved hepatic function.</p><p>A report based on United Network of Organ Sharing data for 14,401 first-time transplant recipients between 1999 and 2006 demonstrated that patients ≥60 years of age more frequently had comorbidities than younger patients and that their overall survival post-transplant was lower than in younger patients [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. However, cumulative five-year survival for patients ≥60 years of age was only slightly lower than that for younger patients (69 versus 75 percent). Multivariate analysis revealed recipient age ≥60 years, donor age, ischemic time, creatinine, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus to be independent predictors of mortality.</p><p>Carefully selected patients over 60 years of age have a survival rate comparable to that in younger patients. This was illustrated in a report that compared 63 patients transplanted at 65 years of age or older (mean age 67) with 63 matched younger patients (mean age 48) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Survival was comparable for both groups at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years; there was also no significant difference in the incidence of rejection or infection.
