         Once the diagnosis of unstable angina or an acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is made, the early management of the patient involves the simultaneous achievement of several goals, including relief of ischemic pain, assessment of the hemodynamic state and correction of abnormalities that are present, determining the optimal timing of cardiac catheterization and potential percutaneous coronary intervention, and initiation of antithrombotic therapy. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         These early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are followed by the initiation of short- and long-term interventions aimed at improving in-hospital and long-term outcomes. This topic will summarize the management of patients with unstable angina or acute NSTEMI in the hours and days following reperfusion. The reader will be directed to a more detailed discussion of these issues in other topics.

         The management of the patient with a STEMI or with a complication of an acute MI (eg, cardiogenic shock, mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect) is discussed separately. (See

         Following initial therapy as discussed above, further medical therapy includes oral beta blockers (if not already given), statins, and possibly nitrates, aldosterone antagonists, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. There is only a limited role for calcium channel blockers and oral anticoagulation, and no role for hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.

         Patients who did not receive a beta blocker during the first 24 hours because of early contraindications should be reevaluated for beta blocker candidacy. An oral cardioselective beta blocker, such as

         The optimal duration of beta blocker therapy after MI is not known. We believe the evidence supports the use of beta blockers in patients with MI for as long as three years. The evidence supporting a longer duration, or indefinite therapy, is limited. The efficacy of beta blocker therapy is related in part to the degree of heart rate slowing. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See

         </span>
         As in the acute setting, red blood cell transfusion is generally reserved for severe or symptomatic anemia, such as hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL or hemoglobin 8 to 10 g/dL with hemodynamic instability or ongoing ischemia. Clinical judgment is required to determine if transfusion is likely to improve oxygen delivery or if there are other reasons to consider transfusion such as active bleeding or trauma. In deciding when to transfuse, individual patient characteristics such as the rate of blood loss and severity of myocardial ischemia need to be taken into account.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for using a restrictive transfusion strategy (limiting transfusions, transfusing for a lower rather than a higher hemoglobin level) includes avoiding risks of transfusion reactions or transfusion-transmitted infection and limiting burdens and costs while using evidence-based thresholds for optimal outcomes. While anemia correlates with worse outcomes, this is likely to be an association rather than causation. (See

         Chest pain after NSTEMI may occur and it is important to determine whether this is representative of recurrent ischemia/infarction or simply resolving discomfort after the initial event. Diagnosing recurrent ischemia/infarction can sometimes be difficult but the presence of typical anginal pain, ischemic ST-segment shifts on the electrocardiogram (ECG), or a typical rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers are useful distinguishing features. Coronary angiography is sometimes necessary to evaluate recurrent chest pain. Chest pain after coronary intervention is also common and can be sorted out in a similar fashion. In particular, the lack of ST-segment shifts on the ECG following coronary intervention is often a useful discriminating feature.

         Among patients with an NSTEMI who have undergone apparently successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), recurrent ischemia or reinfarction represents either ischemia in a coronary distribution not revascularized or possible stent thrombosis. Recurrent ischemia is often manifest by the recurrence of symptoms and new or changing ECG abnormalities.

         </span>
         Initial medical management of recurrent ischemia should include escalation of therapy with beta blockers and nitrates to decrease myocardial oxygen demand and reduce ischemia. Early PCI is considered for these patients, particularly if electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia is present. Intravenous anticoagulation should be initiated if it is not already being administered. For patients with hemodynamic instability, poor left ventricular function, or a large area of myocardium at risk, insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump should also be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
         PCI is the treatment of choice for patients with recurrent ischemia, unless the patient's coronary anatomy or clinical status preclude coronary intervention.

         Acute pericarditis, generally defined as a pericardial friction rub with or without chest discomfort, may rarely complicate the course of an acute NSTEMI. Chest pain is typically pleuritic. Pain in one or both trapezius ridges is especially consistent with the diagnosis. The evaluation and management of this complication are discussed separately. (See

         The optimal duration of hospitalization for patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) who have been revascularized with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been defined. The employment of early angiography and revascularization has led to shorter hospitalizations for patients and the use of stenting and potent antiplatelet therapy in the periprocedural period has led to a reduction in recurrent ischemic events. On the other hand, potent antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapies are associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, which may complicate and lengthen hospitalization.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to discharge, the patient should undergo risk stratification. Other components of predischarge planning include counseling about changes in lifestyle and appropriate medical therapy to reduce the risk for further ischemic episodes.

         The first major step in the transition from acute care to hospital discharge in patients with NSTEACS is ambulation. The proper timing of ambulation is patient and institution dependent and requires balancing the risk of bleeding after coronary intervention with the deleterious effects of deconditioning that can be induced by prolonged bed rest.

         Among patients who have undergone percutaneous revascularization, progressive ambulation can be started after the time required to achieve adequate hemostasis (often three to six hours) in patients who are hemodynamically stable and not having ongoing ischemic symptoms. For patients who have undergone radial (rather than femoral) catheterization, ambulation may be started earlier.

         Multiple imaging techniques for assessing left ventricular function are available and each has equivalent prognostic value in the post-MI patient. In general, echocardiography should be used for routine assessment of LVEF after an NSTEACS. (See

          Risk factor modification
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The major modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia) need to be evaluated and corrected as necessary. A long-term plan for their control needs to be discussed with the patient; referral to an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program is useful for this purpose. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk factor modification'
         </a>
         above.)
