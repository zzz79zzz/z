The therapy focuses upon improving problematic interpersonal relationships or circumstances that are directly related to the current depressive episode. Interpersonal relationships and depressive symptoms appear to affect each other in a reciprocal manner [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>]. Improvement of interpersonal functioning reduces symptoms, which leads to additional spontaneous improvement of interpersonal functioning, which in turn reduces depressive symptoms further.</p><p>IPT was developed in the 1970s as a treatment for depression and for many years was used only by investigators in clinical trials [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Demonstrated success in multiple studies eventually led clinicians to discover that IPT is a practical, user-friendly treatment for many different types of depressed patients, including pregnant, postpartum, and primary care patients [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Neuroimaging studies using sequential single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) suggest that successful treatment of major depression with IPT leads to changes in brain function [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Many of these changes overlap with changes in brain function seen in patients treated with an antidepressant, including regional brain metabolic abnormalities that tended to normalize with treatment.</p><p>Clinical guidelines endorse IPT monotherapy for treatment of mild to moderate depression [<a href="#rid9">9,12,13</a>]. In addition, IPT is used to treat other psychiatric illnesses, including bipolar disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety disorders [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the indications, theoretical foundation, general concepts, and efficacy of IPT for treating depressed adults. Specific IPT interventions and procedures for treating depressed adults are discussed separately, as are other treatments of depression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14680.html" rel="external">"Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for depressed adults: Specific interventions and techniques"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14685.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Choosing treatment for resistant depression"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91120529"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IPT is indicated for depressed patients [<a href="#rid9">9,12,13</a>]. The primary goals of treatment are symptom remission and improved interpersonal functioning.</p><p>As with all psychotherapies, the patient must have the necessary motivation, interest, and cognitive capacity to participate in treatment and complete assigned tasks.</p><p>There are no specific contraindications to IPT. However, patients must be able to tolerate elicitation of strong affects such as sadness and anxiety, which may occur during treatment [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Psychotic patients are not candidates for most affect-focused psychotherapies, including IPT.</p><p>IPT may be used alone or in combination with an antidepressant medication, depending upon symptom severity, as well as past treatment history, patient preference, and cost [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Monotherapy with IPT is often used to treat mild to moderate depression. In addition, IPT alone may be helpful for more severely ill patients. However, patients with moderate to severe depression, especially moderate to severe suicidal ideation or moderate to severe neurovegetative symptoms (decreased sleep, appetite, energy, and libido), generally require pharmacotherapy in addition to IPT [<a href="#rid9">9,12,16</a>]. Treating depressive disorders with IPT plus medication is supported by meta-analyses that found combination treatment was superior to medication alone [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].</p><p>Combining IPT with pharmacotherapy is readily accomplished because IPT is based upon the medical model. (See <a class="local">'Medical model'</a> below.)</p><p>IPT is efficacious for several types of depressed patients, including those who are [<a href="#rid9">9,12,13</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnant</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postpartum</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At risk for postpartum depression</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mothers with a psychiatrically ill child</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mothers of infants and toddlers</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At risk for recurrences of depression</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>HIV-positive</p><p></p><p>There is also evidence that IPT is useful for primary care settings and in low- and middle-income countries [<a href="#rid9">9,12,13,19</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Evidence of efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91116976"><span class="h1">THEORETICAL FOUNDATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The theoretical roots of IPT explain its conceptual approach and distinguish it from other psychotherapies [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91116983"><span class="h2">Interpersonal school of psychoanalysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IPT is based upon the theoretical framework of the interpersonal school of psychoanalysis, which maintains that relationships are the most basic and important aspect of human experience, rather than drives [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. This school emphasized that interpersonal conflicts and social problems cause depression and other forms of psychopathology, as opposed to the psychoanalytic focus on intra-psychic conflict as the primary cause of depression [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. IPT was also shaped by the belief that psychotherapy for depression should address the patient’s social and cultural experiences [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>This framework is supported by research that suggests a reciprocal link between interpersonal relationships and depressive symptoms. One study found that confiding, supportive interpersonal relationships were protective against depression [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], and other studies have found that relationship distress was associated with higher rates of major depression [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Conversely, studies have found that depression was associated with impaired communication and activity within relationships [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], and higher rates of marital discord [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91116990"><span class="h2">Attachment theory</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IPT also draws upon attachment theory, which states that the relationship between a caregiver and infant is crucial to survival and remains essential throughout life [<a href="#rid20">20,26</a>]. Attachment helps determine whether development is normal. A secure attachment early in life lays the foundation for psychological security and a capacity for healthy intimacy in adult relationships, whereas early disturbances in attachment contribute to the vulnerability to depression and other psychopathology. In addition, differences in early attachment experiences translate into different adult relationship styles. Adult attachment styles appear to moderate treatment outcomes with IPT. (See <a class="local">'Predictors of treatment response'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H174665058"><span class="h2">Stress-diathesis model</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The stress-diathesis model is utilized in IPT. The model states that depression occurs when patients with a biological vulnerability (diathesis) to the illness experience adverse life events of sufficient severity to provoke the diathesis [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Patients are not responsible for causing their illness but can help themselves by actively addressing the recent interpersonal problems that trigger the underlying biologic illness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91116997"><span class="h1">GENERAL CONCEPTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IPT is a time-limited, structured, manual-guided treatment based upon the medical model [<a href="#rid2">2,28</a>]. The therapy emphasizes current relationships and the connection between recent adverse life events and depression. The putative mechanism of action is that mood improves as the patient resolves interpersonal problems due to grief, role disputes, role transitions, and general interpersonal deficits [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91117005"><span class="h2">Medical model</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment with IPT occurs within the context of the medical model, which views depression as a clinical syndrome, distinct from the patient’s personality [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The clinician initially takes a psychiatric history, performs a mental status examination, and diagnoses a current episode of major depression according to criteria from the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/z/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The explanation of the diagnosis should liken depression to other medical illnesses ("no different than asthma, diabetes or hypertension"). In addition, the clinician should stress that [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient probably has an inherited, biologic vulnerability to depression</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is not the patient’s fault for developing depression (“just like it is not someone's fault for developing asthma”)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Depression does not represent a character flaw</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91117012"><span class="h2">Link between life events and depression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Throughout treatment, the clinician emphasizes the connection between psychosocial stressors and the patient's depression. Therapy focuses upon identifying the interpersonal antecedents of depressive episodes and examining the impact of both positive and negative life events on the patient’s symptoms. The basic principle is that the depressive syndrome will improve as interpersonal problems resolve. In addition, the bi-directional nature of the relationship between interpersonal functioning and mood is highlighted. In an iterative process, improved mood allows patients to more effectively manage interpersonal stressors, which leads to further symptomatic relief.</p><p>The clinician does not take the position that life events cause depression per se. Rather, the clinician acknowledges that mood symptoms can contribute to negative interpersonal interactions just as problematic interpersonal events contribute to mood destabilization. As these effects are co-occurring, it is impossible to assign causal roles. From a treatment standpoint, it is important to address both aspects of this dynamic.</p><p>IPT and psychodynamic psychotherapy both focus upon relationships and events but differ in several ways. IPT assumes that recent life events are associated with onset and maintenance of the current depressive episode, and that addressing these "here and now" proximal events resolves the depressive episode more rapidly than addressing older "there and then" conflicts [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Another difference is that IPT is not aimed at unconscious processes and does not focus upon the transference relationship between the clinician and the patient [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14689.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Psychodynamic psychotherapy"</a>.)</p><p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) also addresses life events and relationships. IPT and CBT are similar in that they are both time-limited, manualized, evidence-based therapies for depression [<a href="#rid18">18,32</a>]. They differ in that IPT focuses primarily on feelings and relationships, whereas CBT emphasizes thoughts and behaviors [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. In addition, CBT is a highly structured treatment that makes use of handouts and written homework assignments [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. IPT has an overarching framework, but the sessions themselves are delivered flexibly.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91117026"><span class="h2">Interpersonal problem areas</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are four categories of interpersonal problems that are identified in IPT as associated with the onset or maintenance of depression: grief (complicated bereavement), role dispute, role transition, and interpersonal deficits [<a href="#rid13">13,20</a>]. Therapy focuses upon the one or two most problematic areas.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91117033"><span class="h3">Grief</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The death or disappearance of an important person that was not adequately resolved results in an abnormal grief reaction that is delayed or prolonged [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The goals of treatment consist of helping the patient experience the normal grief process, which includes feeling pain, sadness, and other emotions; letting go of the deceased; and moving on with life by re-establishing social contacts and resuming activities [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p>Losses other than death, such as loss of physical health or the end of a relationship, are categorized as role transition. (See <a class="local">'Role transition'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91117040"><span class="h3">Role dispute</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A role dispute consists of a conflict with a significant other (spouse, partner, family member, close friend, or coworker) over different expectations about the relationship. Most often the dispute is with a spouse or romantic partner [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The inability to negotiate a compromise leads to an unsatisfying relationship that in turn is associated with the onset or maintenance of the depression. Therapy focuses on helping the patient to understand the nature of the dispute and to develop skills for resolving the dispute.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91117047"><span class="h3">Role transition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients may experience difficulty in coping with a major change in life circumstances. Role transitions occur in many domains, including interpersonal roles (eg, marriage, becoming a parent, or divorce), occupation (eg, graduation from school, leaving one job for another, or retirement), physical health (eg, diagnosis of a serious medical illness), living conditions (eg, moving), or socioeconomic status (eg, financial problems) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. The transition is conceptualized as moving from one social role to another social role. The goal of treatment is to establish a realistic view of both the previous role (which is usually idealized) and the new role (which is usually devalued), mourn the loss of the old role, and then to develop better strategies to cope with the new role.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91117054"><span class="h3">Interpersonal deficits</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Interpersonal deficits are marked by pervasive problems starting and maintaining relationships; social isolation; and chronically impoverished, contentious, and unfulfilling relationships. Although many patients seeking IPT treatment have deficits in interpersonal functioning, the interpersonal deficits category is reserved for cases when there is no clear acute interpersonal event associated with the onset or maintenance of the depressive episode. Therapy aims to reduce social isolation by increasing new relationships. Patients with chronic impairment in social functioning, who lack the life events upon which IPT focuses, fare worse in treatment [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91117124"><span class="h1">EVIDENCE OF EFFICACY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Research studies indicate that IPT effectively treats depressed adults.</p><p>Psychotherapy trials, like pharmacotherapy trials, are methodologically variable. Some psychotherapy trials are rigorous and specify a priori hypotheses and analytic tests, use active psychotherapy comparators that control for the nonspecific aspects of psychotherapy, use standardized diagnostic criteria and outcome measures, carefully blind outcome ratings, develop manuals for the psychotherapies that are studied and measure adherence, and stratify patients on predetermined risk variables. In less meticulous studies, an increased risk of bias exists because they use open-label designs, less rigorous comparators (eg, treatment as usual or waiting lists), fail to adequately blind outcome ratings, or do not analyze the results by intent-to-treat. Although it is commonly believed that blinding of patients in psychotherapy is less successful compared with pharmacotherapy trials, this has never been studied.</p><p>Clinical trials with different control conditions have demonstrated the efficacy of IPT for acute and maintenance treatment of unipolar major depression in specialty mental health and primary care settings [<a href="#rid9">9,12,13</a>]. In addition, a meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials showed that IPT improves functioning in depressed patients [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Furthermore, IPT is efficacious for several subgroups of depressed patients, including women in the childbearing years and patients infected with HIV. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4202853"><span class="h2">Depressive syndromes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IPT can effectively treat acute episodes of unipolar major depression. In addition, IPT can delay and prevent recurrent episodes [<a href="#rid38">38-42</a>]. However, patients greater than 70 years of age and patients with dysthymic disorder fare better with an antidepressant than with IPT for acute and maintenance treatment of depression [<a href="#rid42">42-45</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2291366"><span class="h3">Acute unipolar major depression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The efficacy of IPT for acute unipolar major depression is well established [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. A meta-analysis of 31 randomized trials (sample size not reported) compared IPT with control conditions such as usual care, waiting list, or pill placebo, and found a significant, clinically moderate to large effect favoring IPT [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Treating approximately three patients with IPT yielded a beneficial response in one additional patient that would not have occurred with the control condition (number needed to treat of three). A subsequent series of meta-analyses also found that IPT was superior to usual care, waiting list, or pill placebo [<a href="#rid48">48</a>].</p><p>In addition, meta-analyses of randomized trials have found that IPT works at least as well as other psychotherapies for treating acute major depression [<a href="#rid18">18,47,49</a>]. As an example, a network meta-analysis identified 331 randomized trials that studied different psychotherapies in patients with depressive disorders (n &gt;34,000) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. The psychotherapies included IPT (35 trials), behavioral activation, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), problem-solving therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and supportive therapy. The analysis compared the efficacy of each therapy with each of the other therapies, by using results from direct comparisons between the therapies as well as indirectly comparing therapies through their relative effect with a common comparator (eg, usual care or waiting list). The benefit of IPT was comparable to that of each other therapy, including CBT. Additional information about the efficacy of IPT compared with other psychotherapies is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment", section on 'Selecting a specific psychotherapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"</a>.)</p><p>The benefit of IPT for acute depression also appears to be comparable to pharmacotherapy. In a meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials (number of patients not specified) that compared IPT with antidepressant medication, the benefit was comparable for the two groups [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p>However, adding IPT to drug therapy does not provide any advantage over drug therapy alone. A meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials (number of patients not specified) compared IPT plus antidepressants with antidepressants alone, and found that the benefit was comparable for the two groups [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2291374"><span class="h3">Recurrent unipolar major depression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Major depression often recurs. For patients who have recovered from an episode of depression, randomized trials indicate that maintenance IPT can efficaciously delay and prevent recurrences of major depression. As an example, a systematic review identified seven randomized trials (number of patients not reported) and conducted of a series of meta-analyses that evaluated the efficacy of once-monthly IPT in patients who recovered from depression [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. The primary findings were as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrence was less likely in patients who received IPT plus pill placebo compared with pill placebo alone (odds ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrence was less likely in patients who received IPT plus antidepressant compared with antidepressant alone (odds ratio 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.8)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrence was comparable for patients who received IPT plus pill placebo and patients who received antidepressant alone (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 0.5-5.5)</p><p></p><p>However, the benefit of maintenance IPT may be less robust for patients age 70 years and older [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p>Monthly sessions of maintenance IPT seem to be as effective as more frequently scheduled sessions for preventing recurrences in patients who have recovered from an episode of major depression [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].

In discussing this paradoxical finding, the investigators hypothesized that the ability to identify maladaptive problems in relationships was potentially helpful in IPT, allowing patients to shift the blame from themselves (“something is wrong with me”) to a more adaptive focus on addressing relationship difficulties in therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2291061"><span class="h2">Sleep EEG profiles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pretreatment sleep parameters may be associated with response to IPT.

Monotherapy with IPT is often used to treat mild to moderate depression. Patients with moderate to severe depression, especially moderate to severe suicidal ideation or moderate to severe neurovegetative symptoms (decreased sleep, appetite, energy, and libido), generally require pharmacotherapy in addition to IPT. Combining IPT with pharmacotherapy is readily accomplished because IPT is based upon the medical model. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Theoretical foundation</strong> – The theoretical foundation of IPT includes the principle that relationships are the most important aspect of human experience. In addition, IPT draws upon the theory that the relationship between a caregiver and infant is crucial to survival and helps determine whether development is normal. IPT also applies a model which states that depression occurs when patients with a biological vulnerability to the illness experience adverse life events of sufficient severity. (See <a class="local">'Theoretical foundation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General concepts</strong> – IPT is a time-limited, structured, manual-guided treatment based upon the medical model. The therapy emphasizes current relationships and the connection between recent adverse life events and depression. The putative mechanism of action is that mood improves as the patient resolves interpersonal problems due to grief, role disputes, role transitions, and interpersonal deficits. (See <a class="local">'General concepts'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evidence of efficacy</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Depressive syndromes</strong> – IPT works at least as well as other psychotherapies. IPT also delays and prevents recurrent episodes in patients less than 70 years old. However, older patients and patients with dysthymic disorder fare better with an antidepressant than with IPT. (See <a class="local">'Evidence of efficacy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Depressive syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Medical comorbidities</strong> – Some depressed patients with a comorbid nonpsychiatric medical illness may respond to IPT. Depressed patients infected with HIV benefitted from IPT, but depressed patients with coronary heart disease did not. (See <a class="local">'Depressed patients with medical comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Across different settings</strong> – IPT has been transported from specialty mental health clinics and demonstrated efficacy for treating depression in primary care settings, community settings, and low- and middle-income countries. (See <a class="local">'Depressed patients in different settings'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Adolescents and older patients</strong> – IPT has demonstrated success in treating adolescent patients. However, the results with older patients are mixed. Acute episodes of bereavement-related major depression in older patients appear to be better treated with pharmacotherapy than with IPT. Maintenance treatment with IPT appears to prevent depressive recurrences in patients age 60 to 69 years, but not in patients age 70 years and older. (See <a class="local">'Depression in adolescent and older patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Women of childbearing age</strong> – IPT is efficacious for several different populations of depressed women in their childbearing years, including women who are pregnant, postpartum, have had a miscarriage, have a psychiatrically ill child, are economically disadvantaged, or have a history of sexual abuse. IPT also appears to prevent postpartum depression in women who are at risk for the disorder. (See <a class="local">'Women in the childbearing years'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Predictors of response</strong> – Response to IPT may initially be greater with an increased number of sessions per week. In addition, response is associated with fewer comorbid anxiety symptoms, less social impairment, single or separated marital status, the presence of obsessive-compulsive personality traits, and lower levels of attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety. In addition, IPT has been successfully used in more severely depressed patients. (See <a class="local">'Predictors of treatment response'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">Klerman, GL, Weissman, et al.
