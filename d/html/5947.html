The bilirubin can be either unconjugated or conjugated.</p><p>Hyperbilirubinemia in children is usually unconjugated and most often caused by problems with red blood cell stability and survival or by defects in the bilirubin-conjugating enzyme uridine diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). In contrast, disorders that result in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are usually caused by intrinsic liver dysfunction. However, some diseases cause both unconjugated and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia because they affect several different aspects of hepatocyte function.</p><p>This topic will present an overview of the causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in children and infants beyond the neonatal period and discuss the evaluation and management of such patients, which varies with the underlying disease.</p><p>The evaluation of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates and the causes and diagnostic approach for the adult with jaundice, which are somewhat different, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5008.html" rel="external">"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm newborns: Screening"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3620.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to the adult with jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3615.html" rel="external">"Classification and causes of jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1262422632"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3006000391"><span class="h2">Jaundice</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and sclerae that is an important symptom of elevated serum bilirubin, which is caused by an abnormality of bilirubin metabolism or excretion.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H983438153"><span class="h2">Hyperbilirubinemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hyperbilirubinemia refers to elevated serum total bilirubin. After the neonatal period, the upper limit of normal is 1 mg/dL (17 micromol/L), or 1.3 mg/dL (22 micromol/L) in some laboratories. Jaundice usually becomes clinically apparent when the serum total bilirubin concentration is greater than 2 to 3 mg/dL (34 to 51 micromol/L), but the threshold for clinically apparent jaundice may vary among patients.</p><p>Hyperbilirubinemia can be categorized as conjugated or unconjugated. Unconjugated bilirubin is a waste product of hemoglobin breakdown that is taken up by the liver, where it is converted by the enzyme uridine diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) into conjugated bilirubin. Conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and is excreted into the bile to be cleared from the body. These categories have important diagnostic implications:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong> is defined as serum conjugated bilirubin concentration &gt;0.5 mg/dL (8.6 micromol/L).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">More commonly, the conjugated component is estimated by measuring "direct" bilirubin, which is elevated if it is &gt;1 mg/dL (17 micromol/L) if the total bilirubin is &lt;5 mg/dL (85 micromol/L), <strong>or</strong> more than 20 percent of the total bilirubin if the total bilirubin is &gt;5 mg/dL (85 micromol/L). The upper limit of normal for direct-reacting bilirubin is higher because it includes conjugated bilirubin and the delta fraction, which represents bilirubin covalently bound to albumin [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Elevation in conjugated (or direct) bilirubin is an abnormal finding that requires further evaluation. The differential diagnosis in neonates differs from that in older children and adults and is discussed in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5941.html" rel="external">"Approach to evaluation of cholestasis in neonates and young infants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3615.html" rel="external">"Classification and causes of jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia", section on 'Disorders associated with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong> is defined as hyperbilirubinemia without an increase in the conjugated component. Thus, it is hyperbilirubinemia in which conjugated bilirubin is &lt;1 mg/dL (17 micromol/L) if the total bilirubin is &lt;5 mg/dL, <strong>or</strong> less than 20 percent of the total bilirubin if the total bilirubin is &gt;5 mg/dL (85 micromol/L).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CAUSES OF UNCONJUGATED HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hyperbilirubinemia in children is usually unconjugated and most often caused by Gilbert syndrome or hemolysis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66972" href="/d/graphic/66972.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is caused by one of three basic pathophysiologic mechanisms or a combination thereof  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121543" href="/d/graphic/121543.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51621" href="/d/graphic/51621.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bilirubin overproduction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Impaired hepatic bilirubin uptake</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Impaired hepatic bilirubin conjugation</p><p></p><p>Some diseases cause both unconjugated and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia because they affect several different aspects of hepatocyte function.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Bilirubin overproduction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bilirubin overproduction can result from increased breakdown of hemoglobin and other heme-containing proteins, typically due to extravascular or intravascular hemolysis or sometimes due to abnormal erythropoiesis.

Individuals with this condition have reduced bilirubin-UGT activity. They typically present with intermittent episodes of mild jaundice, often triggered by an intercurrent illness, physical exertion, fasting, or interactions with certain drugs. Affected individuals have a benign prognosis. Given the high frequency of this mutation and lack of pathologic consequences, it may be considered a normal variant. Thus, management is directed at establishing the diagnosis of this disorder and thereby avoiding unnecessary evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3578.html" rel="external">"Gilbert syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Crigler-Najjar syndrome types I and II are characterized by the absence or deficiency of the enzyme bilirubin-UGT, respectively. Type I is the more severe form, which presents soon after birth with severe persistent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (no conjugated component) and no evidence of hemolysis or underlying liver disease. If the hyperbilirubinemia is not treated promptly and effectively, the patient may develop bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND), or kernicterus, which usually develops after 14 days of age. Even with optimal medical management, many patients eventually develop BIND. Type II also typically presents in infancy but occasionally is diagnosed later in childhood; it is generally associated with lower serum bilirubin concentrations, but values can overlap with type I, especially when there is underlying acute illness or hemolysis.

This includes complete blood count and reticulocyte count. Serum aminotransferases should also be measured. Elevated values suggest the presence of liver disease (though isolated elevation of aspartate aminotransferase [AST] is also seen in hemolysis), and measurement of the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time may be warranted to assess hepatocyte function.

Of note, testing for G6PD activity may yield false-negative results in some patients who are tested during a severe hemolytic episode. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7111.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and management of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency"</a>.)</p><p>Splenomegaly is a common manifestation of hemolytic anemias due to sequestration of destroyed red blood cells (hypersplenism).
