         Hirsutism is defined as excessive male-pattern hair growth in women of reproductive age. It may be the initial, and possibly only, sign of an underlying androgen disorder, the cutaneous manifestations of which may also include acne and female-pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia). The most common cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In some cases, hirsutism is mild and requires only reassurance and local (nonsystemic) therapy, while in others, it causes significant psychological distress and requires more extensive therapy.

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Hirsutism is a clinical diagnosis defined by the presence of excess terminal hair growth (dark, coarse hairs) in androgen-dependent areas (eg, upper lip, chin, midsternum, upper and lower abdomen, upper arms, upper and lower back, and inner thigh/buttocks) in which women typically have little or no hair [

         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Elevated serum concentrations of androgens in women are referred to as hyperandrogenemia, which can manifest as hyperandrogenism: hirsutism, acne, androgenetic alopecia, and virilization. Hirsutism, defined as excessive growth of terminal hair in women in a male-like pattern, is the most commonly used clinical diagnostic criterion of hyperandrogenism [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Virilization, which is rare, occurs only with severe hyperandrogenemia and typically includes deepening of the voice and clitoromegaly.

         Although women with hirsutism typically present because of concerns regarding their excessive hair growth, most also have an underlying endocrine disorder that should be identified  (

         Identify nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (&lt;5 percent of women with hirsutism, depending upon population). Although this diagnosis will not alter the approach to managing hirsutism in most cases, it is important for future genetic counseling when pursuing fertility. If her partner has NCCAH (which is asymptomatic in adult males) or is a heterozygote carrier, there is a risk that their offspring could have classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency (the severe form of the disease).

As noted, 75 to 80 percent of women who present with hirsutism have PCOS, but it is essential to identify those who have a more serious cause (androgen-secreting tumors and ovarian hyperthecosis).

         Women with PCOS, the most common cause of hirsutism, typically have a peripubertal onset of hirsutism. This is not always the case, however, as adolescent girls with PCOS often take COCs for irregular periods and/or for acne, which may mask or delay the recognition of hirsutism. Women with NCCAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency and idiopathic hirsutism have a similar age of symptom onset. (See

         In contrast, women with androgen-secreting tumors or ovarian hyperthecosis develop hirsutism in the third decade of life or later. Both diagnoses are most common after menopause but sometimes occur before. (See

         Once women with PCOS develop hirsutism, the pattern of hair growth may be variable.

Women with NCCAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency and idiopathic hirsutism have a similar presentation.

         Signs of virilization, including frontal balding, clitoromegaly, increased muscle mass, or deepening of the voice, are seen when the serum testosterone concentration is more severely elevated (eg, over 150 ng/dL), which occurs in ovarian hyperthecosis and androgen-secreting ovarian or adrenal tumors. Although serum testosterone levels may be somewhat elevated in women with PCOS, they are not in a range that can cause virilization. Some disorders cause virilization during pregnancy. (See

          1
         </a>
         ]. It is the most widely used method to quantify hair growth, particularly in trials of pharmacologic therapy for hirsutism. Using this method, nine androgen-sensitive sites are graded from 0 to 4  (

          Interpretation of scores

         – A Ferriman-Gallwey score &gt;8 is considered abnormal for Black or White women, a reasonable cutoff based upon data from two population studies in which only 5 percent of women had scores higher than 7 or 8 [

          1,14

         The expression of hair growth varies among racial groups. Most East Asian women have little body hair, White and Black women have an intermediate amount, and most Mediterranean, South Asian, and Middle Eastern women have substantially greater quantities of body hair, even though serum androgen concentrations are similar in all groups [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-18
         </a>
         ]. A much lower Ferriman-Gallwey score (≥2) is considered to be abnormal in Asian women than other groups as they are less likely to manifest hirsutism resulting from androgen excess [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,19
         </a>
         ]. For Mediterranean, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern women, a Ferriman-Gallwey score ≥9 to 10 is considered abnormal and for East Asian and Asian American women, a score ≥2 is abnormal. (See

         Although we use the Ferriman-Gallwey score to assess the severity of hirsutism at baseline and at follow-up visits to monitor response to pharmacologic and direct hair removal therapies [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21

         Most women have been using cosmetic (mechanical) measures (shaving, plucking), especially on the face, by the time they see a clinician, so their Ferriman-Gallwey score at baseline may not be an accurate reflection of the severity and distribution of their hair growth. However, details about the distribution and severity of facial hair (before cosmetic [mechanical] measures were used) can be obtained from the patient. In addition, nonfacial skin is less often shaved or plucked and therefore may reflect the actual hirsutism status better.

          15,22
         </a>

          Serum total testosterone –
         </strong>
         We measure serum total testosterone in women with any degree of hirsutism. It is best assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), an accurate and specific method. With LC-MS/MS, the upper limit of normal for serum testosterone in women is in the 45 to 60 ng/dL range (1.6 to 2.1 nmol/L). The immunoassays that are available in most hospital laboratories are not suitable to accurately measure testosterone in women [

         Women with PCOS have serum testosterone concentrations that may be in the normal range (up to the upper limit of normal, which varies between 45 and 60 ng/dL depending upon the laboratory [0.69 to 2.1 nmol/L]), or elevated but below 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L). Although the degree of hyperandrogenemia may not correlate well with the severity of hirsutism, it does appear to correlate with metabolic risks observed in women with PCOS [

         We also suggest testing for NCCAH due to 21-serum hydroxylase deficiency in hyperandrogenemic women by measuring an 8 AM 17-hydroxyprogesterone level. In clinical practice, it is unusual to identify NCCAH in a woman having an endocrine work-up for hirsutism unless a circulating androgen is elevated.

         ]. The most common form of CAH, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, affects approximately 1:10,000 to 1:15,000 people in the United States and Europe. Among the Inuit population, the occurrence of the classic salt-wasting form of this disorder may be as high as 1 in 282 individuals [

          33
         </a>
         ]. For women who have some spontaneous menstrual cycles, this should be done in the early follicular phase, while for those without cycles, it can be drawn on a random day. A morning value of 17-hydroxyprogesterone greater than 200 ng/dL in the early follicular phase strongly suggests the diagnosis, which may be confirmed by a high-dose (250 mcg) corticotropin (ACTH) 1-24 (cosyntropin) stimulation test. The response to cosyntropin is exaggerated, with most patients having values exceeding 1500 ng/dL (43 nmol/L) 60 minutes after administration of cosyntropin. (See

         Some women with hirsutism seek advice when they are already taking pharmacotherapy, usually COCs. Measuring serum androgens is generally not useful in this setting, because COCs suppress serum gonadotropins and ovarian androgens, most importantly testosterone. However, if an evaluation is done, it is best to discontinue the COC for at least 8 to 12 weeks as it takes at least this length of time for serum androgens and SHBG levels to return to basal values [

Options for first-line tests include a 24-hour urinary excretion of free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, and the low-dose

         </strong>
         Serum DHEAS is an adrenal androgen and is often measured to try to identify an adrenal source of excess androgens, most importantly adrenal androgen-secreting neoplasms. Mildly elevated levels of DHEAS are unlikely to affect management. Elevated DHEAS concentrations do not discriminate as well as serum testosterone between malignant and benign causes of adrenal hyperandrogenism, and it is unclear whether DHEAS is the best marker for androgen-secreting carcinomas. However, we do suggest its measurement in women who present with signs and symptoms suggestive of an androgen-secreting tumor. Serum DHEAS values above 700 mcg/dL (18.9 micromol/L) require further evaluation [

         Pelvic ultrasonography is indicated in patients with an elevated serum testosterone concentration when an ovarian androgen-secreting tumor is suspected (total testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL [5.2 nmol/L]). However, failure to identify a tumor does

         High-resolution pelvic ultrasonography with a transvaginal probe can identify ovarian follicles and cysts as small as 3 to 5 mm in diameter. It is therefore a safe and effective way to look for polycystic ovary morphology and to screen for ovarian androgen-secreting tumors. Suspicious findings include large cysts, solid masses, and complex cysts that do not resolve spontaneously in two to four weeks [

         Additional testing is based upon the patient's presentation (time of onset, pace of progression, presence or absence of virilization, and menstrual cycle status)  (

         Some women with hirsutism seek advice when they are already receiving pharmacotherapy, usually combination oral contraceptives (COCs). Measuring serum androgens is not useful in this setting, because COCs suppress serum gonadotropins and ovarian androgen, most importantly, testosterone. Biochemical evaluation is usually not necessary unless the patient is experiencing severe or rapid worsening of her hirsutism in spite of COCs  (
