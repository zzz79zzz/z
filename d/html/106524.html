         Postoperative surgery patients are prone to electrolyte derangements related to the loss of blood and bodily fluids, the stress response to surgery, intravenous fluid administration, blood transfusion, and the underlying surgical disease.

         The etiology, evaluation, and management of common electrolyte abnormalities following surgery are reviewed here. The estimation of fluid losses and correction of fluid volume deficits following surgery are discussed separately. (See

         A variety of crystalloids are used in fluid resuscitation after surgery, including 0.9% sodium chloride,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108196" href="/z/d/drug information/108196.html" rel="external">

         Although the sodium concentration of 0.9% sodium chloride (154 mEq/L) is higher than the normal plasma sodium concentration, it equals the sodium concentration of the aqueous phase of plasma, which is the phase that is in osmotic equilibrium with the rest of body fluids. However, the chloride concentration of 0.9% sodium chloride is much higher than that of plasma because the solution contains no bicarbonate.

         </span>
         The sodium concentration of LR (130 mEq/L) is lower than that of blood. LR also contains potassium, calcium, and lactate, a buffer that is metabolized by the liver to bicarbonate.

         The concentration of sodium in balanced salt solutions (eg, Plasma-Lyte, Normosol) is equivalent to that of blood. For example, Plasma-Lyte's sodium concentration is 140 mEq/L. Plasma-Lyte also contains potassium and magnesium, as well as acetate, a buffer that is converted to bicarbonate independent of the liver.

         Depending upon the solution chosen, recipients of a large volume of intravenous crystalloid fluid may develop hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and dilutional electrolyte deficiency (ie, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia).

         Hyperchloremia – Large volume 0.9% sodium chloride resuscitation generates a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal vasoconstriction, both of which contribute to unpredictable water retention and electrolyte derangement [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In many cases, acidosis can be avoided with the use of a solution containing less chloride than 0.9% sodium chloride, such as LR or Plasma-Lyte. However, balanced salt solutions are more expensive than LR, and LR has a subphysiologic sodium concentration (130 mEq/L), which may result in hyponatremia when given in excess. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15073.html" rel="external">

         Hyponatremia – During and after surgery, surgical stress results in the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH; ie, vasopressin). ADH acts in the kidney to retain water [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In normovolemic postsurgical patients, the administration of additional sodium (ie, 0.9% sodium chloride) can result in a paradoxical fall in sodium concentration because the sodium contained in these solutions is excreted in the urine, resulting in net retention of electrolyte-free water. As a result, hyponatremia is commonly observed in postsurgical patients. It can also occur if too much LR or a balanced salt solution is administered [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Mild postoperative hyponatremia generally resolves without specific intervention [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,4
         </a>
         ]. As the stress response dissipates and ADH secretion is suppressed by the low serum sodium concentration, the excess free water is excreted in the urine. If the serum sodium does fall below normal, the administered intravenous fluid should be changed to one with a higher sodium concentration (eg, from LR to 0.9% sodium chloride) to avoid worsening hyponatremia and its complications. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15073.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of postoperative fluid therapy in adults"

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, moderate or severe hyponatremia can occur. It is particularly common and worrisome in patients with brain injury (see
         <a class="local">
          'Brain injury'
         </a>
         below), but it has also been reported after minor elective surgical procedures [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In most cases, postoperative patients with hyponatremia related to the administration of hypotonic fluids will respond to isotonic or hypertonic fluids without event. In one review, the prevalence of hyponatremia &lt;130 mmol/L during the first postoperative week was 4.4 percent (48 of 1088 patients) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Most patients (94 percent) were receiving hypotonic fluids (eg, hypotonic sodium chloride or dextrose infusion); however, none of the patients had significant neurologic deterioration. Although uncommon, seizures and even fatal cerebral edema have been reported in postoperative patients [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,7
         </a>
         ]. If the serum sodium concentration rapidly falls below 130 mEq/L (eg, in the first 24 hours after surgery) and the patient has symptoms that might be attributable to the acute hyponatremia, the electrolyte disturbance should be evaluated and emergently treated. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2350.html" rel="external">

         Hypokalemia – In addition to ADH release in response to surgical stress, aldosterone is released in response to hypotension or hypovolemia (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65116" href="/z/d/graphic/65116.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). It acts in the kidney to retain sodium and waste potassium. The degree of this hormonal response for a particular patient or type of surgery is highly variable, as is the degree of associated electrolyte derangement. Although intravascular volume is restored, potassium levels are unpredictably affected [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. This process is compounded by the administration of supernormal sodium doses with intravenous fluid therapy during and after surgery [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. (See

         Hypomagnesemia – Part of the stress response to surgery includes the release of aldosterone, which contributes to magnesium wasting in the kidney [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. For the reasons discussed below, magnesium is repleted more aggressively in surgery patients. (See

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         The effects of transfusion on the development of postoperative electrolyte abnormalities depend upon the amount given, the clinical status of the patient, the temperature of the blood when it is transfused, and the duration of blood storage [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-13
         </a>
         ]. Hyperkalemia may be observed after the transfusion of red blood cells. As stored red blood cells age, they lyse, leaking potassium into the extracellular fluid. In this way, older banked blood tends to contain more extracellular potassium. When citrate, a red blood cell additive, is administered, it may result in the chelation of serum electrolytes, resulting in hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, or hypomagnesemia [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-16
         </a>
         ]. Banked red blood cells exist in an anaerobic environment, leading to the production and accumulation of lactic acid. The transfusion of red blood cells provides an acid load of approximately 15 mEq per unit, the sum of the citric acid anticoagulant and red blood cell lactic acid production [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. In the normal individual, the acid load of banked blood can be adequately accommodated by metabolic and respiratory mechanisms. However, when red blood cells are transfused rapidly or in a large volume, profound electrolyte derangement is often observed in conjunction with acid-base disorder. This is further exacerbated when the product is not warm. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7931.html" rel="external">
          "Massive blood transfusion", section on 'Complications'

        </p>
        <p>
         To a lesser extent, this also applies to autologous blood transfusion, which may be used during resuscitation in the trauma bay, intensive care unit, or operating room. Rapidly lost blood is collected, washed, and returned to the patient promptly. The washing process reduces the potassium and lactate content in the sample [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Conditioning older banked blood using similar autotransfusion technology has also been shown to decrease its potassium and lactate content [

         Following surgery, approximately two-thirds of administered intravenous fluid extravasates into the extravascular space. This process is informally known as "third spacing" into the soft tissues, peritoneal cavity, or pleural cavity. As the patient recovers, the capillary leak resolves, and the fluid returns to the vascular space. Electrolyte deficits (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia) tend to follow this process in an unpredictable manner. (See

         Postoperative ileus or intestinal obstruction is commonly observed in surgical patients and may lead to vomiting that requires nasogastric drainage. The loss of a large volume of gastric fluid, which contains hydrochloric acid, can lead to intravascular volume contraction, metabolic alkalosis, hypochloremia, and hypokalemia. The loss of fluid volume stimulates aldosterone production, which promotes water retention and potassium wasting in the kidney. To produce more acid, the stomach pumps additional bicarbonate into the serum. This excess bicarbonate is excreted in the urine as an unabsorbed anion that obligates excretion of potassium to maintain electrolyte neutrality.

         The pancreas generates a bicarbonate-rich fluid. When pancreatic fluid is lost externally, as with a pancreatico-cutaneous fistula following pancreatic injury (accidental or surgical), it generates a metabolic acidosis as well as secondary derangements in potassium.
        </p>
        <p>
         High-volume diarrhea, ostomy output, or enterocutaneous fistula drainage leads to unpredictable electrolyte derangements, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.

         As the patient recovers from surgery, fluid returns to the vascular space and is evacuated by the kidneys. The mobilization of third-space fluid results in large-volume auto-diuresis, which is associated with potassium and magnesium wasting. Although there is no firm relationship that describes the volume of urine and expected level of electrolyte derangement, it is the author's experience that urinary outputs that exceed 30mL/kg/day during auto-diuresis are typically associated with deficits of potassium, magnesium, or phosphorus. When auto-diuresis is associated with recovering renal dysfunction, such as that which resulted from an obstructing kidney stone or hypovolemia-induced acute kidney injury following hemorrhage, this electrolyte wasting can be exaggerated.

         Brain injury (accidental or surgical) can lead to arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D), formerly called central diabetes insipidus (DI), syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH), and cerebral salt wasting, which are associated with electrolyte derangements. In AVP-D, uncontrolled water loss leads to hypernatremia. In SIADH and cerebral salt wasting, hyponatremia may result [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Hyponatremia in head-injured patients can be highly problematic as it contributes to cerebral edema. Hypotonic fluids should not be administered to head injury or neurosurgery patients at risk for cerebral edema. In some cases, hypertonic 3% sodium chloride and vasopressin receptor antagonists are needed to manage SIADH-associated hyponatremia in head injury patients [

        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, hyponatremia from disordered ADH production may be observed in liver failure patients awaiting transplantation. These patients have a higher risk of morbidity, mortality, and worse survival after transplantation. The management of hyponatremia of liver failure differs from that of head-injury-associated SIADH.

         Following renal transplantation, allograft recovery often includes a phase of uncontrolled diuresis during which hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia commonly occur. Similarly, when a native kidney obstruction is relieved (eg, laser lithotripsy for an obstructing ureteral stone), diuresis and electrolyte wasting may result.

         Hyponatremia is more commonly observed in patients with traumatic or surgical brain trauma. In a study of neurosurgery patients, hyponatremia was observed in 10 and 50 percent of patients, depending on the underlying condition. Accidental and surgical trauma to the brain more commonly result in the production of ADH, which leads to inappropriate fluid retention and dilutional hyponatremia. (See

         Mechanical tissue destruction and ischemia-induced tissue injury can cause tissue necrosis and cell lysis. The resulting cell injury may lead to the release of intracellular potassium into the bloodstream, causing profound hyperkalemia. With muscle injury, myoglobin is released into the circulation and can be nephrotoxic, further impairing potassium excretion. Phosphate released from cells leads to hyperphosphatemia and may also lead to calcium scavenging and hypocalcemia. When associated with significant muscle injury, these electrolyte disturbances are referred to collectively as part of a syndrome termed rhabdomyolysis. (See

         Creatine kinase (CK) is often used as a biochemical marker of muscle damage. In general, increases in CK less than five times the normal value are unlikely to cause significant electrolyte abnormalities. However, the degree of CK elevation used to define rhabdomyolysis remains controversial [

         Surgical trauma (ie, planned muscle division) results in muscle injury. Surgical patients can also experience muscle compression injury if improperly positioned in the operating room or if subjected to a prolonged period of immobility [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Patient positioning may also promote muscle ischemia by interrupting anatomic blood flow (eg, stirrups) or by compression (eg, pressure from security belts when patient is rotated into a lateral position). Generally, positions maintained for under two hours are unlikely to cause significant injury. However, patient factors, particularly obesity, may contribute to increased pressure, thereby leading to unanticipated muscle injury during shorter procedures, which has been demonstrated in a number of surgical populations [
         <a href="#rid25">

        </p>
        <p>
         Extremity injury (eg, crushed injury, electrical shock, open femur fracture) commonly leads to muscle injury and some degree of rhabdomyolysis. When a patient with crush injury is released from a crushing object, reperfusion may result in rapid-onset hyperkalemia and acidosis. Extensive bone and muscle injury with severe extremity injury often results in compartment syndrome, which, when released, can lead to rhabdomyolysis-induced renal failure and metabolic derangements [

         Acute tissue ischemia, such as in cases of thromboembolism to an extremity, can result in extensive muscle ischemia prior to limb salvage surgery. In such cases, rhabdomyolysis and its associated electrolyte abnormalities are commonly observed [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Blood flow to an extremity may be purposefully interrupted with a tourniquet or clamp for short periods of time to prevent blood loss during a planned surgery (eg, arm tourniquet during carpal tunnel release). Release of the tourniquet/clamp can also be associated with reperfusion of ischemic tissue. However, in such controlled settings, it is uncommon for this to result in significant electrolyte abnormalities unless the ischemia time is longer than usual.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ablative or embolic procedures, such as for liver tumors, also result in acute tissue ischemia. With tumor ablation, rarely, tumor lysis syndrome may be observed. Tumor lysis syndrome is well described in case reports in patients who undergo transarterial chemoembolization of large liver tumors, although "large" is not well defined. In these cases, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia may be observed [

         Many surgical diseases are associated with preoperative malnutrition, including malignancies (eg, colon, lung, esophageal carcinoma), chronic organ dysfunction, and inflammatory conditions (eg, pancreatitis, colitis). As malnourished patients recover from surgery and resume dietary intake, they are at risk for refeeding syndrome, a collection of electrolyte derangements associated with a massive intracellular shift of electrolytes. Hypophosphatemia is commonly observed as extracellular phosphate is rapidly taken into the cells to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

         Metabolic alkalosis – This commonly results from volume contraction combined with gastric fluid loss in the postoperative patient. The classic scenario is the patient with a bowel obstruction who undergoes laparotomy, during/after which aggressive third-spacing of fluid into the peritoneal cavity and intestinal lumen leads to volume contraction. Emesis and nasogastric tube decompression lead to further large-volume loss of hydrochloric acid (HCl). As the stomach produces more HCl to replace this loss, it delivers bicarbonate (HCO3

          -

         ) into the serum. In this manner, volume contraction and HCl loss generate a hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. There is a very small amount of potassium in gastric fluid that is directly lost during vomiting and gastric tube decompression as well.

         Metabolic acidosis – This may result from large-volume blood loss and under-resuscitation. The commonly observed scenario is the patient with hemorrhagic shock from large surgical blood loss, which leads to reduced end-organ perfusion and lactic acidosis. This generates a "gap" acidosis. Conversely, a patient who undergoes a large volume of 0.9% sodium chloride infusion may experience hyperchloremic acidosis associated with the large chloride load. This generates a "non-gap" acidosis. Both of these types of acidosis lead to hyperkalemia.

         For adult patients who receive in excess of 50mL/kg/day of intravenous fluids and/or blood products per day, more frequent monitoring is advised (every 6 to 12 hours). Similarly, when correcting electrolyte deficiencies or excesses, frequent monitoring is often warranted to confirm resolution of the disorder. Typically, the rate of electrolyte replacement therapy is limited by safety protocols, such that serum electrolyte monitoring every six hours is usually sufficient. As an example, to replace a 40 mEq potassium deficit at 10 mEq/hour by the intravenous route, it will take at least four hours to complete the replacement.

         There are many chemistry assays available for analyzing serum electrolytes. A complete chemistry report includes the normal values for reference, which vary from one assay to the next. As an example, a serum potassium of 5.3 mmol/L may be high or normal depending on the assay's reference range.

         In assessing serum calcium in postoperative patients, the use of ionized serum calcium is more useful than total serum calcium. The total serum calcium concentration changes in parallel with the albumin concentration. For many surgical patients, their serum albumin does not accurately reflect their current state due to malnourishment around the time of surgery. Also, serum total calcium and albumin are prone to dilution in large-volume resuscitation. As such, measurement of the ionized serum calcium more accurately reflects the true serum calcium in the postoperative patient, though it is a more expensive test. (See

         To avoid complications of electrolyte deficiency in the postoperative period (eg, ileus, arrhythmia, seizure), deficiencies in serum potassium, magnesium, phosphate, and calcium should be identified and treated before the onset of symptoms of deficiency.

As with the treatment of hyponatremia in medical patients, the serum sodium should be raised by no more than 8 mEq/L in a 24 hour period to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). The risk of ODS is greatest in patients with a serum sodium of 120 mEq/L or less whose serum sodium has been low for 48 hours or more. However, hyponatremia may be poorly tolerated in patients with head trauma or following neurosurgery, and correction by 4 to 6 mEq/L within a few hours may be necessary. (See

         The goal of electrolyte replacement in the postoperative surgical patient is normal serum electrolyte levels. Arbitrary goals are practiced widely and are often based upon anecdotal experience. For patients with ongoing losses, the author targets the middle of the normal range, to prevent complications of electrolyte deficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because commercial metabolic panel assays vary from one hospital to the next, leading to inconsistent "normal range" values, it is important for the clinician to be familiar with the normal range for their lab. There is no agreed-upon definition of what constitutes mild, moderate, or severe electrolyte deficiency. In general, if an electrolyte value falls within 25 percent of its normal value for a given lab, that would be considered a mild-to-moderate deficiency by the author. For levels falling more than 25 percent below the normal value, that would be considered a severe deficiency. Life-threatening complications of electrolyte deficiency are typically observed when electrolytes fall into the severe deficiency range.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, if the normal range for serum potassium in your hospital is 3.5 to 4.5 mEq/L and the patient's level is 3.1 mEq/L during fluid resuscitation, the goal serum potassium should be 4 mEq/L, as the patient is expected to have a small amount of ongoing loss with further fluid resuscitation.

         The rate of electrolyte replacement should match the rate of loss to prevent progression of a mild/asymptomatic deficiency to a severe or life-threatening situation. For this reason, acute deficits and moderate-to-severe deficits should be replaced quickly, usually by intravenous route, to avoid complications of electrolyte deficiency. Infusion rates are typically limited for safety reasons and vary slightly by institution:

          Electrolyte replacement

         – To avoid complications of electrolyte deficiency in the postoperative period (eg, ileus, arrhythmia, seizure), electrolyte deficiencies should be identified and treated. Electrolyte replacement to a goal of normal serum electrolyte levels (as defined for a particular institution) is a safe practice. For the patient with ongoing losses, target the middle of the normal range. (See

          Route of administration
         </strong>
         – Electrolyte deficiencies can be replaced using the intravenous or enteral route. One or the other route of administration may be more appropriate depending upon the clinical situation. Although an enterally administered replacement is preferred for those with gut function, these may be poorly tolerated or not feasible in postoperative patients. For patients with moderate-to-severe electrolyte deficiency, intravenous administration provides reliable and rapid delivery. The amount and rates of administration are reviewed above. (See

          Electrolyte excess
         </strong>
         – Electrolyte excess in postoperative patients is often related to the underlying disease for which surgery was indicated and its treatment. Factors known to aggravate the electrolyte excess should be avoided. The treatment for electrolyte excess in surgical patients is like that of medical patients. However, surgical patients are often not candidates for enteral therapies as they recover from surgery. (See
