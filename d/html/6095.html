         Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the retrograde passage of urine from the bladder into the upper urinary tract. The clinical significance of VUR has been based on the premise that it predisposes patients to acute pyelonephritis by transporting bacteria from the bladder to the kidney, which may lead to kidney scarring, hypertension, and end-stage kidney disease. Some aspects of this long-held belief have been increasingly questioned. As a result, there is controversy regarding the optimal management of patients with VUR. A study based on United States Renal Data System reported a steady decrease in new-onset end-stage kidney disease secondary to reflux nephropathy in the United States. Though attributed to the possibility of improvements in medical management and diagnostic practices, the possibility of inclusion of cases with congenital reflux nephropathy in earlier studies cannot be ruled out [

         The management of VUR diagnosed after a urinary tract infection (UTI) will be reviewed here. The presentation, diagnosis, and clinical course of VUR are discussed elsewhere. (See

         The management of VUR varies from center to center because there are insufficient data to establish evidence-based consensus guidelines. Therapeutic choices to manage VUR include watchful waiting (surveillance), antibiotic prophylaxis, and surgical correction. In addition, it is important to identify and treat older, toilet-trained children with BBD because they are at risk for recurrent UTI, pyelonephritis, and worsening of VUR and are less likely to have spontaneous VUR resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our management approach is based on the available evidence and individualizes the management based on:

         We divide our management approach based on the severity of VUR  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ) since increasing severity of VUR is associated with increased risk of febrile UTI recurrence and kidney scarring as well as a decreased likelihood of spontaneous resolution. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6094.html" rel="external">

         BBD is a common finding in patients with VUR in the toilet-trained age group and is more common in girls [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-6
         </a>
         ]. Patients with both BBD and VUR have a higher incidence of breakthrough UTI (any UTI while on prophylactic antibiotic therapy), longer time for VUR resolution, and increased failure rate of surgical correction than patients with only VUR [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4,7
         </a>
         ]. Thus, it is important to identify and treat BBD in any patient with VUR.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms and clinical findings of BBD include urge incontinence, infrequent voiding, recurrent UTI, dysuria, abdominal pain, constipation, and soiling. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of BBD improves bladder function and promotes VUR resolution, including some patients with grade V reflux [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Interventions include laxatives, timed frequent voiding, pelvic floor exercises, behavioral modification, and, in some cases, anticholinergic therapy. (See

         Detection and treatment of BBD in the toilet-trained child – In patients with BBD, measures to improve bladder and bowel function are initiated with ongoing monitoring to see whether VUR spontaneously resolves or improves. A trial of therapeutic medical intervention should be provided before any surgical intervention is undertaken as the surgical failure rate is significant in patients with persistent BBD. (See

         – We do not suggest surgical correction as initial therapy for patients with grade I and II VUR, because there is a high likelihood of spontaneous resolution and a low risk of kidney scarring and the long-term risk of kidney scarring in patients with surgical correction is similar to that of those treated with medical therapy. If the family/caregiver desires, we will discuss the success rate, risks, and costs of surgical correction. Surgical correction remains an alternative for those who are not comfortable with either surveillance or continuous prophylaxis. Furthermore, surgical intervention is indicated for patients with persistent VUR who have breakthrough infections on antibiotic prophylaxis. (See

         Watchful waiting consists of a regimen of surveillance and prompt treatment of intercurrent episodes of urinary tract infection (UTI). Families must seek medical attention when there are symptoms suggestive of UTI or unexplained fever. In our practice, watchful waiting is an option for patients with low-grade reflux (grades I and II  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67039" href="/z/d/graphic/67039.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         )) and who are toilet-trained and able to communicate the presence of UTI symptoms. For patients with high-grade reflux (grades III to V), as well as children who are not toilet-trained or are not able to communicate symptoms in the presence of an infection, we prefer antibiotic prophylaxis because it is associated with a lower risk of recurrent UTI. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Antibiotic prophylaxis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If watchful waiting is selected, family/caregivers need to be aware that kidney scarring is a potential consequence of recurrent febrile UTI, which may lead to hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The family/caregiver needs to be vigilant and must seek medical attention whenever there are symptoms suggestive of UTI or unexplained fever. Additional follow-up includes monitoring of VUR and kidney scarring. The family/caregiver's social situation should be assessed for compliance since surveillance puts the onus on caregivers to promptly recognize a potential UTI and seek medical attention. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Follow-up'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Watchful waiting has been promoted as a reasonable management option based on the results of two systematic reviews that reported antibiotic prophylaxis (medical therapy) versus placebo or no treatment did not reduce the risk of UTI or kidney scarring [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. However, any conclusion based on these publications needs to be viewed with caution because of the degree of heterogeneity of the studies including significant differences in methodology (eg, definition of UTI, grade of reflux) and study populations (eg, circumcision status, patient age) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, the subsequently published Randomized Intervention for Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) trial of 607 children (age range two months to six years) showed a lower risk of recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTI for children assigned to prophylactic antibiotics (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9785" href="/z/d/drug information/9785.html" rel="external">
          trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
         </a>
         [TMP-SMX]) versus those assigned to placebo [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. However, there was no difference in the incidence of kidney scarring between the two groups during the two-year follow-up period as initially reported. Of note, in this cohort, children with grade III or IV VUR were more likely to have febrile or symptomatic UTI than those with grade I or II VUR (23 versus 14 percent). In subgroup analysis, TMP-SMX prophylaxis was associated with a lower risk of recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTI in patients with grade I or II VUR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.61). Antibiotic prophylaxis appeared to be associated with a lower risk of recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTI in patients with grade III or IV VUR, but this did not reach statistical significance (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.40-1.09). A subsequent analysis reported the prophylactic intervention group had reduced scarring when compared with the control group [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review that included the RIVUR trial also concluded that prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of febrile and symptomatic UTI in children with VUR [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. However, there was a higher risk of a UTI due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and there appeared to be no effect on the risk of developing kidney scars. In this analysis, there was considerable heterogeneity among the studies including study design and quality. An additional study using data from the same cohort proposed a predictive model to identify which children with VUR might benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis, based on VUR grade, serum creatinine, age, sex, and presenting UTI symptoms [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Using this model, approximately 60 percent of children would qualify for watchful waiting rather than antibiotic prophylaxis, but these children still had some risk for recurrent UTI.

         Medical therapy for VUR consists of daily prophylactic administration of an antibiotic agent. It is based on the assumptions that use of continuous antibiotics results in sterile urine and the continued reflux of sterile urine does not cause kidney damage, as well as the observation that reflux spontaneously resolves in most cases.

         Large-scale studies continue to show an advantage to antibiotic prophylaxis, in that recurrent UTIs are less common. A discussion with the families should determine whether they prefer a program of prophylaxis or surveillance. Socioeconomic considerations should also be considered, such as the availability of primary care, likelihood of close follow-up, and ability to pay for medication.

          Antibiotic prophylaxis versus surveillance
         </strong>
         – Evidence supporting the use of antibiotic prophylaxis versus surveillance is from the RIVUR trial. In this multicenter trial of children diagnosed with VUR, the effectiveness of TMP-SMX and placebo were compared over a two-year follow-up period [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Overall, children in the TMP-SMX group were less likely to have recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTI than those in the placebo group (13 versus 24 percent; HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.74). This and subsequent analyses of the same cohort helped to identify factors that predicted benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis in children with VUR:

         In subgroup analysis, antibiotic prophylaxis was most effective in children with BBD (HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.58) and in children whose first UTI was febrile (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26-0.64) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Similar findings were seen in a separate analysis in which antimicrobial prophylaxis was most beneficial for toilet-trained children with BBD [

         In a subsequent publication, prophylactic antibiotic was reported to be most beneficial in patients who were at high-risk for recurrent UTI [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. High-risk was classified as uncircumcised males with VUR, any patient with VUR and BBD or constipation, and patients with grade IV VUR (with or without BBD or constipation). The number needed to treat to avoid a recurrent UTI was eight in the overall cohort, compared with five in the high-risk group and 18 in the low-risk group.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         This study highlights that uncircumcised males with any grade of reflux are at increased risk of UTI. For these boys, the family/caregivers should be aware of the risk and elective circumcision should be offered as an option. In addition, if there is any evidence of physiologic phimosis, it is reasonable to suggest topical corticosteroid therapy to allow complete retraction of the foreskin. (See

          20

         The impact of treatment adherence was noted in a secondary analysis that compared the least adherent patients (adherence &lt;70 percent of the time) to the most adherent patients (adherence &gt;96 percent of the time) [

Antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence of first symptomatic UTI (21 versus 36 percent; hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.35-0.86), with no significant differences in new kidney scars or kidney function but increased occurrence of antibiotic-resistant organisms in urine cultures. Compared with the RIVUR trial, this study population was younger, was male predominant (mostly uncircumcised), had more congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, and had no prior UTIs at study enrollment. By contrast, RIVUR and other similar trials reflect a more common clinical population with VUR, ie, primarily girls who present after a UTI [

         Antibiotic prophylaxis is discontinued when VUR resolves spontaneously or is surgically corrected, which is documented by contrast-voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography, or radionuclide cystogram (RNC). Although the evidence is not conclusive, some experts stop prophylaxis therapy in select older children with persistent VUR because the risk of recurrent urinary infection diminishes with age [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28-30
         </a>
         ]. However, the age of discontinuation is not well established, due to the lack of high-quality data.
        </p>
        <p>
         Besides age, discontinuation of prophylaxis generally also depends on absence of BBD, toilet-training status, lack of evidence of kidney scarring, and no recent UTI. The presence of kidney scarring documented on a
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9102" href="/z/d/drug information/9102.html" rel="external">

         ]. Furthermore, discontinuation may be dependent on the social situation and history of compliance. Families need to be counseled regarding prompt diagnosis and treatment of any subsequent infections.
        </p>
        <p>
         After discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis, subsequent infections might require reimaging to see if VUR is present. If there is recurrent or persistent VUR, antibiotic prophylaxis should be resumed and surgical correction may be considered. Adolescent females with persistent VUR should be counseled about the higher risk of pyelonephritis during pregnancy, and management options including surgical correction should be reviewed. (See

         Open surgical reimplantation of ureters is a highly successful procedure, with reported correction rates of 95 to 99 percent regardless of the severity of VUR [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35-39

        </p>
        <p>
         Open procedures are based on the basic technique, described by Politano and Leadbetter, and include the following approaches:

         Intravesical approach – In the intravesical approach, the bladder is opened (intravesical approach) and the ureters are reimplanted by tunneling a ureteral segment through the detrusor (bladder wall muscle), thereby creating a submucosal tunnel that is long enough to act as a flap valve  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111940" href="/z/d/graphic/111940.html" rel="external">

         Extravesical approach – In this approach, reimplantation is performed without opening the bladder and is known as the Lich-Gregoir procedure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111794" href="/z/d/graphic/111794.html" rel="external">

         The extravesical approach has been associated with shortened hospital stays. Bilateral extravesical ureteral reimplantation has been associated with postoperative urinary retention (although rare), requiring prolonged catheterization.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of technique, the patient may require postoperative bladder drainage via a urinary catheter and an in-hospital admission that usually lasts from one to several days. In a small percentage of patients, there may be persistent VUR on the initial postoperative VCUG; however, VUR generally resolves spontaneously without need for further intervention [
         <a href="#rid39">

         ). Although two case series reported comparable success rates between children who underwent robotic-assisted reimplantation compared with patients undergoing open surgical correction during the same time periods [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41,42
         </a>

         Further studies are needed to determine the relative cost/benefit of robotic-assisted reimplantation versus open surgical reimplantation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Transvesical laparoscopic or so-called "vesicoscopic" ureteral reimplantation is one of the newer innovations. The surgery is done entirely within the bladder, as opposed to the more common laparoscopic approach via the abdominal cavity. Success rates of greater than 95 percent have been reported in early series [

          51-59

         Monitoring of reflux is done by either contrast-voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or radionuclide cystogram (RNC). Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography, which is available in some centers, could be another modality for follow-up. Although there is little supportive evidence for the timing of follow-up for reflux for patients on medical therapy, evaluation is typically performed in our practice every 18 to 24 months.

          73
         </a>
         ]. In our practice, we selectively obtain DMSA renal scans at the time of presentation in patients with grade III to V reflux with or without UTI, while others may opt to perform initial baseline scans in all children, even those with lower VUR grades (I and II). It should be noted that while less common, DMSA scan evidence of kidney scarring and pyelonephritis has been found in children at presentation with grades I and II VUR [

         For patients managed by observation alone, evidence of new scarring suggests the need for therapeutic intervention. In patients managed medically, new scarring on prophylaxis suggests that surgical correction should be considered. Follow-up DMSA renal scans can be obtained to document kidney involvement after a breakthrough UTI (any UTI while on antibiotic prophylaxis). New kidney scarring or evidence of pyelonephritis while on prophylaxis or surveillance without antibiotics would be a reason to suggest a change in management (eg, surgical correction or antibiotic prophylaxis for those managed by surveillance). DMSA renal scans are not routinely repeated in the absence of breakthrough infection, regardless of grade.

          Discontinuation of antibiotics
         </strong>
         – Because of the paucity of data addressing when medical therapy should be discontinued in patients initially treated with prophylactic antibiotics, indications of when to discontinue medical therapy are uncertain (see
         <a class="local">
          'Duration of therapy'
         </a>
         above). Some experts will only discontinue therapy when the VCUG is negative. Others will discontinue therapy in older children or adolescents with grade I reflux who have been infection free for a year or so. Again, presence of kidney scarring mitigates against discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis in those with persistent reflux. Teenage girls should be made aware that the presence of reflux increases the risk of pyelonephritis during pregnancy and that they should be carefully monitored at that time unless they opt for surgical correction [

         Although some studies suggest that it is not necessary to document resolution after open surgical repair, in one author's center, a postoperative VCUG or RNC is performed in patients who have undergone surgical correction to determine the success of the procedure. Both kidney ultrasound and VCUG are repeated approximately six months after open surgical correction. Kidney ultrasounds obtained too soon after correction demonstrate hydronephrosis that is transitory and of no clinical concern. Similarly, a kidney ultrasound and VCUG are performed several months after endoscopic correction [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. In other centers, VCUG is not performed unless there is a documented UTI following endoscopic reimplantation.
        </p>
        <p>
         As discussed above, families whose children have undergone endoscopic therapy must be made aware of the fact that there can be later recurrence of reflux and UTIs, necessitating reimaging and possible retreatment. As a result, we perform cystograms for patients with recurrent febrile UTIs following endoscopic correction. In contrast, open surgical correction of reflux is permanent in close to 100 percent of children. Recurrent UTI in this population is much less likely to be associated with reappearance of reflux, and, thus, repeat cystography is not often needed if there is one normal postoperative VCUG [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77
         </a>
         ]. Multiple recurrent UTIs after successful surgical correction might require another VCUG and kidney ultrasound but should also suggest further evaluation of bowel and bladder dysfunction (BBD).

         </span>
         Following the resolution of VUR either spontaneously or surgically, long-term follow-up should be provided for those with kidney scarring. The American Urology Association guidelines suggest annual assessments through adolescence, which include measurements of growth (height and weight) and blood pressure, as well as urinalysis to detect proteinuria or bacteria. Families should be made aware of the potential patient complications of hypertension and impaired kidney function as well as the increased risk of VUR in first-degree relatives.
        </p>
        <p>
         The frequency, utility, and method of detecting kidney scarring have not been clearly defined. DMSA renal scan is the most sensitive measure for detecting kidney scarring. Kidney ultrasound is not as sensitive in detecting kidney scars as DMSA scan and, as a result, has not been as useful in follow-up [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72,78
         </a>
         ]. However, a kidney ultrasound performed every two or three years may be helpful to monitor kidney growth, especially for patients with significant scarring. The need for DMSA renal scan is determined on a case-by-case basis, dictated by if information would affect clinical management. For example, nephrectomy may be considered for a patient with severe hypertension if the DMSA renal scan demonstrates a significant differential function with the affected kidney demonstrating less than 10 to 15 percent function.

         Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the retrograde passage of urine from the bladder into the upper urinary tract.

          Goals
         </strong>
         – Management of VUR has been based on the premise that VUR predisposes patients to acute pyelonephritis (upper urinary tract infection [UTI]) by allowing the transport of bacteria upward, exposing the kidney parenchyma and diminishing the clearance of bacteria from the urinary tract with each void. Although data are inconclusive regarding optimal management of VUR, the approach used should fulfill the following goals (see
         <a class="local">

          Bowel and bladder dysfunction
         </strong>
         – BBD is a common finding in patients with VUR. Patients with VUR and BBD are at increased risk for breakthrough UTI, longer time for VUR resolution, and increased failure rate of surgical correction than patients with only VUR. As a result, we screen all patients with VUR for BBD. For patients with BBD, interventions include the use of laxatives, timed frequent voiding, pelvic floor exercises, and behavioral modification, which can both improve bladder function and lead to VUR resolution, as discussed separately.

          Our approach
         </strong>
         – Our management is based on the available data and divides the choice of treatment on the severity of VUR since increasing severity of VUR is associated with increasing risk of febrile UTI recurrence and kidney scarring as well as a decreased likelihood of spontaneous resolution  (

          Intermediate or high grade

         ). We initially place all patients on prophylactic antibiotic therapy. In these patients, surgical correction is reserved for all patients with grades III to IV with breakthrough infection or who have serious adverse effects from prophylactic antibiotic therapy. In addition, surgical correction is performed in patients with persistent grade IV and V beyond two or three years of age. (See

          Low grade
         </strong>

          During antibiotic prophylaxis
         </strong>
         – Patients who are treated with antibiotic prophylaxis or by "watchful waiting" require mandatory urine cultures whenever there are symptoms suggestive of UTI or unexplained fever and monitoring by repeat cystogram for the continued presence of VUR. Following a breakthrough or additional UTI, while under observation or antibiotic prophylactic management,

         </a>
         (DMSA) scans can be obtained, looking for evidence of new kidney scarring. These scans can be compared with any prior scans if they were performed at the time of presentation. New scarring would be compelling evidence for a change in management. (See

          After surgery
         </strong>
         – Following surgical correction, a kidney ultrasound is performed to assess for obstruction. In many centers, a cystogram may also be performed to demonstrate a successful operative outcome. In addition, reimaging with a contrast-voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) should be considered in patients who undergo endoscopic correction, if there is subsequent recurrence of febrile UTIs.

          Long-term
         </strong>
         – Long-term follow-up includes annual assessment of linear growth, measurement of blood pressure, and urinalysis. Families should be aware of the association of VUR with increased risk of chronic kidney disease (eg, hypertension, kidney function impairment, or proteinuria). (See
