         Preexisting hypertension is the most common medical reason for postponing surgery [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Hypertension is well known to be a risk factor for cardiovascular catastrophe, a risk that logically extends into the perioperative period [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. In a case-control study of 76 patients who died of a cardiovascular cause within 30 days of elective surgery, a preoperative history of hypertension was four times more likely than among 76 matched controls [

         The issues regarding the perioperative management of the patient with hypertension are reviewed here. Additional discussion of the intra- and immediate postoperative management of patients with hypertension are presented elsewhere:

         Sympathetic activation during the induction of anesthesia can cause the blood pressure to rise by 20 to 30 mmHg and the heart rate to increase by 15 to 20 beats per minute in normotensive individuals [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. These responses may be more pronounced in patients with untreated or poorly controlled hypertension in whom the systolic blood pressure can increase by 90 mmHg and the heart rate by 40 beats per minute.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mean arterial pressure tends to fall as the period of anesthesia progresses due to a variety of factors, including direct effects of the anesthetic, inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system, and loss of the baroreceptor reflex control of arterial pressure. These changes can result in episodes of intraoperative hypotension. Patients with preexisting hypertension are more likely to experience intraoperative blood pressure lability (either hypotension or hypertension) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], which may lead to myocardial ischemia [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Blood pressure and heart rate slowly increase as patients recover from the effects of anesthesia during the immediate postoperative period. Parameters generally return to preoperative levels, although hypertensive individuals, in particular, may experience significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate [

         Preexisting hypertension can induce a variety of cardiovascular responses that potentially increase the risk of surgery, including diastolic dysfunction from left ventricular hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction leading to congestive heart failure, renal impairment, and cerebrovascular and coronary occlusive disease. The level of risk is dependent upon the severity of hypertension.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, much of the evidence for the impact of preoperative hypertension comes from uncontrolled studies performed before contemporary (more effective) hypertension management was available. Furthermore, it is unclear whether postponing surgery to achieve blood pressure control will lead to reduced cardiac risk [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines list uncontrolled hypertension as a "minor" risk factor for perioperative cardiovascular events [
         <a href="#rid10">

         An early study found that patients with untreated, severe hypertension (mean systolic and diastolic pressures of 211 and 105 mmHg, respectively) had exaggerated hypotensive responses to the induction of anesthesia and marked hypertensive responses to noxious stimuli [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, patients with well-controlled hypertension responded similarly to normotensive individuals. Other studies have found that a diastolic pressure over 110 mmHg immediately (within the several days) before surgery is associated with a number of complications including dysrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and infarction, neurologic complications, and kidney failure [
         <a href="#rid5">

         Patients with less marked hypertension (eg, systolic pressure less than 180 and diastolic pressure less than 100 mmHg) do not appear to be at increased operative risk. This was illustrated in a study of 676 operations involving a general anesthetic in patients over the age of 40 years [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         Normotensive patients (group I, no medications; group II, on diuretics for nonhypertensive reasons) were significantly less likely to experience perioperative hypertension than patients who were normotensive on medication (group III), who were hypertensive despite treatment (group IV), and who had untreated hypertension (group V) (8 and 6 versus 27, 25, and 20 percent, respectively).

         </span>
         Among patients with a history of hypertension (groups III, IV, and V), multivariate analysis identified only two independent risk factors for cardiac complications: the preoperative cardiac risk index score (which does not include hypertension  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57075" href="/z/d/graphic/57075.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         )); and marked reductions in intraoperative blood pressure (a decrease to less than 50 percent of preoperative levels or a decrease of 33 percent or more for more than 10 minutes).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These results suggest that elective surgery in patients with non-severe hypertension does not need to be delayed, although intra- and postoperative blood pressures should be carefully monitored to prevent hyper- or hypotensive episodes. On the other hand, when hypertension has caused end-organ disease such as heart failure and kidney function impairment, the probability of adverse cardiac outcome in the perioperative period increases significantly [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

        <p>
         The association of systolic hypertension with operative risk is less clear than the association of diastolic hypertension with risk [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. One study of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy found that a systolic pressure greater than 200 mmHg was associated with an increased risk of postoperative hypertension and neurologic deficits [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         Patients with suspected secondary hypertension should ideally undergo a diagnostic evaluation prior to elective surgery (see

An important exception is the patient with pheochromocytoma, in whom operative mortality may be as high as 80 percent in unsuspected cases [

         There are risks associated with severe, uncontrolled hypertension. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Severe hypertension'
         </a>

        <p>
         Most antihypertensive agents can be taken with small sips of water on the morning of surgery. However, the decision to temporarily discontinue the medication preoperatively is dependent upon several factors, including the specific antihypertensive agent, the indications for the drug, the patient's blood pressure, and the type of surgery and anesthesia planned  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62659" href="/z/d/graphic/62659.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In particular, the management of patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) preoperatively is controversial. ACE inhibitors and ARBs can theoretically blunt the compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system during surgery and result in prolonged hypotension. The decision to continue or discontinue these agents is based on the indications for the drug, the patient's blood pressure, and the type of surgery and anesthesia planned. For most patients, the drug can be held on the morning of surgery. However, when the indication is for heart failure or poorly controlled hypertension, the agent is continued without interruption to avoid further exacerbation of these conditions. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4814.html" rel="external">
          "Perioperative medication management", section on 'ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For diuretics, the major physiologic effects of concern in the perioperative setting are hypokalemia and hypovolemia. There is no consensus on whether diuretics should be discontinued in all patients prior to elective surgery, and our approach is individualized, depending upon the reason for diuretic use and the patient's history.

         Preexisting hypertension is the most common medical reason for postponing surgery. Hypertension is well known to be a risk factor for cardiovascular catastrophe, a risk that logically extends into the perioperative period. (See

         Sympathetic activation during the induction of anesthesia can cause the blood pressure to rise by 20 to 30 mmHg and the heart rate to increase by 15 to 20 beats per minute in normotensive individuals. These responses may be more pronounced in patients with untreated hypertension in whom the systolic blood pressure can increase by as much as 90 mmHg and the heart rate by as much as 40 beats per minute. The mean arterial pressure tends to fall as the period of anesthesia progresses. Blood pressure and heart rate then slowly increase as patients recover from the effects of anesthesia during the immediate postoperative period. Hypertensive individuals, in particular, may experience significant increases in these parameters. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Blood pressure response during anesthesia'

         Preexisting hypertension can induce a variety of cardiovascular responses that potentially increase the risk of surgery, including diastolic dysfunction from left ventricular hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction leading to congestive heart failure, renal impairment, and cerebrovascular and coronary occlusive disease. The level of risk is dependent upon the severity of hypertension. (See

         In patients treated for chronic hypertension, oral antihypertensive medications can usually be continued. In most cases, continuing antihypertensive medications is relatively safe, and discontinuing some medications (eg, beta blockers,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9285" href="/z/d/drug information/9285.html" rel="external">
          clonidine
         </a>
         ) may be associated with significant rebound hypertension. Thus, we typically continue most antihypertensive agents until the time of surgery, taken with small sips of water on the morning of surgery. However, the decision to continue or hold angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and diuretics prior to surgery is individualized and depends upon the indications for the drug, the patient's blood pressure, and the type of surgery and anesthesia planned.

In patients treated for postoperative hypertension who did not have preexisting hypertension, we discontinue antihypertensive therapy once the patient is surgically stable and the blood pressure is at goal for at least 24 hours.
