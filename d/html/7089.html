The role of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in these settings is evolving. As outcomes from HCT improve, more patients may be able to benefit from this approach.</p><p>This topic review discusses the use of HCT for adults with severe AA.

(See <a class="local">'Patient/disease/donor factors'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For most patients under age 50 years with severe AA (SAA) or very severe AA (vSAA) who have an available matched related or unrelated donor, we suggest proceeding directly to allogeneic HCT rather than pursuing a course of immunosuppressive therapy. The rationale for early transplantation includes improved outcomes with HCT, especially in younger patients, and concerns about the risks of severe infections, excessive blood product transfusions, and late clonal disorders such as myelodysplasia and/or acute leukemia with immunosuppressive therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7158.html" rel="external">"Treatment of aplastic anemia in adults", section on 'Severe AA/very severe AA'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Early referral to a transplant center will facilitate timely donor identification and ensure that other pretransplantation issues are addressed. (See <a class="local">'Pretransplant testing and interventions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A matched related donor (typically, a sibling) is preferable to an unrelated donor. However, a matched unrelated donor is an acceptable alternative for patients who do not have a sibling donor or the sibling has comorbid medical conditions. A human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated donor is preferable to a haploidentical related donor. (See <a class="local">'Preferred donor and preparative regimen'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Some patients younger than 50 years of age may have comorbidities that preclude transplantation or affect the ability to tolerate transplantation-associated toxicities; additional individuals may not have an available donor. In such cases, other approaches are needed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7158.html" rel="external">"Treatment of aplastic anemia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If a donor cannot be found in a timely manner, the search should continue as long as HCT is considered to be a potentially effective therapy for that patient (eg, as long as the patient could tolerate HCT and the disease does not respond to immunosuppressive therapy). Immunosuppressive therapy sometimes may be used during this period because the search for an unrelated donor may take a long time (eg, four months or more), especially if the patient is unstable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients ≥50 years of age with SAA, the decision is more nuanced because some older patients can tolerate the toxicities of potentially curative HCT. Thus, HCT or immunotherapy may be appropriate, depending on disease severity and the availability of a donor. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis that considers the degree of cytopenias, life expectancy, and patient preferences.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5861242"><span class="h2">Patient/disease/donor factors</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Disease severity</strong> – HCT generally is reserved for individuals with SAA (eg, bone marrow cellularity &lt;25 percent, bone marrow hypoplasia with absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;500 cells/microL) or vSAA (ANC &lt;200/microL). Patients with SAA or vSAA are more likely to have potentially fatal complications of their disease (eg, infection, bleeding), and their disease is less likely to respond to immunosuppression. In contrast, outcomes with moderate AA are generally better, and use of immunotherapy and/or supportive care may be preferable to the risks of HCT. Additionally, HCT generally is not pursued until any medications that may have induced AA have been discontinued, viral infections have been treated (eg, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and other possible causes of bone marrow aplasia have been addressed (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, eosinophilic fasciitis, vitamin deficiencies [eg, B12, folate, copper])  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70072" href="/z/d/graphic/70072.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The evaluation of patients with AA and classification of disease severity is presented in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7152.html" rel="external">"Aplastic anemia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient age</strong> – Outcomes from HCT historically have been better in younger patients, especially individuals who are ≤20 years of age. However, outcomes have continued to improve in individuals between 20 and 50 years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Thus, HCT is the treatment of choice for patients with SAA &lt;50 years old who have an HLA-matched related donor (typically a sibling) and lack significant medical comorbidities. HCT may also be appropriate for selected patients older than 50 years with excellent performance status who have an available HLA-matched donor. Indications based on age may continue to broaden as transplant outcomes improve.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comorbidities</strong> – Patient comorbidities may preclude successful HCT. Examples in the setting of AA include infections and/or renal, hepatic, or cardiac dysfunction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Donor availability</strong> – The availability of an HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cell donor is paramount in the decision to proceed to HCT although experience with alternative donors continues to evolve.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A related donor is preferable to an unrelated donor with the same degree of HLA matching, due to genetic similarities not assessed by available testing, and closer HLA matching reduces the risks of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (see <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below). Another advantage of using an HLA-matched related donor is the greater speed of donor identification. (See <a class="local">'HLA-matched sibling donor'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A matched unrelated donor may be appropriate for patients without a suitable related donor, as outcomes with unrelated donors continue to improve. Improvements in donor recruitment, donor identification, molecular HLA typing, GVHD prevention strategies, and/or strategies for pursuing transplantation with haploidentical donors may result in further expansion of the unrelated donor pool. (See <a class="local">'Overview of HCT considerations'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H941212"><span class="h2">Evidence for efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outcomes with HCT appear to be superior to those achieved with immunosuppressive therapy. However, the potential risks and benefits need to be evaluated for each individual patient, as these may differ from individuals participating in clinical trials.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient selection criteria differ among trials and in trials versus a nonclinical trial population.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early outcomes may favor immunosuppression, whereas HCT is more likely to be curative.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Innovations in both HCT and immunosuppression make comparisons with historical controls difficult.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients may have strong preferences for one therapy or the other because the risks and potential benefits are very different.</p><p></p><p>Randomized trials comparing HCT with immunosuppression in AA are lacking. Two meta-analyses that evaluated available evidence (7955 and 302 patients, respectively) found that overall survival either was greater with HCT or was no different from immunosuppressive therapy [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Examples of available studies include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective review that compared outcomes in 395 individuals with SAA who underwent either HCT (mostly bone marrow from HLA-identical sibling donors, with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> conditioning without radiation) or immunosuppressive therapy (mostly antithymocyte globulin [ATG] from horse) during the 1990s found greater survival at 15 years in those undergoing transplant (69 versus 38 percent)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75806" href="/z/d/graphic/75806.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The relative benefit of HCT versus immunosuppressive therapy was greatest in the youngest children, persisted through age 39, and was less apparent in individuals &gt;40 years, although several individuals over age 40 received a transplant (median age 22 years, range 2 to 54 years). The major causes of death due to HCT were GVHD (44 percent [mostly chronic]) and infection (44 percent). In contrast, most deaths in individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy were due to bleeding (37 percent) and/or infection (38 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evidence from children with AA has shown good long-term survival with HCT. Specific improvements have been associated with reduced incidence and severity of GVHD, higher rates of engraftment, early transplantation before the onset of severe infections, and avoidance of blood product transfusions from the donor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5923.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acquired aplastic anemia in children and adolescents", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Outcomes with HCT continue to improve with advances in conditioning regimens, infection prophylaxis and treatment, and GVHD prevention. This was illustrated in a report that compared outcomes in 1305 individuals who received a transplant during the decades between 1976 and 1992, during which survival steadily improved [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Five-year overall survival increased from 48 percent (1976 to 1980 cohort) to 66 percent (1988 to 1992 cohort). Greater survival was attributed primarily to reduced mortality in the three months immediately following transplantation; institution of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9217" href="/z/d/drug information/9217.html" rel="external">cyclosporine</a> a (CSA) for GVHD prevention was the most important intervention.</p><p>Among individuals who undergo HCT for SAA, outcomes are better with related donors and with bone marrow rather than peripheral blood as the source of stem cells.

In patients with AA, HCT using bone marrow has been demonstrated to provide excellent outcomes and a lower risk of GVHD (see <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below). Individuals with AA do not have a malignancy and thus do not require a graft-versus-leukemia effect, which is often correlated with GVHD. One exception may be an identical twin donor; in this setting, hematopoietic cells from peripheral blood may be used because there are not concerns regarding GVHD, and engraftment may be more rapid with peripheral blood-derived cells.
