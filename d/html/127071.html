         Minor blunt head trauma occurs commonly in children and is typically not associated with brain injury or long-term sequelae. However, a small number of children with apparently minor blunt head trauma may have a clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) that requires extended observation or acute intervention such as intensive supportive care or neurosurgery. Neuroimaging with computed tomography (CT) is highly sensitive for identifying brain injury that requires intervention; however, it exposes patients to radiation. By performing a complete history and physical and utilizing a clinical decision rule, the clinician can identify children at higher risk for traumatic brain injury (TBI) while minimizing overuse of CT.

         For the purposes of this discussion, we define minor head trauma in previously healthy children two years of age and older as follows:

         No physical evidence of skull fracture (eg, no palpable skull defect and no signs of basilar skull fracture such as hemotympanum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oto- or rhinorrhea, or periocular or posterior auricular hematomas)

        <p>

        <p>
         However, the clinician should regard these patients as having

          apparently
         </strong>
         minor head trauma because approximately 5 percent have traumatic brain injury (TBI) on neuroimaging, and 1 percent have clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI). (See

          1-4
         </a>
         ]. Short-term follow-up (four weeks post-injury) indicates that the risk of morbidity or mortality in children with TBI is very low. However, because there are no long-term studies of infants and children with TBI on CT who do not meet criteria for ciTBI, the long-term implications of these findings are unknown.

         Most children with minor blunt head trauma do not sustain traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, either concussion or clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) can occur after minor blunt head trauma even in children who have minimal symptoms:

         Concussion is associated with a rapid rotational acceleration of the brain. (See

         Subdural hematoma may arise from rotational acceleration-deceleration of the head. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6520.html" rel="external">

         Epidural hematomas typically arise from a direct blow to the temporal region. This force often results in a linear fracture that disrupts middle meningeal arterial branches or dural venous sinuses. However, epidural hematomas may also occur without an associated fracture in a significant number of children. (See

         Head trauma occurs commonly in children with approximate annual rates of 1100 emergency department visits, 31 hospitalizations, and 3.4 deaths per 100,000 population in the United States [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Among children two years of age and older with minor blunt head trauma and a normal neurologic examination, 3 to 7 percent may have a traumatic brain injury (TBI) noted on CT [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,11-15
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 1 percent have clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI), and 0.1 to 0.6 percent require surgical intervention [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3,13,16-18
         </a>
         ]. Falls are the most common mechanism of injury for children sustaining minor blunt head trauma, followed by motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian and bicycle accidents, projectiles, assaults, and sports-related trauma [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,19
         </a>
         ]. These mechanisms cause isolated head trauma in the majority of patients [

         Many clinicians regard children with ventricular shunts or bleeding disorders as having a higher risk for ciTBI after minor head trauma. However, it is not clear that ciTBI after minor head trauma actually occurs more frequently than in normal children. As an example, in planned secondary analyses of a large, multicenter, observational study of children with minor head injury, approximately 1 percent of children with either ventricular shunts (98 children) or bleeding disorders (230 children) had a ciTBI compared with 0.9 percent of the approximately 40,000 normal children [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20-22
         </a>
         ]. However, with the low numbers of patients with either risk factor in these studies, the true frequency of ciTBI following minor head trauma could be as high as 4 percent in children with bleeding disorders or 5 percent in children with ventricular shunts. Furthermore, the rate of ciTBI seen in children with bleeding disorders occurred despite significantly fewer severe mechanisms of injury when compared with normal children [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22
         </a>
         ]. Thus, until further evidence is available, a more cautious approach to imaging in these patients may still be warranted.

         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26

         ]. As an example, of 5557 children evaluated for vomiting after minor head trauma at multiple centers, ciTBI occurred in 0.2 percent (95% CI 0-0.9 percent) of 815 children with isolated vomiting (ie, vomiting alone without other findings of ciTBI) and in 2.5 percent (95% CI 2.1-3 percent) of 4577 children with vomiting and other findings of ciTBI [

         Whether the number of vomiting episodes and the timing of these episodes can help identify patients with ciTBI is unclear.

         Most children with headache after minor blunt head trauma do not have ciTBI. However, when severe or present with other symptoms, headache does increase the risk of ciTBi. As an example, in a planned secondary analysis of a large multicenter cohort of children with minor head trauma, among the 2462 patients with an isolated headache by an "extensive definition" (headache of any degree and excluding patients with other PECARN predictors as well as seizure, amnesia, neurologic deficits, or any traumatic scalp findings), no patient (0 percent, 95% CI 0-0.1) had ciTBI versus 162 of 10,105 patients (1.6 percent, 95% CI 1.3-1.9) with headache and other symptoms [

Severe headache and the addition of other single PECARN predictors did not significantly change the risk of ciTBi or TBI on CT; however, the number of patients with these features was low.

         The priority for the evaluation of children with apparently minor head trauma is to identify those patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who may require immediate intervention (eg, an expanding epidural hematoma), admission for monitoring (eg, small stable epidural hematomas or cerebral contusions), or close follow-up (eg, skull fracture without intracranial injury) while limiting unnecessary neuroimaging.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical findings can help stratify a patient's risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) as high, intermediate, or low, with implications for the need for neuroimaging. Focused evaluation to support these clinical decisions can be facilitated by clinical practice guidelines and implementation of computerized decision support based upon validated clinical prediction rules such as the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) TBI rules  (

         The goal of evaluating minor head trauma in pediatric patients is to identify those children with ciTBI (by neuroimaging) while limiting unnecessary radiographic imaging and the radiation exposure of CT. Most children with minor head trauma do not need CT to exclude ciTBI. The decision to obtain a head CT must balance the importance of identifying a significant but rare ciTBI with the estimated risks of late-onset malignancy associated with radiation exposure from CT. Although only a very small number of patients with ciTBI require neurosurgery, the risk of missing such an injury is immediate and may have serious consequences for the patient. The risk of radiation-related malignancy is real; however, it wound not occur for years [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41,42
         </a>
         ]. Although preliminary evidence suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rather than CT may be feasible, it is not widely available in many settings.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evaluation for high-risk findings and the use of a clinical decision rule can provide a balanced approach that stratifies patients by risk for ciTBI  (

         Clinical decision rules are valuable aids that inform the clinician's approach to neuroimaging. However, they are not intended to fully replace clinical judgment and are intended to assist rather than completely direct the clinician's approach to neuroimaging for children with minor head trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
         For children two years of age and older with minor blunt head trauma and no suspicion for child abuse, we suggest that management decisions, especially the performance of neuroimaging and observation, be guided by the use of the PECARN low-risk clinical decision rules  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58477" href="/z/d/graphic/58477.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) rather than other rules because they were derived in the largest cohort and have the best discrimination for ciTBI [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,43-48
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In prospective validation, the sensitivity for detection of ciTBI in children ≥2 years was 97 percent (95% CI 89-100 percent) with a negative predictive value of 99.95 percent (95% CI 99.81-100 percent) in a population with approximately 1 percent prevalence of ciTBI in both the derivation and validation cohorts [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In addition to deriving and validating the clinical rules to identify children at low risk for ciTBI, these results support grouping of children with minor head trauma into three risk categories to inform CT decision-making and provide guidance for children who are not at low risk  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128099" href="/z/d/graphic/128099.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequently, the PECARN rule has shown high accuracy in both prospective and retrospective validation studies in a variety of settings [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43-47,49
         </a>
         ]. For example, in a prospective, multicenter study from Australia and New Zealand among over 11,100 children &gt;2 years, the risk estimates for ciTBI were consistent with the original PECARN study for this age group: high risk 5.7 percent (95% CI 4.4-7.2 percent), intermediate risk 0.7 percent (95% CI 0.5-1 percent), and low risk 0 percent (95% CI 0-0.1 percent) [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. Successful implementation of the PECARN rules have been described using a variety of methods including clinician education, clinical pathways, and clinical decision support embedded in the electronic health record [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41,51,52
         </a>
         ]. The PECARN and other clinical decision rules are discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         Evidence suggests that clinical decisions rules improve the detection of ciTBI in children with minor blunt head trauma compared with clinical judgment alone. In settings where clinician judgment is already documented to be highly accurate (eg, pediatric emergency medicine attendings practicing in high-volume tertiary care pediatric facilities), implementation of the PECARN decision rules may have limited impact on improving detection of ciTBI.

         In a planned secondary analysis of a multicenter, prospective, observational study of over 18,000 children with minor blunt head trauma (about 75 percent two years of age and older) presenting to emergency departments in New Zealand and Australia, planned observation was associated with lower CT use than patients who had imaging decisions made immediately after initial evaluation (unadjusted CT rate 4 versus 10 percent, respectively; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.2) [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. Most patients undergoing planned observation were at intermediate risk of ciTBI by PECARN criteria. Among intermediate-risk patients, there was no difference in ciTBI between patients observed (0.5 percent) and those with no planned observation (0.6 percent). Two intermediate-risk patients who underwent planned observation had ciTBI requiring neurosurgery. Among high-risk patients, ciTBI was noted in 1.2 percent of the observed group compared with 9.4 percent of patients with no planned observation (rate difference -8.3, 95% CI -10.2 to -6.3). Since decision to observe was the treating clinician's choice, and both intermediate- and high-risk groups are heterogeneous, it is possible that the observed patients may have been less symptomatic.

Most observed patients were intermediate risk by the PECARN decision rules and two years of age or older. All eight children with ciTBI had an immediate head CT, although clinical follow-up was confined to electronic medical record review.

         grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10

         <strong>
          Rationale
         </strong>
         – Minor blunt head trauma occurs commonly in children and is typically not associated with brain injury or long-term sequelae. However, a small number of children with apparently minor injuries may have a clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) that requires extended observation or acute intervention such as intensive supportive care or neurosurgery. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Rationale'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Among children two years of age and older with minor blunt head trauma and a normal neurologic examination, approximately 3 to 7 percent have a traumatic brain injury (TBI) noted on CT, approximately 1 percent have ciTBI, and 0.1 to 0.6 percent require neurosurgical intervention. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – The clinician should perform a thorough history and physical examination in children with minor blunt head trauma with specific attention to clinical findings that should raise concern for ciTBI. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation'

         <strong>
          PECARN clinical decision rules
         </strong>
         – Children older than two years of age with minor blunt head trauma can be stratified as high, intermediate, or low risk for ciTBI based on clinical features. We suggest that evaluation decisions, especially the performance of neuroimaging and observation, be guided by the use of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) low-risk clinical decision rules rather than other rules or clinical judgment alone. The table summarizes the criteria for high, intermediate, and low risk and the corresponding imaging decision  (

          table 3
         </a>
         ). (See

          'Clinical decision rules'

         <strong>
          Approach to neuroimaging
         </strong>
         – The approach to neuroimaging two years of age and older with minor blunt head trauma based upon clinical findings is provided in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128099" href="/z/d/graphic/128099.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Patients at high risk for ciTBI should undergo prompt neuroimaging. Those at intermediate risk may undergo neuroimaging or observation based on the specific clinical scenario, with performance of imaging if persistent, worsening, or new symptoms occur during observation. Individuals at low risk for ciTBI should not undergo neuroimaging. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         This approach does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         apply to children for whom there is clinical concern for abusive head trauma (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">
          "Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children"
         </a>
         ). All such patients warrant neuroimaging. Similarly, children with evidence of increased intracranial pressure and/or focal neurologic findings after apparently minor blunt head trauma should undergo emergency neuroimaging. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Recommended study
         </strong>
         – Both unenhanced CT of the head or MRI of the brain have the necessary sensitivity to identify ciTBI. Head CT can be rapidly obtained in most hospitals. Although MRI has no associated radiation, it is less available in most settings, which can result in delays in care and may require use of sedation due to longer scanning times. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Recommended study'

         above.)

          Management
