         The main goal of carotid artery imaging is to assess for vascular abnormalities that may contribute to stroke, of which the most common is atherosclerotic disease. Determining the degree of atherosclerotic stenosis (or whether complete occlusion is present) has critical management implications.

         The benefit of carotid revascularization with endarterectomy or stenting is dependent on the severity of the stenosis. The methods of evaluating the degree of carotid stenosis vary in technique and accuracy. If the results of clinical trials are to be generalized, there is a need for uniformity in measurement [

          Stenosis determination by angiography
         </strong>
         – The two major randomized clinical trials evaluating the utility of endarterectomy in symptomatic patients (NASCET and ECST) used different methods to measure carotid stenosis  (

         <a href="#rid2">
          2

          NASCET
         </strong>
         – The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method measures the residual lumen diameter at the most stenotic portion of the vessel and compares this with the lumen diameter in the normal internal carotid artery distal to the stenosis [

         – The European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) method measures the lumen diameter at the most stenotic portion of the vessel and compares this with the estimated probable original diameter at the site of maximum stenosis [

         – The common carotid (CC) method measures the residual lumen diameter at the most stenotic portion of the vessel and compares this with the lumen diameter in the proximal common carotid artery [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The CC method is mainly of historical interest, as it is rarely used in modern clinical practice.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The maximum degree of stenosis is generally in the carotid bulb, which is a wider portion of the artery than the distal segment. As a result, the same degree of stenosis is quantified as a higher percentage stenosis when measured by the ECST or CC methods than when measured by the NASCET method. The ECST methodology also requires an assumption of the true lumen, which increases the risk of interobserver variability  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58353" href="/z/d/graphic/58353.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Also note that atherosclerotic plaque may be present in the carotid bulb and still result in a NASCET measurement of 0 percent stenosis. Therefore, the absence of stenosis by NASCET criteria does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         exclude the presence of carotid plaque.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Despite these differences, the results of all three methods have a nearly linear relationship to each other and provide data of similar prognostic value [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Equivalent measurements for the three methods have been determined [

          Stenosis determination by carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS)
         </strong>
         – In contrast to the angiographic measurements described above, CDUS generally estimates the degree of stenosis based on elevations in blood flow velocity observed in the target vessel as opposed to anatomic measurements of luminal narrowing. Velocity criteria correlating with specific degrees of angiographically-confirmed stenosis have been established; these are typically categorical as opposed to linear (ie, &lt;50 percent stenosis, 50 to 69 percent stenosis, &gt;70 percent stenosis).

         No surgical treatment has been proven to be of benefit for preventing a subsequent stroke in patients with complete carotid artery occlusion. Additionally, revascularization in these patients is often technically not feasible. Thus, it is important to adequately distinguish between completely occluded vessels and those with some remaining flow, since the latter group may benefit from carotid revascularization.

         The choice among the noninvasive carotid artery imaging methods depends mainly upon the clinical indications for imaging, the availability and expertise at individual centers, and the initial patient presentation [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         <strong>
          Symptomatic
         </strong>
         – For patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) potentially due to carotid stenosis, we generally perform CTA or MRA of the head and neck initially. This expedites imaging of both the extracranial and intracranial circulation and allows for identification of unusual vascular abnormalities implicated as stroke mechanisms, such as carotid webs or dissections, in addition to more typical atherosclerotic stenosis. However, other experts prefer CDUS as the initial imaging test, followed most often by CTA if carotid revascularization is being considered.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients presenting with acute stroke or TIA, immediate CTA is often performed in the emergency department to risk-stratify and rapidly guide acute treatment.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients with stroke or suspected TIA undergoing brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have not already had CTA, combining brain MRI with MRA of the head and neck can be an efficient diagnostic strategy.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients with stroke or TIA in whom an obvious stroke mechanism is apparent (eg, atrial fibrillation) and for whom thrombolysis or thrombectomy is not a consideration, CDUS alone may be the efficient strategy.

         </strong>
         – CDUS, CTA, or MRA demonstrating less than 50 percent carotid stenosis generally rules out significant atherosclerotic stenosis that would require revascularization, and no further testing is typically needed. Important exceptions to this include carotid stenosis that is unusually distal and beyond the field of insonation for CDUS as well as short-segment stenosis in regions of heavily calcified plaque on CTA in which adequate assessment of the residual lumen may be difficult. Severe calcification may also hamper duplex imaging.

For instance, the combination of carotid duplex and MRA is highly specific (range 80 to 90 percent) for high-grade carotid stenosis when concordant [

          Occlusion
         </strong>
         – Both CDUS and MRA are quite accurate at discriminating between occlusion and severe stenosis. One systematic review pooled data across multiple studies and used digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the gold standard; for determination of complete carotid occlusion, the sensitivity and specificity with CDUS was 96 and 100 percent, respectively, and with MRA was 98 and 100 percent [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Some authors have suggested that, as with high-grade stenosis, concordant results from the combination of MRA and CDUS should be considered diagnostic of occlusion, while discordant results should prompt additional imaging modalities such as DSA [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Despite a widespread perception that CTA is highly accurate for discrimination between occlusion and severe stenosis, data supporting this are limited and confounded by technical changes in CTA over time and variable timing schemes for image acquisition. Early reports suggested CTA was 97 to 100 percent sensitive and 99 to 100 percent specific for detection of carotid occlusion [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ], but the increasing speed of image acquisition with multidetector computed tomography (CT) scans has led to recognition of the phenomenon of carotid "pseudo-occlusion," whereby image acquisition occurs with insufficient time for the contrast bolus to fully opacify the affected vessel, creating the erroneous appearance of complete occlusion [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. This problem can be avoided with multiphase CTA, but this is not widely used. In the author’s practice, carotid occlusion identified by CTA prompts further study with CDUS to confirm the occlusion if the patient would be a candidate for carotid revascularization and if atherosclerotic stenosis at the bifurcation is suspected to be the source of the occlusion. When carotid occlusion is identified by CEMRA or CDUS, additional testing is generally not performed.

         MRA is more expensive and time-consuming than CDUS and is less readily available. Furthermore, MRA may be difficult to adequately perform if the patient is critically ill, unable to lie supine, or has claustrophobia, a pacemaker, or ferromagnetic implants. MRA takes longer to acquire than CTA, which makes images more susceptible to artifact and image degradation from patient movement, although this is less of an issue with CEMRA than TOF MRA.

         The absence of flow in the internal carotid artery may be due to occlusion, but hairline residual lumens can be missed on CDUS (as with other imaging modalities). In addition, several studies have found that CDUS tends to overestimate the degree of stenosis [

         CDUS is less precise in determining stenoses of &lt;50 percent compared with stenoses of higher degrees [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. However, this rarely impacts its clinical utility as intervention is not indicated for any condition associated with internal carotid artery stenosis at the bifurcation of &lt;50 percent. CDUS may also be less accurate in determining stenoses in the range of 50 to 69 percent compared with ≥70 percent stenosis [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. However, this, too, rarely impacts its clinical utility because most patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis who are considered for endarterectomy have ≥70 percent stenosis. In addition, while patients with relevant symptoms and 50 to 69 percent stenosis may be appropriate for carotid intervention, most patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis have ≥70 percent stenosis.

         CDUS imaging may be limited by features such as calcific carotid lesions, tortuous or kinked carotid arteries, and patient body habitus. Furthermore, CDUS must be interpreted carefully in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion to avoid overestimation of an ipsilateral carotid stenosis, since the peak systolic velocity may be increased in the presence of a contralateral internal carotid occlusion [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. In this scenario, the peak internal carotid to the ipsilateral common carotid artery velocity ratio will usually accurately reflect the degree of stenosis. An additional limitation of CDUS is that only a portion of the cervical internal carotid artery extending just past the carotid bifurcation can be evaluated. Fortunately, the vast majority of atherosclerotic stenoses occur within this region. However, other carotid pathologies, such as carotid dissection, often occur in the more distal portion of the cervical carotid artery and thus will not be accurately identified by CDUS [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. When suspected, angiographic imaging with computed tomography angiography (CTA), MRA, or catheter angiography should be used instead. Transcranial Doppler may also provide additional information about intracranial vessels that may inform the assessment of carotid disease. (See

         A 2022 Cochrane systematic review concluded that CDUS compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the diagnosis of 50 to 99 percent carotid stenosis had a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.98) and specificity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.67-0.73) [

         <strong>
          As noted above, studies clearly demonstrate that increasing absolute peak systolic velocities are associated with increasing specificity for high-grade stenosis.

         As an adjunct to carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS), transcranial Doppler (TCD) examines the major intracerebral arteries through the orbit, temporal windows, and at the base of the brain. TCD can be used in conjunction with CDUS to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, and it can be used to improve the accuracy of CDUS in identifying surgical carotid disease [

        <p>
         TCD can evaluate the intracranial hemodynamic consequences of high-grade carotid lesions, such as the development of collateral flow patterns in the circle of Willis, reversal of flow in the ophthalmic and anterior cerebral arteries, absence of ophthalmic or carotid siphon flow, and reduced MCA flow velocity and pulsatility [

          46

         TCD can also be used for detection of middle cerebral artery microemboli that arise from the carotid artery.

TCD monitoring for microembolic signals is a powerful tool for risk-stratifying patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. This issue is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See

         The development of intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) reduces the dose of contrast, uses smaller catheters, and shortens the length of the procedure. Although there is lower spatial resolution, DSA has largely replaced conventional catheter angiography. The introduction of a radial as opposed to femoral artery approach for DSA has improved patient comfort with the procedure and is likely associated with a reduced risk of local vascular complications [

         The quality of catheter angiogram images depends upon selective catheterization of the carotid artery with at least two unimpeded views (typically an anteroposterior and lateral view, often with additional oblique views) to identify the projection with the most severe degree of stenosis; this method is consistent with how stenosis was determined in the ECST and NASCET trials.

         Cerebral angiography permits an evaluation of the entire carotid artery system, providing information about tandem atherosclerotic disease, plaque morphology/ulceration, and collateral circulation that may affect management.

         The disadvantages of catheter angiography include its invasive nature, high cost, and risk of morbidity and mortality. In a 1990 review of prospective studies using cerebral angiography, the risk of all neurologic complications was approximately 4 percent and the risk of serious neurologic complications or death was approximately 1 percent (range 0 to 6 percent). In a 2003 single-center prospective study of 986 patients undergoing angiography for diagnosis of carotid stenosis or ischemic stroke, an overall neurologic complication rate of 1.7 percent was reported, with a 0.6 percent rate of neurologic complications resulting in permanent sequelae [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. The risk of morbidity is increased with cerebrovascular symptoms, advanced age, diabetes, hypertension, elevated serum creatinine, and peripheral vascular disease. The size of the catheter, amount of contrast, and procedure duration also affect the likelihood of complications [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. One study found that embolic events following angiography occur more frequently than the apparent neurologic complication rate [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50

        </p>
        <p>
         Although often considered the "gold standard" of carotid neurovascular imaging methods, conventional DSA has the disadvantage of a limited number of projections, typically two or three, depicting the carotid artery and bifurcation. This limitation could lead to an underestimation of the degree of carotid stenosis in arteries that have asymmetrical rather than concentric stenotic lumens [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52

         After carotid intervention with endarterectomy or stenting, it is common to perform serial monitoring over time to ensure patency of the vessel and evaluate for restenosis. In general, carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS) is the preferred study in this setting given its low cost, ease of use, and ability to accurately monitor for change over time. However, structural changes to the carotid wall after endarterectomy or stenting may alter compliance of the vessel wall. This in turn may impact the relationship between flow velocity and degree of stenosis such that standard velocity criteria may be inaccurate. Accordingly, modified velocity criteria have been proposed to more accurately define the degree of restenosis in this specific situation [
         <a href="#rid30">

         When CDUS findings suggest significant carotid restenosis, carotid imaging with computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) can be performed for confirmation if intervention is being considered, noting that stent artifact may limit the accuracy of both CTA and, in particular, MRA.

          Stenosis measurement
         </strong>
         – The main methods of carotid stenosis measurement are the NASCET, ECST, and common carotid (CC) methods. The NASCET method is the most widely adopted. The NASCET and ECST methods were used in two major randomized clinical trials evaluating the utility of endarterectomy in symptomatic patients  (

         ). The results of all three methods have a nearly linear relationship to each other and provide data of similar prognostic value. (See

          Choice of imaging test
         </strong>
         – Most patients are evaluated for carotid disease using one of the noninvasive tests (carotid duplex ultrasound [CDUS], time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography [TOF MRA], contrast-enhanced MRA [CEMRA], or computed tomography angiography [CTA]). These noninvasive imaging modalities all have high sensitivities and specificities for diagnosing 70 to 99 percent internal carotid artery stenosis in patients with ipsilateral carotid territory ischemic symptoms. The accuracy of the noninvasive tests for 50 to 69 percent carotid stenosis is reduced compared with 70 to 99 percent stenosis. (See

If &gt;50 percent carotid stenosis is identified, we then perform confirmatory CDUS. If discordant results are found, we then consider alternate angiographic imaging different than the initial modality (ie, CTA if MRA was done initially, and vice versa). (See

          Asymptomatic patients

         – For patients who have suspected asymptomatic carotid disease, we generally use CDUS as our initial imaging modality.

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         If &gt;50 percent stenosis is identified and carotid revascularization will not be pursued (eg, based on assessment of relative risks and benefits in the individual patient), patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis can be followed with noninvasive vascular imaging of the carotid artery, typically with CDUS, particularly if they may be candidates for revascularization in the setting of stenosis progression.

         If &gt;50 percent stenosis is identified and if carotid revascularization is being considered, we then proceed to CTA or MRA with a similar approach to concordant and discordant results as described above. (See

          CTA
         </strong>
         – CTA provides an anatomic depiction of the carotid artery lumen and allows imaging of adjacent soft tissue and bony structures. Three-dimensional reconstruction allows accurate measurements of residual lumen diameter and degree of stenosis. (See

          MRA
         </strong>
         – The MRA techniques most often employed for evaluating the extracranial carotid arteries utilize either two- or three-dimensional TOF MRA or gadolinium-enhanced MRA (contrast-enhanced MRA [CEMRA]). MRA produces a reproducible three-dimensional image of the carotid bifurcation with good sensitivity for detecting high-grade carotid stenosis  (

         ). Both TOF MRA and CEMRA are accurate for the identification of high-grade carotid artery stenosis and occlusion. (See

         <strong>
          Ultrasound
         </strong>
         – CDUS uses B-mode ultrasound imaging and Doppler ultrasound to detect focal increases in blood flow velocity indicative of high-grade carotid stenosis  (

          TCD
         </strong>
         – Transcranial Doppler (TCD) examines the major intracerebral arteries through the orbit and at the base of the brain. TCD is sometimes used in conjunction with CDUS to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of internal carotid artery stenosis. TCD monitoring for microembolic signals is a powerful tool for risk-stratifying patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. (See

          Catheter angiography
         </strong>
         – Cerebral catheter angiography remains the gold standard for imaging the carotid arteries. However, catheter angiography is invasive, time-consuming, resource-intensive, and associated with a small but real risk of procedural stroke and other vascular complications. Given this and the high sensitivity/specificity of noninvasive approaches, catheter angiography is used infrequently. (See
