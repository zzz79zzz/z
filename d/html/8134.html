         Surgical replacement of a diseased heart valve with a prosthetic valve or transcatheter implantation of a prosthetic valve can provide substantial clinical benefits. However, such procedures exchange the adverse effects of native disease for prosthesis-related complications [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The frequency of various complications depends upon the valve type and position, and other clinical risk factors. Complications include embolic events, bleeding, valve obstruction (due to thrombosis or pannus), infective endocarditis, structural deterioration (particularly for bioprosthetic valves), paravalvular regurgitation, hemolytic anemia, and prosthesis-patient mismatch. (See

         Management of patients with prosthetic valves, including monitoring for complications, is reviewed here.

         Patients should be educated about prosthetic valve outcomes, the need for proper care (including optimal dental care, the need for antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures, and when required, appropriate antithrombotic therapy) and should be instructed to seek prompt medical attention for any new sign or symptom that might be related to a valve complication such as a significant change in the audible click of a mechanical prosthesis, persistent or recurrent fever, decrease in exercise tolerance, ischemic cerebral events, or palpitations. Repeat evaluation with echocardiography should be performed any time there is a change in clinical status or examination findings. (See

         The main components of follow-up are history, physical examination, and echocardiography. We suggest the following approach to evaluation after prosthetic valve implantation, largely based on the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline on the management of patients with valvular heart disease [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </span>
         The first outpatient visit at six weeks (or earlier if an issue was identified at discharge such as heart failure or pericardial effusion or if new symptoms or signs arise) to three months after valve implantation is aimed at assessing function of the prosthetic valve and looking for signs of infection, conduction disturbance, or myocardial infarction. The evaluation should include an interval history, physical examination, appropriate blood tests (complete blood count, creatinine, electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, and International Normalized Ratio if indicated), and a transthoracic echocardiogram. An electrocardiogram (ECG) may be obtained, if indicated.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A baseline echocardiogram is essential since it enables assessment of the effects of surgery on cardiac remodeling and function, and serves as a basis for later comparison, particularly for valvular hemodynamics obtained with Doppler.

         Follow-up clinical evaluation with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE; and transesophageal echocardiography [TEE] as needed) should be performed any time there is a change in clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of valve dysfunction, or, in patients with mechanical valves, an interruption in effective anticoagulation.

         Routine follow-up visits in asymptomatic patients with normal cardiac function should occur yearly. The evaluation should include a complete history and physical examination; other tests are performed as indicated.

         For patients with a surgically implanted bioprosthetic valve, a TTE at 5 and 10 years, and then annually after implantation, is reasonable, even in the absence of symptoms or of a change in clinical status. Earlier surveillance is suggested for selected patients at risk for early bioprosthetic valve degeneration, including patients with hyperparathyroidism (including patients with kidney disease), systemic inflammatory disease, and patients &lt;60 years old.

         For transcatheter aortic and pulmonic bioprosthetic valves, we recommend annual echocardiography, as the long-term durability of these valves has not yet been established. In addition, many patients are enrolled in mandated valve registries that require annual imaging. (See

         In addition to routine monitoring of prosthetic heart valves, periodic echocardiography is frequently indicated in patients with prosthetic valves for residual cardiac abnormalities, such as left ventricular dilation or systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, abnormalities of native valves, and persistent pulmonary hypertension.

         When performing a history and physical examination in patients with prosthetic heart valve, particular attention should be given to the following signs and symptoms:

         Subtle symptoms of heart failure or neurologic events can be clues to serious valve-related complications. In a patient with a prosthetic heart valve, new symptoms or signs should be carefully considered to determine if they may be caused by a valve complication. The physical findings may identify signs of embolic events suggested by the history.

         Abnormal auscultatory findings may be suggestive of valvular abnormalities  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70856" href="/z/d/graphic/70856.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. With a mechanical valve, absence or blunting of typical opening and closing sounds may be suggestive of valve thrombosis. With both mechanical and biological valves, a new murmur suggests prosthetic valve stenosis, regurgitation, or a paravalvular leak. Interpretation of auscultatory findings in patients with prosthetic heart valves is difficult even for experienced clinicians. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1078.html" rel="external">

         As noted above, a baseline echocardiogram is recommended in all patients at their first postoperative follow-up visit. This study is used to document the stability of the valve, the presence and extent of valvular or paravalvular regurgitation, and the transvalvular pressure gradients. Methods to evaluate surgical and percutaneous prosthetic valve function with Doppler echocardiography are detailed in the guidelines from the American Society of Echocardiography [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. The postoperative baseline echocardiogram also establishes whether there are concurrent conditions (left ventricular dysfunction, pericardial effusion, pulmonary hypertension, or other valve involvement) that might warrant more frequent imaging than needed for monitoring the prosthetic valve. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5333.html" rel="external">
          "Echocardiographic evaluation of prosthetic heart valves"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         TTE is generally used for the baseline study; TEE may be indicated in select patients to assess valve dysfunction (eg, those with a suspected paravalvular leak from a mitral prosthesis), or patients with a suspected cardiac source of embolism  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67281 graphicRef68507 graphicRef75409" href="/z/d/graphic/67281.html" rel="external">

         Doppler-derived velocities and derived parameters are essential in the noninvasive evaluation of prosthetic valve function [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. One study, for example, found that application of the continuity equation and calculation of valve resistance provided a reliable method to distinguish whether a high velocity and gradient across a St. Jude aortic valve was secondary to obstruction or increased flow (as with paravalvular aortic regurgitation) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Parameters that differentiated stenotic from regurgitant and normal valves were effective orifice area, Doppler velocity index, and valve resistance. (See

         The incidence of serious complications in appropriately managed patients with prosthetic heart valves is approximately 3 percent per year. The frequency of various complications depends upon the valve type (mechanical versus bioprosthetic), position, and multiple clinical risk factors, including adequacy of anticoagulation.

         In patients with newer generation prosthetic valves (those used since approximately the 1990s), hemolysis is common (eg, in one series, 51.2 percent in patients with St. Jude valves and 17.8 percent in patients with Medtronic Hall valves [

         ]) but usually mild and subclinical, reflected by mild elevations in the serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration. Hemolytic anemia is seen more commonly with mechanical heart valves than with bioprosthetic valves. Hemolysis severe enough to produce anemia is rare (&lt;1 percent) with newer generation prosthetic valves [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>

         Severe hemolysis was previously reported in up to 15 percent of patients with certain older valve prostheses, such as ball valves and certain older bileaflet valves, which may have been at least partly related to structural deterioration [

         Oral iron and folate replacement are effective in the majority of patients. In occasional patients, red cell transfusion is required; in such cases, the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin may eliminate the need for transfusion [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Reoperation may be required, especially if hemolysis is due to regurgitation from a paravalvular leak or valve failure. It is important to note that the degree of regurgitation does not have to be severe to cause hemolysis, as it is mainly secondary to shear forces from the high velocity jet hitting adjacent structures.

         Patients with prosthetic valves are among those at highest risk of an adverse outcome from infective endocarditis. Patient education should include instruction regarding the risk of infective endocarditis, the importance of optimal dental hygiene and regular dental care, the need for endocarditis prophylaxis at the time of relevant procedures, and the importance of seeking medical attention, including blood cultures promptly if symptoms of endocarditis develop. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended in the setting of relevant procedures likely to result in bacteremia with a microorganism that has the potential ability to cause endocarditis (eg, dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of the teeth, or perforation of the oral mucosa, such as tooth extraction and routine dental cleaning). Relevant procedures and recommended regimens are discussed in detail separately. (See

         is recommended in patients with prosthetic heart valves to prevent valve thrombosis and thromboembolic events. Recommendations for therapy vary with the type of valve (the risk of thrombosis is much greater with mechanical valves), the site of valve replacement (the risk is greater with mitral than aortic valves), and the presence or absence of thrombotic risk factors, including atrial fibrillation. Specific recommendations apply to management of antithrombotic therapy during pregnancy and during invasive procedures. (See

         For all patients receiving a prosthetic heart valve, a baseline echocardiogram is recommended at first postoperative follow-up visit six weeks to three months after prosthetic valve implantation. (See

         In asymptomatic patients with mechanical valves without evidence of left ventricular or valve dysfunction, routine annual echocardiography is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         indicated. Surgical bioprosthetic valves should be imaged annually starting 10 years after implantation with earlier evaluation in those at risk of more rapid valve deterioration. Transcatheter bioprosthetic valves should be imaged annually. (See

         Patients with prosthetic valves are among those at highest risk of an adverse outcome from infective endocarditis and thus optimal dental care is essential, and antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended in the setting of procedures likely to result in bacteremia with a microorganism that has the potential ability to cause endocarditis.

         Hemolysis associated with prosthetic heart valves is more common with mechanical than bioprosthetic valves. It is usually mild and subclinical but is severe in certain patients with paravalvular regurgitation. (See

         Regular moderate exercise to maintain cardiovascular fitness is encouraged in patients with prosthetic valves. Recommendations for competitive sports vary depending upon valve type and need for anticoagulation. All patients treated with anticoagulation should not participate in sports associated with risk of bodily contact or other types of trauma  (

         Pregnancy in women with prosthetic mechanical heart valves is complicated by the need for antithrombotic therapy. While
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin

         is the most effective therapy to prevent valve thrombosis and thromboembolism, warfarin use is associated with an increased risk of fetal anomalies and a high risk of late fetal loss. These and other issues related to prosthetic valves during pregnancy and the peripartum period are discussed in detail separately. (See
