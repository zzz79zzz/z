         Short-term mechanical circulatory assist (support) devices are designed to provide hemodynamic support for a wide range of clinical conditions, ranging from prophylactic insertion for high-risk invasive coronary artery procedures to the management of cardiogenic shock, acute decompensated heart failure, or cardiopulmonary arrest. Each of these devices provides circulatory support by performing work for a failing left or right ventricle or both.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are four major (arbitrary) categories of circulatory assist devices: intraaortic balloon pumps (IABP), non-IABP percutaneous mechanical circulatory assist devices  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93736" href="/z/d/graphic/93736.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ), extracorporeal membrane oxygenator pumps, and nonpercutaneous centrifugal pumps, which are used for cardiopulmonary bypass. These devices are often inserted in the catheterization laboratory but in some cases, such as an IABP, they can be inserted in the intensive care unit.
        </p>
        <p>
         A description of short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices will be reviewed here. The role for intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory devices as "bridges" to transplantation or as replacement therapy for failing hearts is discussed separately. (See

         The intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) is the most commonly used mechanical support device, and it is the device interventional cardiologists are most familiar with. It is inserted easily and rapidly, is the least expensive of all the devices, and does not require continuous monitoring by technical support personnel. However, it is limited in that it is capable of generating only modest hemodynamic support and myocardial protection. In addition, clinical trials of patients with cardiogenic shock have not shown an improvement in mortality with IABP use. IABP use is discussed separately. (See

         The major limitations of the intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), discussed directly above, formed the basis for the development of other percutaneous mechanical circulatory devices. Compared with the IABP, they provide greater improvement in hemodynamic parameters. Similar to IABP, there is no evidence to suggest they improve clinical outcomes such as mortality. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83.html" rel="external">

         These devices, relative to IABP, cost more, take longer to insert, and have a higher complication rate (ie, bleeding, hemolysis, limb ischemia).

         The axial flow pump works on the principle of an Archimedes screw. The inflow is placed retrogradely across the aortic valve into the left ventricle. A pump revolving at high speeds draws blood out of the left ventricle and ejects it proximally into the ascending aorta. A device that uses this principle is the Impella micro-axial flow device  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103910" href="/z/d/graphic/103910.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ), which is a miniature impeller pump located within a catheter. The Impella System is available in different sizes (versions 2.5, CP and 5.0), where the smaller device can be placed percutaneously but only provides half the support of the larger device that is placed surgically.
        </p>
        <p>
         Impella was designed for either surgical placement using a graft in the ascending aorta or subclavian artery, or for percutaneous placement via the femoral artery [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 24 patients who received a surgically-implanted Impella device for post-cardiotomy failure, mortality was 54 percent, comparable to that seen in a cohort of high-risk patients supported with an IABP [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The PROTECT II trial was designed to compare outcomes in over 600 symptomatic patients with complex three-vessel or unprotected left main coronary artery disease and severely depressed left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35 percent) who were to be randomly assigned to an Impella (version 2.5) or an IABP [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The trial was stopped for futility at 69 percent (n = 448) of planned enrollment. There was no significant difference in the primary end point of major adverse events at 30 days (35.1 versus 40.1 percent, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
         On per-protocol analysis, Impella use was associated with a reduction in the composite end point (major adverse cardiovascular events) at 90 days (51.0 versus 40.0 percent, p = 0.023), driven mostly by a reduction in the need for repeat revascularization (8.1 versus 3.7 percent, p = 0.06). There appeared to be effect modification by rotational atherectomy use, such that patients not undergoing this procedure had a significant reduction with Impella in major adverse event rate at 30 (p = 0.01) and 90 days (p = 0.003), as compared with IABP. It remains to be seen whether the two other Impella pumps that provide greater flow (3 to 5 L/min) will provide further improvement outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intravascular microaxial LVAD and IABP have also been compared in patients with acute MI and cardiogenic shock [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8

         An extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device is a cardiopulmonary support system that, in addition to helping to move blood forward, removes carbon dioxide from and adds oxygen to venous blood using an artificial membrane lung. When placed in its standard venoarterial configuration (right-atrium-to-the-iliofemoral-artery system), the pulmonary circulation is bypassed and oxygenated blood returns to the patient via an arterial or venous route. With veno-venous bypass, ECMO is effective primarily as a therapeutic option for patients with severe respiratory failure. With venoarterial bypass, an extracorporeal pump is employed to support systemic perfusion, thus providing a hemodynamic support option in patients with circulatory and respiratory failure. A MagLev centrifugal pump in combination with long-term oxygenators (CentriMag plus Maquet Quadrox or the Maquet CardioHelp) provides full cardiopulmonary support (including hemodynamic support and oxygenation of venous blood) analogous to that provided by bypass during cardiac surgery. The ECMO systems involve placement in the central arterial and venous circulation of large bore catheters that allow positioning of cannulae in the aorta and right atrium. Blood from the venous catheter is pumped through a heat exchanger and oxygenator and then returned to the systemic arterial circulation via the arterial cannula. The ECMO systems can be used for support for up to 30 days. ECMO can also be placed in a venovenous configuration where deoxygenated blood is drawn from the superior vena cava/inferior vena cava and right atrium to the ECMO pump, and fully oxygenated blood is then returned through the tricuspid valve to the lungs  (

         In contrast to left-ventricle-to-aorta pumps that unload the left ventricle, ECMO and left-atrium-to-iliofemoral system pumps produce a significant load on the left ventricle. With compromised left ventricular function, this load can reduce left ventricular ejection fraction substantially, causing in some cases complete closure of the aortic valve and an increase in left ventricular filling pressures and/or pulmonary edema or pulmonary hemorrhage. As such, ECMO has been combined with an axial flow pump, referred to as "ECPELLA," to unload and decompress the left ventricle in this setting. Whether this circuit provides an effect that allows the heart to recover and avoid an otherwise necessary durable ventricular assist device or death remains to be shown. In August, 2020, the U S Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for left-sided Impella heart pumps as a tool to provide unloading therapy for COVID-19 patients undergoing ECMO.

         External centrifugal pumps use rotating cones or impellers to generate energy that is recovered in the form of pressure flow work. There are presently two centrifugal pumps available for very short-term use (less than six hours): the Bio-Medicus (Bio-Medicus Inc, Minneapolis, Minnesota) and the Sarns (Sarns/3M Ann Arbor, Michigan). They are used primarily for cardiopulmonary bypass during open heart cases and thus are not placed percutaneously. They cause too much hemolysis to permit long-term use. (See

         There are currently two magnetically-levitated implantable centrifugal pumps approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ventricular assistance: Thoratec CentriMag and TandemHeart (see
         <a class="local">
          'Left ventricle to aorta'
         </a>
         above). One example of their use is right ventricular support at the time of left ventricular assist device placement. The Maquet Rotaflow is also magnetically levitated and can be used long or short term but is FDA-approved only for use in cardiopulmonary bypass during open-heart procedures. The magnetic levitated pumps cause less trauma, less heat generation, and are standard of care for short-term ventricular assist device support. They can be implanted for long periods of time (up to four months). They have the capability of supporting patients who cannot be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, those in cardiogenic shock, or who are awaiting cardiac transplantation. The pumps are versatile and can be used as a right ventricular assist device, left ventricular assist device, or biventricular support.
        </p>
        <p>
         Insertion of centrifugal pumps, especially for long-term use, generally requires a sternotomy. The right and/or left atrium can be cannulated by using simple purse string sutures. The aorta and/or the pulmonary artery are cannulated by using standard cardiopulmonary bypass aorta cannulae placed through a purse string suture. For long-term use, sewn grafts to the aorta or pulmonary artery are preferred. With appropriate cannulae, these devices can also be placed percutaneously in the catheterization laboratory as described above.
        </p>
        <p>
         Centrifugal pumps have several important caveats:

         The magnetically-levitated devices are generally well tolerated and cause a minimal amount of hemolysis and generalized inflammatory response. The devices themselves perform well; most of the complications occur due to the method of cannulation, whether percutaneous or open.

         An important potential complication of these devices is clot formation. The main source of problematic clots is at the tips of the cannulae and not the devices themselves. These clots can lead to arterial embolization or inflow occlusion. Patients with centrifugal pumps should be maintained on continuous intravenous heparin anticoagulation, which is started as soon as the initial bleeding subsides and continued until device removal. The activated partial thromboplastin time is maintained between 150 and 200 seconds but can be reduced if flows are maintained and if bleeding increases.

         ]. A retrospective analysis of the French National Heart Transplant Registry (CRISTAL) of 80 patients supported by venous arterial ECMO prior to heart transplant had a 52.2 percent one-year survival post-heart transplant compared with 75.5 percent in 866 patients not supported by ECMO [

         ]. Given these results, it is doubtful that Tier 1.i will often be used for bridging transplant. Tiers 2.i and 2.ii (IABP and percutaneous endovascular hemodynamic support) will be utilized to keep patients alive until transplant and facilitate transplantation. This will likely result in increased utilization of short-term mechanical circulatory support. The new system was implemented in October 2018. Outcome information will be available in mid-2019. (See

         Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices improve cardiovascular hemodynamics by assisting a failing left or right ventricle or both. However, with the exception of those devices used during open-heart surgery, they have not been shown to improve mortality. (See

         These devices are broadly categorized as follows: intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), non-IABP percutaneous mechanical circulatory assist devices, extracorporeal membrane oxygenator pumps, and nonpercutaneous centrifugal pumps. (See
