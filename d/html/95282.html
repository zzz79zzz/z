         Atherosclerosis results in the accumulation of lipid and fibrous material between the layers of the arterial wall and causes disease of the coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arteries. Atherosclerotic disease often involves the arteries providing flow to the lower extremities, referred to as lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). Atherosclerosis can lead to acute or chronic symptoms due to embolism from more proximal disease, or due to thrombosis of an artery that has been progressively narrowed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Management of patients with lower extremity PAD should include medical therapies aimed at reducing the risk for future cardiovascular and limb events related to atherothrombosis, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and amputation, and also to improve limb symptoms and quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of atherosclerotic disease affecting the lower extremities is provided here. Disease affecting the upper extremity is reviewed separately. (See

         The subintimal accumulation of lipid and fibrous material (ie, plaque) can narrow the vessel lumen, which can thrombose, or the plaque can rupture, causing occlusion of downstream vessels. Multiple factors contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, including endothelial dysfunction, enhanced platelet activity, dyslipidemia, inflammatory and immunologic factors, and tobacco use. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13603.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The symptoms related to atherosclerotic narrowing of the aorta or lower extremity arteries depend upon the location and severity of disease. Within any arterial segment (aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, tibial), the plaque tends to occur in the proximal or mid-segments (eg, proximal bifurcation leading to that vascular bed). Atherosclerotic disease follows anatomic patterns, which also have a bearing on the natural history and progression of disease. Patients with diabetes or with end-stage kidney disease generally present with more distal disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with PAD develop changes in their muscles with reduced calf skeletal muscle area and increased calf muscle fat infiltration and fibrosis. The presence of PAD also reduces calf muscle perfusion and impairs mitochondrial activity, and greater walking impairment is associated with smaller myofibers. Small clinical trials have shown that these changes are reversible with intervention. Patients with PAD have been shown to suffer from sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is a type of muscle loss that occurs with aging and/or immobility and is characterized by the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength. The rate of muscle loss depends on exercise level, comorbidities, nutrition, and other factors. All the etiological factors that have been associated with sarcopenia are present in PAD. Both sarcopenia and PAD are accompanied by oxidative stress, skeletal muscle mitochondrial impairments, inflammation, inhibition of specific pathways regulating muscle synthesis or protection (ie, insulin-like growth factor-1, reperfusion injury salvage kinase [RISK], and Survivor Activating Factor Enhancement [SAFE]), and activation of molecules associated with muscle degradation [

         The overall prevalence of lower extremity PAD varies widely depending upon the population studied but is estimated to be approximately 10 percent of adults older than 55 years [

          6

         The clinical manifestations of PAD (claudication, rest pain, ulceration, and gangrene) are predominantly due to progressive luminal narrowing (stenosis/occlusion), although thrombosis or embolism of unstable atherosclerotic plaque or thrombotic material can also occur [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The natural history of those who present with mild-to-moderate claudication is generally benign with respect to the limb, which contrasts with the more progressive clinical course seen in those who present with ischemic rest pain or ulceration. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8208.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Single-level disease (ie, aortoiliac, superficial femoral) more frequently manifests initially as claudication. Multilevel disease can manifest as claudication when collateral circulation is adequate  (

         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>

         Exertional pain in patients with lower extremity PAD is termed "claudication," which is derived from the Latin word "claudico" (to limp). Claudication is a reproducible discomfort of a defined group of muscles that is induced by exercise and relieved with rest. Claudication can present unilaterally or bilaterally, as buttock and hip, thigh, calf, or foot pain, singly or in combination. The severity of symptoms depends upon the number and degree of arterial narrowings, the collateral circulation, and the vigor of extremity use. (See

         Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of PAD in combination with rest pain, gangrene, or a lower limb ulceration &gt;2 weeks duration. CLTI is the preferred term replacing the terms critical limb ischemia (CLI) or severe limb ischemia [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. The use of the term CLTI reflects changes in arterial disease patterns and the concept that CLTI is a spectrum of disease, a concept that is especially applicable to patients with diabetes. The nature of the clinical manifestations depends upon the wound extent, the presence or absence of infection, and the time course over which arterial narrowing or occlusion occurs; the latter in turn affects the extent to which the collateral circulation can develop  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956" href="/z/d/graphic/72956.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Acute-on-chronic reductions in limb perfusion, which may be due to atheroembolism, cholesterol embolism, or thrombotic occlusion of a stenotic vessel, cause diffuse limb pain [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Chronic severe reductions in limb perfusion present as ischemic rest pain, typically localized to the forefoot and toes, or as tissue loss (nonhealing ulcer, gangrene).

         </span>
         In patients with an appropriate history and physical examination, the diagnosis of PAD is established with the measurement of an ankle-brachial index (ABI) ≤0.9. The ABI is a comparison of the resting systolic blood pressure at the ankle to the higher systolic brachial pressure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85752 graphicRef50445" href="/z/d/graphic/85752.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1A-B
         </a>
         ). An ABI of 0.9 to 0.99 is classified as borderline normal; the pressure is normally higher in the ankle than in the arm (ie, ABI &gt;1 to 1.3). For patients with symptoms suggestive of PAD, but a normal or borderline ABI, we obtain an ABI following exercise testing. We also obtain additional vascular studies (eg, toe-brachial index) for an ABI &gt;1.3, which suggests the presence of noncompressible calcified vessels. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8201.html" rel="external">

         The management of patients with lower extremity PAD is aimed at relieving symptoms and lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease progression and complications. Patients with PAD exhibit a wide range of symptoms and associated effects on daily function. The treatment of symptomatic lower extremity PAD is based on a careful assessment of risk factors, medical comorbidities, compliance with pharmacologic treatments and follow-up care, and the subjective values and goals of the patient. Patients with ischemic pain or ulceration may necessarily require early intervention for limb salvage. (See

         PAD is regarded as a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. We agree with major cardiovascular practice guidelines for the management of patients identified with PAD (asymptomatic or symptomatic) that recommend secondary prevention measures to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events and potentially limit the progression of atherosclerosis [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,29,31-33

        </p>
        <p>
         Preventive therapies include antiplatelet therapy, smoking cessation, lipid-lowering therapy, and treatment of diabetes and hypertension. Prevention of cardiovascular disease events is reviewed separately. Some of these treatments can also reduce the risk of periprocedural complications and also may improve symptoms or the patency of interventions. Management of medications in the periprocedural period is reviewed separately. (See

         Long-term antithrombotic therapy has established benefit in the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Based upon randomized trials showing a significantly reduced risk for future adverse cardiovascular events, we agree with major cardiovascular consensus guidelines that recommend long-term antiplatelet therapy (eg,

         ]. For individuals identified with PAD who are asymptomatic, antithrombotic therapy is individualized, accounting for overall cardiovascular risk and weighing the potential risk reduction with the potential increase in bleeding. We do not recommend dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with PAD in the absence of other indications (eg, drug-eluting stent) given the increased risk of bleeding in the absence of proven benefit.

Major bleeding, as defined according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) classification, was 2.7 percent in the rivaroxaban group and 1.9 percent in the placebo group (HR 1.43, 95% CI 0.97-2.10).

         Numerous epidemiological and observational studies show that smoking cessation reduces adverse cardiovascular events and the risk for limb loss in patients with PAD, but smoking cessation may be difficult to accomplish. We agree with consensus guidelines that recommend smoking cessation for all patients with PAD. The patient should be assessed for willingness to quit smoking and assisted in finding resources (eg, behavioral modification) to help with this goal. Follow-up for smoking cessation therapy should also be arranged.

         Hypertension is a major risk factor for PAD. However, there are no data evaluating whether antihypertensive therapy alters the progression of PAD. In the EUCLID trial, poor blood pressure control and high systolic blood pressure were associated with worse limb outcomes [

          69,70

Every 10 mmHg increase in SBP &gt;125 mmHg was associated with a significant increase in the risk of major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio [HR] 1.10, 95% CI 1.06–1.14) and an increased risk of major adverse limb events/lower extremity revascularization (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04–1.11). Every 10 mmHg decrease in SBP ≤125 mmHg was associated with a significant increase in the risk of major adverse cardiac events (HR 1.19, 95% CI, 1.09–1.31]), but not major adverse limb events or major adverse limb events/lower extremity revascularization.

         The relationship between obesity and PAD is unclear. In two small studies, obesity independently predicted more severe PAD [

          76,77

         <a href="#rid76">
          76
         </a>
         ]. In a small prospective cohort study, obesity was independently associated with the severity of PAD as measured by ankle-brachial pressure index, initial claudication distance, and mean walking distance [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77
         </a>
         ]. Metabolic syndrome was independently associated only with mean walking distance. By 24 months, outcome events occurred in 37 and 43 percent of patients with metabolic syndrome or obesity, respectively, compared with 0 and 11 percent of those without these diagnoses. A subsequent, larger observational study suggested that body mass indicator is an independent risk factor for PAD, but only in women [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78
         </a>
         ]. In a review of data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, higher body mass index was associated with increased incident hospitalized PAD after adjusting for potential confounders, particularly for more severe ischemia [
         <a href="#rid79">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, obesity has been associated with lower risk for death in patients with PAD. In a review of a national German database of over 5 million individuals aged 18 years or older with PAD, those classified as obese were younger (70 versus 73), more frequently female (36.7 versus 35.1 percent), had less cancer (4.9 versus 7.9 percent), and had less frequent major amputation (2.6 versus 3.2 percent) compared with the nonobese reference group [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80
         </a>
         ]. In-hospital mortality was 5 percent overall. Obese patients with PAD had lower mortality rate (3.2 versus 5.1 percent), and a reduced risk for in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.61-0.63) compared with those who were normal weight or overweight. This obesity survival paradox was independent of age, sex, and comorbidities and was seen in all obesity classes. (See

         Although those with asymptomatic PAD (defined as an abnormal ABI without typical limb pain) may not report exertional pain, lower extremity function may nonetheless be impaired as evidenced by slow walking speed or poor balance. Whether those with asymptomatic PAD should undergo ABI testing and with what frequency has not been established, but testing or repeat testing may be useful in higher-risk patients. It is also important to note that some asymptomatic PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, can develop limb-threatening ischemia without an antecedent history of claudication.

         , may also improve symptoms. Statin therapy may also improve pain-free walking time in patients with claudication, but the evidence for this is conflicting. There is no evidence that beta blocker therapy for treatment of high blood pressure worsens claudication. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8210.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Without treatment, the natural history of claudication is a slow progressive decline in the distance the individual is able to walk before the onset of pain. However, with intensive medical management (risk factor reduction, exercise therapy, pharmacologic therapy), among patients with claudication and no diabetes or renal dysfunction, less than 5 percent will develop any signs of limb-threatening ischemia, and the risk of major amputation is exceedingly low (&lt;1 percent per year). The risk for other adverse cardiovascular events (eg, stroke, heart attack) is greater than the risk for adverse limb outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms should be reevaluated after conservative treatments (risk factor reduction, exercise therapy, pharmacologic therapy) have been instituted and allowed to have an effect. If claudication symptoms persist and the patient has been responsive to adjusting his/her lifestyle, the patient may be a candidate for an endovascular or open intervention depending on the location and severity of lesions and medical risk.

         Once a patient develops ischemic rest pain or tissue loss, the natural history often involves a persistent decline and an increased risk of major limb amputation unless there is some form of intervention to improve arterial perfusion. (See

         For patients with wet gangrene or abscess, the wound should be debrided or drained immediately regardless of the anticipated need for revascularization. The dressing choice depends upon the level of anticipated drainage and the size of the wound. Dead space is usually managed with gauze packing. The extremity should be revascularized as soon as safely possible, if needed, after drainage/debridement and control of the infection.

         For patients with dry gangrene without cellulitis, the limb should be revascularized first. The wound dressing is protective, reducing the risk for trauma or infection. The wound should be lightly wrapped with a bulky dry gauze bandage, avoiding excess pressure that could aggravate ischemia. Following revascularization, the wound should be monitored closely for signs of healing, or for tissue necrosis/drainage that may indicate a need for further debridement.

         Some patients are poor candidates for any type of revascularization procedure (endovascular, surgical) because of concomitant diseases or unfavorable anatomy. Medical therapies would be desirable in such patients. Therapies that have been investigated include prostaglandins, therapeutic angiogenesis, stem cell therapy, and spinal cord stimulation; however, none of these are recommended. (See

         For those with significant or disabling symptoms of claudication unresponsive to lifestyle adjustment and pharmacologic therapy, intervention (percutaneous, surgical) may be reasonable. In the absence of limb-threatening ischemia, symptoms of PAD tend to remain stable with medical therapy. Performing prophylactic intervention, whether percutaneous or surgical, in patients with minimal claudication provides little benefit, may cause harm, and is not indicated. (See

         For patients over 65 years of age, comprehensive geriatric assessment may improve outcomes following elective lower extremity bypass. In a trial that included 176 patients undergoing lower extremity bypass surgery or abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, length of stay was reduced for those randomly assigned to comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimization versus standard preoperative assessment (3.32 versus 5.53 days) [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84
         </a>
         ]. Although the outcomes were not stratified by the type of surgery, the major benefit shown was more likely to have occurred in the bypass group. The comprehensive assessment increased the number of new diagnoses (eg, pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cognitive impairment) and influenced the number of patients who did not undergo surgery. There was a lower incidence of complications, including cardiac complications (8 versus 27 percent), bladder/bowel complications (33 versus 55 percent), and delirium (11 versus 24 percent). Patients in the comprehensive assessment group were also less likely to require discharge to a higher level of dependency. This trial underscores the need to accurately assess medical risk prior to undertaking elective vascular surgery in older adults. (See

         Among those with appropriate indications for intervention, determining whether percutaneous or surgical revascularization is the more appropriate initial treatment depends upon a myriad of factors, including symptomatology, WIfI stage, patient risk, available conduit, anatomic location and extent of disease, the patient's comorbidities (including frailty) and functional status, risk for the intervention, and patient preference.

         The majority of patients presenting with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) can be offered a reasonable attempt at limb salvage. Freedom from pain or sustained healing of areas of tissue loss may be acceptable goals even in the absence of sustained patency of the treated arterial lesion. Overall, approximately 25 percent of patients with CLTI require amputation within one year. However, for some patients, primary amputation may be the best course of therapy.

         For most focal lesions, given the widespread availability of percutaneous procedures, initial percutaneous revascularization is supported by major vascular society guidelines. Surgery is generally reserved for those with arterial anatomy for which a percutaneous approach is not likely to provide a durable clinical success, provided the patient has an acceptable risk for surgery [

Excluded from the POISE-2 trial were patients with carotid occlusive disease and patients with bare metal coronary stents placed fewer than six weeks before the surgery or drug-eluting coronary stents less than one year before surgery. As with the overall results, there was no significant difference for the primary outcome (composite of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days) for those allocated to aspirin compared with placebo (15.8 versus 13.6 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 1.16, 95% CI 0.62-2.17). In the subgroup analysis of those with a prior coronary stent, there appeared to be a benefit for aspirin [

However, while there was an increased risk of major or life-threatening bleeding, the difference was not statistically significant among vascular surgery patients taking aspirin. The results of this study (positive and negative) need to be viewed with caution as the number of events was small and the subgroup analysis was underpowered.

         Outcomes of revascularization may be measured anatomically, hemodynamically, and functionally. While anatomic patency and hemodynamic success are important, the primary reason to perform an intervention is symptom relief and long-term clinical success. Following intervention, clinical success is often higher than anatomic success. Clinical failures are only partially related to anatomic patency of the treated area, and other factors, such as progression of disease in the inflow vessels, in the treated vessel, and in the outflow tract, are also implicated.

         Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are an important and developing metric to evaluate a patient’s subjective perception of their health and wellbeing before and after medical intervention. Patients with claudication have decrements in perceived health status and quality of life (QoL), which worsens with disease progression. After a period of supervised exercise therapy (SET), objective improvement in health status and in the physical and overall domains of QoL have been observed in patients with claudication [
         <a href="#rid93">
          93-99
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The Claudication: Exercise Versus Endoluminal Revascularization (CLEVER) trial compared optimal medical care alone, optimal medical care plus SET, and optimal medical care plus endovascular revascularization in patients with claudication and documented aortoiliac occlusive disease [
         <a href="#rid93">
          93
         </a>
         ]. While the primary outcome of walking distance was improved more for the SET group compared with the endovascular revascularization group, PROMs were improved more in the endovascular group compared with SET or optimal medical therapy alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Low Intensity Exercise Intervention in Peripheral Artery Disease (LITE) clinical trial, 305 patients with claudication were randomized to low-intensity home-based walking, home-based high-intensity walking, or nonexercise control [
         <a href="#rid94">
          94
         </a>
         ]. At 12-month follow-up, low-intensity walking was significantly less effective compared with high-intensity walking and was not significantly different from the nonexercise control when the six-minute walk distance was assessed. However, QoL was significantly improved for either exercise intervention compared with no exercise. There was no significant difference in change in QoL between exercise at an intensity inducing ischemic leg symptoms and exercise at a comfortable pace without ischemic leg symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with chronic ischemia, undergoing revascularization provides modest QoL benefits with similar outcomes for open or endovascular intervention [
         <a href="#rid97">
          97
         </a>
         ]. However, major lower extremity amputation and ongoing conservative management also appear to maintain QoL. For patients who are nonambulatory, those with advanced age, and those with renal failure, revascularization provides limited QoL benefits.

         Following revascularization, periodic clinical evaluation and postprocedure surveillance help identify problems that can contribute to thrombosis and potentially limb loss. For patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia, the SVS WIfI Classification is recommended to initially stage the limb and to assess the response to therapy [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The surveillance schedule depends on the type of intervention (angioplasty/stenting, vein bypass, prosthetic bypass). (See

          101-105
         </a>
         ]. In a review of over 5000 subjects, the mortality rate was 59 percent at 10 years. Among those who died, cardiovascular disease (eg, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure) was the main cause in 44.6 percent [
         <a href="#rid103">
          103

        </p>
        <p>
         Among the 1 to 2 percent of patients who develop chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), outcomes have improved over time, related to improved medical management [

          106-108

         <a href="#rid109">
          109
         </a>
         ]. Even among those without a revascularization option, amputation-free survival has improved [
         <a href="#rid110">
          110
         </a>
         ]. Overall (all comers), at one year, 45 percent of patients will be alive with both limbs, 30 percent will have undergone amputation, and 25 percent will have died. At five years, more than 60 percent of patients with CLTI will have died. For patients with nonreconstructible disease at one year, approximately 55 percent will be alive without amputation (range 40 to 69 percent); 20 percent of patients will have died (range: 12 to 32 percent), and 34 percent will have undergone major amputation (range: 25 to 45 percent) [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         These general estimates do not apply equally to all patients. Atherosclerotic vascular disease tends to be more aggressive in patients with diabetes and lower extremity PAD with amputation rates that are higher compared with patients with PAD who do not have diabetes [

          111

          Peripheral artery disease
         </strong>
         – Atherosclerotic disease often involves the arteries providing flow to the lower extremities, referred to as lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is a growing clinical problem due to the aging population and the epidemic of diabetes in the United States and other developed countries. (See

          Risk factors
         </strong>
         – As with atherosclerotic disease that develops in other vascular beds (eg, coronary, cerebral), risk factors for lower extremity PAD include smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. (See

          Clinical presentations
         </strong>
         – The natural history of lower extremity PAD in patients who present initially as asymptomatic or with mild-to-moderate exertional pain (claudication) is relatively benign, which contrasts with the more rapid deterioration often seen in those who initially present with ischemic rest pain or extremity ulceration.

          Diagnosis

         2.5 mg twice a day (ie, low dose) in addition to aspirin. Rivaroxaban plus aspirin is associated with an increased risk for bleeding compared with aspirin alone. For those who are asymptomatic, a decision for aspirin therapy is individualized, taking into account overall cardiovascular risk and weighing the potential risk reduction with the potential increase in bleeding.

          Exercise therapy
         </strong>
         – For most patients with lower extremity PAD, in addition to cardiovascular risk reduction strategies, we recommend exercise therapy (for those who can participate), and possibly pharmacologic therapy, rather than initial vascular intervention (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). For patients who can participate in exercise therapy, we suggest supervised rather than unsupervised exercise therapy, where available (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). For patients who have been compliant with risk reduction strategies, but six months to one year of exercise therapy and adjunctive pharmacotherapy have failed to provide satisfactory improvement, referral for possible revascularization is appropriate. (See

          Limb salvage
         </strong>
         – For patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI; ischemic rest pain or ulceration), where the limb is at risk of amputation, revascularization is a priority to restore perfusion and limit tissue loss. The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Wound, Infection, foot Infection (WIfI) Classification is recommended to stage the limb in patients with CLTI and to assess the response to therapy. Some patients with acute thrombosis superimposed on chronic stenosis or occlusion may benefit from thrombolytic therapy. The role of thrombolytic therapy in such patients is discussed separately.

         <strong>
          Revascularization options
         </strong>
         – Among patients with indications for revascularization, options include percutaneous intervention, surgical bypass, or a combination (hybrid approach) of these. The choice depends upon the level of obstruction (aortoiliac, femoropopliteal), severity of disease, the patient's risk for the intervention, and the goals for care. For patients with lesions that have anatomic features associated with durable clinical success with a percutaneous approach (single, short segment, uniform), we agree with guidelines that suggest an initial attempt at percutaneous revascularization rather than initial surgical revascularization.
