         Extensive gynecologic surgery often entails meticulous dissection near the bladder, rectum, ureters, and great vessels of the pelvis. Complications of gynecologic surgery include hemorrhage, infection, thromboembolism, and visceral damage. The risk of complications depends upon the extent and approach to surgery and patient characteristics. Understandably, the more common complications from this surgery relate to injuries to these viscera and occur during extensive resections for the treatment of cancer or when anatomy is distorted due to infection or endometriosis. Other complications, such as pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or fluid or electrolyte imbalance are common to all surgery. (Refer to individual topic reviews on these subjects).

         Uterine perforation is a potential complication of all intrauterine procedures and may be associated with injury to surrounding blood vessels or viscera (bladder, bowel). In addition, uterine perforations and associated complications that are not diagnosed at the time of the procedure can result in hemorrhage or sepsis. The risk of uterine perforation is increased by factors that make access to the endometrial cavity difficult (eg, cervical stenosis) or alter the strength of the myometrial wall (eg, pregnancy, menopause).

          Small bowel injury
         </strong>
         – Small defects of the serosal or muscularis may be repaired using continuous or interrupted 3-0 silk or synthetic absorbable suture material. Single layer closure of small bowel is adequate in most cases. Suture lines should be perpendicular to the long axis of the bowel to prevent narrowing of the bowel lumen. Large defects can sometimes by closed with a stapling device, or resection with reanastomosis may be necessary.

          Colonic injury
         </strong>
         – Repair is similar to that described above for the small bowel. Lack of preoperative bowel prep is not an indication for colostomy. After the bowel is repaired, the abdomen is copiously irrigated. Occasionally, a segment of bowel must be resected, and if reanastomosis is performed, routine care can resume. If bowel reanastomosis cannot be performed due to extensive injury or pathology (ie, dense adhesions or inflammatory changes), a diverting colostomy may be required. Closed-system drains are commonly placed in the pelvis, but are not used by all surgeons.

         Patients with bowel injury, necrosis, and perforation, particularly that results from thermal injury at the time of surgery, often do not present until the postoperative period. These women typically present with abdominal and/or chest pain. However, for women with a perforation resulting from a laparoscopic procedure, fecal contamination of the abdomen may not be associated with peritoneal signs, and patients may actually be eating and drinking and passing flatus. The diagnosis is made by observing increasing free air on CT scan. For older women, bowel necrosis and perforation can present as persistent tachycardia. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of bowel perforation is presented separately. (See

         Most fistulas occur after hysterectomy for benign conditions, since these procedures are far more common than surgery for cancer. However, the risk of fistula formation is higher after radical surgery because of the scope of surgery, the presence of tumor, and, in some cases, radiation induced changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fistulae of the ureter, bladder, or both occur after radical gynecologic surgery in less than one percent of women. The fistula is localized by cystoscopy, intravenous pyelogram, and retrograde studies of the ureter (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3288.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnostic cystourethroscopy (cystoscopy) for gynecologic conditions"
         </a>
         ). Simple vesicovaginal fistulae can be managed by prolonged drainage to allow an opportunity for spontaneous healing. Antibiotic prophylaxis, and, if appropriate, postmenopausal hormone therapy, are given. It is unclear how long drainage should be continued, but usually healing occurs in less than four weeks. Although cautery has been advocated for closing small fistulae, no data exist to support this practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surgical correction is necessary when healing fails to occur. An immediate repair may be performed in the absence of infection and excessive granulation tissue, although delayed repairs were recommended in the past. A vaginal approach (eg, Latzko procedure) is the procedure of choice and may be done as an outpatient, with minimal morbidity. If complete closure is not obtained, a second effort may be successful. Otherwise, excision of the fistula, layered closure, and placement of an omental flap to separate bladder and vagina and provide neovascularity can be attempted transabdominally.
        </p>
        <p>
         Simple ureterovaginal fistulae usually heal after being stented, preferably percutaneously. If this fails, surgical repair will be necessary. Complex ureterovesicovaginal fistulae require stenting and drainage until inflammation and infection have resolved. Although spontaneous healing infrequently occurs, the tissue is in more optimal condition for surgical repair. Fistulae are discussed in greater depth elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8071.html" rel="external">

         Gastrointestinal fistulae after gynecologic surgery are rare. They occur 10 to 14 days postoperatively, and may be heralded by spiking temperatures with no clear source, no response to antibiotics, and a tender, but otherwise normal-appearing, incision. The diagnosis and site of the fistula are determined radiographically by injecting dye into the fistula (fistulogram) and subsequently performing a small and large bowel series.
        </p>
        <p>
         Management consists of resting the gastrointestinal tract by eliminating oral intake, and possibly by using inhibitors of pancreatic and gastric secretion (eg, somatostatin). Healing occurs over weeks. However, the fistula will not heal if there is an obstruction distal to it.

         is indicated in most cases. If healing fails to occur, laparotomy with resection of the anastomosis and primary repair is appropriate. For low rectovaginal fistulae, the Latzko procedure can be performed. (See

         Postoperative nausea with or without vomiting (PONV) has been related to a number of factors. Analgesic and anesthetic drugs, especially general anesthesia and opioids, are the most common sources of PONV. Surgical factors for PONV include intraabdominal surgery and procedures of long duration [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The most common surgery-specific cause of PONV is postoperative ileus or obstruction. Postoperative ileus is discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8042.html" rel="external">
          "Postoperative ileus"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other risk factors include patient factors, such as female sex, nonsmoking status, history of motion sickness, and history of PONV [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, early refeeding of postoperative gynecologic patients, defined as fluid or food within 24 hours of surgery regardless of bowel function, has not been associated with increased nausea, vomiting, or ileus [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients at moderate to high risk of PONV benefit from preoperative administration of a prophylactic antiemetic agent (eg, serotonin receptor antagonist, dexamethsone, anticholinergic agent) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,4
         </a>
         ]. If a prophylactic antiemetic was administered, treatment of PONV within six hours of surgery should be with an antiemetic from a different pharmacologic class (ie, acting at a different receptor) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. After six hours, PONV can be treated with any antiemetic; sometimes combinations of antiemetics from different classes are needed. Treatment of PONV is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

          —
         </span>
         One function of the peritoneal surface of pelvic and abdominal structures is to prevent adherence between these structures when they touch. If the peritoneum is injured as a result of surgery, the damaged areas may stick to each other and a permanent adhesion may form. The mainstay of prevention is careful handling of tissue at the time of surgery as tissue trauma and bacterial infection have been linked to adhesion formation [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Multiple agents, including liquids, solids, and gels, have been used intraoperatively in attempt to reduce the risk of adhesion formation. However, a systematic review reported no difference in efficacy with liquid barriers compared with no treatment or placebo on the adhesion-related outcomes, such as postoperative pelvic pain, pregnancy rates, and live birth rates [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In addition, there was inadequate evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of anti-adhesion solids and gels in gynecologic surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Postoperative adhesions typically occur within the first five days after surgery [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. They occur in 60 to 90 percent of women undergoing major gynecologic surgery [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. They are a common cause of small bowel obstruction, although most adhesions do not result in serious sequelae: infertility, chronic pain, intestinal obstruction, or difficult subsequent surgery (possibly resulting in inadvertent enterotomy). The incidence of adhesion-related intestinal obstruction after gynecologic surgery for benign conditions without hysterectomy is approximately 0.3 percent, increasing to 1 to 3 percent among patients who undergo simple hysterectomy, 5 percent after radical hysterectomy, and 20 percent in patients who undergo both radical hysterectomy and pelvic radiation [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. Symptoms may occur weeks to years after the procedure. A multihospital series of 135 cases of small bowel obstruction due to intraabdominal adhesions in nononcologic patients reported that 50 percent were related to abdominal hysterectomy (incidence 49/3597 abdominal hysterectomies or 13.6/1000) [

         Unilateral or bilateral lymphedema of the lower extremities is uncommon after radical surgery, even when postoperative radiation is given. It is a chronic problem for which there is little effective intervention. Support hose and leg wraps will minimize edema; elevation of the extremities when sitting and elevating the foot of the bed also help to control the problem. Women with lymphedema should be warned to take care of their skin and pay special attention to the development of erythema or tenderness, which may indicate infection and a need for systemic antibiotics. Diuretics do not improve lymphedema, and may lead to electrolyte abnormalities. (See

         Lymphocysts are uncommon after pelvic lymphadenectomy, occurring in 1 to 3 percent of women 11 to 12 days after surgery. They are seldom symptomatic and are detected when radiologic studies are performed surveying the woman for recurrent neoplastic disease. Symptoms consist of vague, colicky, lower abdominal pain. Symptomatic lymphocysts and those causing hydronephrosis can be drained percutaneously [
         <a href="#rid11">

         ]. Recurrent lymphocysts should be drained again and

         In one series, approximately 30 percent of women undergoing laparotomy for a gynecologic condition developed a fever of 38.0°C or more (≥100.4°F) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The majority of fever work-ups were of low clinical yield and added moderate cost, except when one or more of the following risk factors were present: surgery for malignancy, bowel resection, several febrile days, higher fever, and moderately increased white blood cell count. Postoperative fever is discussed in detail separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Fever within the first 48 hours of surgery is almost always cytokine related. Fever-associated cytokines are released by tissue trauma and do not necessarily signal infection. Fever due to the trauma of surgery usually resolves within two to three days.

         A useful initial screen for the more common causes of postoperative fever is represented by the four-part mnemonic "Wind, Water, Wound, What did we do?". "Wind" refers to pulmonary causes of fever including pneumonia, aspiration, and pulmonary embolism. "Water" refers to UTI, and "Wound" refers to SSI. "What did we do?" is a reminder to consider treatments as a cause of fever and includes medications, blood product transfusions, and intravascular, urethral, nasal, and abdominal catheters.

         Significant febrile morbidity after gynecologic surgery is usually attributable to infection of the urinary tract, wound (including the vaginal cuff and necrotizing fasciitis), or pelvic cellulitis and abscess. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         After the first two postoperative days, a thorough inspection of the wound and good rectovaginal examination are the most important components of the fever work-up. Empiric broad spectrum antibiotics may then be started. It is appropriate to obtain an intravenous pyelogram to look for occult ureteral obstruction in women febrile after 24 hours of antibiotics. Ureteral obstruction should be treated by percutaneous stent placement. Persistent fever despite antibiotics can be a sign of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, which requires heparin therapy. (See

          15
         </a>
         ]. One approach to prevention is use of a bulk running closure with a permanent suture and a suture length-to-wound length ratio of at least 4:1 (ie, attempt to close the incision incorporating a length of suture at least four times the length of the incision) [

          16,17

         A discussion of sexual function should precede and follow gynecologic surgery. If problems are identified with a woman's sex life, then appropriate counseling is warranted as soon as possible since sexual dysfunction may become worse after surgery or radiation therapy. As an example, vaginal fibrosis may result from radical hysterectomy or vaginal irradiation. However, most gynecologic procedures are not associated with subsequent sexual dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid21">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Management of the physical problems related to sexual dysfunction is multifaceted. Adequate endogenous hormones or exogenous therapy are required. Vaginal lubrication can be augmented with commercial water-soluble lubricants. Use of a vaginal dilator can both enlarge the caliber of the vagina, and increase length over time. Sexual positions in which the female is on the bottom can be made more comfortable by having the patient keep the thighs slightly closer together to create a "longer" vagina. This will require the patient to guide the penis during entry. Female superior or side-by-side positions will allow the female more control over depth of penile penetration. Oral and anal sex may be reasonable considerations in patients who find this acceptable. Masturbation by the patient or sex partner may allow gradual adjustments to altered perceptions of sexual pleasure. (See
