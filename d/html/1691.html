In a radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) an individual presents without overt clinical symptoms but with MRI findings highly suggestive of MS. CIS and RIS can create diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, since a substantial percentage of patients with CIS and MRI lesions go on to develop clinically definite MS.</p><p>This topic will discuss the management of CIS and of RIS suggestive of MS.</p><p>Other aspects of MS are discussed separately.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96029.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, course, and prognosis of multiple sclerosis in adults", section on 'Clinically isolated syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>The typical patient with a CIS is a young adult with a single episode of central nervous system dysfunction, such as unilateral optic neuritis, a focal brain syndrome, a focal brainstem or cerebellar syndrome, or partial myelopathy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Symptoms usually develop over the course of hours to days and then gradually remit over the ensuing weeks to months, though remission may not be complete. While CIS is, by definition, isolated to a single attack in time, it is not necessarily isolated in space, as approximately one-quarter of patients present with multifocal abnormalities. CIS should not be considered a different disease than MS, rather it is a potential precursor to MS. As the diagnostic criteria for MS have expanded, fewer patients meet the strict criteria for CIS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3904542792"><span class="h1">RADIOLOGICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROME</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An RIS is defined by incidental brain or spinal cord MRI findings that are highly suggestive of MS, based upon location and morphology within the central nervous system, in an asymptomatic patient lacking any history, symptoms, or signs of MS [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Typically, the MRI has been obtained for a completely unrelated condition such as headaches or trauma.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3269639250"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with a CIS should have neuroimaging with a contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and the spinal cord in order to determine whether there is an explanatory acute inflammatory lesion in the brain or spinal cord and whether there are additional lesions on MRI that are indicative of MS. The evaluation of a CIS and suspected MS is described in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1688.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>We suggest cerebrospinal fluid examination for patients with a CIS who have a brain MRI that shows no or few lesions (ie, MRI findings that do not meet the McDonald criteria for dissemination in space). Qualitative assessment of cerebrospinal fluid using isoelectric focusing for oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands that are not present in a concomitant serum specimen can help to refine the risk estimation for progression to MS in equivocal cases. Elevation of the cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin level relative to other protein components is also a common finding in patients with MS and suggests intrathecal synthesis. A positive cerebrospinal fluid is based upon the finding of either oligoclonal bands different from any such bands in serum, or by an increased IgG index. The IgG level may be expressed as a percentage of total protein (normal &lt;11 percent), as a percentage of albumin (normal &lt;27 percent), by use of the calculated IgG index (normal value &lt;0.66 to &lt;0.9, depending upon the individual laboratory), or by use of a formula for intrathecal fluid synthesis of IgG. Thus, the presence of oligoclonal bands can provide supportive evidence that the underlying disorder is inflammatory and demyelinating. (See <a class="local">'With oligoclonal bands'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of MS can be made for some patients at the time they present with a first clinical attack (ie, a CIS) if a single MRI obtained at any time shows dissemination in space and, as evidence for dissemination in time, by the simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and nonenhancing lesions, <strong>or</strong> by the presence of cerebrospinal fluid-specific oligoclonal bands. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1688.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults", section on 'For a clinically isolated syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>In select cases, testing for anti-AQP4 or anti-MOG antibodies may be appropriate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1688.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults", section on 'Autoantibody testing'</a>.)</p><p>A patient with an RIS, identified by incidental findings on a brain MRI, is asymptomatic by definition and has no history, symptoms, or signs of MS, but follow-up is important to monitor for the possible onset of clinical features consistent with MS. However, some experts recommend lumbar puncture in patients with an RIS who have high-risk MRI features, such as a large number of demyelinating brain lesions (hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI) or even a single demyelinating spinal cord lesion, since the additional finding of oligoclonal bands would suggest an increased risk of conversion to MS [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of CIS and RIS is essentially the same as the differential of MS and includes a number of inflammatory, vascular, infectious, genetic, granulomatous, and other demyelinating disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76753" href="/d/graphic/76753.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). This is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1688.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">RISK OF PROGRESSION TO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Identification of those patients with RIS or CIS who are likely to progress to MS is a major goal of current research.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2278593571"><span class="h2">Overall risk with a CIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In various studies, the long-term (ie, 10- to 20-year) likelihood of developing MS for patients with CIS and MRI lesions characteristic of MS ranges from 60 to 80 percent [<a href="#rid4">4-9</a>], with most of the data suggesting that the true rate of conversion is closer to the lower end of this range. In patients with a CIS who have a normal baseline MRI, limited data suggest that the long-term prevalence of MS is approximately 20 percent [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Therefore, patients with a CIS who have MRI abnormalities characteristic of MS in these MS-typical regions (periventricular, cortical or juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord) either at presentation or within three to six months of the event are candidates for early disease-modifying therapy. (See <a class="local">'Who should receive early DMT?'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">After isolated optic neuritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the Optic Neuritis Treatment trial (ONTT), the cumulative five-year incidence of clinically definite MS was 30 percent following a first episode of idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The cumulative incidence increased to 40 percent at 12 years [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], and to 50 percent at 15 years [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The presence of characteristic demyelinating lesions on brain MRI is a strong predictor of developing MS  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81188" href="/d/graphic/81188.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). In the ONTT, the risk of MS after 10 years was 56 percent among those with one or more lesions on MRI versus 22 percent among those with no lesions [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Optic neuritis is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5252.html" rel="external">"Optic neuritis: Prognosis and treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21504293"><span class="h3">After acute transverse myelitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute transverse myelitis is an inflammatory disorder that presents with the rapid onset of weakness, sensory alterations, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14088.html" rel="external">"Transverse myelitis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Patients presenting with acute complete transverse myelitis (complete or near complete clinical deficits below the lesion) have a generally cited risk of MS of only 5 to 10 percent [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>], although some reports suggest a higher conversion rate [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. However, partial or incomplete myelitis with mild or grossly asymmetric spinal cord dysfunction is a much more common clinical entity and bears more relevance to MS. Patients who have acute partial myelitis as an initial presentation and cranial MRI abnormalities showing lesions typical for MS have a transition rate to MS over three to five years of 60 to 90 percent [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. By contrast, patients with acute partial myelitis who have a normal brain MRI develop MS at a rate of only 10 to 30 percent over a similar time period [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Studies suggest that patients with monosymptomatic disease who have positive oligoclonal bands have a higher risk of evolution to MS than those without oligoclonal bands [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>The length of the spinal cord lesion is also associated with the risk of progression to multiple sclerosis. In a retrospective report of 100 patients evaluated at a tertiary center between 2010 and 2018 with isolated idiopathic myelitis and no evidence of inflammation or demyelination elsewhere in the central nervous system, progression to MS with short-segment myelitis (fewer than three vertebral segments) occurred in 25 of 77 patients (32 percent), while progression to MS with longitudinally extensive myelitis occurred in none of 23 patients (0 percent) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3310036120"><span class="h3">With oligoclonal bands</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with CIS, the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid may be an independent risk factor for progression to MS. Supporting evidence comes from a prospective study of 415 patients with CIS, which found that the presence of oligoclonal bands was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing clinically definite MS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. This increased risk was independent of the number of lesions on baseline MRI. Among 113 patients with a negative MRI (ie, no lesions), the risk of developing MS in those with and without oligoclonal bands was 23 and 4 percent, respectively. These findings suggest that progression to MS is unlikely in patients with a CIS who have few or no MRI lesions and no oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3016640832"><span class="h2">Risk with an RIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with an RIS are at risk of developing CIS and MS, but data are limited. One of the largest studies evaluated an international cohort of over 450 retrospectively identified subjects (approximately 78 percent female) with RIS from 22 databases [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. With a mean follow-up of 4.4 years, independent predictors for the development of a first clinical event were younger age (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-0.99), male sex (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.24-2.99), and asymptomatic MRI lesions in the cervical or thoracic spinal cord (HR 3.08, 95% CI 2.06-4.62). Conversion to symptomatic MS occurred in approximately 30 percent; of those who converted to MS, criteria for primary progressive MS were met in 12 percent [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Another study of 75 patients with RIS found that the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid was associated with an increased risk of conversion to MS [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>These data and expert consensus suggest that patients with an RIS have an increased risk of subclinical MS if and one or more of following features are present [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age &lt;35 years</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Male sex</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cervical or thoracic spinal cord lesions on MRI</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dissemination in time on MRI (gadolinium-enhancing and/or new T2 lesions)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High T2 lesion load on MRI</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cortical and/or juxtacortical lesions on MRI</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abnormal visual evoked potentials</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Deficits of specific cognitive functions (ie, information processing speed, complex attention, episodic memory, and executive functions)</p><p></p><p>Other features are "red flags" that suggest an alternative diagnosis [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Migraine or chronic headache</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizures</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Paroxysmal symptoms</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychiatric disturbances</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overt cognitive impairment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Head trauma</p><p></p><p>The presence of "red flag" features casts doubt on a diagnosis of RIS, and should prompt consideration of other conditions that may explain the symptoms.</p><p>Larger prospective studies are needed to better define the risk of MS associated with RIS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An acute relapse in a patient with CIS should be managed with oral or intravenous glucocorticoids, as is done for acute exacerbations of MS.

(See <a class="local">'Initial Evaluation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1688.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults", section on 'For a clinically isolated syndrome'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Progression to MS</strong> – The long-term likelihood of progression to clinically definite MS for patients with a CIS is approximately 60 percent if the baseline brain MRI reveals demyelinating lesions suggestive of MS, and approximately 20 percent if the MRI is normal. The risk may vary according to the type of CIS (eg, optic neuritis, acute transverse myelitis) and with the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid. (See <a class="local">'Risk of progression to multiple sclerosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Patients with a CIS or RIS should be monitored for possible manifestations of MS disease activity including acute clinical attacks (relapses), new lesions on MRI, and onset or progression of sustained disability.
