In the last two decades, multiple classification systems have been used for these conditions. These include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Kiel classification</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification for primary cutaneous lymphomas</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematolymphoid tumors (2001) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>WHO-EORTC classification of primary cutaneous lymphomas (2005)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>WHO classification of hematolymphoid tumors (2008)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Revised WHO classification of hematolymphoid tumors (2016)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Revised WHO-EORTC classification of primary cutaneous lymphomas (2018)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>WHO classification of hematolymphoid tumors 5<sup>th</sup> edition (2022)</p><p></p><p>In the early 1980s, mycosis fungoides (MF), Sézary syndrome (SS), and some related disorders, collectively termed cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), were the only types of cutaneous lymphomas that were recognized. Cutaneous lymphomas other than MF/SS were firmly believed to represent skin manifestations of a systemic lymphoma and treated accordingly [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The development and application of immunophenotyping and cytogenetic and molecular testing had a major impact on the diagnosis and classification of cutaneous lymphomas. Collaborative studies by dermatologists and pathologists using these new diagnostic techniques demonstrated that malignant lymphomas other than MF/SS can present primarily in the skin without detectable extracutaneous disease. Based upon these studies, several new types of CTCL and cutaneous B cell lymphomas (CBCL) were defined [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. It became clear that primary cutaneous lymphomas had distinctive immunophenotypic and genetic features, a different clinical behavior, and often a much better prognosis than histologically similar nodal lymphomas with secondary skin involvement.</p><p>Since in the past primary CTCL and CBCL were not recognized by the classification systems used by hematopathologists for nodal lymphomas (eg, Kiel classification, Working Formulation), they were often inappropriately treated as systemic lymphomas with unnecessarily aggressive therapeutic regimens. This observation prompted the EORTC Cutaneous Lymphoma Group to formulate a separate classification for primary cutaneous lymphomas [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>The 1997 EORTC classification simply listed the different types of CTCL and CBCL that had been defined as separate entities in the decade before. It included a limited number of well-defined types of CTCL and CBCL and some provisional entities. A distinction was made among cutaneous lymphomas with indolent, intermediate, or aggressive clinical behavior. The clinical significance of this classification has been validated by several large studies including more than 1300 patients with a primary cutaneous lymphoma [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].</p><p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of the WHO classification for tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, published in 2001, included most types of CTCL but did not recognize different types of CBCL [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The combined efforts of the EORTC Cutaneous Lymphoma Group and the WHO group resulted in a new consensus classification for primary cutaneous lymphomas, the 2005 WHO-EORTC classification [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Several large studies have validated the clinical significance of this new classification [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>].</p><p>The 4<sup>th</sup> edition of the WHO classification, published in 2008, and subsequent editions have adopted the terminology and definitions of the WHO-EORTC classification with only minor modifications and now include all types of CTCL and CBCL relevant for dermatologists [<a href="#rid10">10-13</a>]. The 2018 update of the WHO-EORTC classification of primary cutaneous lymphomas is for the most part identical to the 2016 revision of the WHO classification for tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. The relative frequency and prognosis of the different types of CTCL and CBCL included in the 2018 update of the WHO-EORTC classification are presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109862" href="/z/d/graphic/109862.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will briefly discuss the types of primary cutaneous T cell and B cell lymphomas included in the 2018 update of the WHO-EORTC classification of primary cutaneous lymphomas and the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of the WHO classification of hematolymphoid tumors [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The classification of other hematopoietic neoplasms is presented separately.

In the Western world, CTCL represent approximately 75 to 80 percent of all primary cutaneous lymphomas [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Mycosis fungoides (MF) and primary cutaneous CD30<sup>+</sup> lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) account for approximately 90 percent of CTCL.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3583009556"><span class="h2">Mycosis fungoides</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Classic MF is an epidermotropic CTCL clinically characterized by the progression from patch stage to plaques stage and lastly to tumor stage.

ATLL is endemic in areas with a high prevalence of HTLV-1 in the population, such as southwest Japan, the Caribbean islands, and parts of South and Central America. Approximately 25 percent of ATLL patients present with skin lesions mimicking MF or Sézary syndrome.

This group includes primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (C-ALCL), lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), and borderline cases. These conditions show overlapping clinical and histologic features and form a spectrum of disease:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma</strong> – Primary C-ALCL is characterized histologically by the presence of large cells with an anaplastic or pleomorphic cytomorphology and expression of the CD30 antigen by the majority (greater than 75 percent) of tumor cells. It presents with solitary or localized (ulcerating) skin tumors and has an excellent prognosis in most cases. Unlike systemic ALCL, the vast majority of C-ALCL are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) negative and do not show the t(2;5) chromosomal translocation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4705.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lymphomatoid papulosis</strong> – LyP is defined as a chronic, recurrent, self-healing papulonecrotic or papulonodular skin disease with histologic features suggestive of a CD30<sup>+</sup> malignant lymphoma. Several histologic subtypes of LyP mimicking other types of CTCL have been described. Although these variants do not have therapeutic or prognostic implications, it important that pathologists recognize them and include LyP in the differential diagnosis of certain types of CTCL. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15725.html" rel="external">"Lymphomatoid papulosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2988419597"><span class="h2">Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma (SPTCL) was originally defined as an aggressive cytotoxic T cell lymphoma that preferentially infiltrates subcutaneous tissue and is often complicated by a hemophagocytic syndrome [<a href="#rid2">2,5</a>]. In the 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, SPTCL included cases with an alpha-beta T cell phenotype (75 percent) and cases with a gamma-delta T cell phenotype (25 percent) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Studies have shown clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic differences between cases of SPTCL with an alpha-beta T cell phenotype and those with a gamma-delta T cell phenotype, suggesting that they may represent different entities [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. While most SPTCL with an alpha-beta T cell phenotype show an indolent clinical behavior, SPTCL with a gamma-delta T cell phenotype runs a very aggressive clinical course, similar to other types of gamma-delta T cell lymphoma.</p><p>Therefore, in the 2005 WHO-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification and in more recent classifications, the term SPTCL is only used for cases with an alpha-beta T cell phenotype, whereas cases with a gamma-delta T cell phenotype are included in the category of primary cutaneous gamma-delta T cell lymphoma (PCGD-TCL).

Two forms of hydroa vacciniforme lymphoproliferative disorder are recognized: the classic form and the systemic form. These disorders are seen mainly in children and adolescents from Asia or in indigenous populations from Central and South America and Mexico. Both conditions are rare in adults.

It includes cases previously designated as primary cutaneous immunocytoma, cutaneous follicular lymphoid hyperplasia with monotypic plasma cells, and primary cutaneous plasmacytoma without underlying multiple myeloma (extramedullary plasmacytoma of the skin).</p><p>Within the group of PCMZL, distinction is made between heavy chain class-switched cases (immunoglobulin G [IgG] positive), which are the most common and most typical type of PCMZL, and non-class-switched cases (immunoglobulin M [IgM] positive), which are uncommon, share many features with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas at other extranodal sites, and are more likely to have extracutaneous disease [<a href="#rid11">11,14,15</a>].<strong> </strong>In the 2016 revision of the 4<sup>th</sup> edition of the WHO classification, PCMZL was not yet listed separately but was included in the broad group of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of MALT [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>However, in the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of the WHO classification, PCMZL is recognized as a distinct entity, separate from other MALT lymphomas [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In the published International Consensus Classification of mature lymphoid neoplasms, the term "primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoproliferative disorder" (rather than "primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma")<em> </em>was suggested because of the extremely indolent clinical behavior, with disease-specific survival rates approaching 100 percent [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. PCMZL make up approximately 7 percent of all cutaneous lymphomas and approximately 30 to 40 percent of primary CBCL. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4739.html" rel="external">"Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3261779501"><span class="h2">Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL), previously called primary cutaneous follicle center cell lymphoma, is a tumor of neoplastic follicle center cells with a predominance of large centrocytes (large cleaved cells) admixed with variable numbers of centroblasts (large noncleaved cells with prominent and usually paracentral nucleoli). PCFCL generally presents with localized lesions on the head, particularly the scalp, or trunk. PCFCL may show a follicular, a follicular and diffuse, or a diffuse growth pattern. In contrast to nodal follicular lymphomas, most PCFCL are B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) negative and lack the t(14;18) translocation. In previous classifications, PCFCL with a diffuse growth pattern were commonly classified as diffuse large B cell lymphoma. PCFCL accounts for approximately 10 percent of all cutaneous lymphomas and approximately 40 to 50 percent of primary CBCL. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4718.html" rel="external">"Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1502234609"><span class="h2">Primary cutaneous diffuse large B cell lymphoma, leg type</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary cutaneous diffuse large B cell lymphoma, leg type (PCDLBCL, LT) shows histologically a predominance of confluent sheets of centroblasts and immunoblasts. It typically presents with skin lesions on the lower legs in older adult patients, particularly females. PCDLBCL, LT makes up approximately 4 percent of all cutaneous lymphomas and approximately 20 percent of primary CBCL. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4715.html" rel="external">"Primary cutaneous large B cell lymphoma, leg type"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1886051432"><span class="h2">EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive mucocutaneous ulcer was included as a new entity in the 2018 revision of the WHO-EORTC classification [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. It affects patients with age-related and iatrogenic immunosuppression and usually has a self-limited, indolent course. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4703.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma", section on 'EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1952744386"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
