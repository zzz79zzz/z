In the United States and Europe, the risk of HIV transmission from mother to infant has declined to historically low levels with the use of antiretroviral medications [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Contributions to this successful prevention effort include universal testing of pregnant women for HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all pregnant women with HIV, and the use of cesarean delivery in certain circumstances. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13972.html" rel="external">"Prenatal evaluation of women with HIV in resource-rich settings"</a>.)</p><p>We recognize that not all pregnant, postpartum, and lactating individuals identify as women or mothers. Using gender-inclusive language, however, is not possible in all languages and all countries and for all our readers. The topics discussed here are based on risks driven by biological sex and not gender identity. Therefore, throughout this topic, we use the term “woman” to signify a person of the female sex (regardless of gender identity) and the term “mother” to signify the female biological parent of a child (regardless of gender identity).</p><p>This topic will address intrapartum management of pregnant women with HIV, breastfeeding for postpartum women with HIV, and antiretroviral management for their infants in resource-rich settings. In the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services publishes guidelines on the evaluation and management of pregnant women with HIV, which are updated on an ongoing basis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Our recommendations below are largely consistent with these guidelines. </p><p>Other guidelines that are relevant to resource-rich settings include those from the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acog.org%2Fclinical%2Fclinical-guidance%2Fcommittee-opinion%2Farticles%2F2018%2F09%2Flabor-and-delivery-management-of-women-with-human-immunodeficiency-virus-infection%3Futm_source%3Dredirect%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_campaign%3Dotn&amp;token=%2F7pnRJN09U2bCSW8i1Qju7Zpo66InlQP%2BzvLHfPTz20AC02JL55legzPsTEweJAhNvvyxyZUk283%2FjiDsoKNEM5woOO4d5OU7%2F5xQ4IDWcz3upQqZXzg9EhaaFNdizFRWo63bSWy7EutmG3pLSLWnrIbVQ1i2HAHZvrrecy8mljdHOOGW9EWEl2Qgv1tIT6mLaGtyF8MZRx2ZayNn1ruuEhewVYN%2BtzpKT30zSZTd0w%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=126417" target="_blank">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)</a>, the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhiva.org%2Fpregnancy-guidelines&amp;token=cQPYGFzowbrgeI4ozEoovkM6DkOyp5M3t%2FUoN5snnI9Jx1st%2FGF%2Bc9Nzor0OmC1dU6GsRGCr9tEg%2B3fO8GL8ug%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=126417" target="_blank">British HIV Association</a>, and the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eacsociety.org%2Fguidelines%2Feacs-guidelines%2F&amp;token=q%2BtFDlZ3%2BJRQXZSWNuOsHGBf4hv0gkxQrBBl9Guewfu4g6ns4%2FOR1MAs206yVKGUqUhdoSYQ6jjsiCYZpUhIrw%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=126417" target="_blank">European AIDS Clinical Society</a> [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>].

In a meta-analysis that included observational studies conducted after the introduction of combination ART, pre-labor cesarean delivery at 38 weeks was not associated with decreased risk of HIV transmission compared with vaginal delivery among mothers who were on suppressive ART at the time of delivery [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Thus, we do not advise cesarean deliveries for these women, unless indicated for obstetric reasons  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110841" href="/z/d/graphic/110841.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Women with plasma viral load &gt;1000 copies/mL</strong> − In women whose viral loads remain &gt;1000 copies/mL beyond 34 weeks gestation (eg, women not taking ART, women presenting late in pregnancy, or women not responding to their current ART regimen), we recommend performing cesarean delivery at 38 weeks, prior to labor onset and rupture of membranes [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. For these women, prelabor cesarean delivery decreases the risk of transmission to the child. This was illustrated by a meta-analysis of 15 prospective cohort studies performed prior to the widespread use of antiretroviral agents during pregnancy, in which the incidence of HIV transmission to the infant was 8.4 percent (72 of 857 births) with cesarean delivery versus 16.7 percent (1280 of 7676 births) with vaginal delivery [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The reduction in risk was similar when adjusted for use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10053" href="/z/d/drug information/10053.html" rel="external">zidovudine</a> (versus nothing) and advanced HIV disease in the mother. A subsequent trial from the same time period that randomly assigned 436 women with HIV to cesarean or vaginal delivery produced similar results [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If such women present in labor or with ruptured membranes prior to scheduled cesarean delivery, management must be individualized and take into account the duration of the rupture of membranes/labor, current ART regimen, and HIV RNA level. If a woman is already in advanced labor or has prolonged rupture of membranes (≥4 hours), the benefit of cesarean may be lost, and consideration should be given to vaginal delivery. </p><p></p><p>Prior to the widespread use of ART during pregnancy, duration of membrane rupture was associated with risk of transmission [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, in a more recent prospective study of deliveries between 1996 and 2008, there were no cases of HIV transmission among 493 pregnant women on ART with HIV RNA &lt;1000 copies/mL near delivery, 144 of whom had rupture of membranes for more than four hours [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Among the 146 women on ART who had HIV RNA &gt;1000 copies/mL (55 of whom had cesarean while the others had vaginal delivery), vertical transmission was 3.8 percent if duration of membrane rupture was less than four hours compared with 4.9 percent if four or more hours, and this difference was not statistically significant. Only viral load above 10,000 copies/mL was an independent risk factor for vertical transmission.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1662587442"><span class="h2">Intrapartum antiretrovirals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women should continue taking their ART regimen as much as possible during labor and delivery or scheduled cesarean delivery. Additional administration of intrapartum intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10053" href="/z/d/drug information/10053.html" rel="external">zidovudine</a> depends on the maternal HIV viral load within four weeks of anticipated delivery  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110841" href="/z/d/graphic/110841.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). If indicated, intravenous zidovudine (intravenously with a 2 mg/kg dose followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour until delivery) should be given regardless of the presence of drug resistance to zidovudine. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For women on ART with HIV RNA ≤50 copies/mL consistently in late pregnancy and near the time of delivery (ie, four weeks before delivery) and no concerns regarding adherence or resistance to the regimen, intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10053" href="/z/d/drug information/10053.html" rel="external">zidovudine</a> is not specifically recommended as it does not appear to further reduce the risk of vertical transmission in this setting [<a href="#rid4">4,17,18</a>]. Patients with acute or primary (first six months of infection) HIV during pregnancy should be treated similarly to women with HIV RNA ≥1000 copies/mL within four weeks before delivery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For women on ART with HIV RNA between 50 and 1000 (ie, four weeks before delivery) or those who have had challenges consistently taking ART, the decision to use intrapartum intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10053" href="/z/d/drug information/10053.html" rel="external">zidovudine</a> should be individualized; we suggest using it at these HIV RNA levels, and start the intravenous infusion at the time the woman presents in labor or prior to scheduled cesarean delivery. While observational data do not suggest a prevention benefit with intravenous zidovudine for this viral level range, the data are relatively limited. The transmission risk remains slightly higher with low-level viremia compared with undetectable levels; thus, some clinicians and patients may reasonably decide to use zidovudine in this setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15799.html" rel="external">"Antiretroviral selection and management in pregnant individuals with HIV in resource-rich settings", section on 'HIV viremia and risk of infant infection'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For women with HIV RNA ≥1000 copies/mL within four weeks before delivery, possible poor adherence, <strong>or</strong> unknown HIV RNA levels, we recommend intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10053" href="/z/d/drug information/10053.html" rel="external">zidovudine</a>. We also suggest intravenous zidovudine for women with acute or primary (first six months of infection) HIV during pregnancy. For women scheduled for cesarean delivery, intravenous zidovudine should be given three hours before cesarean delivery. Women with HIV who present in labor should be given intravenous zidovudine immediately to decrease the risk of vertical transmission.</p><p></p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10053" href="/z/d/drug information/10053.html" rel="external">Zidovudine</a> crosses the placenta rapidly and can provide pre-exposure prophylaxis to the fetus. In the PACTG 076 trial, combined antepartum zidovudine, intravenous zidovudine during labor, and six weeks of infant zidovudine prophylaxis reduced vertical transmission by 66 percent [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. There are no randomized clinical trials evaluating the benefit of intravenous zidovudine during labor among women using current combination antiretroviral regimens. However, among 7917 women from the French Perinatal Cohort who had HIV RNA &lt;400 copies/mL at delivery, receipt of intravenous zidovudine intrapartum was not associated with a decreased risk of vertical HIV transmission (transmission rates of 0.6 percent [42 of 7576] and 0 percent [0 of 341] with and without intrapartum zidovudine, respectively) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In contrast, zidovudine receipt was associated with lower transmission rates among women who had HIV RNA ≥1000 copies/mL (2.9 percent [45 of 1561] versus 7.5 percent [8 of 107] without intrapartum zidovudine).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H757790471"><span class="h2">Specific circumstances</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1706131796"><span class="h3">Preterm premature rupture of membranes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When membrane rupture occurs before 37 weeks gestation, decisions about timing of delivery should be based on best obstetric practices, taking into account risks of prematurity for the infant. The presence of HIV infection of the mother should not change management. In patients with viral load &lt;1000 copies/mL at delivery, the duration of membrane rupture did not affect the risk of HIV transmission to the infant. As an example, in a study of 707 pregnant women with HIV receiving ART, there was no significant difference in perinatal transmission in women with membrane rupture less than four hours compared with greater than four hours (1.0 versus 1.9 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Of 493 participants with delivery viral load &lt;1000 copies/mL, there were no cases of perinatal transmission despite ruptured membranes of up to 25 hours. Administration of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity should be given if appropriate, as no data exist to suggest that these recommendations need be altered for women with HIV. When the decision is made to deliver, route of delivery should be according to obstetric indications. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2792853671"><span class="h3">Other intrapartum interventions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Obstetric management should minimize the duration of fetal exposure to maternal fluids and blood and avoid fetal scalp electrode monitoring when possible. The possible risks of other interventions during management of labor should be weighed against the obstetric indications and benefits. Artificial rupture of membranes and operative vaginal delivery (eg, with forceps or vacuum extractor) should generally be avoided in women with a viral level ≥50 copies/mL. Delayed cord clamping for 30 to 60 seconds after birth in vigorous term and preterm infants is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to improve iron stores and hemoglobin levels in the infant. This practice does not appear to affect the risk of HIV transmission. As an example, in a study of 64 mother-infant pairs, of whom all the mothers were receiving ART, the 32 infants with delayed cord clamping (120 seconds post birth) had higher hemoglobin levels at 24 hours and 1 month of age, no increased risk of jaundice or polycythemia, and no perinatal transmission compared with the infants who had early cord clamping (&lt;30 seconds after birth) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3892449278"><span class="h1">BREASTFEEDING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of HIV transmission from mother to child through breastfeeding depends on maternal viral load, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, infant ART prophylaxis, and whether the infant is exclusively breastfed or receives combination feeding of formula and breastmilk in the first six months of life [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p>In contrast with resource-rich settings, avoidance of breastfeeding in infants born to mothers with HIV in resource-limited settings is associated with increased infant morbidity and mortality. The prevention of vertical HIV transmission in breastfeeding individuals in resource-limited settings is discussed elsewhere.

Rapid weaning has been associated with increased risk of HIV shedding into breast milk [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>] and development of milk stasis and breast engorgement during the weaning process. (See <a class="local">'Mother with nipple damage, mastitis, or breast abscess'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The data available on HIV transmission through breastfeeding come from resource-limited settings and mothers who initiated ART during second trimester of pregnancy or later. The data show in mothers who are on ART and have viral suppression, the risk of transmitting HIV through breastfeeding is low but not zero. As an example, in a study of over 2400 breastfeeding mothers with HIV randomized following delivery to either 18 months of maternal ART or infant prophylaxis for prevention of HIV transmission through breastfeeding, two transmissions occurred in mothers on ART who had viral loads &lt;40 copies/mL [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In another study of 500 breastfeeding mothers with HIV, there were two transmissions in mothers on ART who had viral loads &lt;50 copies/mL [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

The rate of intrapartum transmission of HIV was higher when infants received six weeks of zidovudine alone (4.8 percent) compared with six weeks of zidovudine plus three prophylaxis-level doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9694" href="/z/d/drug information/9694.html" rel="external">nevirapine</a> over eight days (2.2 percent) or six weeks of zidovudine plus two weeks of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9685" href="/z/d/drug information/9685.html" rel="external">nelfinavir</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9544" href="/z/d/drug information/9544.html" rel="external">lamivudine</a> (2.4 percent). Neutropenia was more common with the triple-drug regimen than the other two regimens. Thus, the two-drug zidovudine plus nevirapine regimen offered the most favorable balance between efficacy and side effects.

Observational data suggest that the three-drug regimen of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine is associated with slightly lower hemoglobin levels and higher premature discontinuation rates but no major toxicity compared with zidovudine only [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Raltegravir is available in a formulation appropriate for neonates and has defined neonatal dosing; in studies in antiretroviral-naïve adults with HIV, raltegravir is associated with greater and more durable viral suppression and less toxicity than the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8731" href="/z/d/drug information/8731.html" rel="external">efavirenz</a> [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].

The combined use of maternal antepartum, maternal intrapartum, and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis maximizes infant pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis to decrease the risk of HIV acquisition.
