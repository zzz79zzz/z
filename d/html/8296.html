Although smallpox has been eradicated, there is still a role for vaccinia virus vaccines to help prevent smallpox and mpox (previously referred to as monkeypox) in select populations.</p><p>This topic will address the virology of vaccinia virus, available vaccines, vaccination procedures, contraindications, and adverse events. Topic reviews that discuss the individual infections are presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8341.html" rel="external">"Variola virus (smallpox)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8295.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of mpox (monkeypox)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30687967"><span class="h1">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF ORTHOPOXVIRUS VACCINES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Attempts at control of smallpox began after it was noted that accidental exposure to smallpox by a scratch on the skin reduced the severity of infection. This led to the practice of "variolation," which involved intentional administration of pustular fluids from smallpox scabs to uninfected persons. The practice of variolation began in China and India in the 10<sup>th</sup> century; deaths were reported as a complication of this procedure.</p><p>In 1796, Edward Jenner showed that inoculation with cowpox virus protected against smallpox and carried less risk of illness than variolation. Subsequently, vaccinia virus became the basis for the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10175" href="/d/drug information/10175.html" rel="external">smallpox vaccine</a>. The origins of vaccinia virus are uncertain. Successful vaccination was highly protective for development of any disease for five years and could protect from death or severe smallpox for up to 20 years. Periodic revaccination was necessary for optimal protection.</p><p>In 1959, the World Health Assembly adopted a program aimed at global eradication of smallpox. The development of stable, freeze-dried vaccine meant that vaccination programs could reach resource-limited tropical countries. By 1967, efforts towards eradication were intensified.</p><p>Key components of the eradication strategy included surveillance, quarantine of infected patients, and vaccination of contacts and others living in the immediate area (a strategy called ring vaccination). Eradication was ultimately successful for a number of reasons. Smallpox has a long incubation period, which allows vaccination to modify the course of the illness. The lack of a reservoir for variola, other than humans, the ease of clinical diagnosis, and the fact that variola does not establish latent or persistent infection were additional important contributors to the success of the eradication effort.</p><p>With the eradication of smallpox, routine vaccination against smallpox was abandoned throughout the world because the risk of vaccination with replication-competent vaccinia virus outweighed the benefits. However, some groups have continued to be vaccinated in the decades since eradication. This includes laboratory researchers who work with pathogenic poxviruses and replication-competent vaccinia virus as well as certain health care workers and first responders. In addition, the United States military has continued to vaccinate personnel during certain periods of time.</p><p>After the anthrax bioterrorism attack in October 2001, the United States government improved preparedness for the intentional or accidental release of and/or exposure to variola virus. Since production of the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10175" href="/d/drug information/10175.html" rel="external">smallpox vaccine</a> ended after the eradication of smallpox (in the United States, that vaccine was called Dryvax), new stocks of smallpox vaccine produced in cell culture were developed, stockpiled, and approved; this vaccine is called ACAM2000. More recently, a second generation smallpox vaccine with an improved safety profile was developed and approved (modified vaccinia Ankara [MVA]/JYNNEOS). In the United States, these vaccines are distributed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Detailed discussions of these vaccines are found below. (See <a class="local">'Modified vaccinia Ankara (non-replicating) vaccine'</a> below and <a class="local">'Vaccinia virus (replication-competent) vaccine'</a> below.)</p><p>Vaccinia virus vaccines are also being utilized as pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis during the global outbreak of mpox that started in May 2022. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8295.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of mpox (monkeypox)", section on 'Pre-exposure prophylaxis with orthopoxvirus vaccines'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8295.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of mpox (monkeypox)", section on 'Post-exposure prophylaxis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8295.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of mpox (monkeypox)", section on 'Post-exposure management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1271119283"><span class="h1">VACCINIA VIRUS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaccinia virus is a large, double-stranded DNA virus that carries out its entire replication cycle in the cytoplasm of infected cells [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The virus is in the same family as variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, and immunization with a vaccine derived from vaccinia virus provides protection against smallpox, mpox, and other diseases caused by members of the orthopoxvirus family. (See <a class="local">'Modified vaccinia Ankara (non-replicating) vaccine'</a> below and <a class="local">'Vaccinia virus (replication-competent) vaccine'</a> below.)</p><p>Because vaccinia virus has the ability to infect numerous cell types from a vast variety of animals, it is widely used in research laboratories.</p><p>The virus has also been extensively studied as a model system to understand gene regulation and expression. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology and cloning, vaccinia virus became a research tool for the expression of foreign proteins in vitro and in vivo [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing foreign proteins may have future applications in vaccinating animals or people against infectious diseases or cancer [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p>Many laboratories have also been using a highly attenuated vaccinia virus that does not produce infectious virus in mammalian cells. This virus was initially developed in Germany in the 1970's by serial passage in chick embryo fibroblasts. The resulting virus, modified vaccinia Ankara [MVA], contained large deletions in the genome. These deletions resulted in a virus that replicates in chicken embryo fibroblasts but does not form infectious virus particles in mammalian cells. Because this type of virus does not produce infectious progeny in mammalian cells, it has an excellent safety profile, even in immunocompromised hosts [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus has gained approval for use as a smallpox/mpox vaccine in several countries, including the United States.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3244051669"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR VACCINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The indications for vaccination with an orthopoxvirus vaccine depends upon the setting (outbreak versus routine nonemergency setting).</p><p>There are two available orthopoxvirus vaccines that can be used for prevention of smallpox and mpox: a replication-deficient <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="122670" href="/d/drug information/122670.html" rel="external">modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine</a> and a replication-competent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10175" href="/d/drug information/10175.html" rel="external">smallpox vaccine</a> (ACAM2000).

The MVA vaccine is administered as two doses four weeks apart. In the United States, this vaccine is approved for the prevention of smallpox and mpox. (See <a class="local">'Modified vaccinia Ankara (non-replicating) vaccine'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ACAM2000</strong> – ACAM2000 is a replication-competent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10175" href="/d/drug information/10175.html" rel="external">smallpox vaccine</a> that can only be used in select patients and is associated with more adverse events than the MVA vaccine. It is administered as a single dose. In the United States, ACAM2000 is approved for the prevention of smallpox. It can be used for prevention of mpox under an expanded-access investigational new drug (IND) application through the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (See <a class="local">'Vaccinia virus (replication-competent) vaccine'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H385302793"><span class="h2">Emergency/outbreak settings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The indications for vaccination in an emergency or outbreak setting vary depending upon the specific pathogen (eg, smallpox versus mpox), the type of exposure, and the risk of complications. The approach to vaccination in an emergency setting is determined by public health authorities.</p><p>During the global outbreak of mpox in 2022, vaccination is being used for post-exposure prophylaxis, and when resources allow, it is also being offered to communities at high risk for exposure to monkeypox virus (the causative agent of mpox). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8295.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of mpox (monkeypox)", section on 'Pre-exposure prophylaxis with orthopoxvirus vaccines'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8295.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of mpox (monkeypox)", section on 'Post-exposure prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of a smallpox outbreak or bioterrorism attack, the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has published <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmmwr%2Fpreview%2Fmmwrhtml%2Frr6402a1.htm%3Fs_cid%3Drr6402a1_w&amp;token=R4Uiw8%2FbmPVaqNHRDqpXLINfNMwh6y7JRM6C2UhhD%2FRIClmyQht7ddlJMbDS%2FsnE8g74CTLeCqHEb2ZF9%2FCPJV66ZRuvybw4MZ8e5zj1JIo%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=8296" target="_blank">recommendations</a> for vaccination with the replication-competent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10175" href="/d/drug information/10175.html" rel="external">smallpox vaccine</a> (ACAM2000) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3884805241"><span class="h2">Routine nonemergency indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaccination against orthopoxvirus infections with either the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="122670" href="/d/drug information/122670.html" rel="external">modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine</a> (JYNNEOS) or the replication-competent vaccine (ACAM2000) is indicated in occupational settings for people working with virulent orthopoxviruses like variola virus (eg, in WHO-sanctioned BSL-4 labs at the CDC in the United States and Vector Institute in Russia) and monkeypox virus as well as less virulent orthopoxviruses like cowpox and replication-competent vaccinia virus. These groups include research laboratory workers, laboratory response network laboratory personnel, and members of select health care worker response teams [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In such persons, it can also be used for management after an exposure.</p><p>While the United States ACIP does not make recommendations regarding which vaccine should be used, we suggest vaccination with the MVA strain of vaccinia virus because of its safety profile. If the MVA vaccine is not available, vaccination with the replication-competent vaccine should be considered in the occupational setting [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis. However, contraindications to vaccination must be carefully evaluated, and the risk of severe adverse reactions must be weighed against the risk for severe orthopoxvirus infection. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications and precautions'</a> below and <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3633191336"><span class="h1">MODIFIED VACCINIA ANKARA (NON-REPLICATING) VACCINE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="122670" href="/d/drug information/122670.html" rel="external">modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine</a> has been approved for prevention of both smallpox and mpox. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3078308257"><span class="h2">Dosing and administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The preferred route of administration for the MVA vaccine is subcutaneously. However, in an outbreak situation when vaccine supplies might be limited, intradermal administration can be used as it requires a lower dose and allows more doses per vial. (See <a class="local">'Standard dosing'</a> below and <a class="local">'Dose-sparing regimen'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H880758639"><span class="h3">Standard dosing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The MVA vaccine series consists of two doses; the second dose is ideally administered 28 to 35 days after the first dose. However, if the second dose is delayed beyond 35 days, an additional dose (ie, after the second dose) is not required [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Peak immunity is expected 14 days after the second dose of vaccine.</p><p>The MVA vaccine (0.5 mL/dose) is administered as a subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous injection delivers 0.5x10<sup>8</sup> to 3.95x10<sup>8</sup> plaque forming units (PFUs). Subcutaneous administration involves injecting the vaccine into the fatty tissue, typically over the triceps in those 12 months and older or in the anterolateral thigh for children younger than 12 months of age. The manufacturer of the MVA vaccine notes that it is acceptable to administer this vaccine in the subcutaneous tissue over the triceps area, even though the package insert states the preferred site of administration is the "deltoid" [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>The duration of immunity after two doses of the MVA vaccine is unknown. For those at risk of an occupational exposure, the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends a booster dose (0.5 mL/dose) every two years for persons at continued risk of exposure to more virulent species of orthopoxvirus (eg, variola virus, monkeypox virus) or at least every 10 years for those at risk of exposure to less virulent species (eg, vaccinia virus, cowpox virus) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Recommendations for booster doses in other populations have not yet been established.</p><p>The MVA vaccine may be used as a booster dose for those persons who received a primary series with the replication-competent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10175" href="/d/drug information/10175.html" rel="external">smallpox vaccine</a> (ACAM2000 or Dryvax) and who are at continued risk for exposure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3040453009"><span class="h3">Dose-sparing regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, emergency use authorization (EUA) has been granted for intradermal administration of the MVA vaccine in persons ≥18 years for prevention of mpox (0.1 mL/dose at zero and four weeks). Persons ≥18 who received the initial dose using the standard subcutaneous regimen may receive the second dose with the intradermal regimen to complete the vaccine series. However, intradermal administration should generally be avoided in persons who have a history of developing keloid scars [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Intradermal vaccine is typically administered on the volar (inner side) of the forearm. A video of intradermal administration can be found on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTLv1mR6mECQ&amp;token=3BBziCZQDrEhIlt93szQloH6eZnp6PMXkxC7JnVMP%2FX1F5c2GiT2Vs2crjokDEFSYeAW3G89JDu%2FDJwu%2BAwq%2Fg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=8296" target="_blank">CDC website</a>. If a person presents for their second MVA vaccine dose and is still experiencing erythema or induration at the site of the first vaccine, the second dose should be administered intradermally in the contralateral forearm; other options include the upper back below the scapula or in the deltoid area.</p><p>Intradermal administration uses a lower dose compared with the standard subcutaneous route, extending the amount of available vaccine when supplies are limited [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In a trial of 528 individuals that evaluated the immunogenicity of different vaccine formulations and routes of administration in persons ≥18 years, the immunogenicity of the liquid formulation was similar between those who received subcutaneous versus intradermal vaccine 14 and 180 days after the second dose of vaccine [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>In another study that examined immune responses in humans after MVA was given by various routes of vaccination, intradermal injection of 10<sup>7</sup> PFUs resulted in similar immunogenicity to subcutaneous injection of 10<sup>8</sup> PFUs [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In an open-label follow-up that analyzed cutaneous reactions induced after subsequent challenge with the historical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10175" href="/d/drug information/10175.html" rel="external">smallpox vaccine</a> (Dryvax), eight of the nine participants who had previously received 10<sup>7</sup> PFUs of MVA vaccine by the intradermal route had an attenuated cutaneous response to Dryvax challenge, while all of the placebo-vaccinated subjects had a full cutaneous response to Dryvax challenge, providing evidence of protection from a poxvirus challenge [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2223088095"><span class="h3">Administration errors and deviations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sometimes a vaccine may be administered at the incorrect site, via the incorrect route, or at the incorrect interval.

In general, the MVA vaccine may be administered without regards to timing of other vaccines since it is a nonreplicating virus vaccine.</p><p>One exception may be delaying the COVID-19 vaccine in patients who recently (eg, in the last four weeks) received the MVA vaccine. This exception is based on a theoretical risk of myocarditis after a vaccinia virus vaccine. The ACAM2000 vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine have both been associated with myocarditis.

Mortality from this complication was high, and there was significant potential for permanent neurologic sequelae. Of the 16 reported cases, 15 occurred in subjects who were less than seven years old. The only adult patient found to have central nervous system complications was 42 years old, and his prior vaccination status was unknown.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Two distinct clinicopathologic syndromes of postvaccinial encephalitis have been identified [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Microglial encephalitis is more frequent in persons older than two years of age; it is characterized by fever and headache followed by onset of seizures and coma.

No virus was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, and all patients recovered. No reports of encephalitis occurred more than 14 days after vaccination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These data from the United States on central nervous system disease following vaccination are in striking contrast to statistics from European countries where a different strain of vaccinia virus was used and rates of postvaccinial encephalitis were as high as one in 4000 in adult primary vaccinees [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. This leads some to suggest that development of postvaccinial encephalitis could be very high in adults undergoing primary vaccination [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There are no data on specific therapy of this generally rare complication. It has been suggested that hyperimmune <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10332" href="/d/drug information/10332.html" rel="external">vaccinia virus immune globulin</a>(VIG) would be unlikely to be effective because postvaccinial encephalitis is thought to be an immune-mediated disorder rather than direct vaccinial infection of the central nervous system [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Although not recommended for this indication, VIG may reduce the incidence of postvaccinial encephalitis (from 13 to 3 cases in a randomized trial of over 106,000 Dutch military recruits) [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Additional information on the use of VIG for treatment and prevention of complications is found below. (See <a class="local">'Vaccinia immune globulin'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Progressive vaccinia</strong> – Progressive vaccinia (also called vaccinia necrosum and vaccinia gangrenosum) is one of the most severe complications of vaccination and was universally fatal prior to the introduction of VIG [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. It occurs in vaccinees with immunodeficiencies such as agammaglobulinemia or T cell deficiencies as well as those who receive immunosuppressive therapy including steroids or radiation therapy. After vaccination, there is progressive destruction of local areas of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and other underlying structures with metastatic lesions appearing at other cutaneous sites that can ultimately result in death.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This complication can occur after both primary and revaccination. In the 1968 national surveillance study, the majority of progressive vaccinia cases developed in patients over the age of 15 years who became immunosuppressed (two of five primary vaccinees and five of six re-vaccinees) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

Progressive vaccinia developed after he received chemotherapy to treat AML and presented as an expanding lesion at the vaccine site (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101768" href="/d/graphic/101768.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).

In patients with EV, vaccinia virus may disseminate to cause an extensive vesiculopustular rash with systemic illness [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Eczema vaccinatum has developed in patients whose eczema was in complete remission at the time of vaccination. As a result, a history of eczema is considered a contraindication for vaccination in the nonsmallpox emergency situation. Individuals with other types of dermatitis are also at risk of eczema vaccinatum, and they should not be vaccinated until the skin condition is completely cleared. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications and precautions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The vast majority of patients developing eczema vaccinatum in both the primary and revaccination groups were infants and children in the 1968 national surveillance study, with only 20 of the 126 cases occurring in people over 15 years of age (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66396" href="/d/graphic/66396.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. While usually less severe than progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum resulted in hospitalization in 60 percent of vaccinees with this complication; hospital stays were occasionally prolonged [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Treatment with VIG may decrease the severity of and mortality from eczema vaccinatum, although there are no controlled trials evaluating efficacy [<a href="#rid32">32,43,48</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Vaccinia immune globulin'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Individuals with eczema who have direct contact with a person who has been recently vaccinated can also develop severe eczema vaccinatum. Approximately 80 percent of contacts acquiring this complication required hospitalization [<a href="#rid34">34,49</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The first case report of eczema vaccinatum in the United States since 1988 was a two-year-old child with a history of severe eczema who was hospitalized in 2007 because of a generalized vesicular rash (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61125" href="/d/graphic/61125.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>].

However, the history was not initially obtained by his doctors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Due to the delayed diagnosis of eczema vaccinatum, the child's hospital course was complicated by hypothermia and hemodynamic instability. The patient was treated serially with intravenous VIG, mechanical ventilation, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9264" href="/d/drug information/9264.html" rel="external">cidofovir</a>, and an investigational drug, ST-246 (now called <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="118450" href="/d/drug information/118450.html" rel="external">tecovirimat</a>), under an emergency investigational drug application.

This complication is referred to as generalized vaccinia, which is usually self-limited and not life-threatening. Of the 143 cases compiled in the 1968 national surveillance study, a majority occurred among infants and children receiving primary vaccination [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. However, 9 of 10 cases that occurred in the revaccination group were in people 20 years or older. While no serious sequelae from generalized vaccinia have been reported, extensive scars can develop.

The complications range from asymptomatic T-wave changes to fatal myocarditis or myopericarditis. The cause of myocarditis and myopericarditis is unknown but is believed to be immune mediated. While this has yet to be proven, it was found that after vaccinations, some subjects developed a false positive test to syphilis [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">During the smallpox vaccination program of civilian first responders in the United States in 2003, 21 of 36,217 civilian vaccinees developed myopericarditis (6 per 10,000) [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. The rate was 1.3 per 10,000 vaccinees if only probable cases were included and 5.5 per 10,000 vaccinees if suspected cases were included [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Among military vaccinees, the rate was lower (1.2 per 10,000), probably reflecting a highly selected, very fit population [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. The true incidence of myopericarditis is probably somewhat higher since these cases represented symptomatic disease, which limited duty. This complication has led to its inclusion on a black box warning on the ACAM2000 package insert.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The diagnosis and treatment of this entity are discussed elsewhere.

In the 1968 national surveillance study, complications were 10 times more likely to occur in the primary vaccine group compared to those being revaccinated. Revaccination was also associated with fewer acute adverse reactions compared with primary vaccination, including significantly smaller skin lesions and a significantly lower incidence of fever [<a href="#rid55">55,56</a>].

Mild to moderate adverse effects included headache, hives, and other rashes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There have been concerns about its use in treatment of keratitis, based in part upon experimental data in rabbits showing that daily administration of VIG in vaccinial keratitis resulted in larger eye lesions with more persistent scarring, possibly due to immune complex disease [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].

In this report, 14 patients died, which represents a mortality rate of 22 percent. Progressive vaccinia was lethal in infants with deficiencies in cellular immunity despite treatment with VIG.
