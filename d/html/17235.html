A report by the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that EHI occurs both during practice and competition and noted a disturbing trend of increasing incidence [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]; in addition, despite prevention efforts exertional heat stroke in the military continues to climb [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Clinicians who care for athletes, both young and old, and for others who exert themselves in the heat (eg, firefighters, soldiers, construction workers) need to be aware of the basic physiologic principles of thermoregulation, the spectrum of heat illness, strategies for prevention and treatment, and current guidelines for determining safe return to play or work.</p><p>The management and prevention of exertional heat illness are reviewed here. Assessment of the collapsed athlete, thermoregulation, and the clinical presentation and diagnosis of exertional heat illness are discussed separately, as are exercise-associated hyponatremia, nonexertional heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, and heat illness in children:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Collapsed athlete and related conditions (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114092.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the collapsed adult athlete"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2290.html" rel="external">"Exercise-associated hyponatremia"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exertional heat illness (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13788.html" rel="external">"Exertional heat illness in adolescents and adults: Epidemiology, thermoregulation, risk factors, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6592.html" rel="external">"Heat illness (other than heat stroke) in children"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Non-exertional heat illness (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/176.html" rel="external">"Severe nonexertional hyperthermia (classic heat stroke) in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/401.html" rel="external">"Malignant hyperthermia: Diagnosis and management of acute crisis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4829.html" rel="external">"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6596.html" rel="external">"Heat stroke in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6592.html" rel="external">"Heat illness (other than heat stroke) in children"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12884448"><span class="h1">GUIDING PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two critical observations inform the management of exertional heat stroke (EHS) and all types of severe heat illness [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The severity of a heat illness may not be apparent during the initial presentation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Morbidity and mortality are directly related to the duration of core temperature elevation.</p><p></p><p>Accordingly, effective management of any severe heat illness requires careful evaluation at the field and hospital, and treatment of EHS with rapid cooling is paramount. It may help to think of EHS as a "heat attack" [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p>Clinicians caring for patients with severe heat illness must remain vigilant for late developing complications, possibly including rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute liver failure. For patients with high rectal temperatures (≥105°F, 40.5°C) and concerning symptoms but no clear signs of end-organ damage, clinical suspicion needs to remain high. In most such cases, it is prudent to observe or admit the patient and reevaluate with serial clinical examinations and laboratory studies. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Disposition and admission criteria'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H737851"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF EXERTIONAL HEAT STROKE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12884456"><span class="h2">Prehospital assessment and initial interventions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Resuscitation of the athlete with possible severe heat illness begins by evaluating and stabilizing as necessary the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation, in accordance with standard life support protocols (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/267.html" rel="external">"Basic airway management in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/272.html" rel="external">"Adult basic life support (BLS) for health care providers"</a>). The consensus statements in the reference that follows outline important elements in prehospital care [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. </p><p>Vital signs, including a rectal temperature, should be obtained quickly and appropriate treatment initiated rapidly. Blood (ie, fingerstick) glucose and serum sodium concentration should be measured depending on the patient presentation. Treatment tents at major endurance events often have the capacity to measure a serum sodium concentration to rule out exercise-associated hyponatremia, but emergency medical services (EMS) units typically do not. Elevated temperature (≥105°F, 40.5°C) in the setting of altered mental status is consistent with a diagnosis of exertional heat stroke and is treated with rapid cooling. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13788.html" rel="external">"Exertional heat illness in adolescents and adults: Epidemiology, thermoregulation, risk factors, and diagnosis", section on 'Exertional heat stroke'</a>.)</p><p>If appropriate medical staff is available on-site (eg, team physician, athletic trainer), materials needed for aggressive cooling are readily available (ie, cold water immersion, ice/wet towel rotation, high flow cold water dousing), and no other emergency medical treatment is needed other than rapid lowering of the body temperature, it is usually best to follow the "cool-first, transport second" guideline. Once cooling to a reasonable temperature (eg, approximately 39°C or 102.2°F) is achieved, the patient is rapidly transported to the closest emergency department [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>If the conditions for on-site cooling are not met, particularly if the patient has additional problems (eg, seizure) requiring medical intervention, the patient should be transferred immediately to the closest emergency department. Cooling can be initiated during transport in the most effective manner possible.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12884471"><span class="h2">Rapid cooling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rapid cooling is the most effective strategy for minimizing morbidity and mortality from exertional heat stroke (EHS) and should be initiated as soon as possible, and within 30 minutes of presentation [<a href="#rid13">13-20</a>].</p><p>Key steps in cooling the athlete at the field include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Activate emergency medical system immediately; if appropriate medical staff is on-site and no medical emergencies other than EHS are present, cool first and transport second whenever possible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Remove all equipment and excess clothing. Cooling should not be delayed in order to remove all clothing; this can be done simultaneously with cooling efforts [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If ice water immersion is to be performed, immerse the athlete in a tub of cold water (the colder the better); water temperature should be between 35 to 60°F (2 to 15°C); ice water is ideal, but even tepid water is helpful; maintain an appropriately cool water temperature; stir the water vigorously during cooling.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If ice water immersion is not feasible or possible, rapidly initiate an alternative method of cooling. These are described immediately below.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monitor vital signs (rectal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure) and mental status continually. Maintain patient safety at all times.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cease cooling when rectal temperature reaches approximately 102.2°F (38.3 to 39°C).</p><p></p><p>A detailed guide to field-side cooling is provided in the accompanying table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54492" href="/z/d/graphic/54492.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Note that cooling rates are slower initially, but increase the longer the patient is treated.</p><p>If immersion is not possible in the field (equipment is unavailable), alternative cooling methods should be used. Such measures include putting the athlete in a cold shower, dousing them with cold water from a hose, or moving them to a cool shaded area and applying cold, wet towels to as much of the body surface as possible. For the last method, towels should be replaced as soon as they are no longer cool or every two to three minutes otherwise. If ice is available but no tub, the patient can be placed in a tarp or sheet, covered with a large amount of ice, and then the tarp or sheet can be wrapped around them. Ice should be replenished as soon as a moderate degree of melting occurs.</p><p>Cooling should not be delayed in order to remove all clothing, uniforms, or equipment. The cooling process should be initiated as quickly as possible; clothing and equipment can be removed while cooling is initiated, or when practical [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. </p><p>Few controlled studies are available to determine the best method for achieving rapid cooling of patients with EHS and other forms of severe EHI. Based upon largely low quality evidence, several systematic reviews have concluded that ice water immersion is the most effective method available [<a href="#rid23">23-26</a>]. When appropriate conditions are met, the authors strongly prefer this approach; however, in some circumstances, treatment with ice water immersion is not feasible, particularly if the patient has complications requiring aggressive medical intervention (eg, compromised airway, seizure). If clinicians are actively managing or anticipate the need to manage such complications, alternative methods of cooling should be used that allow for necessary interventions (eg, tracheal intubation, administration of medication or IV fluid) and close patient monitoring. In the emergency department, one reasonable approach is to undress the patient and apply ice packs to the neck, axillae, and inguinal regions (areas adjacent to large blood vessels), while simultaneously spraying tepid water over the patient's body and using fans to blow air over the moist skin (ie, evaporative cooling). Water should be continually reapplied as needed and fanning performed continuously.</p><p>There is little evidence to guide the use of chilled intravenous fluids or gastric, peritoneal, or bladder cooling with cold lavage fluids; cooling blankets have not been found to be effective [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. </p><p>One area of active research is the use of intravenous cooling as either a primary or adjunctive therapy to facilitate a rapid reduction in core temperature. While this strategy is employed in the acute management of cardiac arrest and other conditions, there are no published clinical trials concerning this intervention in the setting of exertional heat stroke nor are published practice guidelines available. Case reports show the potential utility of endovascular cooling in extreme situations, but clinical criteria have yet to be defined [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Intravenous cooling may be useful in scenarios such as ambulance transport or when a cooling tub is unavailable but further research is needed [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5303831"><span class="h2">Temperature measurement and monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Do <strong>not</strong> use alternative methods to determine body temperature (eg, oral, aural canal, tympanic, axillary, temporal, skin, forehead sticker) [<a href="#rid31">31-34</a>], even if a rectal thermometer is not available. Alternative methods do <strong>not</strong> provide accurate measurements of core temperature in athletes who have been exercising intensely in the heat and can be misleading. If a rectal temperature is not available when treating EHS, we suggest one of two options:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cool until the patient begins to shiver.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><strong>or</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treat with cold water immersion for 15 to 20 minutes. This would cool most patients 3 to 4°C (5 to 7°F), which would make removal from an ice tub prudent in most cases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The latter approach assumes a typical cooling rate with cold water immersion of about 0.21°C per minute (0.37°F per minute), and that nearly all patients are between 41 and 43.5°C at the time of the incident (106 and 110°F). In such cases, the patient would cool 1°C every five minutes or 1°F every three minutes. This approach does <strong>not</strong> account for patients who are exceptionally hot at the start of treatment or those who cool slower than average. Continuous monitoring with a rectal thermistor (flexible thermometer) remains the best approach.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12884478"><span class="h2">Clinical assessment at the hospital</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assessment of the patient with exertional heat stroke (EHS) begins with careful evaluation of the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC's). A protected airway, adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and adequate circulation must be ensured. Regular reassessment of the ABC's is important. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/268.html" rel="external">"The decision to intubate"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/276.html" rel="external">"Overview of advanced airway management in adults for emergency medicine and critical care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/176.html" rel="external">"Severe nonexertional hyperthermia (classic heat stroke) in adults", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>If rapid cooling was initiated in the field but the temperature has not yet been sufficiently lowered (goal temperature is 101 to 102°F, or 38.3 to 38.9°C), cooling measures are continued in the hospital. Rapid cooling is initiated as quickly as possible for patients diagnosed with EHS who could not be treated in the field. (See <a class="local">'Rapid cooling'</a> above.)</p><p>The most effective method for cooling patients with EHS is cold water immersion, regardless of the patient's location. However, many facilities are not equipped to implement this strategy, and in some cases this approach is not feasible. Effective alternative cooling methods are described above. (See <a class="local">'Rapid cooling'</a> above.)</p><p>Frequent vital sign measurements combined with pulse oximetry, cardiac and other monitoring provide immediate insight into respiratory and hemodynamic status. A bladder (eg, Foley) catheter allows for monitoring of fluid status and renal function. In some cases, in particular when urine output may not be reliable, central venous pressure monitoring may be needed to guide fluid resuscitation.</p><p>Continuous temperature measurement is invaluable during the initial resuscitation of the patient with EHS. If available, a rectal thermistor (flexible thermometer) that provides continuous temperature readings is preferred to episodic measurements performed with a standard rectal thermometer. If a rectal thermistor is not available during cold water immersion, or evaporative cooling, a rectal temperature should be measured approximately every 10 minutes using a rectal thermometer.</p><p>The secondary survey must include a careful assessment of mental status, evaluation of muscle compartments for evidence of acute compartment syndrome, and examination of all orifices for possible bleeding. Patients with severe EHS typically demonstrate muscle flaccidity; rigidity should prompt consideration for malignant hyperthermia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/401.html" rel="external">"Malignant hyperthermia: Diagnosis and management of acute crisis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/358.html" rel="external">"Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities"</a>.)</p><p>The clinician should inquire about the nature of the precipitating event, interventions at the scene, medical history (eg, sickle cell trait, recent infection, malignant hyperthermia, cardiovascular disease), medications, supplements, and drugs of abuse.</p><p>There is evidence that many of the complications of EHS (eg rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation) result from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [<a href="#rid6">6,37</a>]. Accordingly, SIRS criteria should be followed during the course of the hospitalization. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1657.html" rel="external">"Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12884485"><span class="h2">Laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Targeted laboratory and radiographic studies are important for identifying early and late complications of severe EHI [<a href="#rid20">20,38</a>].

The combination of a hyperdynamic heart and peripheral vasodilation can lead to high output cardiac failure [<a href="#rid40">40,41</a>]. Although generally less common among patients with EHS, clinicians should be aware of this complication and the potential need for aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, despite possible signs of pulmonary edema. Use of a therapeutic hypothermia treatment protocol can be helpful, particularly for patients with severe complications [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p>EHS management in patients who develop complications can be complex and we suggest early consultation with appropriate specialists as needed, including critical care and possibly nephrology, neurology, and gastroenterology. Potential complications and links to topics describing the management of these entities are provided.

Such individuals can generally be discharged after an appropriate period of observation with arrangements for proper follow-up. There are no studies on which to base a recommendation, but a six-hour period of observation seems reasonable. A thorough reexamination of the patient should be performed prior to discharge.

Additional resuscitative measures are provided as necessary; initial care is largely supportive.

Treatment for EHS is described in detail separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54492" href="/z/d/graphic/54492.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Management of exertional heat stroke'</a> above.)</p><p>The clinical distinction between heat injury and EHS is made based upon a careful assessment of central nervous system dysfunction (eg, seizure, altered mental status, abnormal behavior). In practice, this distinction is often made after the initial treatment of the patient and is based on a careful review of the event with the patient, witnesses, and other treating clinicians.</p><p>Subsequent treatment of heat injury following cooling requires careful risk stratification based upon the clinical presentation and the results of diagnostic studies. All patients with signs of heat injury are closely followed to insure the resolution of any end-organ damage prior to returning to play or vigorous activity [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In addition to vital signs and urine output, monitoring should include the following studies: liver function tests (serum aminotransferases (AST, ALT), prothrombin time), urinalysis including urine myoglobin, BUN and creatinine, and creatine kinase. The indications for hospital admission are identical to those for EHS. (See <a class="local">'Disposition and admission criteria'</a> above.)</p><p>The specific management plan is determined individually on the basis of the patient's presentation. As examples, patients with diffuse myalgias and an elevated creatine kinase at risk for developing rhabdomyolysis or patients with signs and abnormal laboratory values suggestive of acute kidney or liver injury should be admitted and managed appropriately.

For patients without severe symptoms or signs and no grossly abnormal initial laboratory results, a reasonable approach is to reexamine the patient and recheck the relevant studies on an outpatient basis every 24 to 48 hours to assess organ function. Once symptoms and signs have resolved and two successive sets of normal laboratory values have been obtained, surveillance may be discontinued, and the patient may gradually return to normal activity.

In its simplest form, a positive test indicates a failure to compensate to a given heat challenge in a controlled environment, suggesting that the athlete is not ready to resume full activity in the heat. Such failure prompts the clinician and athlete to develop and follow an appropriate plan for acclimatizing to activity in the heat and reestablishing fitness. A follow-up heat tolerance test can be used to gauge progress. Positive repeat testing suggests persistent problems with heat intolerance and the need to monitor the athlete more closely as activities in the heat are gradually resumed.</p><p>As an example, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) uses a heat tolerance test (HTT) to evaluate soldiers following an episode of EHS and guide decision-making about return to duty [<a href="#rid68">68,69</a>].

We begin this process approximately four to six hours prior to the start of training or competition. Of note, unless an athlete is deficient in sodium and other electrolytes, increased salt intake before and during exercise is unlikely to help prevent exertional heat illness. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid exercise in severe heat and/or humidity when ill.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stop exercising and notify medical staff immediately if severe exhaustion, lightheadedness, or other concerning symptoms develop in yourself or a teammate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"Precooling" (ie, implementing cooling measures before or especially during play) may benefit athletes whose sport involves sustained exercise (eg, middle and long distance running, cycling, tennis, and team sports) in hot environments [<a href="#rid78">78,79</a>]. Precooling strategies can include both internal methods (eg, ice slurry) and external methods (eg, cooling vests). In addition to precooling, athletes can use cooling strategies during exercise. Athletes who participate in sports with regular breaks in play (eg, American football, tennis) can implement cooling methods during such breaks. In addition to drinking an ice slurry, such cooling methods may include donning an ice vest or ice hat, draping an ice towel around the neck or over the head, or immersing arms or hands in an ice chest. Precooling and intra-event cooling methods affect some athletes differently than others, and thus it is important to experiment or practice with these strategies before they are used in competition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Wear athletic clothing that ventilates well and allows for evaporative cooling when exercising in the heat.

(See <a class="local">'Guiding principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial resuscitation and core temperature measurement</strong> – Resuscitation of the athlete with possible severe exertional heat illness (including heat stroke and heat injury) begins by evaluating and securing the airway, breathing, and circulation, in accordance with standard life support protocols. Measurements of vital signs, including a rectal temperature, blood (ie, fingerstick) glucose, and serum sodium concentration, should be obtained quickly and appropriate treatment initiated rapidly. Do <strong>not</strong> use alternative methods to determine body temperature (eg, oral, tympanic, axillary, temporal, forehead sticker). If a rectal thermistor or rectal thermometer is not available, one reasonable approach is to cool the patient with a severe heat illness until they begin to shiver. (See <a class="local">'Prehospital assessment and initial interventions'</a> above and <a class="local">'Rapid cooling'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Elevated core body temperature (above 105°F, 40.5°C) associated with altered mental status following exertion in high heat and humidity is consistent with a diagnosis of EHS. If appropriate medical staff is available on-site (eg, team physician), tools to implement aggressive cooling are readily available, and <strong>no other emergency medical treatment is needed</strong> other than rapid lowering of the body temperature, it is generally best to follow the "cool-first, transport second" guideline. Once initial cooling is achieved (eg, 38.9°C, 102°F), the patient with EHS or other severe heat illness is rapidly transported to the closest emergency department.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rapid cooling is critical</strong> – We recommend that adults with EHS be treated as quickly as possible with rapid cooling (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Cold water immersion therapy is highly effective and the authors' preferred treatment if appropriate conditions are met and suitable equipment is available. In circumstances when ice water immersion is not feasible, particularly if the patient has complications requiring aggressive medical intervention (eg, compromised airway, seizure), alternative methods of cooling should be used. In the emergency department, one reasonable approach is to apply ice packs to the neck, axillae, and inguinal regions (areas adjacent to large blood vessels), while simultaneously spraying tepid water over the patient's body and using fans to blow air over the moist skin (ie, evaporative cooling). A detailed guide to field-side cooling is provided in the accompanying table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54492" href="/z/d/graphic/54492.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The goal temperature is 101 to 102°F or 38.3 to 38.9°C. Continuous monitoring of the patient is mandatory. (See <a class="local">'Rapid cooling'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hospital management of EHS</strong> – Once at the hospital, patients with EHS or other severe heat illness receive a diagnostic evaluation while rapid cooling and other interventions (eg, fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte abnormalities) are performed as needed. Studies to be obtained are listed above. Potential complications of EHS include respiratory failure, seizure, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, hepatic injury, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and myocardial injury. (See <a class="local">'Clinical assessment at the hospital'</a> above and <a class="local">'Laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging'</a> above and <a class="local">'Supportive therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exertional heat injury</strong> – Exertional heat injury is similar to EHS, but the patient's central nervous system is not affected. For patients with suspected heat injury, we recommend immediate treatment with rapid cooling using any of the methods suitable for EHS (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Additional resuscitative measures are provided as necessary and a hospital evaluation similar to that for patients with EHS should be performed. (See <a class="local">'Heat injury'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Heat exhaustion and heat syncope</strong> – Heat exhaustion is characterized by the inability to maintain adequate cardiac output (usually manifested as physical collapse during exercise) due to strenuous physical activity and environmental heat stress. Elevations in body temperature are less extreme than with EHS, and the central nervous system is not affected. Treatment includes moving the patient to a cool environment, with additional cooling methods used as needed, rehydration (usually with oral fluids), and careful monitoring. Evaluation in an emergency department is necessary if rapid improvement (within one or two hours) does not occur with appropriate management. Similar management is provided to patients with heat-related syncope and exercise-associated collapse.
