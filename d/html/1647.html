There are numerous ways to measure whether oxygenation is impaired. Commonly used measures are arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>), the alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, and arterial oxygen tension:fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio. SaO<sub>2</sub>, SpO<sub>2</sub>,<sub> </sub>and PaO<sub>2</sub> are general measures of oxygenation while the A-a gradient and PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio are used in select situations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1493836808"><span class="h2">Commonly used</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h3">Arterial and peripheral oxygen saturation (SaO2 and SpO2)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most of the oxygen that diffuses from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells (approximately 98 percent).

Since SaO<sub>2</sub> is a more accurate measure of oxygenation, it is prudent that the clinician checks the SaO<sub>2</sub> on an arterial blood gas when uncertainty exists (ie, dark skin tone, an error in the SpO<sub>2</sub> is suspected such as methemoglobinemia or carbon monoxide poisoning). Further details regarding errors associated with SpO<sub>2</sub> including racial differences in SpO<sub>2</sub> measurements are listed in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107546" href="/z/d/graphic/107546.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and discussed separately.

This reflects the multifactorial nature of tissue hypoxia. It is reasonable to consider a resting SpO<sub>2</sub> or SaO<sub>2</sub> ≤95 percent or exercise desaturation ≥5 percent from baseline as abnormal, although these values should not be considered in isolation [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. As an example, a resting SaO<sub>2</sub> of 95 percent could be abnormal if a patient previously had a resting SaO<sub>2</sub> of 99 percent. Ideal target oxygen saturation goals are discussed separately.

However, it is reasonable to consider a PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;80 mmHg as abnormal, with the understanding that the threshold varies with the A-a gradient (which widens with age), that the value should not be considered in isolation, and that an approximate value &lt;60 mmHg typically represents hypoxemia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].

The A-a gradient is a nonspecific indicator of the integrity of the alveolocapillary membrane. Thus, any pathology of the alveolocapillary unit widens the gradient. Hypoxemia due to ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, diffusion limitation, and shunt are associated with a widened gradient, whereas hypoxemia due to hypoventilation has a normal gradient.</p><p>We typically use the A-a gradient to narrow the differential in patients with hypoxemia, the details of which are discussed separately (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138668" href="/z/d/graphic/138668.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

The respiratory quotient is approximately 0.8 at steady state but varies according to the relative utilization of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. The A-a gradient calculated using the alveolar gas equation may deviate from the true gradient by up to 10 mmHg. This reflects the equation's simplification from a more rigorous full calculation and the imprecision of several independent variables (eg, FiO<sub>2</sub> and R).</p><p>There is no single cutoff for a normal or abnormal A-a gradient since it varies with age and the FiO<sub>2</sub> [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age</strong> – The normal A-a gradient increases with age due to a rise in V/Q mismatch with age and can be estimated from the following equation, assuming the patient is breathing room air (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13447.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p></p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p>A-a gradient = 2.5 + 0.21 x age in years</p></div></div><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>FiO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong> – The A-a gradient increases with higher FiO<sub>2</sub>. When a patient receives a high FiO<sub>2</sub>, both PAO<sub>2</sub> and PaO<sub>2</sub> increase. However, the PAO<sub>2</sub> increases disproportionately, causing the A-a gradient to widen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Proper determination of the A-a gradient requires <strong>exact</strong> measurement of the FiO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the most accurate measurement of the A-a gradient is in patients breathing room air at sea level or in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Since the FiO<sub>2</sub> can only be estimated in patients receiving supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or face mask the A-a gradient can only be approximated in such patients leading to large variations and limiting its usefulness. However, when used to assess the contribution of shunt to hypoxemia in spontaneously breathing patients (eg, in a pulmonary function laboratory or hospital floor), despite relative inaccuracy, a 100 percent nonrebreathing mask is typically used since it is the only suitable noninvasive alternative. Further details on this evaluation are provided separately. (See <a class="local">'Ventilation-perfusion mismatch'</a> below and <a class="local">'Right-to-left shunt'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8268.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: Clinical features and diagnostic evaluation in adults", section on 'Shunt fraction assessment'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Arterial oxygen tension: fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio is another common measure of oxygenation and is most often employed in ventilated patients.

For example, a patient whose PaO<sub>2</sub> is 60 mmHg while receiving an FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.5 (ie, 50 percent) has a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio of 120 mmHg. A normal PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio is 300 to 500 mmHg, with values less than 300 mmHg indicating abnormal gas exchange and values less than 200 mmHg indicating moderate to severe hypoxemia [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2940396139"><span class="h3">Mixed and central venous oxygen saturation (SvO2, ScvO2)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO<sub>2</sub>) measure the percentage of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in mixed venous and central venous blood, respectively.

Hypoxemia due to global hypoventilation generally corrects easily with supplemental oxygen.</p><p>The lung alveolus is a space in which gas makes up 100 percent of the contents. This means that once the partial pressure of one gas rises, the other must decrease. Both arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and alveolar carbon dioxide tension (PACO<sub>2</sub>) increase during hypoventilation, which causes the PAO<sub>2</sub> to decrease. As a result, diffusion of oxygen from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary declines with a net effect of hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Because the respiratory quotient (defined as CO<sub>2 </sub>eliminated/O<sub>2 </sub>consumed) is assumed to be 0.8, hypoventilation affects PaCO<sub>2</sub> more than the PaO<sub>2</sub>.
