(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6845.html" rel="external">"Ear barotrauma", section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Middle ear</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The middle ear space is an air-filled cavity between the external ear canal and the inner ear  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75010" href="/d/graphic/75010.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The ossicular chain and the facial nerve cross the middle ear space. The boundaries of the middle ear cavity are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The tympanic membrane, a three-layered membrane, laterally</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The otic capsule, containing the cochlea, semicircular canals, and vestibule (saccule and utricle), medially</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The bony tegmental wall under the middle cranial fossa, superiorly</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The bony jugular wall, encasing the internal jugular vein bulb, inferiorly</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The carotid wall, containing the Eustachian tube and tensor tympani muscle, anteriorly</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The entrance to the mastoid cavity, called the aditus ad antrum, posteriorly  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74487" href="/d/graphic/74487.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>)</p><p></p><p>The posterior aspect of the middle ear space leads into the adjacent air space called the mastoid cavity  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74487" href="/d/graphic/74487.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) via the aditus ad antrum. The bony roof of these regions separates them from the middle cranial fossa, which is lined by dura; the bony posterior aspect of the mastoid cavity contains the sigmoid sinus in the posterior cranial fossa. Fractures of the temporal bone into these spaces may result in any of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) middle ear effusion, otorrhea, or rhinorrhea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hemotympanum  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62387" href="/d/graphic/62387.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Carotid artery aneurysm, or pseudoaneurysm</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Meningitis days to years after the injury</p><p></p><p>The middle ear space is lined by vascularized, ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar respiratory mucosa. The pressure in the middle ear cavity is equilibrated to ambient pressure by the action of the tensor veli palatini muscle and the salpingopharyngeus muscle located at the orifice of the Eustachian tube (ET). The ET is supported by bone then cartilage, and lined by mucosa, as it travels from the middle ear space into the nasopharynx.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Ossicles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ossicles (the malleus, the incus, and the stapes) comprise a lever system that amplifies sound by a factor of approximately 1.5. The tympanic membrane has a large surface area compared with the oval window of the inner ear, and thus, it is responsible for amplification of sound by a factor of approximately 20 [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Sudden changes in sound intensity can be temporized by the activity of the stapedius muscle and tensor tympani muscle, both of which contract reflexively to dampen sound. Absence of air in the middle ear space, loss of tympanic membrane integrity, or disruption of the ossicular chain compromises the amplification system.</p><p>Middle ear injuries, such as those sustained from a slap on the ear or insertion of a Q-tip, may result in mild conductive hearing loss due to tympanic membrane perforation with partial loss of sound amplification  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65160" href="/d/graphic/65160.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Hemotympanum or CSF middle ear effusion caused by temporal bone basilar skull fracture or barotrauma may also dampen tympanic membrane sound conduction  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62387" href="/d/graphic/62387.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6845.html" rel="external">"Ear barotrauma"</a>.)</p><p>Middle ear injuries, such as more severe ear canal foreign body penetrations or temporal bone fractures, may result in maximum conductive hearing loss (ie, 60 dB) if the ossicular leverage system is disrupted at the incudostapedial joint or if the stapes is subluxed  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57714" href="/d/graphic/57714.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Alternatively, such injuries can result in sensorineural hearing loss as a result of a cochlear concussion, otic capsule fracture, or internal auditory canal fracture with impingement or laceration of the acoustic nerve (cranial nerve VIII).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Adjacent structures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following structures are present within and/or adjacent to the middle ear and often sustain injury when middle ear trauma occurs:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Oval window</strong> – Sudden changes in pressure, associated with barometric pressure changes, sound waves, or direct cranial injury, may result in trauma to the oval window and may cause a tear in the oval or round window membranes, creating a perilymphatic fistula between the inner ear and middle ear  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75010" href="/d/graphic/75010.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The presence of a perilymphatic fistula is associated with hearing loss and "third window" signs, such as Tullio phenomenon and a positive fistula test [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], which are manifest as follows [<a href="#rid5">5,14-16</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In Tullio phenomenon, a loud sound presented to the affected ear causes spinning vertigo and nystagmus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The fistula test is positive when pneumatic otoscopy with positive and negative pressure in the ear canal on the intact tympanic membrane results in spinning vertigo and nystagmus. If movements are large, the semicircular canal may be compromised; if movements are minimal, it may be an oval window fistula [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inner ear (otic capsule)</strong> – The inner ear is encased by the bony otic capsule and contains the cochlea, vestibule (saccule and utricle), and semicircular canals. The bone of the otic capsule is denser than the surrounding petrous portion of the temporal bone. When the otic capsule is fractured, damage to the cochlea with permanent sensorineural hearing loss commonly results.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Facial nerve</strong> – Usually encased in thin bone, the facial nerve exits the internal auditory canal, crosses the middle ear just superior to the oval window and stapes footplate, and then enters the fallopian canal to exit the mastoid via the stylomastoid foramen. From there, it divides into the branches responsible for activity of the muscles of facial expression. During its temporal bone course, the chorda tympani branch "leaves" the facial nerve to carry special sensory afferent fibers for taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Injury to the facial nerve results in ipsilateral facial paralysis, which can be either partial or complete. Injury to the chorda tympani results in a loss of taste or a metallic taste to the ipsilateral aspect of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, which often resolves over time.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Middle ear trauma is typically identified during clinical evaluation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3066130364"><span class="h2">Initial stabilization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient with suspected middle ear trauma should undergo evaluation and management based upon the patient's mechanism of injury and physical findings.

Middle ear assessment should be part of the secondary survey in these patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child"</a>.)</p><p>Important stabilization interventions specific to patients with middle ear trauma include: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with significant facial injury sustained during major trauma warrant cervical spine immobilization until appropriate assessment and diagnostic imaging of the neck are performed.

A complete physical examination and additional studies are warranted to identify other signs of abuse in these patients. (See <a class="local">'Child and elder protection'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3007.html" rel="external">"Elder abuse, self-neglect, and related phenomena"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Facial nerve function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Facial nerve deficit may arise from direct trauma to the middle ear or in association with a basilar skull fracture [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. Facial nerve function is assessed by observing the response to commands for closing the eyes, elevating the brow, and smiling/frowning. Patients with a peripheral facial nerve palsy associated with middle ear trauma may appear to have a facial droop associated with weakness of the forehead or they may appear to have the eye on the weakened side widely opened and the features of the weak side may be softer with absence of the nasolabial crease. These patients should be differentiated from those with stroke, in whom forehead and eyelid strength are preserved. The nasolabial folds and cheeks will be asymmetrical as the teeth are displayed, and the lower lip may appear to be somewhat hugging the teeth on the affected side. Decreased tearing, hyperacusis, loss of taste sensation on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and/or a metallic taste can also indicate facial nerve disruption localized to the fallopian canal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5095.html" rel="external">"The detailed neurologic examination in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Facial response to a painful stimulus may be helpful in patients who are unable to cooperate or have altered mental status. Early assessment is crucial as a predictor of prognosis, and it directs management steps in the setting of facial nerve weakness or paralysis. After initial examination and stabilization, patients with significant trauma may be sedated or comatose. This situation often complicates further evaluation of facial nerve function.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Ancillary studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with clinical features suggestive of middle ear trauma warrant the following studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation of any ear or nose drainage for the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tests of hearing (ie, active, age-appropriate behavioral testing for alert and cooperative patients or passive testing with auditory brainstem response [ABR] for uncooperative or comatose patients)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The ability to hear a whisper and symmetric hearing by report may suffice as an initial screening test in awake patients if pure tone audiometry is not immediately available.
