Because of its tendency to involve veins, the disorder has also been termed "periphlebitis retinae" and "idiopathic retinal periphlebitis."</p><p>The clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis of Eales disease are distinct from those of other inflammatory conditions that involve the retina. Eales disease must be distinguished from systemic disorders and infections, as well as from other ocular syndromes that cause retinal vasculitis.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of Eales disease will be reviewed. Retinal vasculitis that occurs in association with systemic disorders, infections, and primary retinal diseases is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8232.html" rel="external">"Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8231.html" rel="external">"Retinal vasculitis associated with primary ocular disorders"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Eales disease was described originally in England [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>] but is observed much more commonly on the Indian subcontinent than in any other region. Eales disease has been estimated to occur in 1 of every 135 to 250 patients evaluated at tertiary eye care centers in India [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p>A striking male predominance is reported in most series [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. However, in one series from North America, equal numbers of females and males were reported [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The mean age at onset in most studies from India is between the age of 20 and 30 years, compared with approximately 40 years in America and Germany [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathogenesis</strong> – The cause of Eales disease remains unknown. Substantial speculation has surrounded the potential association between <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and Eales disease [<a href="#rid10">10-14</a>]. If any true association does exist between these entities, the relationship is likely to be a reactive type of inflammation, similar to that which occurs in the joints in Poncet disease (tuberculous rheumatism) or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27-associated reactive arthritis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7658.html" rel="external">"Bone and joint tuberculosis", section on 'Inflammatory (Poncet disease)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7794.html" rel="external">"Reactive arthritis"</a>). Observational studies provide indirect support for the possibility of reactive inflammation in patients with Eales disease thought to be harboring nonviable tuberculosis organisms [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The precise events in the pathophysiology of Eales disease remain incompletely defined. Light microscopic and immunohistochemical studies of the epiretinal and subretinal membranes in Eales disease reveal T cell infiltration. In other ocular inflammatory diseases, the blood-retinal barrier breaks down during intraocular inflammation, followed by seepage of circulating blood into the retina. The vascular tropism of Eales disease, its predilection for veins, and its confinement to the retina remain unexplained. The presence of inflammatory mediators and vascular growth factors in the vitreous of these patients supports the theory of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> – The pathophysiology of Eales disease involves three basic processes [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Inflammation (peripheral retinal perivasculitis)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ischemic changes (peripheral retinal capillary nonperfusion)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neovascularization</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Eales disease begins as a retinal perivasculitis that primarily affects the peripheral parts of the retina. It is not unusual to have involvement of all four quadrants of the peripheral retina by active perivasculitis and exudates surrounding retinal veins. This vasculitis can lead to obliteration of the lumen of the blood vessel. Branch retinal vein occlusion may be noted on initial examination [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The obliteration leads to ischemia of the part of the retina perfused by the vessel. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production is increased by persistent ischemia, which subsequently leads to neovascularization.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1443025106"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1691252851"><span class="h2">Ocular symptoms and signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The visual loss in Eales disease is painless. Patients usually present in a subacute manner because retinal changes are focused in the periphery and may not cause notable visual changes. Mild visual blurring can occur early in the disease course and some patients report floating spots or flashes in one or both eyes. Profound visual loss may develop later because of vitreous hemorrhage. Although Eales disease is often unilateral and recurrent, up to 90 percent of patients with Eales disease eventually have involvement of both eyes [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>The duration of symptom progression can be quite variable, ranging from weeks to months. Central portions of the retina may be involved at the time of diagnosis. Eales disease may evolve in a discontinuous fashion, with apparent regression of the inflammatory process in some areas of the retina associated with signs of healing. Healed perivasculitis is represented by venous sheathing.</p><p>Superficial retinal hemorrhages often accompany the inflammation. Vitreous hemorrhage  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50653" href="/z/d/graphic/50653.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) occasionally results from capillary rupture caused by vascular inflammation in the acute phases of the illness but more commonly stems from proliferative retinal disease that resembles diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>Peripheral retinal neovascularization in Eales disease has a characteristic "sea fan" appearance noted on clinical examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy. Recurrent vitreous hemorrhage from these lesions is a disease hallmark. Although vitreous hemorrhages may resolve spontaneously over a period of weeks, the more common scenario is that such hemorrhages lead to organization, multiple vitreoretinal adhesions, and retinal detachment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Clinical stages</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Classification systems have been developed that help define the clinical stages of the disease [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. The more detailed classification system proposed in 2004 is as follows [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage I – Periphlebitis of small (Ia) and large (Ib) caliber vessels with superficial retinal hemorrhages</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IIa – Capillary nonperfusion</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IIb – Neovascularization of the disc/neovascularization elsewhere</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IIIa – Fibrovascular proliferation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IIIb – Vitreous hemorrhage</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IVa – Traction/combined rhegmatogenous retinal detachment</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage IVb – Rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, complicated cataract, and optic atrophy</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H46112663"><span class="h2">When to suspect Eales disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of Eales disease should be suspected in a younger patient who reports floaters, with or without decreased vision, in one or both eyes. When present, changes in vision are typically painless. Patients may be asymptomatic in early stages of the disease, but floaters, photopsias, and blurry vision are the most common symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3320133910"><span class="h2">Ocular examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation in a patient with suspected Eales disease should focus on obtaining an expedited eye examination by an ophthalmologist. As the changes caused by the disease involve the retina, careful assessment of the retinal vasculature via indirect ophthalmoscopy is imperative to document disease pathology.</p><p>Fundus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/z/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">fluorescein</a> angiography (FFA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are generally performed in all patients with suspected Eales disease.

FFA findings include aneurysms, hemorrhage, and vascular occlusions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">FFA is particularly helpful in the ischemic stage, when it can delineate areas of nonperfusion, neovascularization, and macular edema and can help guide the selection of sites for laser photocoagulation. As the pathology is predominantly in the periphery of the retina, wide-field angiography captures the retinal changes more effectively. (See <a class="local">'Patients with proliferative disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Optical coherence tomography</strong> – OCT is a noninvasive test that offers high-resolution imaging of the retina. OCT can demonstrate regions of neovascularization, hemorrhage, and macular edema.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>B-scan ultrasound – </strong>In rare situations, ultrasonography is needed to exclude retinal detachments in eyes that have undergone vitreous hemorrhage. This imaging modality may be used when the media (vitreous) precludes adequate visualization of the retina by slit-lamp examination or indirect ophthalmoscopy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1117029717"><span class="h2">Subsequent evaluation to exclude alternative diagnoses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once the presence of retinal vasculitis is confirmed, a subsequent evaluation is performed to exclude the presence of a related systemic disorder or infection. Referral to a rheumatologist or other specialist may be appropriate to help with the evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8232.html" rel="external">"Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections", section on 'Evaluation for underlying disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1500621198"><span class="h3">History and physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A thorough history and physical should be performed to exclude the presence of other systemic rheumatic diseases or infectious etiologies, as described in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8232.html" rel="external">"Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections", section on 'History and examination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Additional testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We typically obtain a complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, urinalysis with microscopy, and acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and serum C-reactive protein [CRP]) in all patients with retinal vasculitis.</p><p>For patients with suspected systemic disease, the additional serologic assays may be appropriate depending on the clinical presentation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antinuclear antibody testing – Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is useful in the evaluation of systemic lupus erythematosus and other systemic rheumatic diseases. A strongly positive ANA assay should be followed by additional serologic testing to determine the specific disease state responsible for the ANA positivity. This additional testing may include serum complement levels (C3, C4), antibodies to double-stranded DNA, and antibodies to the Ro/SSA, La/SSB, Sm, or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antigens. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4668.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults", section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antiphospholipid antibodies – Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) may be associated with ocular thrombotic events that mimic Eales disease (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4667.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome"</a>). Because not all patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) have all types of aPL, performance of each of the following tests is important:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>IgG and IgM anti-beta2-glycoprotein I</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lupus anticoagulant assay (usually a Russell viper venom time)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rheumatoid factor – A positive rheumatoid factor assay is a nonspecific result, but extremely high titers are usually found in the setting of rheumatoid vasculitis.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3060.html" rel="external">"Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If an immunofluorescence assay is positive in either a cytoplasmic or a perinuclear pattern (ie, C-ANCA or P-ANCA), then confirmation of the ANCA specificity, through enzyme immunoassays for antibodies to proteinase-3 and myeloperoxidase, is important.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Spirochetal disease assays – Syphilis should be excluded with an initial screening with a nontreponemal test (eg, a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] test), and then confirmed if reactive with a treponemal-specific test (eg, a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] test). Lyme disease should be excluded with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay followed, if appropriate, by a Western immunoblot assay. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7588.html" rel="external">"Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7914.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of Lyme disease", section on 'Serologic tests'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tuberculosis testing – We perform screening for tuberculosis, given the possible association with Eales disease and the potential need to give systemic immunosuppression for treatment.

As an example, chest radiography or computed tomography (CT) of the lungs is may be useful to exclude systemic diseases associated with retinal vasculitis, such as sarcoidosis and ANCA-associated vasculitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8226.html" rel="external">"Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults", section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141853336"><span class="h2">Diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of Eales disease is based upon the presence of characteristic clinical findings on eye examination (see <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above) and the exclusion of systemic disorders that may result in similar findings, such as sarcoidosis, which can exhibit similar ocular manifestations to early-stage Eales disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Differential diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Eales disease must be distinguished from retinal vasculitis found in primary vasculitides, connective tissue disorders, infections, and other conditions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8232.html" rel="external">"Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections"</a>.)</p><p>One distinguishing feature between Eales disease and other disorders associated with retinal vasculitis is that anterior uveitis seldom occurs concomitantly with Eales disease. In a small percentage of patients with Eales disease, a "spillover" uveitis occurs. This reflects spillover of inflammatory cells from the vasculitis into the uveal tract.</p><p><strong>MANAGEMENT APPROACH</strong> — The treatment of Eales disease is largely dependent on the disease stage. There are four major treatment options: watchful waiting, medical therapy, laser photocoagulation, and vitreal surgery. Since each affected eye may be at different stages of the disease, more than one treatment approach may be required for each patient.</p><p>As this condition is suspected to represent a postinfectious inflammatory syndrome (similar to reactive arthritis) in response to exposure to tuberculosis, infectious disease referral for consideration of antimicrobial therapy should be considered.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Patients without active retinal vasculitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who do not have evidence of active peripheral retinal vasculitis, we suggest watchful waiting rather than medical therapy. Patients without active peripheral vasculitis are typically those who in whom the initial slit-lamp examination reveals only venous sheathing, a finding that is consistent with inactive vasculitis. Watchful waiting usually consists of follow-up evaluations with slit-lamp examinations and fundus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/z/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">fluorescein</a> angiography (FFA) every six months.</p><p>Watchful waiting may also be appropriate in patients with fresh vitreous hemorrhage, which sometimes resolves spontaneously.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> – Eales disease occurs more commonly on the Indian subcontinent than any other region in the world. The disorder has a tendency to affect younger males. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathogenesis and pathophysiology</strong> – The cause of Eales disease remains unknown. Substantial speculation has surrounded the potential association between <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and Eales disease. The pathophysiology involves three basic processes: inflammation (peripheral retinal perivasculitis), ischemic changes (peripheral retinal capillary nonperfusion), and neovascularization. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> – Patients are usually asymptomatic in the initial stages and present in a subacute manner. Some patients report floating spots in one or both eyes. Mild visual blurring can occur early in the disease course, but painless visual loss may develop later because of vitreous hemorrhage. The duration of symptom progression can be quite variable, ranging from weeks to months. (See <a class="local">'Ocular symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ocular examination</strong> – The initial evaluation in a patient with suspected Eales disease should focus on obtaining an expedited eye examination by an ophthalmologist. As the changes caused by the disease involve the retina, careful assessment of the retinal vasculature via indirect ophthalmoscopy is imperative to document disease pathology. (See <a class="local">'Ocular symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subsequent evaluation</strong> – Once the presence of retinal vasculitis is confirmed, a subsequent evaluation is performed to exclude the presence of an underlying disease observed in patients with retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent evaluation to exclude alternative diagnoses'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of Eales disease is based upon the presence of characteristic clinical findings on eye examination and the exclusion of systemic disorders that may result in similar findings, such as sarcoidosis, which can exhibit similar ocular manifestations to early-stage Eales disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment</strong> – The treatment of Eales disease is predicated upon the patient's disease manifestations and severity.
