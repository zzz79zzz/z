(See <a class="local">'Importance of proteinuria and blood pressure control'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical trials evaluating antihypertensive therapy in nondiabetic CKD and our recommendations for choice of therapy as well as treatment goals will be reviewed here. The animal studies that provided the mechanisms and rationale for the clinical trials, the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, and general issues related to the treatment of hypertension in patients with CKD are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7171.html" rel="external">"Antihypertensive therapy and progression of chronic kidney disease: Experimental studies"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3052.html" rel="external">"Treatment of diabetic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3872.html" rel="external">"Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The approach to slowing the progression of CKD in children is discussed elsewhere.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3872.html" rel="external">"Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease", section on 'Possible benefit from nocturnal therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H594278"><span class="h1">IMPORTANCE OF PROTEINURIA AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple studies in animals and humans have shown that progression of a variety of chronic kidney diseases may be largely due to secondary hemodynamic and metabolic factors, rather than the activity of the underlying disorder. The major histologic manifestations of these secondary causes of kidney injury are interstitial fibrosis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (called secondary FSGS), which are superimposed upon any primary kidney injury that may be present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3049.html" rel="external">"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Glomerular damage and proteinuria typically occur with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), even in primary tubulointerstitial diseases such as chronic pyelonephritis due to reflux nephropathy [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Conversely, interstitial fibrosis occurs with progressive CKD, even in the setting of primary glomerular disease.</p><p>Identification of the factors responsible for secondary injury, such as intraglomerular hypertension, glomerular hypertrophy, and proteinuria greater than 500 to 1000 mg/day, is clinically important because they can be treated, slowing disease progression in many patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7181.html" rel="external">"Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>Studies of antihypertensive therapy in proteinuric nondiabetic CKD have focused on two areas: short-term reduction in protein excretion; and long-term protection against progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Data are limited on nonproteinuric CKD, defined as CKD associated with urine protein excretion less than 500 to 1000 mg/day. Among patients with proteinuric CKD, the preferred antihypertensive agents are drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and, at least in patients with type 2 diabetes, angiotensin II receptor blockers [<a href="#rid2">2,4,5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H594330"><span class="h2">Importance of proteinuria and the proteinuric response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with CKD, higher degrees of urinary protein excretion are associated with a more rapid decline in GFR, regardless of the primary cause of the kidney disease and the initial GFR  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68921" href="/d/graphic/68921.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). In addition to the initial urinary protein excretion, a number of studies have reported correlations between reduction in proteinuria with antihypertensive therapy and slower progression of the kidney disease. (See <a class="local">'The proteinuric response as a predictor of outcome'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1497610"><span class="h2">Importance of blood pressure control</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Observational studies show that patients with CKD and a normal blood pressure have better preservation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than hypertensive patients [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Interventional studies show that lower blood pressure targets (below 130/80 mmHg) are associated with better kidney outcomes in patients with proteinuric CKD (defined as urine protein excretion greater than 500 to 1000 mg/day) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Effect of goal blood pressure on progression of CKD'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EFFECT OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS ON PROTEINURIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The effect of antihypertensive drugs on proteinuria varies with drug class. When the blood pressure is controlled, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are more effective than other antihypertensive drugs in reducing proteinuria and in slowing the rate progression of proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), regardless of etiology [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. These benefits can be demonstrated even in patients who are not hypertensive and in those with diabetic nephropathy. (See <a class="local">'Effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on progression of CKD'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3052.html" rel="external">"Treatment of diabetic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>The generally greater antiproteinuric effect seen with the ACE inhibitors and ARBs is compatible with a greater fall in intraglomerular pressure, which has been demonstrated in animal models of proteinuric CKD [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. This effect is mediated in part by dilation of both efferent and afferent glomerular arterioles, rather than only the afferent arterioles as occurs with other classes of antihypertensive drugs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7171.html" rel="external">"Antihypertensive therapy and progression of chronic kidney disease: Experimental studies"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H79962422"><span class="h2">Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of trials have identified a preferential benefit of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in reducing proteinuria, compared with other antihypertensive drugs. The rationale behind these studies is the observation that protein excretion varies directly with the intraglomerular pressure in animals with structural glomerular disease [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>In addition to the reduction in intraglomerular pressure, a variety of other mechanisms may contribute to RAS inhibitor-induced reductions in proteinuria. These include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Direct improvement in the permselective properties of the glomerulus by ACE inhibitors, independent of changes in glomerular hemodynamics [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. The following findings support this hypothesis:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Protein excretion progressively declines over weeks to several months, whereas the hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibition occur rapidly and are then stable [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute administration of angiotensin II does not reverse the antiproteinuric effect, despite inducing renal and systemic vasoconstriction, and increasing intraglomerular pressure [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In transgenic rats, overexpression of the angiotensin II receptor (type 1) in glomerular podocytes results in significant proteinuria, foot process effacement, and glomerulosclerosis [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Angiotensin II reduces the expression of nephrin, a major component of the podocyte slit pore membrane and an important contributor to the glomerular filtration barrier [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. By contrast, nephrin expression is increased by ACE inhibitor therapy [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ACE inhibitors have an antifibrotic effect, which could contribute to the slowing of kidney disease progression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7181.html" rel="external">"Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease", section on 'Tubulointerstitial fibrosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The fall in protein excretion induced by RAS inhibitors (and some other antihypertensive drugs described below) may be associated with a reduction in serum lipid levels, which may reduce both the risk of systemic atherosclerosis and the rate of kidney disease progression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7181.html" rel="external">"Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>ACE inhibitors and ARBs have important side effects in patients with CKD, including the potential to induce hyperkalemia. The risk is low if the glomerular filtration rate is greater than 40 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and the initial serum potassium is in the low to normal range, and risk is even lower if a diuretic is also given [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. They can also acutely reduce the glomerular filtration rate, particularly if the patient is hypovolemic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3816.html" rel="external">"Major side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">ACE inhibitors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ACE inhibitors generally reduce protein excretion by approximately 30 to 35 percent in patients with nondiabetic or diabetic CKD [<a href="#rid21">21-25</a>]. The antiproteinuric effect is most prominent in patients who are on a low-sodium diet or who are treated with diuretics since relative volume depletion results in greater angiotensin II dependence of the glomerular microcirculation [<a href="#rid23">23,26</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Importance of salt intake'</a> below.)</p><p>It is unclear whether the ACE inhibitor dose associated with a maximal antihypertensive effect is the same as that required for an optimal antiproteinuric effect. This issue was addressed in a study of 23 proteinuric patients with nondiabetic kidney disease who were given increasing doses of spirapril for maximal antihypertensive effect (median dose of 6 mg/day), as assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. This dose reduced proteinuria from a mean of 2.56 to 1.73 g/day. An additional increase of spirapril to a supramaximal dose (median dose of 12 mg/day) failed to further decrease either blood pressure or proteinuria. In contrast to these findings, other studies have reported a dissociation between the doses required for optimal antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects, suggesting that the amounts necessary for these two benefits are likely to vary among patients [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H79962776"><span class="h3">Angiotensin II receptor blockers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) has been demonstrated in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic CKD. Their effect on slowing progression of GFR decline has been best demonstrated in diabetic kidney disease. It seems likely that they will have a similar renoprotective effect as ACE inhibitors in nondiabetic CKD but supportive data are limited [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3052.html" rel="external">"Treatment of diabetic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>Studies in humans have found that ARBs are as effective as ACE inhibitors in reducing protein excretion in patients with CKD [<a href="#rid14">14,21,30,31</a>]. In a 2008 meta-analysis of 49 randomized trials (mostly small), the reduction in proteinuria at 5 to 12 months was similar with ARBs and ACE inhibitors (ratio of means 1.08, 95% CI 0.96-1.22) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>As with ACE inhibition, there appears to be a dose effect, with greater reduction of proteinuria at higher (even supramaximal) doses in both nondiabetic and diabetic patients [<a href="#rid32">32-35</a>]. In the SMART trial, for example, 269 patients with proteinuria greater than 1 g/day despite seven weeks of the maximum approved dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8670" href="/d/drug information/8670.html" rel="external">candesartan</a> (16 mg/day) were randomly assigned to candesartan at a dose of 16, 64, or 128 mg/day [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Patients who received 128 mg/day had a significantly greater reduction in proteinuria at 30 weeks compared with those who received 16 mg/day (mean difference 33 percent). The blood pressure was not different between groups. Although hyperkalemia required the withdrawal of 11 patients from the trial, there was no difference in the incidence of hyperkalemia between groups. Such high-dose therapy is not typically used in clinical practice.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H79962783"><span class="h3">ACE inhibitor plus ARB</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The reduction in proteinuria appears to be greater when ACE inhibitors are used in combination with ARBs than with either drug alone, although no study has compared combination therapy with doubling the dose of a single agent [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, it has not been proven that combination therapy improves kidney outcomes and adverse effects may be more common. (See <a class="local">'Combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H79963722"><span class="h2">Other antihypertensive drugs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other antihypertensive drugs have a variable effect on protein excretion. These drugs may be used in addition to RAS-inhibitors to further reduce protein excretion but only one trial (AASK) has evaluated the efficacy of such regimens on the rate of disease progression in patients with nondiabetic CKD. (See <a class="local">'AASK trial of antihypertensive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H79963019"><span class="h3">Calcium channel blockers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9365" href="/d/drug information/9365.html" rel="external">diltiazem</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10043" href="/d/drug information/10043.html" rel="external">verapamil</a>, have significant antiproteinuric effects in patients with proteinuria [<a href="#rid22">22,36,37</a>]. By comparison, the dihydropyridines, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8627" href="/d/drug information/8627.html" rel="external">amlodipine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9700" href="/d/drug information/9700.html" rel="external">nifedipine</a>, have a variable effect on proteinuria, ranging from an increase to no effect to a fall in protein excretion [<a href="#rid21">21,36,38</a>].</p><p>Differences between non-dihydropyridine and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were illustrated in a systematic review of 23 studies that adjusted for sample size, study length, and baseline values [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Based upon an analysis of monotherapy in 510 patients, non-dihydropyridines decreased mean proteinuria by 30 percent and dihydropyridines increased proteinuria by 2 percent (95% CI 10-54% for the differences between the two drug classes).

This was demonstrated in an analysis of 1190 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants who were over age 70 years and had CKD, which was defined as an estimated GFR &lt;60 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of &gt;200 mg/g of creatinine (approximately 300 mg/day) [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].

As an example, in a study of 790,342 military veterans aged 70 years or older, the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) with RAS inhibition to prevent one ESKD event was calculated, assuming that such medications result in a 30 percent lower relative risk (similar to the effect in younger populations) [<a href="#rid81">81</a>].

As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the MDRD study, for each 1 g/day reduction in protein excretion during the first four months, the rate of decline in GFR fell by 0.9 to 1.3 mL/min per year [<a href="#rid86">86</a>].

Thus, repeat measurement of the serum creatinine and potassium should be obtained during this time frame after the initiation or intensification of therapy.</p><p>The long-term clinical significance of a modest and stable rise in serum creatinine after the initiation or intensification of RAS inhibitor therapy is debated since it is due in part to a reduction in intraglomerular pressure, which is thought to contribute to the slowing of disease progression. An initial elevation in serum creatinine of as much as 30 to 35 percent above baseline that stabilizes within the first two months of therapy is considered acceptable and <strong>not</strong> a reason to discontinue therapy as long as there is not an excessive fall in blood pressure; the latter is most likely to occur in patients who are volume depleted at the initiation of therapy due, for example, to diuretic therapy [<a href="#rid89">89,90</a>]. The prognostic implications of an acute and stable rise in serum creatinine of up to 30 percent are uncertain. Several studies suggest that such reductions in GFR are associated with adverse consequences [<a href="#rid91">91,92</a>]. By contrast, a review of 12 randomized trials found that patients with an acute and stable rise in serum creatinine of up to 30 percent were more likely to have long-term preservation of kidney function [<a href="#rid89">89</a>].</p><p>A separate question is whether or not ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be discontinued among patients who take these agents chronically if they progress to advanced CKD (ie, eGFR &lt;30 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Theoretically, the acute decline in eGFR occurring after initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB could be regained when these drugs are stopped, thereby delaying the onset of ESKD. However, rigorous studies indicate that there is no benefit from discontinuing these agents [<a href="#rid93">93-95</a>]. The best data come from a trial of 411 patients with advanced CKD (median eGFR 18 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) who were treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least six months; patients were randomly assigned to continue or discontinue therapy with these drugs [<a href="#rid93">93</a>]. At three years, patients who discontinued therapy were more likely to develop ESKD, although this was not statistically significant (62 versus 56 percent; hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 0.99-1.65).

The 2004 K/DOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines on hypertension and antihypertensive agents in CKD recommends a goal less than 500 to 1000 mg/g creatinine from the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on a random urine specimen [<a href="#rid105">105</a>]. However, proteinuria estimated from the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio may be substantially different from daily protein excretion. As an example, creatinine excretion in males under the age of 50 years is 20 to 25 mg/kg of lean body weight per day. Thus, a male with obesity who has a lean body weight of 80 kg may excrete 2000 mg of creatinine. In such a patient, a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 1000 mg/g represents protein excretion of approximately 2 g/day. This would be a suboptimal outcome in patients with IgA nephropathy in whom protein excretion above 1000 mg/day is associated with an adverse kidney prognosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3101.html" rel="external">"Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3039.html" rel="external">"IgA nephropathy: Treatment and prognosis", section on 'Risk factors for disease progression'</a>.) </p><p>Because of this potential limitation in using only the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, we suggest the following approach to measuring and monitoring protein excretion, which takes into account both the greater accuracy of a complete 24-hour urine collection and the greater ease of monitoring with a spot urine specimen:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 24-hour urine collection should be obtained during the initial evaluation, measuring the excretion of both protein and creatinine. The completeness of the 24-hour urine collection can be estimated from creatinine excretion. Normal values of creatinine excretion vary with muscle mass and, hence, age, sex, and physical activity: in patients under the age of 50 years, 20 to 25 mg/kg estimated lean body weight in males and 15 to 20 mg/kg estimated lean body weight in females; and, in patients between the ages of 50 and 90 years, there is a progressive 50 percent decline in creatinine excretion (to approximately 10 mg/kg estimated lean body weight in males).

The urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on this specimen can be related to the total amount of proteinuria, and the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on a random specimen can subsequently be used to monitor the degree of proteinuria, as long as muscle mass appears stable. If, for example, 24-hour protein excretion is 3 g/day in an apparently complete collection and the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is 2.0, then a ratio below 0.7 would represent goal proteinuria below 1 g/day.</p><p></p><p>We suggest a proteinuria goal of less than 1000 mg/day, which is similar to the K/DOQI recommendation of 500 to 1000 mg/g creatinine. It may be difficult to attain this goal, particularly in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. In such patients, we suggest a minimum reduction in proteinuria of at least 50 to 60 percent from baseline values <strong>plus</strong> protein excretion less than 3.5 g/day. This approach is based upon an observational study in 348 patients with membranous nephropathy and nephrotic syndrome who were treated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition and, in some cases, immunosuppressive therapy and were followed for a minimum of one year [<a href="#rid118">118</a>]. The patients who attained these goals, when compared with patients who reached only one or neither of these goals, had marked reductions in the rate of loss of glomerular filtration rate (0.17 versus 0.86 mL/min per month) and in the incidence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (9 versus 29 percent, adjusted hazard ratio 0.17). Subnephrotic proteinuria is also associated with a good kidney prognosis in primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3051.html" rel="external">"Membranous nephropathy: Treatment and prognosis", section on 'General measures in all patients'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3100.html" rel="external">"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: Treatment and prognosis", section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>IgA nephropathy represents an exception to the above approach since protein excretion above 1000 mg/day and perhaps above 500 mg/day is associated with a higher risk of disease progression.
