         A growing body of evidence suggests that sleep disorders may interfere with physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. In addition, children with neurodevelopmental problems, learning differences, or behavior problems may be at heightened risk for sleep problems compared with the general pediatric population [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ]. Children with sleep disorders may present with different symptoms than do adults, and, within the pediatric age group, the clinical manifestations of sleep problems may vary by age and developmental level.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will discuss the approach to taking a structured sleep history, provide an overview of specific sleep problems that may present during childhood, and explain indications for further diagnostic testing. Specific sleep disorders are discussed in more detail in other topic reviews:

          Anticipatory guidance
         </strong>
         – Routine counseling to parents, caregivers, and children about age-appropriate targets for nighttime sleep and daytime napping can help them recognize a chronic sleep deficit and its consequences. A child with insufficient sleep may not appear sleepy to parents/caregivers or clinicians. Instead, the child may exhibit attentional difficulties due to unsuspected sleepiness, hyperactivity secondary to efforts to stay awake, or aggressive and disruptive behavior that reflects inability of a sleep-deprived frontal cortex to regulate emotion normally. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16641.html" rel="external">

         Clinicians should incorporate questions about sleep into routine health assessment for children of all ages. Parents may not volunteer information about their child's sleep or may not appreciate the potential relationship between sleep problems and daytime behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sleep problems usually present in the outpatient setting, but the hospitalized child may develop sleep problems during an acute illness, or chronic sleep disorders may come to medical attention during hospitalization.
        </p>
        <p>
         A variety of checklists and questionnaires are available and may supplement the history. As an example, BEARS is a screening acronym that prompts a clinician to inquire about five sleep areas  (

         The sleep history should always assess for difficulties in each of these areas. However, the main focus of the history depends on the nature of the chief complaint. The main diagnostic considerations in each of these categories are outlined below. (See

The problem can be clarified by evaluating the sleep schedule, sleeping environment, and bedtime routines. When problems are identified, the provider can advise the parent/caregiver on how to modify the routine to improve sleep habits. (See

          Response to nighttime awakenings
         </strong>
         – When children experience nighttime awakenings, the parent/caregiver's response can promote or extinguish the behavior. As an example, excessive parental attention in response to nighttime awakenings (including routinely allowing the child to switch beds) may perpetuate the problem. The clinician should assess whether the parents' response to nighttime awakenings is likely to reinforce the behavior and should offer advice on how to reverse this pattern. For healthy toddlers and older infants, habitual nighttime feedings may disrupt sleep and are unnecessary. Clinicians should inquire about nighttime feedings and offer guidance on eliminating these when appropriate. (See

         – Psychosocial dysfunction may cause or present as a sleeping problem. Conversely, children's sleeping problems can contribute to household and marital stress. The clinician should probe the psychosocial history, including the presence of marital discord, use of alcohol or drugs by household members, and any indications of child abuse.

          Anxiety or depression

         – Anxiety (including separation anxiety) and depression are common causes of insomnia in children. All children have fears at some point in their lives, and these may interfere with sleep. If the fears are persistent and consistently interfere with functioning (ie, sleep), evaluation for a specific phobia or generalized anxiety disorder may be warranted. (See

          Concomitant medical problems
         </strong>
         – The clinician should identify chronic medical problems that may influence sleep, including chronic or recurrent pain, symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux, breathing problems during wakefulness or sleep, and the medication history. Such medical problems may disrupt sleep because of discomfort or because of medical interventions (eg, medications, breathing treatments, or feedings) that are given during the night. Some medications, including stimulants used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), may affect sleep latency and continuity. (See

         For evaluation of the child with excessive daytime sleepiness, the history is directed at identification of potential causes. Sleepiness should be differentiated from chronic fatigue, which often involves somatic complaints, such as weakness or easy fatigability, malaise, nonrestorative sleep patterns, and depression or other emotional disturbances. (See

         Excessive sleepiness is of particular concern in older adolescents because of the known association between drowsy driving and accidents. Driving while drowsy can have the same consequences as driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol including reduced attentiveness, delayed reaction times, and impaired decision-making. Young men between 16 and 24 years of age are most at risk for having an accident while driving drowsy [

         Insufficient sleep is the leading cause of daytime sleepiness in children and teenagers [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25

         ]. Insufficient sleep is common [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ], and often is a consequence of poor sleep hygiene (which contributes to insufficient sleep time), failure of the parents or older children to prioritize sleep, and/or medication side effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recommended sleep times by age are outlined in the figure  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). However, sleep needs vary substantially between individuals. Sufficient sleep for any given individual can be defined as that amount which, when obtained on a regular basis, allows optimal daytime alertness and (importantly for children) behavioral and emotional regulation. By this definition, any individual may still have insufficient sleep even if the number of hours obtained falls within the limits suggested in the table.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, the primary care clinician may provide counseling to improve sleep hygiene  (

         ). For children with suspected emotional triggers, further evaluation and referral to a mental health specialist is appropriate. If this is not successful, then referral to a specialist in sleep medicine may be helpful, especially for children with neurologic or developmental disorders. (See

         Children with narcolepsy often experience severe sleepiness, including falling asleep during meal times and conversation, sports events, or social activities. The disorder is most often diagnosed during adolescence, but is increasingly recognized in younger children. Academic failure is common. Unique features that may or may not be present initially are cataplexy (sudden bilateral loss of tone, often precipitated by a sudden emotion such as laughter), sleep paralysis, or hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid, dreamlike imagery at sleep onset) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,27-30
         </a>
         ]. Cataplexy should be differentiated from atonic seizures, syncope, vestibular disorders, transient ischemic attacks, and behaviorally based loss of postural tone. The diagnostic evaluation for narcolepsy includes a focused history and physical examination, polysomnography (PSG), and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). (See

Children who snore ≥3 nights per week should be evaluated by their primary care clinician or specialist to determine the need for a PSG. In addition, persistent comorbidities such as hypertension [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

         ], behavioral disturbances [

         OSA is particularly common in school-aged children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, or in children of any age with obesity. It typically presents with complaints of snoring or other sounds, such as snorting or gasping. It is often associated with neurobehavioral symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and irritability. Children whose initial screening reveals any of these symptoms, or those with marked adenotonsillar hypertrophy or obesity, warrant a more detailed clinical evaluation  (

         Children with suspected OSA should be referred to a sleep medicine clinician or an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) whose practice includes children. Existing literature does not indicate which referral serves best, and local resources and access to care may vary. If PSG is indicated, this usually can be arranged by the sleep clinician or otolaryngologist. Many accredited sleep laboratories will only perform studies after children are seen by a sleep clinician, otolaryngologist, or other clinician experienced with sleep apnea in children. This is because screening for sleep disorders other than OSA, choices for equipment used during sleep studies, interpretation of results, formulation of comprehensive treatment plans, assessment of outcomes, and plans for further interventions when needed are not subjects commonly taught in other types of medical training.

         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. The movements usually involve extension of the great toe and partial flexion of the ankle, knee, and sometimes hip. When these movements are associated with repetitive partial arousals or awakenings, sleep is fragmented. In addition to the movements, affected children have daytime problems, often including diminished attentiveness [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         There is significant overlap between PLMD and restless legs syndrome (RLS) in both children and adults. RLS is characterized by an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs. The symptoms begin or worsen during rest or inactivity, are relieved by movement, and occur exclusively or predominantly in the evening or night. Children with RLS or PLMD often have depressed serum ferritin levels, indicating reduced iron stores, and in this case the disorder may improve with iron supplementation. (See

A generalized tonic clonic seizure arising out of sleep is usually obvious by history and not easy to confuse with a sleep disorder; the seizure involves bilateral tonic clonic movements, often with tongue biting or urinary incontinence, postictal drowsiness and confusion. It may be difficult for parents to provide a full description of nocturnal seizures since they may directly observe only the latter portion of the event rather than the beginning of the event.

Occasionally these types of seizures may be difficult to distinguish from arousal (NREM) parasomnias (sleep walking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) because both may be associated with altered behavior, responsiveness, and automatisms, and because attempts to awaken a child during a parasomnia may precipitate a lengthy period of confusion (ie, partial arousal) that is reminiscent of a postictal state [

         <strong>
          Technique
         </strong>
         – The MSLT is performed following nocturnal PSG and consists of five 20-minute nap opportunities at two-hour intervals across the day, while recording EEG and other parameters similar to a PSG. The test is based on the concept that the speed with which one falls asleep is an indication of the severity of sleepiness.

         <strong>
          Interpretation
         </strong>
         – During the MSLT, a sleep latency time of less than five minutes is markedly abnormal and supports a diagnosis of narcolepsy or severe sleep deprivation. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3
         <sup>
          rd
         </sup>
         edition (ICSD-3), requires a mean sleep latency of less than eight minutes and two or more sleep onset REM periods as part of the diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Prepubertal children tend to have a somewhat longer sleep latency on the MSLT compared with adults, such that values of 8 to 15 minutes (rather than less than eight minutes) on the MSLT may suggest pathologic sleepiness [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition to abnormal sleep latency, patients with narcolepsy tend to enter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep quickly during daytime naps. Abnormal entry into REM sleep also may occur in disorders other than narcolepsy that are associated with fragmented nocturnal sleep, such as OSA, sleep deprivation, and as a rebound phenomenon after REM-suppressing medications are stopped abruptly.

          51
         </a>
         ], usually during a 5- to 14-day period. Actigraphy has been validated against PSG and shown to provide a reasonable estimate for patterns of sleep versus wakefulness in children and adults. The advantage of actigraphy over polysomnography is that it captures multiple days of data from the home environment. Actigraphy is typically used by sleep medicine specialists as part of a comprehensive characterization of sleep-wake patterns and to monitor response to interventions. (See

          Insomnia
         </strong>
         – Difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep (sleeplessness or insomnia) often have behavioral origins in young children. These issues can be identified by evaluating the sleep schedule, sleeping environment, and bedtime routines. Other causes or contributors in all age groups include psychosocial stressors, underlying medical problems, and anxiety or depression. Specific sleep disorders that may cause sleep-onset insomnia include restless legs syndrome (RLS) and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, which is common in adolescents. (See

          Daytime sleepiness

         – The most common causes of daytime sleepiness include insufficient nocturnal sleep compared with the average sleep requirements for the age group  (

         ). Less common but important causes include narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). (See

          Snoring or breathing problems
         </strong>
         – OSA in children typically presents with snoring, other noisy breathing, daytime behavioral problems, or excessive daytime sleepiness. If these symptoms are present, or if a child has significant adenotonsillar hypertrophy or obesity, a more detailed clinical evaluation is warranted  (

          Movements or behaviors

         – Abnormal movements or behaviors may be observed in a variety of sleep disorders  (

         Rhythmic movements of the head, neck, or trunk associated with sleep are common and likely developmental (physiologic) in infants and young children. They are most common in infants and toddlers and generally resolve spontaneously by five years of age. (See

         RLS and periodic limb movements in sleep are relatively common in children and are associated with diminished attentiveness. Children with RLS often have depressed serum ferritin levels, indicating reduced iron stores, and in this case, the disorder may improve with iron supplementation. (See

         Parasomnias (sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors) are benign and most common in young children but occasionally occur in older children or adolescents. The differential diagnosis includes nocturnal seizures. Compared with parasomnias, nocturnal seizures are more likely to recur during the same night, have stereotypic behaviors, and occur randomly through the night (rather than in the first one-third of the night)  (

          Ancillary tests
         </strong>
         – In some children, evaluation with overnight polysomnography (PSG) may be required to confirm a specific sleep disorder (eg, OSA or narcolepsy) or to titrate positive airway pressure therapy. The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is an objective, in-laboratory assessment for excessive daytime sleepiness, used primarily to evaluate patients with suspected narcolepsy. PSG is not routinely indicated for children with insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disturbances, uncomplicated parasomnias, or behavioral sleep problems. (See
