Common presenting symptoms include fever, headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting; patients with fulminant disease may present with coma. Predictors of poor outcome include high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cryptococcal antigen levels (titer &gt;1:1024 by latex; &gt;1:4000 by lateral flow assay), low body weight, poor CSF inflammatory response (&lt;20 cells/microL of CSF), and altered mental status on presentation [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3757.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in patients with HIV"</a>.)</p><p>Management of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis includes all of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antifungal therapy. (See <a class="local">'Antifungal therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Control of intracranial pressure, which can lead to blindness, herniation, persistent headaches, and/or neuropathies if left untreated. (See <a class="local">'Management of increased intracranial pressure'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immune recovery with potent antiretroviral medications. However, to reduce the risk of developing an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be started between 2 and 10 weeks after antifungal therapy has been initiated. In resource-limited areas, the timing of ART is commonly between four and six weeks, but in resource-rich health care systems, ART initiation can be delayed up to 10 weeks. (See <a class="local">'When to initiate antiretroviral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>There is <strong>no</strong> role for empiric glucocorticoids during induction therapy. This is in contrast to other conditions (eg, tuberculous meningitis) in which glucocorticoids are routinely administered as part of initial therapy. The use of glucocorticoids for patients with cryptococcal meningitis was evaluated in a randomized trial that included 451 patients from Asia and Africa [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Patients received amphotericin B plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a> with or without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> (starting at 0.3 mg/kg per day and then tapered over six weeks). The trial was stopped early after an interim analysis found no difference in mortality or the rate of IRIS between the two groups at 10 weeks; in addition, patients who received adjunctive glucocorticoids were less likely to have a good neurologic outcome (13 versus 25 percent; odds ratio 0.42, 95% CI 0.25-0.69). Patients who received dexamethasone also had significantly slower rates of fungal CSF clearance after approximately two weeks and were significantly more likely to develop an adverse event (eg, infection, renal or cardiac event) by six months (667 versus 494 adverse events).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1862442"><span class="h2">Antifungal therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The optimal approach to antifungal therapy involves three phases: induction therapy for approximately two weeks, followed by consolidative therapy for eight weeks [<a href="#rid2">2,6</a>], and then maintenance (ie, suppressive) therapy for at least one year to decrease the risk of relapse  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130859" href="/d/graphic/130859.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Induction therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Consolidation regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>The primary antifungal agents used for the treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis include intravenous (IV) amphotericin B, oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a>, and oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a>. Use of intrathecal or intraventricular amphotericin B is <strong>not</strong> advised except in extreme circumstances, since systemic administration demonstrates good efficacy and these other direct routes can be associated with arachnoiditis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In addition, echinocandin antifungals should <strong>not</strong> be used to treat this infection, since echinocandins do not have significant activity against <em>C. neoformans</em>.</p><p>The approach to treatment below describes treatment in nonpregnant adults. Treatment of pregnant persons should be managed in conjunction with an infectious diseases specialist since <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a> may be teratogenic during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3194246945"><span class="h3">Induction therapy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2542467489"><span class="h4">Preferred regimens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This section will review our preferred approach to regimen selection.

The use of combination therapy with amphotericin B plus flucytosine has been supported in several randomized trials, and this specific regimen was found to have a survival benefit when compared with amphotericin alone [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. This two-week regimen also allows appropriate monitoring of patients to minimize the risk of toxicity and is well established in clinical practice.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients with reduced kidney function, the dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a> must be reduced.

Although some guideline panels use higher doses of amphotericin B deoxycholate (eg, 1 mg/kg/day) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], a comparison of 0.7 mg/kg/day with 1 mg/kg/day of amphotericin B demonstrated no difference in mortality at 10 weeks in a small trial of 64 patients with HIV and cryptococcal meningoencephalitis [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], and we favor the lower amphotericin B daily dose to reduce nephrotoxicity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Induction regimens with a shortened duration of polyene therapy (a single dose of high-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9499" href="/d/drug information/9499.html" rel="external">liposomal amphotericin B</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a>/<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a> for 14 days)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130859" href="/d/graphic/130859.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) may be considered on rare occasion (eg, a patient who adamantly refuses hospitalization). However, this regimen should only be considered on a case-by-case basis. Although data in resource-limited settings suggest that short courses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8701" href="/d/drug information/8701.html" rel="external">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> or liposomal amphotericin B are effective for treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, and may limit some treatment-related toxicity [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>], patients still require close monitoring in the hospital for the two-week induction course since serious complications such as increased intracranial pressure and/or seizures can occur acutely during this time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>When resources are limited</strong> – In certain settings, administering liposomal amphotericin plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a> for two weeks may not be feasible due to cost and/or limited access, as well as the inability to monitor and manage potential toxicities. This is particularly relevant to resource-limited settings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In this setting, we suggest a regimen that uses a shortened duration of polyene therapy. The World Health Organization (WHO)-preferred regimen uses a single 10 mg/kg dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9499" href="/d/drug information/9499.html" rel="external">liposomal amphotericin B</a> with 14 days of oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a> (1200 mg/day) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]; if liposomal amphotericin B is not available, a regimen that includes one week of therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8701" href="/d/drug information/8701.html" rel="external">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> plus flucytosine, followed by a week of high dose fluconazole would be acceptable  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130859" href="/d/graphic/130859.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

These studies used fluconazole doses that were in the 200 to 400 mg range. A subsequent study using high doses of fluconazole (1200 mg/day) and flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day) suggests that a combination oral regimen is comparable to a polyene-containing regimen [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In this trial, the oral combination regimen had a 10-week mortality of approximately 35 percent, which was similar to the mortality reported when induction therapy with certain amphotericin B-containing regimens were used.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>If </strong><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a><strong> cannot be used</strong> – If flucytosine is not available or cannot be tolerated, two weeks of amphotericin B plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a> (800 to 1200 mg daily) can be used [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Alternative regimens'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation prior to consolidation therapy</strong> – The duration of induction therapy should be extended if clinical improvement is not observed and/or if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sterilization has not yet been achieved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">To assess CSF sterilization in patients receiving a regimen that includes two weeks of amphotericin B plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a>, a repeat a lumbar puncture (LP) for fungal culture should be performed after two weeks of induction therapy, even among patients who have clinically improved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients receiving a regimen with a shortened duration of amphotericin B, we suggest an LP 7 to 14 days after completion of polyene therapy, followed by a repeat course of induction therapy in those who have a positive culture (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). In this setting, we would use an induction regimen that includes two weeks of amphotericin B plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a>. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation prior to switching to consolidation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Consolidation regimen</strong> – When patients transition to consolidation therapy, we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a> rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8586" href="/d/drug information/8586.html" rel="external">itraconazole</a> (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Fluconazole is generally preferred over itraconazole due to better bioavailability and a reduced risk of drug interactions and gastrointestinal symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients should receive consolidation therapy for a minimum of eight weeks. We generally initiate consolidation therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a> 800 mg/day  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130859" href="/d/graphic/130859.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In resource-available countries, the dose can be reduced to 400 mg/day to complete the consolidation phase if the patient received induction therapy with amphotericin B plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a> for two weeks, CSF cultures obtained after two weeks of induction therapy are negative, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been started. (See <a class="local">'Consolidation regimen'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Maintenance regimen</strong> – For patients who complete the induction and consolidation phases of therapy, we recommend <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a> (200 mg daily) for maintenance treatment compared with no therapy or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8586" href="/d/drug information/8586.html" rel="external">itraconazole</a> (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). In early studies, patients who received maintenance therapy had a much lower incidence of relapse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The minimum duration of maintenance therapy is at least one year. After that, maintenance therapy can be discontinued in individuals receiving ART who have a CD4 cell count greater than 100 cells/microL and have achieved an undetectable viral load on ART for more than three months. (See <a class="local">'Maintenance therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Managing increased ICP</strong> – Patients with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) should be managed aggressively to reduce the risk of mortality associated with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. In general, repeat LPs should be performed to reduce the opening pressure to &lt;20 cm CSF; however, in symptomatic patients with extremely high CSF pressures, the goal is to reduce the ICP by 50 percent of the initial value.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We perform daily LPs until the patient is asymptomatic and the CSF pressure has been documented to be normal and/or stable. Lumbar or ventricular drains may be preferred in patients who require frequent LPs. (See <a class="local">'Management of increased intracranial pressure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>When to initiate ART</strong> – For patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis who are not receiving ART, we suggest initiation of ART be delayed at least two weeks after antifungal induction therapy has been started (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). For patients with access to close medical follow-up and preventative therapy, we often start ART 10 weeks after the initiation of antifungal therapy to minimize the risk of drug interactions and development of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, for individuals without these resources, we typically start ART four to six weeks after induction therapy has been initiated. (See <a class="local">'When to initiate antiretroviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – The best way to prevent cryptococcal disease in individuals with HIV is through early initiation of ART at high CD4 counts. However, in patients with a low CD4 count, a strategy involving serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening and pre-emptive antifungal therapy in addition to ART may further reduce the risk of developing cryptococcal meningitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For asymptomatic patients with a CD4 count &lt;100 cells/microL who are not receiving ART, we test for cryptococcal antigen prior to initiation of ART. There may also be a benefit to screening at a higher CD4 count threshold (eg, &lt;200 cells/microL) in certain areas of high prevalence for cryptococcal disease, such as resource-limited settings where the accuracy of CD4 counts may be reduced. The management of patients who screen positive for cryptococcal antigen is discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Preventing symptomatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If screening is not available, we do <strong>not</strong> routinely administer antifungal prophylaxis for prevention of cryptococcal disease in resource-available countries where the incidence of cryptococcal infection is low. However, in certain resource-limited areas with a high prevalence of disease, it is reasonable to initiate primary prophylaxis with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a> in asymptomatic adults with CD4 counts &lt;100 cells/microL. (See <a class="local">'If screening is not available'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Considerations during pregnancy</strong> – Pregnant persons should be managed in conjunction with an infectious diseases specialist, since <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8451" href="/d/drug information/8451.html" rel="external">flucytosine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a> may be teratogenic during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester.
