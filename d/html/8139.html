         Mitral stenosis (MS) is a progressive condition characterized by obstruction of blood flow across the mitral valve from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The mechanical obstruction leads to increases in pressure within the left atrium, pulmonary vasculature, and right side of the heart. Most cases of MS are caused by rheumatic heart disease with mitral commissural adhesion; thickened, immobile mitral valve leaflets; and fibrosis, thickening, shortening, fusion, and calcification of the chordae tendineae. Infrequent causes of MS include mitral annular calcification and congenital MS. (See

         Evaluation and management of MS may be optimized by a multidisciplinary heart valve team approach used for a variety of valve conditions [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. This multidisciplinary approach incorporates clinical evaluation and risk assessment to determine if mitral valve intervention is indicated and to guide choice of intervention. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">
          "Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults", section on 'Evaluation of candidates for PMBC'

        </p>
        <p>
         Interventions for MS (percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy [PMBC] and mitral valve surgery) in adults are most commonly performed in countries with high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease; valve centers in such settings often have high procedure volume and extensive operator experience.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, interventions for MS are less commonly performed in countries in which acute rheumatic fever is rare (eg, the United States); patients presenting with rheumatic MS in countries with low prevalence of rheumatic fever are often immigrants from other countries where rheumatic fever persists [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Given the very low volume of patients with rheumatic MS treated by most clinical practices in resource-abundant countries, professional societies have recommended that PMBC be performed at selected experienced valve centers (termed Comprehensive Valve Centers by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,4
         </a>
         ] and Heart Valve Centres by the European Society of Cardiology [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]) where expertise and experience for low-volume procedures such as PMBC can be concentrated.

         Management of rheumatic MS includes patient education regarding the need for ongoing care, periodic monitoring, rheumatic fever prophylaxis, management of heart failure, management of atrial fibrillation (AF), prevention of thromboembolism, endocarditis prophylaxis, counseling on physical activity, management of risk associated with pregnancy, management of risk of noncardiac surgery, and cardiovascular risk reduction.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         For all patients with MS, follow-up should include yearly history and physical examination to assess for symptoms and signs of disease progression and development of indications for intervention [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Careful clinical evaluation is required since some patients may not report symptoms due to the gradual progression of disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography should be performed with frequency based upon the severity of disease. We agree with the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) valve guideline recommendation for echocardiography every three to five years if the mitral valve area (MVA) is &gt;1.5 cm
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         , every one to two years if the MVA is 1.0 to 1.5 cm
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         , and every year if the MVA is &lt;1.0 cm
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The long interval between testing in asymptomatic, stable, mild disease is based in part upon the natural history of MS, as MVA declines at a mean of approximately 0.1 cm
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         per year. However, the rate of progression is highly variable, especially in younger populations with recurrent rheumatic fever [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. More frequent monitoring may be required in these patients and in those with concurrent mitral regurgitation or disease affecting other valves. All patients should undergo reevaluation whenever there is a change in clinical status. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8137.html" rel="external">
          "Pathophysiology and natural history of mitral stenosis", section on 'Rate of progression'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for monitoring is to optimize timing of mitral valve intervention. The timing of surgical or percutaneous intervention for MS is crucial for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If performed too early, the patient may be put at unnecessary risk of a procedure-related complication with little or no benefit because MS (in the absence of intervention) may remain asymptomatic and stable for many years.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Delaying intervention may cause irreversible pulmonary hypertension (PH) and/or right heart failure. Delaying intervention might also increase the risk of AF, although there are few data addressing this issue. The risk of failure to receive necessary corrective intervention was illustrated by a report that included patients in whom valve surgery was indicated but refused [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Patient survival with medical therapy was 44 percent at five years, 32 percent at 10 years, and 19 percent at 15 years.

         Monitoring and evaluation prior to and during pregnancy are discussed separately. (See

         Patients with rheumatic MS should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever. Acceptable regimens and issues related to the duration of prophylaxis are discussed separately. Regardless of whether or not prophylaxis is continued, there should always be a low threshold to test and treat these patients for acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3175.html" rel="external">
          "Acute rheumatic fever: Treatment and prevention", section on 'Secondary prevention (antibiotic prophylaxis)'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Nearly all cases of MS are the result of rheumatic involvement of the mitral valve. Although chronic degenerative changes associated with MS may represent a response to turbulent blood flow through the rheumatically deformed valve [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ], there is also evidence that repeated episodes of rheumatic carditis contribute to the natural history of MS even when no clinical signs of acute rheumatic fever have been present [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Thus, preventing repeated attacks of rheumatic fever may play a role in delaying the progression of MS.
        </p>
        <p>
         The likelihood of recurrence of rheumatic fever is correlated with a higher number of previous attacks and the presence and severity of preexisting rheumatic heart disease [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The risk for recurrence of rheumatic fever declines with increasing age and the number of years since the patient's most recent attack. Recurrences of rheumatic fever tend to mimic previous attacks for that patient, such that the absence of carditis during the initial attack usually means it will not be a feature during future attacks. However, the diagnosis of recurrent rheumatic fever may be difficult since classical criteria for first episodes may not be present. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3177.html" rel="external">
          "Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"

         As noted in the 2007 AHA guidelines on the prevention of bacterial endocarditis, only patients with the highest risk of the development of endocarditis (eg, patients with prosthetic heart valves, patients with prior endocarditis) are advised to receive antimicrobial prophylaxis [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Most patients with native valvular heart disease, including those with MS, are not included in this group and therefore do not require antimicrobial prophylaxis. (See

         Most patients with severe MS are symptomatic with exertion, leading them to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. However, all patients should be encouraged to participate in at least a low-level exercise regimen to maintain cardiovascular fitness. Patients should be informed that sudden death in MS is extremely rare, which may alleviate certain fears about exercising. Each patient's exercise tolerance will vary depending upon the severity of their disease  (

         In general, the medical management of AF for patients with MS does not significantly differ from general treatment guidelines. However, because of the exaggerated adverse hemodynamic effects caused by MS, prompt therapy is often necessary. (See

         In many patients with MS, the onset of AF contributes to the onset of symptoms. When MS is hemodynamically significant (valve area ≤1.5 cm
         <sup>

         </sup>
         ), flow across the mitral valve is maintained by two factors: adequate diastolic filling time and higher-than-normal pulmonary venous pressure. AF in patients with MS may be poorly tolerated for two reasons, with the hemodynamic consequences depending upon the severity of the stenosis:

         If AF is associated with a rapid ventricular rate, the shortened diastolic filling time causes left atrial and pulmonary pressures to rise, potentially leading to pulmonary edema. (See

         A rate control strategy is generally preferred because, based upon studies in patients with nonvalvular AF, outcomes are as good as or perhaps better than with a rhythm control strategy and, with a rhythm control strategy, long-term anticoagulation is still required in most patients and long-term rhythm control may not be feasible as MS progresses. Conversion to sinus rhythm may be necessary if heart rate cannot be adequately controlled with medications. In patients not requiring urgent cardioversion, the decision for rate control versus rhythm control is based upon multiple factors including the duration of AF, hemodynamic response to AF, symptoms, and left atrial size. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1045.html" rel="external">

         For patients in whom a rhythm control strategy is chosen, issues related to the method of restoration of sinus rhythm, anticoagulation before, during, and after cardioversion, and antiarrhythmic drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm are discussed separately. (See

         Regardless of the initial response to antiarrhythmic therapy, it may become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to maintain sinus rhythm as the severity of MS progresses. Catheter AF ablation is an option in selected patients with MS [

         The risk of thromboembolism is addressed primarily by anticoagulation in selected patients with rheumatic MS.

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Indications for antithrombotic therapy in patients with MS and AF are primarily supported by observational studies in patients with MS and extrapolation of anticoagulant trial data in patients with AF without MS. (See

         Systemic thromboembolism is a major complication of rheumatic MS and is the presenting event in some patients. Prior to widespread anticoagulant therapy and surgical treatment in patients with MS, as many as 30 percent of patients with MS experienced an embolic event during the course of the disease. The presence of AF is a risk factor for thromboembolic events in patients with MS [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>

         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>
         ]. In later prospective studies in anticoagulated patients, the risk of stroke or systemic embolism ranged from 0.4 to 4 percent per patient-year. In one series of patients with rheumatic valve disease with systemic embolic events, the incidence of recurrent embolism was 3.4 percent per patient year in those treated with anticoagulation and 9.6 percent per patient year in those not treated with anticoagulation [

         The utility of anticoagulation in patients with MS in normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement or spontaneous echocardiographic contrast but no thrombus on transesophageal echocardiography is uncertain. When embolization occurs in patients with MS who are in sinus rhythm, potential causes include transient AF and infective endocarditis. Transient subclinical AF occurs in some patients with MS, and transient AF is a predictor of stroke and systemic embolism [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Although left atrial enlargement and spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (SEC; along with AF and smaller mitral valve area) have been identified as predictors of thromboembolism in patients with MS [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,32,33
         </a>
         ], the risks and benefits of anticoagulation for left atrial enlargement or SEC in patients with MS in sinus rhythm are uncertain. SEC is a marker of blood stasis associated with decreased atrial contractile function and increased risk of left atrial thrombus in patients with MS [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,35
         </a>

         The presence of MS has potentially important implications for the perioperative management and prognosis of the patient undergoing noncardiac surgery. The prognosis is poor in patients with untreated symptomatic MS, while asymptomatic patients with MS without PH or AF may not incur excess risk with noncardiac surgical procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
         Standard indications for intervention for rheumatic MS apply prior to elective noncardiac surgery [

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The risks and benefits of proceeding with elective noncardiac surgery should be considered in asymptomatic patients with severe MS who are not candidates for PMBC (due to unfavorable valve anatomy or other contraindication). Though evidence is limited, in some cases it may be reasonable to proceed with moderate-risk elective noncardiac surgery with appropriate intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic monitoring and management in this setting.

         <strong>
          Adequate heart rate control
         </strong>
         – Tachycardia should be avoided since it shortens diastolic left ventricular filling time across the stenotic mitral valve and can result in reduced cardiac output, exacerbation of the transmitral gradient, and, potentially, pulmonary congestion. Anesthetic agents and muscle relaxants associated with decreased heart rates are preferred. Among patients with AF, the ventricular rate should be well controlled prior to elective surgery.

         <strong>
          Careful management of central blood volume
         </strong>
         – Pulmonary venous pressure (ie, pulmonary artery balloon occlusion pressure) should be monitored and maintained high enough to allow adequate cardiac output but low enough to avoid pulmonary edema. Because of the obstruction to flow from left atrium to left ventricle, any situation that increases venous return and central blood volume will lead to a rise in pulmonary pressures and congestion. As an example, the Trendelenburg position dramatically increases pulmonary blood flow and can cause overt pulmonary edema. Right heart pressure monitoring during surgery is essential to manage the volume status.

         <strong>
          Maintenance of systemic vascular resistance
         </strong>
         – MS impairs the normal compensatory response associated with a fall in blood pressure, since the stroke volume cannot be substantially increased. As a result, maintenance of systemic vascular resistance is important, since sudden drug-induced reductions in systemic vascular resistance can lead to hypotension.

          Asymptomatic severe MS
         </strong>
         – A rationale for intervention in patients with asymptomatic severe MS with pulmonary hypertension (PH) is to reduce the risks of progressive PH and combined pre- and postcapillary PH). Patients with severe MS and PH (including those with severe PH or combined pre- and postcapillary PH) generally show early clinical and hemodynamic improvement following mitral valve intervention [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41,42

          43,44
         </a>

         Evidence from randomized trials suggests that the clinical and hemodynamic results of PMBC are generally comparable with open and closed surgical mitral commissurotomy (OMC and CMC), and PMBC is associated with less procedural morbidity than mitral valve surgery. (See

Pooled estimates showed similar immediate postprocedure MVA with PMBC compared with surgery (weighted mean difference 0.15, 95% CI -0.18 to +0.48), rates of restenosis or reintervention (15 percent fewer with PMBC, 95% CI -20 to +8 percent), and MVA at 30 months. The incidence of postprocedural severe MR was only nominally higher with PMBC (3 percent more with PTMC, 95% CI -1 to +10 percent).

         Limited data are available comparing outcomes following PMBC versus surgical mitral valve replacement.

In the PMBC group, the early postprocedural success rate was 92.1 percent. While there was a higher rate of reintervention after PMBC (16.3 versus 2.4 percent), the mortality rate was higher with mitral valve replacement (0 versus 4 percent). Functional status at follow-up was similar in the two groups (NYHA class I or II in 94.5 versus 95.2 percent).

         , stage C or stage D) undergoing cardiac surgery for a concurrent condition (eg, coronary artery disease) is to avoid the risk associated with multiple cardiac interventions, particularly if required within a short period of time. The additional risk of concomitant mitral valve surgery at the time of another cardiac surgery is generally estimated to be lower than the risk of multiple separate interventions.
        </p>
        <p>
         One example may be performing concomitant mitral and tricuspid surgery in patients with severe MS and severe secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Improvement in associated secondary TR occurs in some but not all patients following successful PMBC. For patients with severe MS and severe TR, mitral valve surgery combined with tricuspid valve repair is more likely to reduce TR than PMBC alone. A retrospective study from Korea in patients with severe MS and severe TR suggested that mitral valve replacement combined with tricuspid valve repair may yield better outcomes in patients with severe MS and severe TR than PMBC [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. The study compared outcomes in 48 patients undergoing PMBC versus 44 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement combined with tricuspid valve repair. During 57 months of follow-up, two deaths occurred in each group, there were no other clinical events in the surgical group, and there were seven cases of heart failure requiring surgical intervention in the PMBC group (event rate difference was borderline significant, p = 0.05). Severe TR was improved to mild or absent TR in 98 percent of the surgery group and in 46 percent of the PMBC group.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients with severe rheumatic MS have concomitant rheumatic tricuspid valve disease (characterized by thickened retracted leaflets) causing moderate or severe TR. In such patients, PMBC will not improve TR, which is a rationale for concomitant mitral and tricuspid valve surgery in this setting.

          Definition and cause

          Role of valve centers

         – Comprehensive Valve Centers or Heart Valve Centres serve as referral centers for concentration of expertise and experience for management of rheumatic MS, particularly percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy (PMBC). (See

          General management

         – Management of rheumatic MS includes patient education regarding the need for ongoing care, periodic monitoring, rheumatic fever prophylaxis, management of heart failure, management of atrial fibrillation (AF), prevention of thromboembolism, endocarditis prophylaxis, counseling on physical activity, management of risk associated with pregnancy, management of risk of noncardiac surgery, and cardiovascular risk reduction.

          Heart failure management

         – Medical management is not a substitute for valve intervention in patients with MS and is only appropriate for stabilization purposes prior to intervention, to treat hemodynamic decompensation due to an intercurrent illness, or for persistent symptoms after intervention. (See

         – For most symptomatic patients (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II, III, or IV) with severe rheumatic MS (stage D)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97546" href="/z/d/graphic/97546.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), we recommend PMBC rather than either mitral valve surgery or no valve intervention (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ), provided the patient meets criteria for PMBC (as summarized below). For those who do not meet criteria for PMBC and are not at high surgical risk, we recommend mitral valve surgery (repair, commissurotomy, or valve replacement) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         For patients with severe symptomatic rheumatic MS who do not meet criteria for PMBC and have high surgical risk, management decisions are individualized. For patients in this category with severe symptoms (NYHA class III or IV) and less than moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and no left atrial thrombus, we suggest attempting PMBC despite unfavorable valve morphology (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Medical management or high-risk mitral valve surgery are reasonable alternatives.

          Asymptomatic severe MS (stage C)

         – For asymptomatic patients with severe MS (stage C)  (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Patients without elevated PASP or AF and those who do not meet criteria for PMBC are managed medically. An exception is patients undergoing cardiac surgery for a concurrent condition (eg, coronary artery disease). In such patients, we suggest concomitant mitral valve surgery (
