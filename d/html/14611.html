Men are sometimes reluctant to bring incontinence to the attention of their clinician. Only one in five men with symptoms is likely to seek care, and men are only half as likely as women to seek care (22 versus 45 percent, respectively), despite the availability of many types of treatments [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Urinary incontinence can limit participation in activities and lower quality of life. Men with urinary incontinence have a higher rate of depression and are more likely to decrease participation in activities (eg, decrease work hours, change employment, or take voluntary early retirement) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Some evidence suggests that urinary incontinence may have a greater emotional and social impact on quality of life for men than for women [<a href="#rid1">1,2,4</a>].</p><p>Men are more likely to experience urinary incontinence as they get older [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. In a study among community-dwelling men, the prevalence of at least one urinary incontinence episode in the preceding 12 months increased from almost 5 percent at ages 19 to 44 years, to 11.2 percent at ages 45 to 64 years, to 21 percent in men older than 65 years [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In other studies, the prevalence of urinary incontinence in men older than 65 years ranged from 11 to 34 percent, with a prevalence of daily incontinence of 2 to 11 percent [<a href="#rid5">5,8-10</a>]. The prevalence in men living in nursing homes is higher compared with those in community settings and men with urinary incontinence have a higher risk of institutionalization [<a href="#rid1">1,2,11,12</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology, causes, classification, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of urinary incontinence in men [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Urinary incontinence in women is discussed separately.

The etiologies of LUTS are discussed in detail separately.

These contractions may be due to a defect in afferent sensory signaling from the urinary tract or central processing of these signals, and/or due to detrusor muscle dysfunction  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62790" href="/z/d/graphic/62790.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H990438082"><span class="h2">Stress urinary incontinence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) occurs in the absence of a bladder contraction and is due to inadequate urethral sphincter function, either from mechanical damage to the urethral sphincter or from physiologic effects that limit sphincter function.</p><p>Causes of SUI include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prostate surgery – Prostate surgery is the most common cause of SUI.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Radical prostatectomy to treat prostate cancer can result in damage to the external urethral sphincter during surgical dissection because the sphincter is closely approximated to the prostatic apex  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54803" href="/z/d/graphic/54803.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Following radical prostatectomy, it is common for men to initially experience SUI; however, this typically improves or resolves over 6 to 12 months [<a href="#rid14">14-17</a>]. Up to 40 percent of men report some degree of long-term urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy, but for the majority of men, symptoms are mild and do not require treatment [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The rate of persistent, bothersome urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy is approximately 5 to 10 percent [<a href="#rid18">18-22</a>].

It may be seen when both the bladder and urinary sphincter have impaired function, such as in patients with neurologic disorders (eg, spina bifida, spinal cord injury) or sometimes after prostate surgery or radiation. Additionally, mixed urinary incontinence may occur when a patient with either UUI or SUI that has been stable for years has a new causative factor or medication that causes the other type of incontinence to occur.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2774816816"><span class="h2">Overflow incontinence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Overflow incontinence occurs when urine is retained in the bladder due to incomplete emptying after an attempt to urinate.

These tools may also be used to monitor treatment effectiveness [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Tools to measure treatment effectiveness'</a> below.)</p><p>Components of physical<strong> examination</strong> to evaluate urinary incontinence include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rectal examination to assess prostate size and consistency for a gross estimate of the degree of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) that could cause bladder outlet obstruction (BOO).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abdominal examination after voiding to:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Assess for a palpable bladder that may be present with incomplete emptying</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Assess for an abdominal mass that could cause pressure on the bladder</p><p></p><p>We use the same indications for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for men with incontinence as for asymptomatic men, although some clinicians may consider testing at a somewhat younger age. Benefits and risks of PSA testing should be discussed (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7567.html" rel="external">"Screening for prostate cancer", section on 'Approach to screening'</a>). In a man with incontinence, PSA may help to identify benign prostatic enlargement or prostate cancer that could affect treatment and can serve as a baseline PSA for a patient who will take a medication that alters PSA (eg, an alpha reductase inhibitor).

Some men with slowly progressive urinary retention may have minimal symptoms. These patients may report increased abdominal girth (due to the distended bladder), or vague abdominal discomfort.</p><p>Examination findings may include a palpable bladder on abdominal examination right after voiding and/or an enlarged prostate that could cause BOO.</p><p>Post-void residual (PVR) should be measured if poor bladder emptying is suspected. Ultrasound measurement is preferred over urinary catheterization, which is more uncomfortable and carries a risk of infection or urethral trauma.

As an example, trials of men with incontinence six weeks after radical prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) detected no differences in frequency or volume of urinary incontinence between men who received one-to-one pelvic floor muscle training versus control [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. In contrast, among men with incontinence for more than one year after radical prostatectomy, patients receiving eight weeks of either behavioral therapy alone (pelvic floor muscle training and bladder control strategies), or behavioral therapy plus biofeedback and pelvic floor electrical stimulation, had a 55 and 51 percent reduction, respectively, in the number of incontinence episodes compared with a 24 percent reduction in those assigned to observation [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For some men with SUI, a penile clamp to mechanically hinder involuntary passage of urine may be used, although only intermittently [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. A patient who uses a penile clamp should be ambulatory, have good bladder storage function, and be able to place and remove the clamp himself.

For men experiencing incontinence following radical prostatectomy, watchful waiting supplemented with nonpharmacologic therapy for a period of at least 6 to 12 months is generally recommended to allow for spontaneous resolution of SUI symptoms [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Selecting among these therapies depends upon the severity of the incontinence and whether the patient is healthy enough to undergo one of the surgical procedures, which have greater efficacy than the transurethral bulking agent procedure. For men who choose to have surgery for SUI, the main treatment decision is between surgical placement of a perineal sling and an artificial urinary sphincter. The choice is based on patient preference; data suggest that most men prefer a sling [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. These therapies may be trialed sequentially, as a single prior injection of bulking agents does not appear to affect the postoperative results of male perineal slings [<a href="#rid39">39</a>] or artificial urinary sphincters [<a href="#rid40">40</a>], and previous sling placement does not appear to adversely affect the outcome of artificial urinary sphincter placement [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Transurethral bulking agents</strong> – Various substances can be injected into the submucosal tissues of the urethra or bladder neck to improve SUI symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For select men with mild SUI or those who are not candidates for more invasive surgery, transurethral bulking agents may be a reasonable treatment option. The success rates in men are lower (&lt;25 percent) than those reported in women, presumably due to increased scarring at the bladder neck following prostate surgery. In men, multiple injections (up to four) are usually required to achieve satisfactory results, which generally last one year or less, at which point an additional injection is required [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. However, repeated injections of bulking agents may make other subsequent surgery more difficult.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Perineal sling</strong> – Sling techniques involving urethral repositioning have been adapted for use in men. The slings typically use synthetic mesh to mobilize and compress the urethra, likely by extending the functional length of the membranous urethra, to achieve continence. Contemporary male slings are placed transversely through the obturator foramen [<a href="#rid43">43-45</a>]. Additionally, a “quadratic” sling is available that combines transobturator fixation with an anterior prepubic component [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Slings may be preferred in men with limited manual dexterity who may have difficulty manipulating an artificial urinary sphincter or in those with more mild incontinence [<a href="#rid47">47,48</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Studies of perineal sling placement for incontinence occurring after prostate surgery showed evidence of efficacy; however, long-term data are limited. In a prospective study of 44 patients at median follow-up of two years, 55 percent had no wet pads and another 23 percent reduced the number of pads used by &gt;50 percent. Failure rate was 23 percent within six months; failure was associated with body mass index (BMI) of ≥30, prior irradiation, and prior high-intensity focused ultrasound. A retrospective study found similar results. Postoperative complications, including urinary retention, infections, and urethral erosion, occurred in 14 percent of patients and necessitated sling removal in 9 percent. The International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have concluded that evidence supports the safety and efficacy of male slings for postprostatectomy SUI [<a href="#rid36">36,49-51</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Artificial urinary sphincter</strong> – The artificial urinary sphincter is the most effective long-term treatment for men with severe SUI or with previous pelvic radiation therapy [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The artificial urinary sphincter consists of three silicone components: a cuff, a balloon reservoir, and a pump. Each of these components is attached to a length of silicone tubing and connected together during the surgical implant procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Success rates (use of ≤1 pad daily) have ranged from 59 to 90 percent at follow-up intervals ranging from one to eight years [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Patient satisfaction with this technique is high, even among men with severe SUI [<a href="#rid53">53-55</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">However, surgical revision of the artificial urinary sphincter is often required to maintain long-term continence. Surgical revision may be needed due to urethral erosion, infection, mechanical malfunction of the device (eg, leaking of fluid), or urethral atrophy. A common cause of late urethral erosion is Foley catheter trauma. Therefore, after artificial urinary sphincter placement, it is vital that urethral instrumentation be kept to a minimum, as such instrumentation may weaken the urethra at the cuff site and cause erosion of the cuff. If urethral catheterization is required, the artificial urinary sphincter must be deactivated and the smallest catheter possible (usually 12 French) should be utilized for not more than 48 hours preferably. Deactivation often requires involvement of a urologist, although teaching the patient to deactivate the device may allow the patient to take responsibility for deactivating it prior to Foley catheter placement. If urethral erosion occurs, the cuff must be surgically removed and a Foley catheter placed for a period of two weeks to allow the urethra to heal. Another cuff may then be placed at a later time. There is a risk of subsequent urethral stricture in the setting urethral erosion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Another cause of artificial urinary sphincter failure is postoperative wound infection, which occurs in &lt;3 percent of patients [<a href="#rid56">56</a>] and typically requires removal of the entire device. Artificial urinary sphincters are more likely to fail in patients with compromised urethras (from prior artificial urinary sphincter placement, radiation therapy, or urethroplasty) [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2538693781"><span class="h3">Urge urinary incontinence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For men with UUI, nonpharmacologic therapy (see <a class="local">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above) is typically used for initial management along with adjunctive measures.

A patient may have more than one type of urinary incontinence. The etiology of each type of incontinence may be multifactorial with a variety of contributing pathophysiologic mechanisms. (See <a class="local">'Causes/classifications of incontinence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History and examination</strong> – A focused history is often sufficient to identify the most probable type of urinary incontinence. Symptoms occurring with urination also help to narrow the differential diagnosis and focus the examination. Recent prostate surgery, medication changes, and comorbid neurologic disease are particularly relevant factors for determining the type of incontinence. (See <a class="local">'History and examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Identifying urgent or reversible causes</strong> – In the initial evaluation, information gathered during history and examination determines if there is an urgent concern (eg, urinary retention) or a potentially reversible cause (eg, infection, medications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101070" href="/z/d/graphic/101070.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), and others) that should be identified and addressed. (See <a class="local">'Identifying urgent or reversible causes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indications for referral</strong> – Men who should be referred to an urologist include those with concern for a urologic cancer, prior prostate or other pelvic surgery, radiation, post-void residual (PVR) &gt;200 mL, neurologic disease, recurrent urologic infections, pelvic pain, or severe incontinence with multiple pads or incontinence briefs daily. (See <a class="local">'Indications for referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Further evaluation and diagnosis</strong> – Further evaluation and diagnosis of the type of incontinence is based on the medical history and specific symptoms. This in turn will direct the most appropriate management. (See <a class="local">'Further evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A sense of urgency to urinate typically indicates UUI, which may be accompanied by other symptoms.

Symptoms of SUI include incontinence with exertion and, in severe cases, gravitation incontinence. (See <a class="local">'After prostate surgery, radiation, or urethral trauma'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Men with SUI are typically evaluated and managed by their urologist. The patients are typically treated with lifestyle interventions or pelvic floor muscle exercises; <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8484" href="/z/d/drug information/8484.html" rel="external">duloxetine</a> may be added if incontinence persists. Invasive treatments are reserved for men with SUI who do not respond to medical management. (See <a class="local">'Stress urinary incontinence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neurologic disease of the brain or spinal cord can cause urinary incontinence due to effects on the bladder and/or the urinary sphincter. (See <a class="local">'Patients with neurologic disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dribbling after completing urination (PVD) as an isolated symptom is usually idiopathic; patients can be instructed to manually "milk" the perineal urethra to expel retained urine.
