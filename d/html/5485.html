         Sexual problems are highly prevalent in females. In the United States, approximately 40 percent of females have sexual concerns, and 12 percent report distressing sexual problems [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Female sexual dysfunction takes different forms, including lack of sexual desire, impaired arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, pain with sexual activity, or a combination of these issues. Treatment must be tailored to the sexual dysfunction diagnosis or diagnoses and to underlying physical, psychological, and relationship factors.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of female sexual dysfunction will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation of female sexual dysfunction and evaluation and treatment of sexual pain disorders are discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of sexual pain and of female orgasmic disorder are also described separately. (See

         Female sexual dysfunction is multifactorial, often with several different etiologies contributing to the problem. Nonetheless, careful evaluation and use of available therapies can improve sexual function for many patients.

         </span>
         Evaluate the patient for the range of sexual issues and physical, psychological, and relationship factors associated with their concerns before starting treatment. Most patients with sexual concerns have clinical issues that impact more than one aspect of sexual function. The problem may involve more than one phase of the normal sexual response cycle (desire, arousal, orgasm), sexual pain, or a general decrease in sexual satisfaction. As an example, if a patient complains of decreased libido, a full evaluation may also reveal issues with arousal or pain. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5424.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Sexual dysfunction is defined as a sexual problem that is persistent or recurrent and causes marked personal distress or interpersonal difficulty. It must not be better accounted for by a medical or psychiatric condition (ie, anxiety and depression) or due exclusively to the direct physiologic effects of a substance or medication. Intervention is warranted when a patient presents with a distressing sexual concern, even if it does not strictly meet DSM-5 criteria.

         Assess a patient's goals prior to starting treatment, and use their goals to evaluate progress. Improvement may also be tracked using a validated sexual function questionnaire, such as the Female Sexual Distress Scale [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. This also gives the clinician the opportunity to set realistic patient expectations. While some patients may desire modest improvements in their sexual life, others may expect that treatment will allow them to achieve an ideal based on past experience or cultural or media images of sexuality.

         Patients may be hesitant to discuss sexual concerns and feel anxious or embarrassed. Reassure the patient that they are not alone, sexual problems are common in patients, and effective treatment interventions are available. Inform them that just sharing a concern and wanting improvement is a good first step.
        </p>
        <p>
         Discuss that sexual problems are usually multifactorial. Review the management plan with the patient and engage in shared decision-making. Let the patient know that most sexual issues do not have an easy or immediate treatment and that there may be a period of trial and error with management approaches before their sexual function improves.
        </p>
        <p>
         Discuss with the patient that the principal factors associated with a satisfying sex life are physical and psychological well-being and the quality of the relationship with one's partner. Therefore, measures a patient takes to improve their health and relationship will likely have a positive impact on their sex life. Lifestyle changes that increase physical and emotional well-being, reduce fatigue and stress, and strengthen the partnership often result in positive effects on sexual function.

         For patients with sexual partners, the partner must be considered in the treatment plan. This may include treatment of the partner's sexual dysfunction, if present. The clinician should also discuss with the patient involving the partner in setting common goals and expectations, improving communication, and addressing relationship issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         If relationship conflict is identified, couples counseling may be helpful. Sex therapy with a certified therapist is also an effective intervention for many patients and couples by providing education about sexuality, improving communication, and prescribing specific exercises and interventions to help couples focus on greater intimacy and pleasure. Often, a patient is satisfied with their current level of interest and response but distressed by discord stemming from discrepant levels of interest within a relationship. Let them know that that this is not their sexual problem but rather a relationship problem that is often effectively managed by couples counseling and sex therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients without a sexual partner, the clinician should address the patient's goals and concerns. For some patients, sexual function issues deter them from seeking out relationships. Other patients may be dissatisfied with their sexual function during masturbation or other partner-independent activities.

         Assess the medical history and current conditions and medications to ensure associated conditions are treated before or during sexual dysfunction therapy. Many physical and psychological conditions are associated with sexual dysfunction. Sometimes a sexual problem can be ameliorated by diagnosing and treating an underlying problem or by adjusting therapy to minimize sexual side effects. As an example, patients with depression who are experiencing low libido or anorgasmia on a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor can sometimes eliminate these side effects by switching to a different antidepressant. Treating arthritis pain, urinary incontinence, or anemia may improve sexual interest and response. In addition, identification and treatment of a substance use disorder, as well as the underlying factors that precipitated it, often results in greater sexual function and overall quality of life.

         Sexual disorders can be complex, and their treatment can be time intensive and require special expertise. With the patient's consent, communication and management decisions should be shared between the treating clinician and the patient's other health care providers (eg, cardiologist, psychiatrist, oncologist). Also, referrals to clinicians who specialize in sexual function, psychotherapists, sex therapists, and pelvic physical therapists are often needed to address specific aspects of treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment approaches may include lifestyle changes, counseling, physical therapy, or medication. We restrict use of pharmacologic therapy to patients who meet diagnostic criteria for a sexual disorder and for whom nonpharmacologic interventions have proven ineffective.

         <strong>
          Inconsistent measures to assess efficacy
         </strong>
         – Studies have used varying measures to evaluate the efficacy of sexual function interventions. One measure that can be quantified and compared among studies is an event log, which is the frequency of sexually satisfying events. However, an event log does not typically assess qualitative changes in sexual function, such as sexual interest or level of distress.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Most studies of sexual dysfunction treatment use validated questionnaire scores as an outcome measure. There are multiple questionnaires, which use different questions and scales. This makes it difficult to compare data between studies and treatments.

          Diagnoses and therapies are multifaceted
         </strong>
         – Female sexual dysfunction typically affects more than one aspect of sexuality (eg, desire, arousal), and most therapies also impact several aspects. Thus, it is not generally possible to identify an isolated sexual issue and select a therapy that specifically targets that concern.

         </span>
         Patients often have issues in more than one sexual domain (ie, desire, interest/arousal, orgasm, pain). Thus, clinicians should identify all current issues and prioritize and coordinate treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Improvement of one sexual problem may result in improvement in another. For example, successful management of sexual pain often improves sexual interest/arousal and orgasm. Thus, in a patient with postmenopausal dyspareunia and low libido, the optimal approach is to treat the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM; vulvovaginal atrophy) first and then reassess the status of sexual desire concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonpharmacologic options should be the initial treatment for most patients. All currently available pharmacologic therapies for female sexual dysfunction (except approved treatments for vulvovaginal atrophy) are of limited efficacy and associated with side effects and potential risks. As the principal predictors of sexual satisfaction are physical and psychological health and the quality of the relationship with the partner, the focus of therapy should be on interventions that optimize health, well-being, and the partner relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
         The majority of research reviewed in this section was performed in cisgender females with limited published research on treatment of sexual dysfunction in transgender and non-binary individuals. Thus, the management approaches here do not specifically address transgender individuals, though many of the approaches are likely to be applicable. The management approach also does not specifically address those in multiple partner relationships. Health care for transgender individuals is discussed separately. (See

         Psychological and relationship issues often underlie, exacerbate, or are amplified by sexual dysfunction in one or both partners. As an example, a major cause of decreased sexual desire and response is a relationship with limited communication or underlying conflict. Patients should be screened for a history of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse and intimate partner violence. (See

         Patients with sexual dysfunction and their partners will often benefit from referral to a sex and/or couples therapist.

        <p>
         Couples counselors are psychologists, social workers, or other mental health professionals who see both members of the couple. This type of counseling is effective when there is relationship conflict or limited communication.

        </p>
        <p>
         Many clinicians are uncertain of whether to refer a patient to a couples counselor or sex therapist or both; some of this is due to being uncertain about the services sex therapists provide [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In our practice, we refer to a sex therapist if the concerns are specifically related to sex. We refer to a couples counselor if the concerns are about improving communication and reducing conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sex therapy typically includes: educating patients and partners about the normal sexual response cycle, addressing cultural or religious concerns regarding sexuality, helping negotiate a mutually acceptable frequency of sexual activity when disparate levels of sexual interest are present and causing discord, and assigning specific exercises to aid many patients and couples with sexual dysfunction. They may direct patients to a wide range of helpful resources, including book lists, visual aids, and devices.
        </p>
        <p>
         Examples of a sex therapy exercise include instruction in the appropriate use of vaginal dilators, which is highly effective in treating most cases of provoked pelvic floor hypertonus (vaginismus) and dyspareunia. Another approach is sensate focus exercises to help couples increase mutual sexual pleasure, minimizing the importance of intercourse with orgasm as the principal goal of sexual encounters.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study, 65 percent of 365 couples undergoing sex therapy for a range of sexual dysfunctions described their treatment as successful [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the efficacy and high degree of safety of sex therapy, we consider consultation with a sex therapist generally to be a prerequisite to a trial of pharmacologic therapy for most patients with sexual dysfunction.

         Psychiatric disorders, especially depression and anxiety, are associated with an increased likelihood of sexual dysfunction, although the majority of patients with sexual dysfunction do not have a psychiatric diagnosis. Treatment of the underlying psychiatric problem, with appropriate medications and/or psychotherapy, can lead to an improved sexual life. Prior physical, emotional, or sexual abuse or substance use disorders also affect sexual function and may be addressed effectively in this setting. (See

         Pharmacologic treatment of psychiatric illness, particularly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), may reduce libido and impair orgasmic response. If medically appropriate, switching to

         Fatigue and stress contribute significantly to low libido and sexual problems. Treating an underlying sleep problem, adjusting work hours, and engaging assistance with childcare and household responsibilities often improve sexual function. Reducing stress through exercise, yoga, and other relaxation techniques may result in improved sexual interest and satisfaction [

         Research on sexual function consistently demonstrates increased libido and pleasure in new relationships. Although patients in existing relationships certainly should not be advised to improve their sex lives by seeking out new partners, they should be encouraged to bring novelty to their current relationships. Reading books about sexuality (both educational material and erotica), visiting a store with items designed to increase sexual pleasure, and expanding the typical sexual repertoire often increase libido and response.

         Both urinary and fecal incontinence are associated with sexual dysfunction, likely because of fear of involuntary loss of urine or stool during sexual activity. Incontinence also may be a symptom of a pelvic floor problem that is contributing to sexual pain. It is important to ask about incontinence in patients presenting with sexual concerns, as effective treatments are available. (See

         Pelvic organ prolapse may adversely affect sexual function due to embarrassment regarding a visible bulge and physical discomfort during sex resulting from sexual contact with the cervix or sensation of fullness or pressure in the vagina. Surgery and pessaries effectively treat prolapse. Pessary use may contribute to a sexual problem, as pessaries need to be removed prior to penetrative sexual activities, which can reduce spontaneity and be difficult for patients with limited mobility.

         Low libido is the most common sexual problem for females. As it is difficult for researchers to distinguish between sexual interest and arousal, the past diagnosis of sexual desire disorder has been replaced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) by sexual interest/arousal disorder. Desire for sexual activity is significantly reduced or absent, often including an absence of sexual thoughts or fantasies. Low libido affects patients of all ages, with a peak in associated distress at midlife.
        </p>
        <p>
         When relationship factors are contributing to low sexual desire, counseling the patient about changes the couple can make in their sexual relationship can lead to improvement. Discuss with the patient that sexual interest typically decreases with relationship duration, so encourage interventions that increase novelty. These may include spending a night away from home, trying a new sexual position, incorporating a device, or having sex in an unusual location or at a different time of day. Establishing a regular "date night" often improves sexual satisfaction, as couples that enjoy time together outside of the bedroom often have more pleasure in the bedroom.

         Levels of endogenous androgens do not predict sexual function for females; however, androgen therapy that increases serum concentrations to the upper limit of normal has been shown to improve female sexual function in selected populations of postmenopausal women [

Androgen treatments that increase serum concentrations to supraphysiologic levels in the low male range may significantly increase sexual desire and frequency in females but are not advised due to potential risks and side effects [

        <p>
         Discussion of androgen therapy with a patient must include a full explanation of the potential benefits and risks. Patients should understand that data on safety and efficacy are limited, including data on long-term use, or use without concomitant estrogen therapy. In addition, they must be informed that none of the commonly used androgen therapies are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating female sexual dysfunction because of limited clinical trial data, limited efficacy compared with placebo, or concerns about long-term safety. The clinician should document this discussion in the medical record.

         , but will prescribe it when greatly desired by a peri- or postmenopausal patient with low libido associated with distress who has no contraindications to testosterone therapy or identifiable etiology for sexual dysfunction and is otherwise physically and psychologically healthy. Typically, the patient has already tried other safer interventions prior to the testosterone prescription, including low-dose vaginal estrogen, relationship interventions (eg, sex therapy, date nights, use of sexual aids such as vibrators, books), and adjustment of antidepressant medication (when indicated) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. At least one visit with a sex therapist is strongly advised prior to pharmacologic treatment, as this safe and effective intervention may make pharmacologic therapy unnecessary or enhance the response to treatment. Testosterone levels should not be used in determining the etiology of a sexual problem or in assessing efficacy of treatment, as no clear association between androgen levels and sexual function has been found in several large, well-designed studies.

         therapy is the most commonly studied androgen treatment for female sexual dysfunction. The addition of testosterone to postmenopausal estrogen (with or without progestin) therapy in patients who undergo menopause naturally or as a result of oophorectomy (surgical menopause) has been shown to improve sexual function in systematic reviews of randomized trials and in most, but not all, subsequent randomized trials [

         dose of 300 mcg/day for six months is safe and effective in women who are receiving concomitant estrogen therapy. Benefits were reported for many aspects of sexuality, including desire, responsiveness, orgasm, and satisfaction. Pooled data from trials in surgically and naturally menopausal women show that, compared with those who received placebo, women who were treated with testosterone reported a small increase in sexually satisfying events (SSEs) per four weeks (an increase of 1.9 versus 0.9 events over a baseline of approximately three events) [

By contrast, results of two randomized trials reported by the manufacturer of a topical testosterone gel (LibiGel) showed no significant increase in sexual desire, the number of SSEs, or any sexual function endpoint compared with placebo, despite achieving testosterone blood levels similar to those seen in clinical trials of the testosterone patch [

         formulation currently available is topical compounded 1% testosterone cream, ointment, or gel. The patient applies approximately 0.5 grams daily to the skin of the arms, legs, or abdomen. The Global Consensus Statement on androgens for females [

         formulations include inconsistent concentrations of testosterone with variable absorption and bioavailability. Product quality and purity are a concern given limited regulatory oversight of the compounded hormone industry. Compounding pharmacies typically supply these products in a marked, needleless syringe to allow for more accurate dosing, although these controlled administration methods do not overcome the significant inconsistency in delivered dose between pharmacies or even between separate lots of product from the same pharmacy. Clinical trials have not evaluated the safety or efficacy of this product for any indication, including improvement of female sexual function. If compounded testosterone is used, the compounding pharmacy should be compliant with purity of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) to meet industry standards for quality and safety.

         Hypoestrogenism due to menopause is the main cause of GSM. Menopause may occur naturally around age 51 years or may occur earlier due to a genetic mutation, autoimmune process, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Anti-estrogen therapy, including aromatase inhibitors, results in profound estrogen deficiency and is increasingly used for estrogen-dependent tumors and even for chemoprevention. Management options for sexual pain associated with GSM include nonhormonal vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, low-dose vaginal estrogen, vaginal DHEA, and oral

          64

Although many small studies without a sham control suggested efficacy of vaginal laser for GSM, a large, randomized trial with a sham control demonstrated no benefit of three treatments of fractional microablative carbon dioxide laser on vaginal symptom severity. Given high cost, potential risk, and experimental nature of use, we do not advise laser treatment for GSM except in research studies [

         After initiating therapy for sexual dysfunction, patients should be seen for regular follow-up visits, approximately every three months, until effective interventions are identified and the sexual problem has improved. Patients may then be seen every 6 to 12 months, depending on the potential risks of the treatments selected. Patients using pharmacologic therapies will need to be monitored for drug-related risks and side effects at these visits. Treatment efficacy is best assessed by patient self-report of improvement of symptoms and achieving treatment goals.

          Clinical approach
         </strong>
         – Females who seek treatment of sexual concerns (eg, lack of sexual desire, impaired arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, pain with sexual activity) should be fully evaluated for underlying factors. Evaluation should include a physical and pelvic examination. Many patients present with multiple issues, and the etiology may be multifactorial. Medical or psychiatric conditions that may alter sexual function (eg, depression, arthritis, genitourinary syndrome of menopause [GSM], pelvic pain, anemia, sexual issues related to medications, urinary and fecal incontinence) should be assessed and treated before considering other treatments for sexual dysfunction. Relationship and partner issues should be addressed in making the management plan. (See

          Initial interventions

         – Initial treatment often includes nonpharmacologic options such as vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, lifestyle changes (eg, reducing stress and fatigue, increasing quality time with partners, bringing novelty to the sexual repertoire, improving body image), and couples and/or sex therapy.

          Pharmacologic therapy

         – Pharmacologic therapy should be restricted to patients who meet diagnostic criteria for a sexual disorder (a sexual problem that is persistent or recurrent and causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty) and who did not respond to nonpharmacologic interventions. The sexual dysfunction must not be better accounted for by a general medical or psychiatric condition (eg, anxiety and depression) or due exclusively to the direct physiologic effects of a substance or medication.

         therapy is an option for carefully selected patients. Candidates for therapy must have no contraindications to taking androgens or estrogens (as many androgens are aromatized to estrogens), be willing to accept androgenic side effects, and counseled that this therapy is not approved for females by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to a lack of long-term safety data. A commonly used preparation is compounded 1% testosterone topical cream or gel; 0.5 grams is applied daily to the skin of the arms, legs, or abdomen. Dose-adjusted topical testosterone products approved for males is another option, with an increased possibility of excessive dosing. (See

         prescribe androgen therapy. Androgen therapy does not significantly improve sexual function (eg, desire, pleasure, orgasm) and can lead to potential adverse events (eg, inadvertent exposure to a developing fetus if pregnancy occurs). (See

         is a melanocortin receptor agonist approved for the treatment of low sexual desire with associated distress in premenopausal patients. It is a subcutaneous injection used, as needed, 45 minutes prior to anticipated sexual activity. Use may increase sexual desire and sexual satisfaction. Associated nausea and vomiting may limit acceptability for some patients; hyperpigmentation, potentially permanent, occurs in 1 percent of patients. Bremelanotide may increase blood pressure and should not be used in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or known cardiovascular disease. Bremelanotide is not indicated for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal patients. (See

          Flibanserin
         </a>
         is a centrally acting serotonin receptor agonist/antagonist for treatment of low sexual desire with associated distress in premenopausal patients. Daily use results in small increases in the frequency of sexually satisfying events and sexual desire compared with placebo. The clinical role of flibanserin may be limited by the need for daily dosing, common adverse effects (eg, somnolence, dizziness), and safety concerns regarding combining flibanserin with alcohol or certain medications (eg,

          Phosphodiesterase inhibitors

         – Phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitors are ineffective for female sexual dysfunction except for patients with sexual interest/arousal or orgasm disorders associated with use of an SSRI. For patients in whom stopping the SSRI or switching to another antidepressant is not advisable, treatment with a PDE-5 inhibitor may improve sexual function; however, patients must be informed that these medications are not FDA approved for use in females.
