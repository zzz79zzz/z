Lead nephropathy is a type of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) caused by high levels of chronic lead exposure. A proximal tubulopathy/Fanconi syndrome may occur as a result of acute, severe lead poisoning and generally resolves with treatment (see <a class="local">'Pathology'</a> below and <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below). By contrast, lead-related nephrotoxicity refers to lower levels of long-term lead exposure that may contribute to the progression of CKD, regardless of CKD cause.</p><p>Features that distinguish between lead nephropathy and lead-related nephrotoxicity are outlined further below:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lead nephropathy</strong> – Lead nephropathy is characterized histologically by chronic interstitial nephritis, and is a potential complication of prolonged (ie, ≥5 years) high-level lead exposure (ie, blood lead levels persistently &gt;60 mcg/dL [2.9 micromol/L]) [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. The high level of lead exposure required to cause lead nephropathy is now rare in resource-rich countries due to occupational controls and removal of lead from paint, gasoline, and other environmental sources  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60319" href="/z/d/graphic/60319.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Patients with lead nephropathy often have extrarenal manifestations of lead toxicity. (See <a class="local">'Lead nephropathy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lead-related nephrotoxicity</strong> – Lead-related nephrotoxicity refers to lead exposure as a modifiable risk factor for the progression of CKD, and occurs at low levels of chronic exposure that may still be encountered in resource-rich countries [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In this context, lead is typically unrelated to the initial cause of kidney dysfunction, and acts as a secondary factor that accelerates CKD progression (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7181.html" rel="external">"Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease"</a>). Patients with lead-related nephrotoxicity generally do not have extrarenal manifestations of lead poisoning. (See <a class="local">'Lead-related nephrotoxicity'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2187168608"><span class="h2">Measurement of lead dose</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who have signs or symptoms of lead poisoning, blood lead levels are the primary way of measuring lead exposure and are used to guide management (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2773.html" rel="external">"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults"</a>). The major limitation of blood lead levels is that they do not accurately assess cumulative, long-term lead exposure; blood lead is a short-term measurement with a half-life of approximately 30 days that reflects both exposure from current exogenous sources and the release of endogenous lead from bone and soft-tissue stores [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p>Because of this limitation, diagnostic lead chelation can be used to assess the lead body burden in select patients with suspected lead nephropathy. Diagnostic chelation consists of measuring the amount of lead excreted in a timed urine collection after administration of calcium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). (See <a class="local">'Making the diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Other tests to assess cumulative lead exposure, such as radiograph fluorescence measurements of bone lead, are primarily used in research settings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2773.html" rel="external">"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults", section on 'Additional testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2782142275"><span class="h1">SOURCES OF LEAD EXPOSURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are a number of current sources of lead exposure, which are primarily related to occupational exposures in adults and to ingestion or inhalation of environmental lead in adults and children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62969" href="/z/d/graphic/62969.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In addition, since lead accumulates in bone, the body lead burden from past exposures also contributes to current exposure.</p><p>Exposure sources are discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a class="local">'Fanconi syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic high-level lead exposure, at blood levels &gt;60 mcg/dL, can cause a chronic interstitial nephritis that leads to a persistent and progressive reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR; ie, chronic kidney disease [CKD]). Kidney biopsy findings are nonspecific and include tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, low-level inflammatory cell infiltrates, hypertrophic arteriolar changes, and variable degrees of glomerular scarring [<a href="#rid1">1,10,11</a>].

A patient-administered questionnaire  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51152" href="/z/d/graphic/51152.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) is a useful tool to identify the need to explore specific lead sources in greater detail  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62969" href="/z/d/graphic/62969.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2773.html" rel="external">"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults", section on 'Sources of exposure'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6493.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention", section on 'Exposure'</a>.)</p><p>Patients without a history of current or past lead exposure do not require further evaluation for lead nephropathy. Patients with a history of potential or definitive lead exposure and CKD should undergo the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A thorough evaluation for other causes of CKD, since many patients with lead exposure do not have lead nephropathy.

Because blood lead levels may be less elevated if high-level lead exposure has declined or stopped, we also make every effort to obtain the results of any previous blood lead tests.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2773.html" rel="external">"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults", section on 'OSHA and other governmental lead regulations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3376254496"><span class="h3">Making the diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no definitive test for lead nephropathy, and generally accepted or validated clinical criteria to make the diagnosis do not exist. </p><p>We make the diagnosis of lead nephropathy in patients who meet all three of the following criteria:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of lead exposure with a cumulative duration ≥5 years.

In patients who are candidates for chelation-based treatment of lead nephropathy (see <a class="local">'Chelation in select patients'</a> below), we obtain a kidney biopsy. Although primarily done to assess prognosis and chronicity, kidney biopsy in this setting also allows for the definitive exclusion of other causes of CKD.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laboratory evidence of high-level, chronic lead exposure. Although multiple blood lead levels &gt;60 mcg/dL over the course of at least five years are sufficient laboratory evidence of high-level, chronic lead exposure, such data are rarely available (see <a class="local">'Measurement of lead dose'</a> above). In patients who are candidates for chelation-based treatment of lead nephropathy (see <a class="local">'Chelation in select patients'</a> below), diagnostic chelation may be used to assess chronic lead exposure. Consistent with the original studies describing lead nephropathy, we consider a urinary lead excretion &gt;600 mcg (2.9 micromol) in the 72 hours after one gram of intravenous calcium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; administered over one to two hours) to indicate a lead body burden capable of causing lead nephropathy.</p><p></p><p>Patients with CKD and a history of lead exposure who do not meet the strict criteria above for lead nephropathy are considered instead to have lead-related nephrotoxicity.

Patients with ischemic nephropathy frequently have atherosclerosis in other vascular beds, including coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial disease.

Blood lead levels determine the necessity of, and schedule for, ongoing blood lead level monitoring as well as other interventions necessary to reduce lead exposure. Except for lower thresholds for referral to a specialist in occupational and environmental medicine, blood lead level-based management to reduce lead exposure for patients with CKD is similar to that for lead exposed patients in the general population.
