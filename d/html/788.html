The lifetime probability of developing breast cancer is one in six overall (one in eight for invasive disease). It is a heterogeneous, phenotypically diverse disease composed of several biologic subtypes that have distinct behaviors and responses to therapy.</p><p>The use of adjuvant systemic therapy is responsible for much of the reduction in cause-specific mortality from breast cancer seen in almost every Western nation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Adjuvant chemotherapy refers to the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy after breast cancer surgery, administered with the goal of eradicating microscopic foci of cancer cells that, if untreated, could grow and recur as metastatic cancer. In general, similar chemotherapy regimens are used as adjuvant chemotherapy regardless as to whether tumors are estrogen (ER) or progesterone (PR) receptor positive or negative. Treatment directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is incorporated for those patients with HER2 overexpression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will discuss the role of chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of early-stage breast cancer, how to estimate the benefit and risk of chemotherapy, the indications for adjuvant chemotherapy, and the dosing and timing of treatment. Where clinical guidance is provided in this topic, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual is used  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848" href="/z/d/graphic/110848.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); however, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/800.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Adjuvant medical therapy for patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, adjuvant endocrine therapy, the treatment of male breast cancer, and breast cancer in older patients are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/779.html" rel="external">"Breast cancer in men"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/757.html" rel="external">"Overview of the approach to early breast cancer in older women"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85677.html" rel="external">"Treatment protocols for breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Other topics on the management of non-metastatic breast cancer are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/737.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115555550"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to use adjuvant chemotherapy takes into account tumor histology, expression of estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone (PR) receptors, tumor stage and grade, patient age, as well as high-risk features such as lymphovascular invasion.</p><p>Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is standard for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and either a tumor size &gt;0.5 cm or pathologically involved lymph nodes (regardless of tumor size). Indications for adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC, as well as choice between adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy, are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14227.html" rel="external">"ER/PR negative, HER2-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer", section on 'Non-metastatic disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14225.html" rel="external">"General principles of neoadjuvant management of breast cancer", section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)</p><p>Genomic analysis and benefit-risk calculators are also employed to help determine appropriate candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with ER-positive tumors. In many instances, the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy are rather modest, and patient preferences are relevant to treatment decision-making. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126631.html" rel="external">"Deciding when to use adjuvant chemotherapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>The approach towards patients who received neoadjuvant treatment is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Patients who received neoadjuvant treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H71308660"><span class="h1">EFFICACY AND SAFETY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Overall, adjuvant chemotherapy decreases risk of recurrence and improves survival, but the absolute benefits in patients with a low risk of recurrence may be small. Therefore, the decision to offer chemotherapy must take into account risk factors of the disease as well as patient age and comorbidities. (See <a class="local">'Indications for treatment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Older women'</a> below.)</p><p>The benefits and risks of chemotherapy, in general, are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126631.html" rel="external">"Deciding when to use adjuvant chemotherapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'Benefits and risks of adjuvant chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Management of toxicities related to adjuvant chemotherapy is also discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/745.html" rel="external">"Overview of side effects of chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1657040600"><span class="h2">Benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The data to support adjuvant chemotherapy (versus no treatment) and specifically, the administration of anthracycline and taxane therapy in the adjuvant setting come from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). The EBCTCG performs a meta-analysis every five years to review the data on adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>In the 2012 EBCTCG meta-analysis, the use of an anthracycline-containing regimen compared with no treatment resulted in the following outcomes [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased risk of recurrence from 47 to 39 percent (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.68-0.79)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased breast cancer mortality from 36 to 29 percent (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72-0.85)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased overall mortality from 40 to 35 percent (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78-0.91)</p><p></p><p>Compared with no treatment, the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (CMF) was also associated with comparable improvement in these outcomes at 10 years. A comparison of CMF and anthracycline-containing regimens is described below. (See <a class="local">'Rationale for anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>The meta-analyses from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group have been very influential in helping clinicians and patients understand the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy including the assessment of specific agents and treatment regimens. However, many clinicians will look to outcomes in specific randomized trials that have addressed treatment selection factors, chemotherapy agents, and chemotherapy schedules, when discussing the role of chemotherapy in the management of a specific patient, as these trials often describe the individual patient experience with more specificity. For that reason, guidance for whether or not to recommend chemotherapy, or which chemotherapy regimens, may differ from findings of the overview.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H449989167"><span class="h2">Risks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risks of chemotherapy include acute toxicities including nausea, vomiting, hair loss, myelosuppression, early (though not sustained) cognitive impairment [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], and amenorrhea. Immunosuppression associated with chemotherapy may also lead to severe infections in some. Taxanes are associated with neuropathy, which generally resolves weeks to months after treatment, but may be incomplete in severe cases. Longer-term toxicities also include the risks of cardiotoxicity associated with anthracyclines and the rare risk of chemotherapy-related leukemia [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90854.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107443.html" rel="external">"Risk and prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2836.html" rel="external">"Overview of neurologic complications of conventional non-platinum cancer chemotherapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/745.html" rel="external">"Overview of side effects of chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16347.html" rel="external">"Cognitive function after cancer and cancer treatment", section on 'Breast cancer'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H545726104"><span class="h1">REGIMEN SELECTION AND ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31949206"><span class="h2">Choosing a regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The choice of an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen depends both on baseline characteristics of the patient as well as the breast cancer. Considerations are discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H375568735"><span class="h3">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no single worldwide standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of breast cancer, and the preferred regimens vary by prescribing clinician, institution, and/or geographic region. The following outlines our approach:</p><p>For most patients in whom chemotherapy is recommended, we prefer <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/z/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> (AC) followed by <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> (T), otherwise referred to as AC-T, administered on a dose-dense schedule  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55933" href="/z/d/graphic/55933.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Rationale for anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>Further details for those with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14227.html" rel="external">"ER/PR negative, HER2-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer", section on 'Chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Although no regimen has proven to be superior to AC-T, non-anthracycline-based regimens may be an appropriate strategy for certain groups of patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with lower-risk disease (eg, those with node-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer or node-negative, hormone receptor-negative breast cancer &lt;1 cm) for whom chemotherapy is indicated. (See <a class="local">'Acceptable alternatives to anthracycline-based treatment'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with a history of cardiac disease. Given that anthracyclines can promote cardiotoxicity, patients with a history of heart failure or other heart disease may benefit from a non-anthracycline-containing regimen instead of an anthracycline-based therapy. (See <a class="local">'Acceptable alternatives to anthracycline-based treatment'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Advanced age and chest wall radiation are additional risk factors for anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity, and patients should be counseled about the risks and benefits of treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90854.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107443.html" rel="external">"Risk and prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients unwilling to accept the risks of anthracycline-based therapy. The risks of congestive heart failure or leukemia, which occur in approximately 1 percent of patients treated on anthracyclines, may be unacceptable to some patients and may be avoided with certain non-anthracycline-based regimens. (See <a class="local">'Acceptable alternatives to anthracycline-based treatment'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>In such patients for whom anthracyclines are not an appropriate choice, we treat with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> (TC). (See <a class="local">'Acceptable alternatives to anthracycline-based treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>We generally offer taxane-based treatment to patients receiving adjuvant therapy. However, taxane therapy usually requires supportive care with some form of steroid treatment to prevent allergic reactions and other side effects of therapy. For patients in whom steroid treatment or risk of peripheral neuropathy is a particular concern, and where there are concerns about anthracycline exposure, we occasionally recommend <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (CMF) rather than an anthracycline- or taxane-containing regimen. (See <a class="local">'Acceptable alternatives to anthracycline-based treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1657040606"><span class="h3">Rationale for anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The AC-T regimen delivered on a dose-dense schedule is the preferred regimen for most patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55933" href="/z/d/graphic/55933.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), with anthracyclines and taxanes administered sequentially. For patients with lower-risk disease or a history of cardiac disease, non-anthracycline regimens may be preferable. (See <a class="local">'Acceptable alternatives to anthracycline-based treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Benefit of anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimens compared with CMF</strong> – The rationale for utilizing this regimen is based on evidence demonstrating that an anthracycline-containing regimen is at least equivalent to the historical standard regimen CMF and that the addition of taxane to an anthracycline-based regimen further improves outcomes. These data come from the 2012 Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis, which suggested that anthracycline-based regimens had similar or better outcomes relative to CMF, historically a standard treatment [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The meta-analysis compared the use of CMF with the use of various doses of anthracyclines, defined as either "standard" doses (eg, for four cycles, to a cumulative dose of 240 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/z/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a>) or higher doses (ie, for more than four cycles, to cumulative dose &gt;240 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of doxorubicin) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In over 5000 women, the use of anthracyclines administered at "standard" doses, when compared with CMF, was associated with similar recurrence risk (41 versus 42 percent), breast cancer mortality (32 versus 33 percent), and overall mortality (33 versus 35 percent) at 10 years. Patients receiving higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines had marginal improvements in these measures compared with CMF.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Benefit of anthracyclines</strong> – In<strong> </strong>a separate EBCTCG meta-analysis, among 15 trials in over 18,000 women, a taxane regimen with an anthracycline reduced recurrence rates compared with a taxane regimen without an anthracycline (relative risk [RR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.93) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

However, obesity itself is not an indication for chemotherapy in the absence of other indications (see <a class="local">'Indications for treatment'</a> above). If chemotherapy is indicated, we suggest that standard, weight-based drug doses be administered to all patients regardless of body mass index (BMI), despite the expected high doses thus required. This is consistent with clinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

In the largest study to demonstrate this association, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) examined the relationship between obesity and survival outcomes using information from three randomized trials evaluating adjuvant therapy regimens in breast cancer patients, ECOG 1199, 1158, and 3189 [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. After adjustment for prognostic factors (including age, race, menopausal status, tumor stage, and type of surgery), obesity was associated with inferior DFS (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06-1.46) and OS (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.13-1.67) among women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, but not among women with TNBC or HER2-positive disease.
