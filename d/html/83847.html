         Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is the most common of the clinically indolent NHLs defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in years. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4716.html" rel="external">
          "Classification of hematopoietic neoplasms"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of FL depends on the stage of disease at presentation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479" href="/z/d/graphic/97479.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Patients with stage I disease are candidates for radiation therapy (RT), which achieves prolonged progression-free survival in a percentage of patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with stage III or IV disease (sometimes called "advanced stage") are not cured with conventional therapies. Treatment of this group is more akin to the long-term management of a chronic disease with a focus on symptom control. Most patients with stage III or IV FL will receive a number of different treatment modalities (eg, immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, RT) in various combinations, often separated by several years without active therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of patients with stage II FL is more variable. In the majority of patients, we typically offer treatment similar to that used for stage III or IV FL, while other clinicians offer treatment similar to that used for stage I FL. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4741.html" rel="external">
          "Initial treatment of stage I follicular lymphoma", section on 'Stage II FL'
         </a>
         and
         <a class="local">
          'Stage II FL'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment also depends on the histologic grade of the tumor as determined by the number of centroblasts per high power field. The recommendations presented here pertain to patients with histologic grade 1, 2, or 3a FL; patients with grade 3b FL are treated with regimens used for other clinically aggressive lymphomas (eg, diffuse large B cell lymphoma). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Grade 3 FL'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial treatment of stage II, III, or IV FL is discussed here. The initial treatment of stage I FL and the management of relapsed or refractory FL are presented separately, as are the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and pathobiology of FL.

         The pretreatment evaluation for patients with stage II, III, or IV FL is similar to that of patients with stage I FL. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See

         </span>
         Patients with stage II, III, or IV FL are usually not cured with conventional treatment. While remissions can be attained, repeated relapses are common. Treatment focuses on the alleviation of symptoms, reversal of cytopenias, and improvement of quality of life. While not curative, modern therapy that incorporates anti-CD20 antibodies prolongs survival. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Immunotherapy-based treatment'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         While modern chemoimmunotherapy regimens are often given with the goal of achieving a complete response, a sizeable minority of patients treated with these regimens will attain only a partial response. Some of these patients will achieve a complete response if additional therapy (eg, maintenance) is administered. In addition, for this group as a whole, some interventions, such as maintenance therapy and the use of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="91388" href="/z/d/drug information/91388.html" rel="external">
          obinutuzumab
         </a>
         , prolong progression-free survival but have not demonstrated an improvement in overall survival.
        </p>
        <p>
         A decision regarding these treatment options must take into account the individual patient's goals of therapy, values, and preferences. Individuals differ in the value they place on the avoidance of toxicity and the delay of further anti-lymphoma treatment. Different patients who are equally informed of these risks and benefits are likely to make different treatment decisions. (See

         At the time of diagnosis, the vast majority of patients with FL will have stage II (11 to 16 percent), stage III (22 to 33 percent), or stage IV (26 to 40 percent) disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479" href="/z/d/graphic/97479.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2

         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. However, FL is a heterogeneous disease and some patients have a more rapid progression and shorter survival [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. While prognostic tools such as the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ) can be used to identify populations at higher risk of progression, better methods are needed to determine risk for the individual patient. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4699.html" rel="external">

         Our approach to patients with stage III or IV FL depends on the histologic grade, presence of symptoms or organ dysfunction, and disease tempo  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115334" href="/z/d/graphic/115334.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). This approach is generally consistent with that of major guidelines, including those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and the British Society for Haematology [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8
         </a>
         ]. The management of stage II FL is more variable. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Stage II FL'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of patients with stage III or IV FL varies widely [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,9
         </a>
         ]. Whenever available, patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. Asymptomatic patients can be observed initially. Once therapy is indicated, immunotherapy-based treatment (eg, anti-CD20 antibody plus chemotherapy or anti-CD20 mAb alone) is preferred because it results in superior response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Single-agent
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">
          rituximab
         </a>
         may be considered for patients with comorbid conditions that make them poor candidates for chemotherapy. Single-agent rituximab is also a reasonable alternative for those with a low tumor burden and/or disease that progresses slowly over years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Local low dose radiation (eg, total dose of 4 Gy) is reserved for the palliation of locally symptomatic disease. (See

         Patients with asymptomatic, stable stage III or IV FL do not require immediate treatment but should be followed closely. The disease course is variable with some patients demonstrating stable disease for years and others progressing more rapidly. Rarely, patients may have spontaneous remissions lasting longer than one year [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. While we typically also defer therapy in patients with asymptomatic stage II FL, other clinicians may offer radiation therapy to a subset of these patients in which the disease can be encompassed by a reasonable radiation field. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Stage II FL'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians differ in the criteria that they use to initiate treatment. The two most commonly used systems are those proposed by the Groupe d-Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>

         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Our approach, described below, incorporates factors of each.

         These criteria are used as general indications for therapy because treatment of these factors is thought to improve quality of life. These are similar to the indications for therapy used in the trials comparing observation with initial therapy described in the following section and most of the trials of chemotherapy for stage III or IV disease. Importantly, while indications for treatment, it is uncommon for autoimmune hemolytic anemia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia to be due to FL. An evaluation for other causes of autoimmune cytopenia should be performed prior to initiating therapy for this indication alone.

         For asymptomatic, stable patients with stage II, III, or IV FL, we suggest initial observation. This preference is largely based on the prospective trials that have demonstrated no difference in OS with deferred therapy and the avoidance of cost, complications, and potential drug resistance. Patients seeking immediate treatment may reasonably choose initial therapy with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">

         Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are asymptomatic from their lymphoma might benefit from an initial trial of treatment directed at the HCV. (See

        <p>
         We follow asymptomatic patients in clinic every three months for the first year and then every three to six months thereafter until progressive disease is noted. At these appointments we perform a history, physical examination, and laboratory studies including a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Imaging studies are repeated only if clinically indicated. Progressive disease is identified by an enlarging liver, spleen, or lymph node mass or by the development of new lesions, signs, or symptoms  (

         Histologic transformation (HT) of FL to a more aggressive lymphoma variant such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs regardless of whether FL is treated aggressively or conservatively, at a rate of approximately 2 percent per year [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ], depending on the magnitude of the large cell component. HT should be suspected if there is a rapid progression of lymphadenopathy, infiltration of extranodal sites, the development of systemic symptoms, or an elevated serum LDH. Biopsy of a suspicious area is indicated in such circumstances. In addition, we have a low threshold for obtaining a biopsy for all patients with FL at the time of progression. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4724.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Several randomized trials comparing chemotherapy regimens of different intensities with a watch-and-wait strategy followed by chemotherapy at the time of progression support the use of an initial period of observation for asymptomatic patients with low volume disease [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12,17-21
         </a>
         ]. This approach does not jeopardize survival, and a prolonged treatment-free period may decrease the potential for drug resistance by avoiding exposure of the tumor to chemotherapy.

Some contributors routinely use maintenance therapy while others do not. Maintenance therapy prolongs PFS; there is no OS benefit and no change in transformation rate. Patients and clinicians who place a high value on prolonged PFS may reasonably choose a strategy that incorporates maintenance with the understanding that toxicity will be increased.

         Six cycles of BR was compared with six cycles of standard R-CHOP in a randomized, phase 3 trial (StiL trial) of 514 patients with stage II to IV follicular, indolent, and mantle cell lymphoma, and showed superior median PFS (69.5 versus 31.2 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.74) with less toxicity, including lower rates of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (29 versus 69 percent) and leukocytopenia (37 versus 72 percent), fewer infectious episodes (37 versus 50 percent), less paresthesia (7 versus 29 percent), less stomatitis (6 versus 19 percent), and no alopecia [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

        <p>
         In the international phase 3 BRIGHT trial, 447 previously untreated patients with follicular, indolent, or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) were randomly assigned to six cycles of BR versus R-CHOP or R-CVP (as determined by the investigator prior to randomization) [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38-40
         </a>

BR was associated with higher rates of vomiting, drug hypersensitivity, and secondary malignancies, and lower rates of peripheral neuropathy/paresthesia and alopecia. The use of prophylactic antiemetics was not specified in the protocol and was more common among patients assigned to R-CHOP. BR improved PFS (66 versus 56 percent at five years; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.85) for the group as a whole. While this finding lost statistical significance when the patients with MCL were removed from the analysis (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49-1.01), the suggested benefit would be clinically meaningful if true.

         (4 percent) than CHOP (2 percent) or CVP (2 percent). However, these data are complicated to interpret since the backbone chemotherapy was not randomly assigned and the analysis was not adjusted for baseline patient characteristics, which varied among the groups. The difference in fatal adverse event rates by chemotherapy backbone was most prominent among patients over age 70 years in whom rates were numerically higher with bendamustine than with CHOP (16 of 119, 13 percent versus 1 of 55, 2 percent). The majority of deaths in those receiving a bendamustine backbone occurred during maintenance immunotherapy. Causes are difficult to ascertain as the number of deaths was small, although bendamustine and obinutuzumab had more deaths due to second malignancies and infection, whereas BR had more deaths due to nervous system disorders. Among patients younger than 70 years of age, fatal adverse events did not differ numerically by chemotherapy backbone.

         maintenance. It is not known whether this will translate into a survival benefit in the future, and we feel the use of either antibody is reasonable at this time. When considering the choice of anti-CD20 antibody, the potential toxicities and the value of PFS as a clinical endpoint must be interpreted within the context of the disease course. Patients with stage II to IV FL are not cured with conventional therapies. Most of these patients are managed over decades with a focus on symptom control. Active treatment may be separated by several years without active therapy and asymptomatic progression does not require immediate therapy.

         Maintenance therapy refers to the prolonged administration of agents with low toxicity profiles in an attempt to prevent progression of disease. While induction aims to achieve a complete remission, many patients only obtain a partial remission (PR). There has been an increasing interest in using anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">

          obinutuzumab
         </a>
         ) as maintenance therapy after induction in order to achieve deeper responses. Maintenance improves PFS, but has not improved OS. Even though maintenance is designed to have a low toxicity profile, some studies suggest that non-relapse mortality may be higher among patients receiving maintenance after bendamustine-based combinations. As such, a decision regarding its use in an individual patient must take into consideration both the potential benefit from attaining a deeper response and the likelihood that this patient will tolerate the prolonged therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of our contributors offer maintenance therapy, while others do not. Clinicians who choose to administer maintenance should use one of the established regimens, such as that used in the PRIMA study (

         <a href="#rid59">
          59,60

         ]; as such, maintenance should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         exceed two years. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies also impose a risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation among patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). (See

A similarly high rate of fatal adverse events (5 percent) was seen in a small phase 2 trial of BR followed by

         The role of radiation therapy (RT) in stage III to IV FL is limited to the use of local palliative radiation for the treatment of locally symptomatic disease. Consolidation RT given after chemotherapy does not appear to improve outcomes and may result in second malignancies. Some experts offer RT to selected patients with stage II FL. (See

        <p>
         Studies have failed to demonstrate improvements in relapse-free survival or OS when RT is added to conventional chemotherapy. Although myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute leukemia are uncommonly seen in patients with indolent lymphomas treated with chemotherapy alone, a 15-year cumulative incidence of MDS and secondary acute leukemia of 17 percent has been reported for the combination of low dose total lymphoid irradiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid80">

         For patients with previously untreated FL who require therapy, we recommend treatment with an immunotherapy-based regimen alone rather than an immunotherapy-based regimen followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Outside of a clinical trial, HCT is reserved for patients with relapsed or refractory FL or for those with histologic transformation to a more aggressive histology. (See

         FL tumors are graded on a scale from 1 to 3 according to the number of centroblasts per high powered field. Those with &gt;15 centroblasts per high-power field are categorized as grade 3. Grade 3 FL is subdivided into grade 3a, in which centrocytes are present, and grade 3b, in which there are solid sheets of centroblasts [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91
         </a>
         ]. Although controversial, differences in molecular genetics as well as clinical behavior suggest that FL grade 3a is an indolent disease and 3b a more aggressive one [
         <a href="#rid42">

        <p>
         FL grade 3b is often referred to as follicular large cell lymphoma. In contrast to lower grade FLs, this histologic variant has a lesser tendency to involve the bone marrow or peripheral blood and often presents with larger lymphoid masses. Although the follicular architecture is preserved, the clinical presentation, behavior, and outcome with treatment more closely approximates that of DLBCL.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with grade 3b FL commonly present with a more clinically aggressive course, which may resemble histologic transformation. If histologic transformation is suspected, repeat biopsy is indicated. (See

         Stage II FL is defined as FL in two or more nodal groups on the same side of the diaphragm with or without limited contiguous extranodal involvement  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479" href="/z/d/graphic/97479.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). For patients with stage II FL, we prefer a management approach similar to that used for stage III or IV FL. Other clinicians offer radiation therapy (RT) to a subset of these patients in which the disease can be encompassed by a reasonable radiation field (eg, stage II disease with groin and ipsilateral iliac involvement). Details regarding the use of RT are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4741.html" rel="external">
          "Initial treatment of stage I follicular lymphoma", section on 'Radiation therapy (RT)'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with stage II FL have been included in most studies of RT in FL. Studies using contemporary radiation practices suggest that patients with stage II FL are unlikely to be cured with RT [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96,97
         </a>
         ]. As an example, an international multicenter retrospective study evaluated the outcomes of 512 patients with stage I or II FL who underwent RT administered with curative intent [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ]. The percentage of patients free from progression at five years was lower among those with stage II disease (49 versus 74 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subset analyses of trials of RT for stage I or II FL have also identified tumor bulk as a marker of worse outcome following RT alone. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 237 patients with stage I or II FL treated with RT with curative intent, rates of progression-free survival at 10 years decreased with increasing tumor volume (77, 50, and 28 percent for patients with completely excised, &lt;5 cm lesions, and ≥5 cm lesions, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid98">
          98
         </a>
         ]. However, rates of overall survival at 10 years did not differ with tumor volume (76, 62, and 78 percent, respectively). It is unknown whether increasing therapy intensity for patients with bulky disease would improve outcomes in this population.

         – Stage III and IV FL are not curable, and most patients with asymptomatic disease may defer therapy. Patients seeking immediate treatment may reasonably choose

          rituximab

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         While we typically also defer therapy in patients with asymptomatic stage II FL, other clinicians may offer radiation therapy (RT) to a subset of these patients with disease that can be encompassed by a reasonable radiation field. (See

          Selection of initial therapy
         </strong>
         – For patients with previously untreated stage II to IV FL who require therapy, we recommend treatment that incorporates an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">
          rituximab

          obinutuzumab
         </a>
         ) rather than chemotherapy alone or hematopoietic cell transplantation (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">
          Grade 1A
         </a>
         ). A choice among regimens depends on patient characteristics and physician comfort  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). While we generally prefer rituximab-based combinations, obinutuzumab-based regimens are an acceptable alternative and may be preferred by patients who are willing to tolerate increased toxicity and place a high value on improved progression-free survival (PFS). (See
         <a class="local">

         For most patients, we suggest bendamustine-based regimens (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9323" href="/z/d/drug information/9323.html" rel="external">
          bendamustine

          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). This preference is based on the similar efficacy and less toxicity when compared with R-CHOP. Considering the increased deaths seen in patients &gt;70 years treated with BR, we modify the treatment plan for these patients by lowering the dose of bendamustine, limiting the number of cycles, or offering an alternative chemotherapy backbone. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Bendamustine plus rituximab'

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Some contributors use maintenance therapy while others do not. Maintenance prolongs PFS; there is no clear OS benefit or change in transformation rate. Some studies suggest that non-relapse mortality may be higher among patients receiving maintenance after bendamustine-based combinations. Patients and clinicians who place a high value on prolonged PFS may reasonably choose a strategy that incorporates maintenance with the understanding that toxicity will be increased. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         When administering maintenance, it is important to use one of the established regimens, such as that used in the GALLIUM study or PRIMA study (

         There is a paucity of data regarding the use of BR in patients with the more aggressive histologic grade 3a disease; R-CHOP may be preferred in this setting for fit patients with clinically aggressive disease. (See
