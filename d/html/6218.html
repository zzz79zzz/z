Seizure is primarily a clinical diagnosis, and accurate diagnosis requires differentiating seizure from other common clinical events that can mimic seizure.</p><p></p><p>If seizure is diagnosed:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is the episode an acute symptomatic seizure (ie, a provoked seizure caused by a fever, an acute brain insult, or a metabolic derangement), which generally implies a lower risk for future epilepsy compared with unprovoked seizures?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alternatively, is the episode an unprovoked seizure (due to a preexisting brain lesion or progressive nervous system disorder or an unknown etiology), which generally implies a higher risk of future epilepsy compared with acute symptomatic seizures?</p><p></p><p>If seizure or epilepsy is diagnosed:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What is the type of seizure/epilepsy (eg, focal, generalized, combined generalized and focal, or unknown)?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do the clinical features, signs and symptoms, and electrographic pattern suggest an epilepsy syndrome?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What is the most likely etiology (eg, genetic, structural, metabolic, immune, infectious, or unknown)?</p><p></p><p>The accurate diagnosis and classification of seizures and epilepsy provides important information to guide therapy and inform prognosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2783450752"><span class="h1">INITIAL ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of the history are to characterize the event as a seizure and rule out alternative diagnoses, determine whether similar events have happened in the past, and evaluate for underlying risk factors for seizures in the past medical history, family history, and medications. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3586087191"><span class="h3">Importance of detailed history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most children with epilepsy have an idiopathic disorder with a normal neurologic examination and neuroimaging studies. Thus, a careful history is the cornerstones of an accurate diagnosis. A detailed account of the child's behavior preceding, during, and following a "spell" is critical. This account may require a follow-up visit with witnesses or a phone call to individuals, such as a teacher, who actually saw the "seizure." The clinician should remember to include the child in the conversation; quite often the child provides valuable information. </p><p>The clinician should not accept a previous diagnosis of "epilepsy" without taking the child's history. Witnesses should be asked to describe the event in degree of severity (ie, the mildest to the most severe). Often the large seizures (ie, generalized tonic-clonic) are preceded by the identical symptoms that occur in the minor ones, confirming the suspicion of a focal seizure with secondary generalization. However, some children have two or more seizure types. The brief focal signs or aura prior to the more dramatic event, or the important localizing symptoms following the seizure, may be missed in a cursory history. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure may be preceded by brief twitching of one side of the face and followed by a transient language disorder consistent with a dysphasia, supporting the diagnosis of a focal seizure arising in the dominant hemisphere, with secondary generalization.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h3">Setting in which episodes occur</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most seizures occur at random and without warning. By contrast, many nonepileptic spells have characteristic precipitating circumstances or occur in specific locations. Determining the time of day and the activity in which the child was engaged prior to the seizure is important.</p><p>Important questions to consider include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Were the seizures primarily nocturnal and, if so, what time of the night did they occur?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Was the child taking medication (prescription and over-the-counter) or herbal substances prior to the seizure? Several herbal supplements, including St. John's wort, Ma huang, and kava, have caused seizures [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Did the seizures occur only with illness and fever? Seizures occurring in the setting of fever alone may represent febrile seizures, rather than epilepsy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6183.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and evaluation of febrile seizures"</a>.) Febrile seizures occur in children between the ages of six months and five years, with the majority occurring in children between 12 and 18 months of age. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Did the seizure occur in the setting of other acute medical events (eg, acute head injury, other acute medical illness)? Such seizures may be provoked and at lower risk of recurrence than unprovoked seizures. As an example, in one observational study of 117 children with a first seizure, seizure in the setting of acute gastroenteritis had a particularly low risk of seizure recurrence compared with other children with a first seizure (11 versus 40 percent, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Did the seizures occur only when the child was relaxed and never occur when actively involved in some type of activity? (More likely nonseizure events.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Behavior immediately prior to the event</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>On rare occasions, seizures may be precipitated by environmental stimuli such as sound or an unexpected touch (reflex epilepsy). More commonly, no obvious precipitating circumstances are present. Thus, obtaining a history of the events leading up to the seizure is important because they may be more suggestive of a nonseizure diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Important questions to consider include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do the episodes always occur when the child is upset and crying (cyanotic breath-holding spells); only after a minor blow to the head or upper torso (pallid infantile syncope); only in the classroom and never seen by the parents or caregivers (staring episodes are commonly seen in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder); or always when standing and preceded by nausea and dizziness (simple vasovagal syncope)? (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6155.html" rel="external">"Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What activity was the patient engaged in immediately prior to the event? Does the patient mention any sensory or autonomic symptoms (numbness, visual distortions, auditory or visual hallucinations or illusions, nausea or unusual feelings in the abdomen or chest, an unusual smell or taste, etc) or manifest an alteration in behavior or mood? Preceding symptoms suggestive of seizure include auditory or visual hallucinations, experiential feelings like déjà vu or jamais vu, and strange smells or tastes. Symptoms suggestive of orthostatic intolerance leading to syncope include nausea, lightheadedness, dizziness, and loss of vision ("blackout").</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Did a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or headache occur before or after the event? Headaches are common after a generalized convulsive seizure but are infrequent before a seizure [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Nausea and vomiting more often are seen in association with a migraine syndrome, which can mimic a seizure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6155.html" rel="external">"Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are the events precipitated by a particular stimulus? Seizures are rarely precipitated by mild trauma. Pallid infantile syncope is a common benign pediatric syndrome characterized by sudden transient bradycardia followed by an anoxic seizure (with pallor) and spontaneous recovery that are precipitated by a mild unexpected blow to the head and upper torso. It is caused by excessive vagal tone and is of unknown etiology. Pointed questioning may be necessary to uncover the history of mild trauma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6155.html" rel="external">"Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Were focal signs or symptoms present? Examples include face or extremity twitching, an illusion of a bad smell or taste, and a déjà vu experience. Some of these symptoms are considered an "aura," or a focal seizure involving subjective sensory or psychic phenomena, which may be the first clinical manifestation of the seizure. This information can be valuable for localizing the epileptic focus [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Patients may not remember these symptoms because retrograde amnesia often accompanies seizures, particularly those with generalized motor activity. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does the child predictably cry before an event? In studies of adults, weeping during an event was typical of a nonepileptic seizure [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Consistent crying before a "seizure" is suggestive of a cyanotic breath-holding spell.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Physical appearance during the event</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician should obtain a description of the patient's color during the event and determine whether anyone checked the child's heart rate or pulse. Anoxic nonepileptic seizures may be secondary to a cardiac arrhythmia. If a child has a color change during a seizure, particularly a generalized motor seizure, they usually will become cyanotic. A cardiac cause for the event should be considered if the child is described as pale. A description of forceful eye or head deviation to one side can be a useful localizing feature.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Behavior during the event</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An accurate description of behavior during the event is critical to making the diagnosis. The clinician can ask the parent or caregiver or witness to mime the event, or the clinician can mimic different kinds of seizures to find a match for the child's episodes. Often the family, caregivers, or the initial clinician involved with the child will describe the episode as simply a "grand mal" or "petit mal" seizure. Frequently, the clinician is told that the child had "staring episodes" or "fell down and shook all over." These descriptions are not adequate for arriving at a definite diagnosis.</p><p>Important questions to consider include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are limb movements unilateral, bilateral, synchronous, and clonic (rhythmic flexion movements or rhythmically interrupted tonus), or irregular and thrashing? Repeatedly and consistently stereotyped behaviors suggest seizures as compared with nonepileptic events. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bilateral motor seizures, particularly those involving all the extremities and the trunk with generalized, relatively symmetric, tonic or clonic movements, are usually associated with altered consciousness. A nonepileptic seizure should be suspected if the patient has generalized motor activity with normal responsiveness, particularly if it lasts longer than five minutes. Prolonged waxing and waning of clonic or tonic activity or stimulus-provoked clonic/tonic activity during a generalized motor seizure is more consistent with a nonepileptic seizure. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are the eyes and mouth closed? A nonepileptic seizure should be considered if the patient keeps the eyes tightly closed during the seizure and, particularly, if passive eye-opening is actively resisted [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Sustained eye deviation or nystagmoid eye movements are relatively subtle clinical manifestations of seizure activity. Patients with true generalized motor seizures tend to keep their mouths open during the tonic phase of the seizure; in generalized motor nonepileptic seizures, the mouth is partially or tightly closed (clenched).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What was the patient's response to verbal commands, pinching, or more painful stimulation? Generalized motor seizures cannot be interrupted by vocal or tactile/painful stimulation. By contrast, a patient with a nonepileptic seizure may suddenly return to normal after a painful stimulus or shouting of his or her name. However, an abrupt return to consciousness is often seen in frontal lobe seizures and should not be considered a reliable sign of nonepileptic seizures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What was the duration of the event? Most seizures are short lived; an episode of confusion or loss of contact with the environment that lasts more than five minutes should raise the suspicion of a nonepileptic event.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Behavior after the event</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Important questions to consider include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What was the patient's behavior after the event (postictal state)? Did they recover immediately, or was there confusion or somnolence? Was the child able to communicate verbally immediately after the event (eg, could the patient form appropriate and full sentences; was the child oriented; could the child follow complex or simple verbal commands)?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Were there focal findings during the postictal state, such as a hemiparesis (Todd paralysis)? These features are helpful for localization. As an example, if a child had a generalized motor seizure, but in the postictal period could not talk despite being able to follow simple commands (postictal aphasia), a focal onset in the speech area of the dominant hemisphere would be suspected.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Other elements of the history</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A developmental history should be obtained, with particular attention given to any plateau or loss of developmental milestones. In older children, a history of academic performance and social interactions are also essential parts of the history.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The examiner should search for a history of previous illnesses that are associated with seizures (eg, meningitis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, head trauma).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A detailed family history is mandatory. Consanguinity should raise a suspicion of an inherited disorder, particularly a recessively inherited inborn error of metabolism. A family history of seizures may suggest a dominantly inherited epileptic disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The teenager with seizures should be questioned about drug use. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The general history and physical examination of children with seizures includes several elements.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In addition to searching for medical causes of the patient's seizures, close attention should be paid to the eye examination. The clinician should look for congenital ocular defects, the retinal changes associated with certain neurocutaneous and neurodegenerative disorders, or signs of an earlier infection. Ophthalmology consultation should be obtained if the funduscopic examination is difficult, as in the active infant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The neurologic examination should look for evidence of findings associated with seizures, such as sustained head and eye deviation, hemispatial neglect, focal myoclonus of the face or limbs, and automatisms (repetitive stereotypic, purposeless movements including lip smacking, orofacial twitching, arm and hand movements such as picking or fidgeting)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A cardiac examination, including an electrocardiogram (ECG), is necessary if concern exists about a cardiogenic cause for the patient's episodes. Episodes of disturbed neurologic function caused by decreased cardiac output (eg, prolonged QT syndrome or pulmonary hypertension) may closely mimic focal seizures, including the presence of an aura [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1036.html" rel="external">"Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17234.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension in children: Classification, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The abdominal examination may reveal hepatosplenomegaly, suggesting a storage disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The skin examination is of particular importance in the evaluation of children with seizures, as many neurocutaneous disorders are associated with epilepsy. The cutaneous features of tuberous sclerosis, the facial angioma of Sturge-Weber syndrome, the café-au-lait spots of neurofibromatosis, the nevi of the linear nevus syndrome [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], and the swirling hypopigmentation of Ito syndrome [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] all are characteristic physical findings. Wood lamp examination to identify the hypopigmented macules (ash leaf spots) of tuberous sclerosis is an essential feature of the examination of a child with seizures. Dermatologic consultation should be considered in a child with seizures who has a skin lesion that cannot be identified easily. Most neurocutaneous disorders are hereditary and, if identified, should lead to family or caregiver counseling and possibly genetic consultation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3004.html" rel="external">"The genodermatoses: An overview", section on 'Neurocutaneous syndromes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An assessment for genetic disorders is important. Dysmorphic features and other congenital anomalies, body asymmetries, and unusual skull shapes should be noted.

A phone consultation with the electroencephalographer prior to the EEG often is helpful in planning the study.

Epileptiform activity may appear in only one state (usually sleep). Even if epileptiform activity is evident on the initial awake tracing, a sleep recording is indicated. As an example, in the benign focal epilepsies, focal or multifocal spike and slow wave discharges, which are diagnostic of these syndromes, typically appear only during drowsiness and light sleep. In these children, fragments of generalized spike and wave activity can be seen during wakefulness and may erroneously suggest a generalized epilepsy. The benign focal epilepsy syndromes may also manifest a photoparoxysmal response (epileptiform activity provoked by repetitive light flashes); however, these are more typically seen in the idiopathic generalized epilepsies.</p><p>The child should be allowed to sleep naturally in the EEG laboratory. Many laboratories use sleep deprivation by requesting that the child is kept up a significant portion of the night prior to the EEG. However, while sleep deprivation increases the likelihood of detecting epileptiform discharges, even in the absence of recording sleep, the increased yield is modest. One study found that 11 sleep-deprived EEGs would be required to identify one additional child with epileptiform discharges compared with a routine EEG [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Sleep deprivation can be a difficult task for parents and caregivers, and sleep-deprived children, particularly those with cognitive impairment or behavioral disorders, can be difficult to manage in the EEG laboratory [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].

When the EEG was repeated with sleep deprivation in 177 children with an initially normal EEG, epileptiform abnormalities were found in 61 (35 percent), increasing the yield of an abnormal test by 11 percent.</p><p>Attempts should be made to obtain the repeat EEG at a time when the child is most likely to have a seizure. As an example, the EEG should be done in the morning if seizures are occurring primarily in the morning upon awakening (as often occurs in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy).

Stereotyped, generalized interictal discharges in the setting of a normal background suggest a genetic generalized epilepsy, whereas pleomorphic, multifocal discharges on a diffusely slowed background suggest an epileptogenic encephalopathy. Focal structural epilepsies often manifest pleomorphic focal discharges and focal background slowing. By contrast, the focal discharges seen in self-limited focal epilepsies such as benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes are associated with a normal background.

Such disorders can present with a broad range of symptoms in an otherwise healthy child, including psychosis, catatonia, behavioral and memory alterations, seizures, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation.
