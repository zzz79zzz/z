This measurement is used clinically to evaluate the degree of kidney impairment, to follow the course of the disease, and to assess the response to therapy. An attempt must also be made to obtain a specific diagnosis. The first step is a careful urinalysis, looking for proteinuria, hematuria, and cellular casts. Further evaluation may include quantification of proteinuria, kidney ultrasound, referral to a nephrologist, and a kidney biopsy. Nephrology referral is especially indicated when there is a rapid decline in kidney function, an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (&gt;300 mg/g), or urinary red blood cell casts. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2359.html" rel="external">"Assessment of kidney function"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7188.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7196.html" rel="external">"Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>An overview of the general issues involved in the management of the patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including modalities to slow the rate of progression, will be presented here. The specific therapy of patients with particular kidney diseases is discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">NATURAL HISTORY OF KIDNEY DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial injury to the kidney may result in a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic hematuria to kidney failure requiring dialysis. Many individuals fully recover and subsequently suffer from little or no sequelae. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in children, for example, most frequently has a long-term benign prognosis. By comparison, some patients, such as those with lupus nephritis, experience repeated and chronic insults to the kidney, thereby resulting in lasting damage. Furthermore, others in whom the initial disease is either inactive or cured may still develop progressive kidney disease due to hemodynamic and other mechanisms.</p><p>In addition to variations in the activity of the individual diseases, these different manifestations are partly due to how the kidney responds to injury. The kidney adapts to damage by increasing the filtration rate in the undamaged nephrons, a process called adaptive hyperfiltration. As a result, the patient with mild kidney insufficiency often has a normal or near-normal serum creatinine concentration. Additional homeostatic mechanisms (most frequently occurring within the renal tubules) permit the serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorous and the total body water to also remain within the normal range, particularly among those with mild to moderate kidney disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2359.html" rel="external">"Assessment of kidney function"</a>.)</p><p>Adaptive hyperfiltration, although initially beneficial, eventually causes damage to the glomeruli of the remaining nephrons, which is manifest by proteinuria and progressive kidney failure. This process appears to be responsible for the development of kidney failure among those in whom the original illness is either inactive or cured [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Estimates of single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) in humans support hyperfiltration as a relevant pathophysiologic mechanism [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. An elevated SNGFR was associated with risk factors for progression, including obesity, a family history of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and a greater degree of glomerulosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, suggesting compensation in remaining nephrons to maintain total GFR. The institution of measures to help prevent this process, such as treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, may slow progressive disease and even preserve kidney function [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Benefit is more likely if treatment is initiated before much irreversible scarring has occurred. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7181.html" rel="external">"Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>The gradual decline in function in patients with CKD is initially asymptomatic. However, different signs and symptoms may be observed with advanced kidney failure, including volume overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, anemia, and mineral and bone disorders (MBDs). The onset of ESKD results in a constellation of signs and symptoms referred to as uremia.</p><p>Manifestations of uremia include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pericarditis, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system abnormalities (ranging from loss of concentration and lethargy to seizures, coma, and death). No direct correlation exists between the absolute serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, or GFR and the development of these symptoms. Some patients have relatively low levels of BUN (eg, 60 mg/dL [21.4 mmol/L] in an older patient) but are markedly symptomatic, while others have marked elevations (eg, 140 mg/dL [50 mmol/L]) but remain asymptomatic. To continue life, uremic patients require kidney replacement therapy with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1916.html" rel="external">"Uremic toxins"</a>.)</p><p>Not all individuals have progressive loss of kidney function. Some studies show a high rate of progression, while others report relatively stable disease [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. The rate of progression of CKD from one major stage to another varies based upon the underlying disease, presence or absence of comorbid conditions, treatments, socioeconomic status, individual genetics, ethnicity, and other factors. Episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) may cause more rapid progression to ESKD in individual patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7225.html" rel="external">"Kidney and patient outcomes after acute kidney injury in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Using epidemiologic data, general estimates for the rate of transition from an estimated GFR (eGFR) between 15 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> to end-stage disease may be approximately 1.5 percent per year, while the rate of transition from an eGFR &gt;60 to &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> is approximately 0.5 percent per year [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p>The combination of low eGFR plus dipstick-positive proteinuria is associated with a significantly increased risk of progressive kidney disease, compared with either abnormality alone. This was shown in a retrospective study of the association between these measures and the 25-year incidence of ESKD of middle-aged males originally studied in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Study (MRFIT) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The presence of 1+ dipstick proteinuria, 2+ dipstick proteinuria, eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and a low eGFR plus 2+ proteinuria was associated with hazard ratios of 3.1, 15.7, 2.4, and 41, respectively, for the development of ESKD over a 25-year period.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CKD is defined as the presence of kidney damage (usually detected as urinary albumin excretion of ≥30 mg/day or equivalent) <strong>or</strong> decreased kidney function (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) <strong>for three or more months</strong>, irrespective of the cause. The persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is necessary to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease (AKI).</p><p>Classification, or staging, of CKD helps to guide management, including stratification of risk for progression and complications of CKD. Risk stratification is used to inform appropriate treatments and the intensity of monitoring and patient education. We agree with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines that state that, among patients who are diagnosed using the criteria described above, staging of CKD should be done according to the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70597" data-inline-graphics="70597" href="/z/d/graphic/70597.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cause of disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Six categories of eGFR (G stages)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Three categories of albuminuria (A stages)</p><p></p><p>Staging patients with CKD according to cause, eGFR, and albuminuria enhances risk stratification for the major complications of CKD  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68921" href="/z/d/graphic/68921.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58089" href="/z/d/graphic/58089.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). As seen in these figures, increasing albuminuria is associated with a higher risk of adverse events at every level of eGFR.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of the definition and classification of CKD is provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16406.html" rel="external">"Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">ASSOCIATION WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, END-STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE, AND MORTALITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is a large body of evidence that patients with CKD have a substantial increase in cardiovascular risk that can be in part explained by an increase in traditional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. CKD alone is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Among patients with CKD, the risk of death, particularly due to cardiovascular disease, is much higher than the risk of eventually requiring dialysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p>The prevention and management of cardiovascular disease are critical for patients with CKD [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. As an example, the increased intake of calcium (which is commonly given to treat hyperphosphatemia and may result in a high calcium-phosphorus product) may enhance coronary arterial calcification. Although controversial, this may be associated with the development of coronary atherosclerosis and is related to the presence and/or consequences of elevated serum phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. (See <a class="local">'Mineral and bone disorders (MBD)'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7222.html" rel="external">"Vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>These and other observations have suggested that CKD should be considered a coronary equivalent and that aggressive risk factor reduction should be part of standard therapy of patients with CKD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease", section on 'CKD as a CHD risk equivalent'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease", section on 'Reduction of CHD risk in patients with CKD'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with CKD are also at increased risk for the development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) as well as all-cause mortality. The competing risks of cardiovascular and ESKD vary depending on the population of patients studied and factors such as age, proteinuria, and type of kidney disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease", section on 'Competing risks of cardiovascular and end-stage kidney disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The general management of the patient with CKD involves the following issues [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treatment of reversible causes of kidney failure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preventing or slowing the progression of kidney disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treatment of the complications of kidney failure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adjusting drug doses when appropriate for the level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification and adequate preparation of the patient in whom kidney replacement therapy will be required</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3903691109"><span class="h2">Blood pressure control</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Overall, the best evidence supports the following points (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7169.html" rel="external">"Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults", section on 'Effect of goal blood pressure on progression of CKD'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>More intensive versus less intensive blood pressure lowering reduces the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), but not in patients with nonproteinuric CKD.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>However, more intensive blood pressure lowering may reduce mortality in patients with CKD (whether they have proteinuria or not), even though there is no benefit on kidney endpoints among patients without proteinuria. The mortality benefit from aggressive blood pressure lowering is most evident when patients are followed over the long term (ie, during posttrial follow-up), although an early reduction in mortality was noted in the Systolic Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).</p><p></p><p>Hypertension is present in approximately 80 to 85 percent of patients with CKD [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Treating hypertension can slow the progression of proteinuric CKD and reduce the rate of cardiovascular complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease", section on 'Blood pressure control'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3872.html" rel="external">"Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>The choice of antihypertensive therapy in patients with nondiabetic and diabetic CKD is discussed separately.

In patients with advanced CKD and refractory edema, both loop diuretics and thiazide diuretics may be needed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3871.html" rel="external">"Thiazides versus loop diuretics in the treatment of hypertension", section on 'Patients with chronic kidney disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3872.html" rel="external">"Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2324.html" rel="external">"Causes and treatment of refractory edema in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The optimal blood pressure in hypertensive patients with CKD and its impact on the progression of CKD is presented at length elsewhere  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117101" data-inline-graphics="117101" href="/z/d/graphic/117101.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

The major factors are thought to be intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy (which are primarily responsible for the adaptive hyperfiltration described above), leading to glomerular scarring (glomerulosclerosis). Additional causes may include systemic hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic acidosis, and tubulointerstitial disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7181.html" rel="external">"Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>The major histologic manifestation of hemodynamically mediated kidney injury is secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].

This was best shown in a 2007 meta-analysis of eight studies consisting of 3220 patients in which number of days in hospital was significantly higher for late- versus early-referral patients (25 versus 14 days, respectively) [<a href="#rid76">76</a>].</p><p>Late-referral patients are also hospitalized more frequently for the initiation of dialysis [<a href="#rid76">76,81,85,86,92,102,103</a>]. These adverse associations are probably due in part to a greater prevalence of uremic complications and other serious illnesses, such as uncontrolled hypertension and pulmonary edema.

Furthermore, patients referred late are less likely to receive a kidney transplant [<a href="#rid107">107</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients referred to the nephrologist in a timely manner tend to have a functioning permanent access at the start of dialysis compared with only a small minority of late referrals [<a href="#rid84">84,85,87,88,92,108-110</a>]. One study evaluated the clinical characteristics of 139 patients who, prior to the initiation of dialysis, received medical care provided by a nephrologist or a generalist or no medical care [<a href="#rid85">85</a>]. Compared with the group cared for by generalists, patients treated by nephrologists were significantly less likely to have required a temporary venous catheter for the first dialysis (36 versus 89 percent).

The option of conservative management should also be discussed among patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo kidney replacement therapy. The 2015 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend that patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> should be educated concerning these issues [<a href="#rid126">126</a>].

The persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is necessary to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease. Classification, or staging, of CKD provides a guide to management. (See <a class="local">'Definition and classification'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications of CKD</strong> – CKD is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), infection, malignancy, and mortality. (See <a class="local">'Association with cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and mortality'</a> above and <a class="local">'Infection and vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Complications of the loss of kidney function include disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance, such as volume overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia, as well as abnormalities related to hormonal or systemic dysfunction, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hypertension, anemia, malnutrition, hyperlipidemia, and bone disease. (See <a class="local">'Treatment of the complications of severe CKD'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Overview of management</strong> – The management of CKD includes: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Treatment of reversible causes of kidney dysfunction. (See <a class="local">'Acute on chronic kidney disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Slowing the progression of kidney disease. This includes blood pressure control as well as additional therapies in patients with proteinuria, defined as measured or estimated albuminuria ≥300 mg/day or measured or estimated proteinuria ≥500 mg/day (see <a class="local">'Slowing the rate of progression'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Patients with proteinuria should be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB); this issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7169.html" rel="external">"Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults", section on 'Effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on progression of CKD'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>In addition, in patients with proteinuria, we recommend treatment with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medical management – Medical management is required for the complications of CKD (described above). (See <a class="local">'Treatment of the complications of severe CKD'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nephrology referral – Patients with CKD should be referred to a nephrologist when eGFR is &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in order to discuss and potentially plan for kidney replacement therapy. Comanagement of the patient with the primary care provider is a common strategy at early stages of CKD. The optimal medical care of later-stage CKD patients may be best provided by a team of healthcare professionals who practice at a single site (ie, a CKD clinic), following the principles of the chronic disease model of care. (See <a class="local">'Referral to nephrologists'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Planning for kidney replacement therapy – It is important to identify patients who may eventually require kidney replacement therapy since adequate preparation can decrease morbidity and perhaps mortality. Such patients should be counseled to consider the advantages and disadvantages of hemodialysis (in-center or at home), peritoneal dialysis (continuous or intermittent modalities), and kidney transplantation (living or deceased donor). The option of conservative management should also be discussed among patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo kidney replacement therapy. Early referral to a surgeon for evaluation and establishment of arteriovenous (AV) access is needed for patients choosing hemodialysis. (See <a class="local">'Preparation for and initiation of kidney replacement therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Conservative management of kidney failure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Indications for dialysis – Clinical indications to initiate dialysis in patients with CKD include (see <a class="local">'Indications for kidney replacement therapy'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1866.html" rel="external">"Indications for initiation of dialysis in chronic kidney disease"</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Pericarditis or pleuritis (urgent indication).</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Progressive uremic encephalopathy or neuropathy (urgent indication).</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>A clinically significant bleeding diathesis attributable to uremia (urgent indication).</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Fluid overload refractory to diuretics.</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hypertension poorly responsive to antihypertensive medications.</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Persistent metabolic disturbances that are refractory to medical therapy. </p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Persistent nausea and vomiting.</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Evidence of malnutrition.</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Decreased attentiveness and cognitive tasking (relative indication). </p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Depression, persistent pruritus, or the restless leg syndrome (relative indications).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Conservative kidney management – Conservative management of ESKD should be an option for all patients who decide not to pursue kidney replacement therapy. Conservative care includes the management of symptoms, advance-care planning, and provision of appropriate palliative care.
