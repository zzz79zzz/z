At the same time, there has been increasing concerns about the potential effects of these exposures on female reproductive health and the need for health professionals to play a role in preventing harmful exposures [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. A Committee Opinion by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine emphasizes the need to identify and reduce exposures to this multitude of environmental agents and to address the consequences of such exposures [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Fundamental to this process is understanding the conditions leading to exposure, interpretation of exposure markers, the scientific evidence supporting potential adverse effects, and options for exposure reduction.</p><p>This topic will focus on the reproductive impact of selected agents that are particularly timely or controversial and a clinical approach to evaluating and managing women with potential or confirmed exposures. Detailed discussions of specific exposures and approaches to poisoning in general are presented separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2773.html" rel="external">"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6491.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7179.html" rel="external">"Mercury toxicity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2778.html" rel="external">"Arsenic exposure and chronic poisoning"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/324.html" rel="external">"General approach to drug poisoning in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6496.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with occult toxic exposure"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented.

For one, there are a huge number of toxic agents and potential exposures. As of 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) listed 86,685 manufactured or processed chemical substances in its <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Ftsca-inventory&amp;token=%2B0rEyHQ1T7gRoXXx698zAjYNR4FwyhigSZ%2B1REfpDKYIzfElHlv8hdRABC74aKvR&amp;TOPIC_ID=111468" target="_blank">Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Substance Inventory</a> [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This inventory does not encompass all toxic substances, and most substances enter the marketplace with little regulatory oversight. There are over 350,000 chemicals registered and in use worldwide [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Additional challenges include the limited amount and quality of the scientific data, extrapolation of animal data to humans, timing of exposures, confounding variables, contributions of other social determinants of disease and medical illnesses, and exposures occurring as mixtures and not individual agents. These issues related to study design, assessment of exposure, and determination of the various reproductive end points and outcomes are presented in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5447.html" rel="external">"Overview of occupational and environmental risks to reproduction in females", section on 'Assessing risk'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1194268832"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the numerous potential exposures and exposure combinations, copious amounts of data of varying quality and at times conflicting in nature, and the lack of a test or proven intervention in many instances, it is unclear how best to provide meaningful information to patients and families. Professional societies emphasize the need to identify and reduce exposures to this multitude of environmental agents and address the consequences of such exposures, which may disproportionately affect vulnerable and underserved populations [<a href="#rid2">2,5,6,9</a>]. While decreased exposure seems prudent, there is a tension between educating patients with the limited available information and creating patient stress about exposures over which the patient may have little control. In the work setting, providing information about work-related exposures may actually lead to implementation of strategies to reduce or prevent potentially harmful exposures [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we have found the following actions helpful:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assess exposures</strong> – We ask patients about common exposures, particularly hazards at work, as well as metals such as lead (manufacturing and paint) and mercury (consumption of large predator fish). As time is limited during prenatal appointments and there are competing priorities, standardized printed or web-based questionnaires [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] may be useful to aid the clinician with assessment (see <a class="local">'Assessment of environmental risk'</a> below). We also advise clinicians to educate themselves about specific exposures that may be more prevalent in their geographic regions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Discuss impact of agent</strong> – For possible exposures, we discuss the potential impact of the agent on the patient, her fertility, the developing fetus, and the child. For patients with a specific known exposure, supporting written and web-based information can be helpful. (See <a class="local">'Patient brochures about toxic exposures'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Discuss preventive measures</strong> – Opportunities to discuss environmental exposure arise frequently in clinical practice and often do require a lot of time to address. Examples include providing information (verbal, printed, online) when a woman expresses desire for pregnancy or when a patient presents with a specific history or question (ie, a woman asks about exposure to lead paint during house renovation).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Provide additional resources</strong> – For patients and families with potential or confirmed exposures, we refer them to specialty providers for evaluation and/or management (ie, maternal-fetal medicine or occupational/environmental medicine specialists). In addition, we offer our patients counseling services to help them cope with the stress from the experience. Lastly, we provide them with websites that offer additional information relevant to their care. (See <a class="local">'General information'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3184453624"><span class="h1">METALS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2245606195"><span class="h2">Lead</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2294932557"><span class="h3">Exposure sources</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lead, in the form of inorganic lead, is a commonly encountered agent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62969" href="/d/graphic/62969.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Work-related exposures include storage battery manufacturing, use of pigments, soldering, welding, use or production of ammunition, construction, and painting [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Non-work exposures can come from paint dust, cookware, cosmetics, some remedies or supplements (eg, Ayurvedic medications), and, to a lesser extent, water from leaded pipes [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Detailed discussions of acute lead exposure and management in adults and children, unrelated to reproduction, are presented separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2773.html" rel="external">"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6493.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6491.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6494.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7180.html" rel="external">"Lead nephropathy and lead-related nephrotoxicity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Inorganic lead can be absorbed through the intestinal tract (ingestion) or lungs (inhalation). Organic lead, found in leaded gasoline, can also be absorbed from the skin. Once absorbed, lead is bound to red blood cells and distributed to the soft tissues, brain, and skeleton and can also cross the placenta. Although inorganic lead is excreted via the urine with a half-life of months, some of the lead remains in the bone for decades, in equilibrium with the blood, thus serving as an internal, ongoing source of lead. Conditions that promote bone turnover, such as hyperthyroidism as well as pregnancy and breastfeeding, can lead to a release of lead to the blood and to higher blood lead levels (BLL), along with release of lead into breast milk during breastfeeding [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. BLLs, therefore, reflect both current external exposures as well as past exposures from mobilization of lead previously stored in bones.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4160400989"><span class="h3">Exposure assessment</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History</strong> – The history is the key first step: Are there any current or prior sources of lead exposure  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86038" href="/d/graphic/86038.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)? A common scenario is that a person becomes pregnant and then commences with a home renovation project to make room for the new family addition. This renovation project may involve removal or disruption of painted surfaces and the consequent generation of lead dust. If the house was built before 1978, and has not been de-leaded, it is highly likely that the paint has lead. Past exposures are also important since lead may be stored in the bones, and that lead could be additionally mobilized to the blood during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which causes more bone turnover  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119274" href="/d/graphic/119274.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Biological monitoring </strong>– For patients at risk of lead exposure, lead can be reliably measured through a biological monitoring test: the venous blood lead concentration, which is reported as microgram/dL. This measurement will reflect current exposures, as well as small amounts of lead stored in bone and then released over time into the blood. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms for routine screening for elevated BLLs in asymptomatic pregnant persons, but both the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend targeted screening in pregnant and lactating women with risk factors for lead exposure, such as environmental, occupational, or pica [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2773.html" rel="external">"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults", section on 'When to measure blood lead levels'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Some research studies can test for the quantity of lead in cortical (tibia) and trabecular bone (patella) through radiograph fluorescence, which is an indication of long-term lead exposure, but this is not a test that is clinically available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Environmental sampling </strong>– Lead can also be measured in air samples or wipe samples, more commonly done in work settings.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2180005789"><span class="h3">Reproductive health impacts</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adverse pregnancy outcomes</strong> – Maternal lead exposure appears to increase the risk of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) [<a href="#rid18">18-22</a>]. One prospective study of 650 pregnant women reported the risk of spontaneous abortion increased with every 5 mcg/dL increase in BLL (range 5 to 20 mcg/dL) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Maternal BLL of ≥10 mcg/dL have been associated with reduced gestational length, increased risk for preterm birth, and SGA [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Some cross-sectional studies have suggested that blood lead is associated with increased risk of hypertensive complications of pregnancy including preeclampsia. A meta-analysis of 11 studies including over 6000 women found that blood lead concentrations in pregnant women presented an important risk factor for preeclampsia, with an increase of 1 mcg/dL associated with a 1.6 percent increase in the likelihood of preeclampsia [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6814.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Effects on offspring</strong> – Studies have reported that young children with lead exposure have reduced neurobehavioral function and IQ, with no evidence of threshold effects [<a href="#rid24">24-27</a>]. Impaired cognitive development has also been demonstrated in children even with low levels of prenatal lead exposure [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Attempts to determine the impact of timing of lead exposure during pregnancy and subsequent cognitive impairment in offspring have reported inconsistent findings, including greatest correlation with first trimester exposure [<a href="#rid29">29</a>], greatest correlation with third trimester exposure [<a href="#rid30">30</a>], and no effect [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. While mechanism of action is not fully understood, alternations in DNA methylation have been reported in children following prenatal lead exposure [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>].

Potential exposures include living in or renovating a home built before 1978, using imported pottery for cooking and eating, using Ayurvedic medication or supplements, using imported cosmetics (as those containing vermillion [sindoor]) or spices, or working in occupations with exposure. Additional discussion can be found in related content. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6493.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Test</strong> – Since many of the above risk factors may not be readily elicited, our approach is to have a very low threshold for ordering a venous blood level. The test is relatively inexpensive and could have a significant impact on the individual patient. Background blood levels for United States (2017 to 2018) adults age 20 years and older is, on average, &lt;1 mcg/dL, and the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile is approximately 2.62 mcg/dL [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].<strong> </strong>Looking at background BLL in women of childbearing age, from 1976 to 2016, there has been a downward trend. From 2011 to 2016, 0.7 percent of women of childbearing age had BLL ≥0.5 mcg/dL (representing approximately 500,000 women), with higher BLL associated with various factors [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. The usual venous BLL is not a "serum" level, which is used more for research purposes. While independent reviews by the USPSTF and ACOG concluded that data were insufficient to recommend routine universal blood lead testing of all pregnant women, ACOG advises clinicians to consider venous BLL in women with risk factors, such as those who live in housing built before 1978, have an occupational exposure (or a partner with occupational exposure), or take alternative therapies that may contain lead  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86038" href="/d/graphic/86038.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Evaluation of children with suspected lead poisoning is presented separately.

However, chelation therapy could be considered for BLL around 45 mcg/dL, and particularly at higher levels (&gt;70) where there are also health risks to the mothers [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. There are some case reports that demonstrate a lowering of BLL in the mother with chelation, but there is no definitive information on effects for the fetus.

Methyl mercury in these sources forms when inorganic mercury (as from industrial sources) enters the sea (also via air from coal-fired power plants), and sea microorganisms add a methyl group, which is ingested by fish eating smaller fish, so that it bioaccumulates among the larger predatory fish, such as tuna and swordfish, that have among the highest amounts of mercury. The mercury is present in the fish tissues and is not eliminated with cooking. The amount of methyl mercury in fish and seafood, therefore, varies, and concentrations for different fish are listed in resources such as the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Ffood%2Fmetals-and-your-food%2Fmercury-levels-commercial-fish-and-shellfish-1990-2012&amp;token=IF2fUU3GLn2TBX5oCwJicHdnbvMmguMENAUN%2FQLHerJeqv%2FYFwWZEsDHDoTfTbHKOaJZLL%2BQezEA2eD6h1VUQcXLR47EB3cb%2FnZnJt%2BslKHzm1KeI19bmfpesttn4B94&amp;TOPIC_ID=111468" target="_blank">US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) web site</a>.

Elemental mercury vaporizes at room temperature and is mainly absorbed through vapor inhalation and not by oral ingestion of the liquid. For women with mercury-containing dental amalgams, exposure could occur during chewing or teeth grinding when the element is vaporized and then inhaled. One study of pregnant women with amalgams and restorations, overall, did not report an association with negative birth outcomes [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Overall, the exposure is very small. Women should not have fillings removed just to reduce mercury exposure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Of greater concern is the potential high exposure to elemental mercury in pregnant women around or working in artisanal gold mining [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. This type of small-scale mining, usually performed by poorly educated individuals in low-resource settings, is carried out in 70 countries by approximately 10 to 15 million miners, including approximately 4 to 5 million women and children [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. The work involves crushing possible gold-containing rocks or river sediment and adding elemental mercury (usually in large quantities) to form a gold-mercury "amalgam." This mixture is then heated to vaporize the mercury, leading to air, soil, and water contaminated with mercury. Women make up to 10 to 50 percent of the small-scale mining population directly but could also be contaminated indirectly, and such a level of mercury exposure could pose a threat to a developing fetus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inorganic salts </strong>–<strong> </strong>Inorganic salts are formed when mercury combines with other elements such as sulfur or oxygen.

The test does not distinguish among the different forms of mercury. The half-life of mercury, in general, is approximately one to two months. Methyl mercury is excreted predominately through the gastrointestinal tract, and some is metabolized to the inorganic form that may then be excreted in the urine. Elemental and inorganic mercury have a much greater excretion in the urine. For screening, we order blood and spot urine mercury levels along with a urine creatinine (to correct for concentration on a spot sample). Urine mercury is reported both as mcg/L, as well as microgram per gram of creatinine. Finding the majority of mercury in the blood sample with little to none in the urine is suggestive of methyl mercury. Mercury can also be measured in hair, but a significant quantity may be required, and the result may be no more useful than a blood level given the half-life of one to two months.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H880057818"><span class="h3">Reproductive health impact</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once absorbed, all forms of mercury cross the placenta and can result in exposure to the developing fetus. Severe neurodevelopmental toxicity has been described with severe methyl mercury poisoning from consumption of fish highly contaminated with industrial mercury waste (Minamata disease) as well as from bread made from contaminated seeds [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>]. The offspring from minimally symptomatic mothers with high exposure in Minamata, Japan, gave birth to offspring with severe neurologic manifestations resembling cerebral palsy, sometimes with seizures and cognitive impairment. It is important to note that exposure levels from these industrial disasters are many times greater than from routine fish consumption (10 to 60 ppm Hg versus &lt;1 ppm).</p><p></p><p>Since these severe mercury poisoning events, subsequent studies of high fish-eating populations have examined mercury levels in pregnant women and neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring and, at times, reported conflicting results [<a href="#rid47">47,48</a>]. Studies of a population in the Faroe Islands found statistically significant effects on motor, attention, and verbal tests in neurobehavioral testing at ages 7 and 14 years after in utero exposure [<a href="#rid47">47,49</a>], whereas another study in the Seychelles Islands, a population chronically eating reef fish, did not find these effects [<a href="#rid48">48,50</a>]. To develop guidance, the US National Research Council Committee relied on data from the Faroe Islands and other data to arrive at a reference dose of 0.1 mcg Hg/kg/day for the whole population, including pregnant individuals or females of childbearing age. In addition, they utilized the lowest confidence interval of a mean cord blood mercury level associated with a statistical difference on a neurobehavioral test divided by an uncertainty factor (10) to come up with an "acceptable" level of blood mercury of 5.8 mcg/L for pregnant persons, which has also been adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. However, because of differences between maternal blood mercury and cord blood due to the bioconcentration of methyl mercury across the placenta, some propose a goal below 3.5 and 5.8 mcg/L [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

In situations in which a high level of mercury from any source is suspected, the clinician may choose to do a biological monitoring test. We advise a blood mercury, accompanied by a urine spot test for mercury, and urine creatinine (to adjust for concentration). An elevated blood mercury with much less in the urine is suggestive of methyl mercury. Interpretation and counseling regarding a test result are critical. Many fish eaters will have blood mercury levels greater than 5.8 mcg/L. The key actions are to identify the source and to decrease or eliminate the exposure. If fish is the likely source, the patient can switch to the very low mercury seafood. If the patient is preconception, advice could be given to wait until blood mercury levels decline, if elevated. As with lead, use of chelators during pregnancy is not advised unless there is evidence of very high mercury. Chelating agents also do not work well for methyl mercury and are more effective for inorganic mercury. In these situations, we advise consultation with an expert specialist.

Inorganic arsenic exists in trivalent and pentavalent forms that can be ingested, absorbed, and then metabolized by the liver to less toxic organic forms that are quickly excreted through the urine with a half-life of approximately 48 to 72 hours for the majority. Chronic exposures can also occur and, if in high enough amounts, can cause a variety of skin lesions as well as increase the risk for cancers, such as skin, lung, and bladder [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3608599239"><span class="h3">Exposure assessment</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History</strong> – We inquire about the patient's occupation, source of drinking water, diet, and use of any supplements. Drinking water, particularly from well water, is a common environmental source of arsenic.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Biological monitoring</strong> – Arsenic can be measured in the urine, usually as "total arsenic," but it is important to speciate (fractionate) the sample to measure inorganic arsenic since there are other forms of arsenic (arsenobetaine, arsenosugars) from fish, shellfish, and other foods that are of minimal to no toxicity but add to the total arsenic measured and give a false impression of the presence of toxic exposure [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Urine is generally the preferred biomarker for recent arsenic exposure because arsenic is rapidly excreted into urine and can be speciated. Although it can also be measured in blood, it is cleared quickly from this reservoir.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For screening, a spot urine sample is obtained for both urine arsenic and urine creatinine. Urine creatinine is used to adjust for urine concentration. The initial arsenic result is reported as micrograms of arsenic per liter.

Some labs will do this if an arsenic profile is ordered.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After absorption, inorganic arsenic is distributed through the body, metabolized in the liver, and accumulated in the skin, hair, and nails. Advantages of using hair for testing include that it binds the inorganic (toxic) forms, but not the seafood-derived, less toxic, organic forms, and it can reflect exposures from the past (pending the length of the hair). Disadvantages of using hair for arsenic monitoring include that it will also bind external arsenic sources, such as from air (smelter) or from bathing with arsenic-contaminated water, and thus may not reflect the true internal dose.

Inorganic arsenic can cross the placenta, so there is the potential for adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes. A meta-analysis of 16 studies found arsenic levels &gt;50 mcg arsenic/L in groundwater were associated with nearly twice the risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth (odds ratio [OR] 1.98, 95% CI 1.27-3.10 and OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.32-2.36, respectively) [<a href="#rid61">61</a>].

Thus, phthalates do not tend to accumulate in the body [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. Key metabolites include mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and 2-ethylhexanol, which are both biologically active. Metabolites can cross the placenta. Urine and serum are the preferred sources for measuring phthalates in humans, but measurement is typically limited to specific labs for biomonitoring or research purposes and not performed in clinical practice.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H326569930"><span class="h3">Impact on reproductive health</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Phthalates are considered endocrine-disrupting chemicals (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113968.html" rel="external">"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals"</a>). </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Animal data</strong> – The potential that phthalates could adversely impact reproductive health was first recognized from experimental animal studies.

Prenatal exposure among rats also has been linked with a constellation of teratogenic effects demonstrable in male rats known as the "phthalate syndrome" [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. This is characterized by a reduced anogenital distance, hypospadias, testicular malformations, and reduced semen quality bearing a striking resemblance to testicular dysgenesis among humans. It is important to emphasize that animal studies demonstrating the reproductive toxicity of phthalates used much higher phthalate concentrations than the range of typical human exposure.

Occupational exposure among agricultural workers and their families has been a concern. We focus here specifically on insecticides, as the health effects of these chemicals have been more widely studied.</p><p>Insecticides are typically classified by their mode of action and persistence in the environment. The organochlorines were the first insecticides synthesized and include compounds like dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), chlordane, and methoxychlor. Organochlorines interfere with nerve sodium channels and were widely used for insect control in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century for mosquito control but banned secondary to extensive neurotoxicity to other living organisms, not just insects. While exposure continues to this day as these chemicals persist in the environment for extended periods, there is little individuals can do to alter their own exposure. DDT is still used in some countries for control of mosquitoes in the fight against malaria [<a href="#rid114">114</a>]. Organophosphates and carbamates were introduced as alternatives to the organochlorines. While they are also neurotoxicants, their mechanism of action is through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, and they are less persistent in the environment than the organochlorines. The pyrethroids are an additional class of nonpersistent insecticide chemicals that interfere with sodium channels; these are often a component of residential pest (insect) control products. Newer insecticides include the neonicotinoids and the ryanoids.

While air quality has improved in industrialized countries as a result of legislative efforts, there is evidence that continued low-level exposure to air pollution can negatively influence health at the population level, increasing the risk for morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, both of which have the potential to negatively impact pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16307.html" rel="external">"Overview of possible risk factors for cardiovascular disease", section on 'Air pollution'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/572.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for asthma", section on 'Air pollution'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1443.html" rel="external">"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Risk factors and risk reduction", section on 'Pollution, biomass, and occupational exposures'</a>.)</p><p>There are no clinical tests to measure pollution exposure. Reducing exposure to ambient air pollution is best accomplished through policy and legislation. That said, on particularly high pollution days as defined by the air quality index, individuals could elect to stay inside and filter indoor air, although the implications of high exposures over short durations in pregnancy is not entirely understood [<a href="#rid145">145</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H985196447"><span class="h2">Reproductive impact</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The possibility that ambient air pollution might additionally affect female fertility and reproductive outcomes stems from extensive and mostly consistent literature documenting the association of cigarette smoking and environmental tobacco exposure with increases in subfertility and a host of adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, reduced birth weight, stillbirth, preterm birth, and abruption. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4803.html" rel="external">"Cigarette and tobacco products in pregnancy: Impact on pregnancy and the neonate"</a>.)</p><p>Given the overlap in constituents of tobacco smoke with air pollution, a number of epidemiologic investigations have been undertaken to evaluate the association of ambient air pollution and human reproduction. Study designs are heterogeneous and include consideration of a variety of constituents of air pollution as the exposure of interest, most commonly fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>,<sub> </sub>PM<sub>10</sub>) but also CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, PAHs, and NO<sub>2</sub>. How exposure is quantified also differs from study to study ranging from direct personal air sampling to estimations from stationary air quality monitoring sites coupled with geospatial information on an individual.</p><p>Despite the heterogeneity of study designs, several systematic reviews summarizing the body of evidence with respect to reproductive health and air pollution have demonstrated increases in the risks for preterm birth, miscarriage and stillbirth, low birth weight, decrements in birth weight, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [<a href="#rid146">146-152</a>]. The association with preterm birth has been less consistent in studies. That said, even when associations were significant, estimates were typically modest (odds ratio &lt;1.3). Such modest association nevertheless can have a significant impact at the population level. There are emerging data suggestive that pre- and early childhood exposure to ambient air pollution may increase the risk for autism spectrum disorders with ongoing confirmatory studies underway [<a href="#rid153">153</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3621386788"><span class="h2">Carbon monoxide poisoning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In contrast to CO present in ambient air pollution, high levels of CO can accumulate in a dwelling due to incomplete combustion of an energy source (like a gas furnace) with inadequate ventilation. CO binds more tightly to hemoglobin than to oxygen (approximately 200 times) and is bound even more tightly to fetal hemoglobin. CO crosses the placenta, and given the relative affinity of fetal hemoglobin for CO compared with adult hemoglobin, CO can accumulate in the fetus and take longer to clear than in the adult. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment may need to be extended in the setting of CO poisoning in pregnancy to accomplish fetal CO elimination [<a href="#rid154">154</a>]. The presentation, diagnosis, and management of patients with CO poisoning is discussed in detail separately.

Elevated arsenic levels in drinking water have been associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and the potential for future increased risks for some cancers. (See <a class="local">'Arsenic'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Plastics (including phthalates and phenols)</strong> – Plastics, including phthalates and phenols (eg, bisphenol A) are synthetic chemicals used extensively in a diverse array of industrial and consumer applications, typically used as a plasticizers or solvents. These agents are considered endocrine disrupting chemicals, and initial studies suggest that they negatively impact fertility, reproductive outcomes, and development. (See <a class="local">'Plastics'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Synthetic flame retardants</strong> – Synthetic flame retardants have been applied widely to textiles, furnishing, upholstery, carpets, electronics, and construction materials. There are hundreds of distinct flame retardants with differing chemical structures used over the past 40 years. While animal research suggests that some can cause reproductive and neurodevelopmental toxicity as well as other adverse nonreproductive effects, human data are limited. (See <a class="local">'Flame retardants'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pesticides</strong> – Pesticides include insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Organochlorines, the first insecticides synthesized, include dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), chlordane, and methoxychlor. Organochlorines interfere with nerve sodium channels and were widely used for mosquito control but subsequently banned secondary to extensive neurotoxicity to other living organisms, not just insects. There is animal and epidemiologic evidence that non-DDT insecticides adversely impact neurodevelopment. Negative reproductive effects include lower birth weight and gestational age at delivery as well as male subfertility. (See <a class="local">'Pesticides'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)</strong> – Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also called PFCs, are used in nonstick cookware, carpet, stain resistant treatments for clothing, AFFF fire-fighting foam, nonstick packaging, and various industrial processes. Significant exposures have been identified in contaminated drinking water sources. Initial studies have suggested an association between elevated maternal blood and cord blood concentrations of PFAS (primarily perfluorooctane sulfonate [PFOS] and perfluorooctanoate [PFOA]) and decreased birth weight. More studies are ongoing. (See <a class="local">'Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Air pollution</strong> – There is evidence that continued low-level exposure to air pollution can negatively influence health at the population level by increasing the risk for morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Several systematic reviews assessing reproductive health and air pollution have demonstrated increases in the risk for stillbirth, low birth weight, and decrements in birth weight with increasing exposure. (See <a class="local">'Air pollution'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Woodruff TJ, Zota AR, Schwartz JM.
