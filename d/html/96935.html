         The evaluation of illness in returned travelers should focus on the possible infections given the patient's clinical findings, travel geography, administration (if any) of vaccinations and malaria chemoprophylaxis, the nature and timeframe of potential exposure(s), and the incubation period(s) of the relevant possible infections  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75701" href="/z/d/graphic/75701.html" rel="external">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Good resources that provide current information about the infections that occur in various geographic areas are essential [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website includes an online version of Health Information for International Travel under Travelers' Health and updates on travel-related infections [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The World Health Organization website also has regularly updated information about outbreaks.

         General medical information (including vaccination history, past medical history, and medications) – If malaria chemoprophylaxis was taken, the clinician should inquire as to the drug, the dose, the intervals between doses, and the duration of therapy prior to arrival and following departure from the transmission area.

         Physical findings that signal severe illness warranting prompt intervention include hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress, hemorrhagic manifestations, and neurologic findings such as confusion, lethargy, stiff neck, or focal deficits. The physical examination should also include evaluation for skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, retinal or conjunctival changes, enlargement of liver or spleen, genital lesions, and neurologic findings.

         The initial laboratory evaluation for travelers with fever should include complete blood count and differential, liver enzymes, blood cultures and blood smears, and/or rapid diagnostic test for malaria (if there was exposure to an area with malaria transmission). Additional studies depend upon exposures and other factors  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with exposure to an area with malaria transmission should have diagnostic tests performed promptly (on the day of the encounter). Because parasites may be sequestered in the deep vasculature in patients with falciparum malaria, few parasites may be visible on a peripheral smear even in severe infection. Therefore, if the initial smear is negative, additional smears should be evaluated over the subsequent 24 to 72 hours. Rapid diagnostic tests should be used if available. (See

         Individuals with fever after travel in a malarious zone should undergo evaluation for malaria, regardless of prophylaxis status. The likelihood of protection against malaria is very high if prophylaxis is taken correctly, but the efficacy is not 100 percent. Furthermore, some travelers may fail to take malaria prophylaxis correctly.

         Malaria is characterized by fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, myalgia, and anemia. Any patient with fever who has spent time in a region where malaria is endemic should be evaluated for malaria, even if afebrile at the time of evaluation  (

         Malaria is transmitted by
         <em>
          Anopheles
         </em>
         mosquitoes. Malaria due to
         <em>
          Plasmodium falciparum
         </em>
         usually manifests within 90 days of exposure (most frequently in the first month after exposure,) but should be considered even if exposure occurred more than 90 days previously. Malaria due to non-falciparum species may have an incubation period of weeks or months, including up to one to two years after exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of malaria is established by rapid antigen testing or by visualization of parasites on peripheral smear; evaluation of the smear is important for species confirmation and assessment of parasitemia. (See

         serotype Paratyphi A, B, and C worldwide). Enteric fever is characterized by abdominal pain, fever, and chills. Classic manifestations include relative bradycardia, pulse-temperature dissociation, and "rose spots" (faint salmon-colored macules on the trunk and abdomen). Hepatosplenomegaly, intestinal bleeding, and perforation may occur, leading to secondary bacteremia and peritonitis. The disease occurs worldwide, with parts of South Asia having among the highest incidence globally. Transmission is fecal-oral; the incubation period is 6 to 30 days. The diagnosis is established via culture. (See

         infection include right upper quadrant discomfort, malaise, and weight loss. The infection is transmitted via ingestion of a tapeworm whose life cycle includes a definitive host (usually dogs) and an intermediate host (such as sheep). Infection occurs in South and Central America, the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, western China, the former Soviet Union, South Asia, and some sub-Saharan African countries. Onset of clinical manifestations typically occurs decades following infection. The diagnosis is typically established by ultrasound imaging in combination with serologic testing.

Hemorrhagic manifestations and thrombocytopenia can also occur. A macular or maculopapular rash occurs in approximately half of cases. The virus is transmitted by

         Scrub typhus is transmitted by mites and occurs in rural areas with scrub vegetation but has also been acquired in urban or periurban areas. Scrub typhus may begin insidiously with headache, anorexia, and malaise, or start abruptly with chills and fever. As the illness evolves most patients develop high fever, worsening of headache severity, and myalgias. An eschar or rash may develop in a subset of patients. The diagnosis is established by serology.

         (rare) – Pneumonic plague is characterized by sudden onset of dyspnea, high fever, pleuritic chest pain, and cough that may be accompanied by bloody sputum. Pneumonic plague can be primary (eg, acquired by inhalation of respiratory secretions or aerosolized droplets from infected animals or humans or by laboratory exposure) or secondary (eg, developing in the setting of bubonic or septicemic plague). The disease occurs in the southwestern United States, the former Soviet Union, and foci in Africa, Asia, and South America. The incubation period is two to eight days; the diagnosis is established by isolation of the organism in culture, serologic testing, or rapid testing in some circumstances. (See

         The most commonly diagnosed illness in individuals seeking care after travel to South Asia are diarrhea and intestinal infection, enteric fever, arboviruses (including dengue), and tuberculosis; less common illnesses include malaria, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and melioidosis  (

         Any patient with fever who has spent time in a region where malaria is endemic should be evaluated for malaria, even if afebrile at the time of evaluation  (
