Some patients may have neurologic abnormalities, mild renal insufficiency, and/or low-grade fever. We divide TTP into immune (autoimmune, acquired) and hereditary syndromes, which are due to an autoantibody against ADAMTS13 and biallelic <em>ADAMTS13</em> gene variants, respectively.</p><p>This topic reviews our approach to the initial therapy of immune TTP, defined by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity level usually &lt;10 percent).

They differ in their mechanisms of action, short- and long-term efficacy, risks, burdens, and costs. When deciding on the use of these treatments, we risk-stratify patients based on clinical and laboratory findings at presentation. (See <a class="local">'PLASMIC score to quantify a presumptive diagnosis of TTP'</a> below and <a class="local">'Incorporating results of ADAMTS13 testing'</a> below.) </p><p>Virtually every decision point in the therapy of TTP is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory features, and the best choice involves a risk-benefit analysis for the individual patient, as illustrated in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef120708" href="/z/d/graphic/120708.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Early involvement of the consulting clinician with expertise in managing TTP is advised.</p><p>We do not use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8836" href="/z/d/drug information/8836.html" rel="external">eculizumab</a> for treatment of TTP.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2088336063"><span class="h2">PLASMIC score to quantify a presumptive diagnosis of TTP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The PLASMIC score is used to quantify the likelihood of TTP, which may support initiation of presumptive treatment before ADAMTS13 activity is available.</p><p>The PLASMIC score assigns points for a number of positive and negative clinical features (thrombocytopenia; hemolytic anemia; lack of cancer, macrocytosis, coagulopathy, or renal failure) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/116626.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>).</p><p>We make a presumptive diagnosis of TTP when the PLASMIC score is in the intermediate to high range (5 to 7 points) or if there are other reasons to have a high suspicion of immune TTP. A presumptive diagnosis is sufficient to initiate treatment while awaiting confirmatory ADAMTS13 testing, as discussed below (see <a class="local">'Plasma exchange for all patients with a presumptive diagnosis of TTP'</a> below). The use of the PLASMIC score in the presumptive diagnosis of TTP is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1338.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of immune TTP", section on 'Presumptive diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H718631999"><span class="h2">Incorporating results of ADAMTS13 testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TTP is initially a clinical diagnosis that is confirmed by a subsequent finding of severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity. (See <a class="local">'PLASMIC score to quantify a presumptive diagnosis of TTP'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1331.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)", section on 'Deficient ADAMTS13 activity'</a>.)</p><p>Few institutions have immediate access to the results of ADAMTS13 activity testing; in many institutions, this is a send-out test with a turnaround time of up to a week, although this may change as the potential benefits of rapid turnaround time for this testing become more apparent (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1338.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of immune TTP", section on 'ADAMTS13 testing'</a>). If ADAMTS13 activity results are not rapidly available, therapy is initiated and continued based on the clinical diagnosis, with results of ADAMTS13 activity incorporated when they do become available.</p><p>For those who have immediate access to ADAMTS13 activity, this may be incorporated into initial decision-making. In such cases, activity &lt;10 percent, indicative of severe deficiency, can provide confidence in the diagnosis of TTP  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef120708" href="/z/d/graphic/120708.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>ADAMTS13 measurements have some sources of error (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1338.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of immune TTP", section on 'Assay considerations'</a>), but we generally use the following interpretations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ADAMTS13 &lt;10 percent</strong> – If the ADAMTS13 activity is &lt;10 percent, this constitutes severe deficiency and confirms the clinical diagnosis of TTP.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ADAMTS13 10 to 20 percent</strong> – If the ADAMTS13 activity is between 10 and 20 percent, this may support the diagnosis of TTP in some individuals (eg, those for whom TPE was already ongoing when the ADAMTS13 test was sent), and we continue TPE along with other therapies. However, we also search more aggressively for other causes of the patient's presenting symptoms and laboratory findings in these individuals. (See <a class="local">'Ongoing search for other causes of MAHA and thrombocytopenia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ADAMTS13 &gt;20 percent</strong> – If the ADAMTS13 activity is &gt;20 percent, the diagnosis of TTP becomes very unlikely, and it is often appropriate to discontinue TTP therapy, unless the clinical features are especially compelling for the diagnosis of TTP [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Alternative diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>There are rare exceptions, in which patients with severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity can have an alternative etiology for thrombocytopenia and MAHA. We have seen 5 patients in whom ADAMTS13 activity was &lt;10 percent but clinical features suggested an alternative diagnosis that was subsequently confirmed [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Alternatively, some patients with TTP may have initial ADAMTS13 activity measurements of 10 to 20 percent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. A unique patient had ADAMTS13 activity of 53 percent at presentation; his ADAMTS13 activity was &lt;10 percent when subsequent relapses occurred [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This may represent dissociation of the inhibitory autoantibody from ADAMTS13 during the incubation for the assay.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3327378312"><span class="h2">Plasma exchange for all patients with a presumptive diagnosis of TTP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) remains the mainstay of treatment for TTP [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. All patients with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of TTP and/or a confirmed diagnosis based on severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity are treated with TPE until their platelet count recovers or until an alternate diagnosis is established. (See <a class="local">'Therapeutic plasma exchange'</a> below.)</p><p>TPE is used for all patients because, if <strong>untreated</strong>, TTP typically follows a progressive course in which neurologic deterioration, cardiac ischemia, irreversible renal failure, and death are common [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Supporting evidence for TPE is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Evidence for efficacy of TPE'</a> below.)</p><p>Although TPE can be life-saving, the decision to initiate TPE can be challenging because it is a clinical decision that synthesizes clinical and laboratory features; results of ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor testing often are not immediately available. Even when ADAMTS13 results become available, they cannot be used in isolation because they are not sufficiently sensitive or specific for diagnosis of an acute TTP episode.</p><p>TPE also carries substantial risks, and its use requires the mobilization of individuals with expertise in managing the procedure and operating the apheresis equipment. In some cases, transfer of the patient to another facility may be required. Plasma infusion may be used as a temporizing measure while arranging for TPE, especially if the patient requires transfer to another facility and can be treated with plasma prior to transport, but it is not an alternative to TPE and should not delay initiation of TPE. (See <a class="local">'TPE complications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Plasma infusion as a temporizing measure'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2455898134"><span class="h2">Medical therapies (glucocorticoids, rituximab, caplacizumab)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We generally make decisions about medical therapy based on clinical features quantified in the PLASMIC score, since ADAMTS13 activity may not be immediately available. </p><p>In centers with access to very rapid turnaround of ADAMTS13 results (hours), it may be reasonable to wait to start these therapies until severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (typically &lt;10 percent) is documented.
