(See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H546190780"><span class="h1">GLOMERULAR ANATOMY AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The glomerulus is the basic filtering unit of the kidney  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113970" href="/z/d/graphic/113970.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Each glomerulus is essentially a tuft of capillaries formed by the branching of the afferent arteriole and supported by a structural matrix called the mesangium, which is maintained by specialized mesangial cells. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) provides both a size- and charge-selective barrier to the passage of circulating macromolecules from the plasma  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50018" href="/z/d/graphic/50018.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). On the urinary side of the GBM is a lining composed of a layer of podocytes, which are specialized epithelial cells possessing a specialized intercellular junction, the slit diaphragm. The slit diaphragm provides another barrier to the filtration of plasma macromolecules. The glomerular capillary tufts are surrounded by the Bowman's capsule, a single layer of parietal epithelial cells forming a cup-like sac that is continuous with the renal tubule, and into which the filtrate from the glomerular capillaries is collected and passed to the renal tubule [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>On a pathological basis, glomerular lesions can be diffuse (all glomeruli are involved) or focal (only some glomeruli are involved [typically less than 50 percent]). At the level of the individual glomerulus, a process is global if the whole glomerular tuft is involved or segmental if only a portion is involved (less than 50 percent). Histologic descriptions include the terms "proliferative" (an increase in the number of cells in the glomerulus), "sclerosing" (presence of scarring), and "necrotizing" (areas of cell death). Proliferation may occur predominantly in the mesangium (mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis), within the capillary wall (endocapillary hypercellularity), and in an extracapillary location. Extracapillary proliferation (also known as crescents) are lesions associated with accumulations of macrophages, fibroblasts, proliferating epithelial cells, and fibrin within Bowman's space and represent rupture of the glomerular membrane, signifying severe injury to the glomerular capillary wall. Some examples of how this terminology is used include "focal and segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis" and "diffuse global proliferative glomerulonephritis"  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80304" href="/z/d/graphic/80304.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Lastly, interstitial fibrosis, which accompanies uncontrolled glomerular disease, is a poor prognostic sign [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Several mechanisms lead to glomerular dysfunction [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Podocyte dysfunction can occur in genetic disease, affecting key podocyte and basement membrane proteins such as collagen IV mutations in Alport syndrome. In diseases such as minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), putative circulating factors are thought to directly affect podocyte function and lead to proteinuria [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In diabetes mellitus and amyloidosis, there is mechanical disruption of the glomerulus due to accumulation of normal or abnormal protein both in the capillary loops of the glomerulus and the mesangium. Immune mechanisms include in situ formation of immune complexes in membranous glomerulopathy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] or the localized effects of anti-GBM antibodies in Goodpasture's disease; in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, immune-mediated kidney injury is caused by deposition of circulating immune complexes [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Lastly, activated neutrophils and macrophages could directly injure the glomerulus in diseases such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3068.html" rel="external">"Mechanisms of immune injury of the glomerulus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3069.html" rel="external">"Mechanisms of glomerular crescent formation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1292164380"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF GLOMERULAR DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical manifestations associated with glomerular disease include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hematuria and/or proteinuria</strong> – Glomerular disease should be suspected when hematuria and/or proteinuria are seen on urinalysis. Glomerular hematuria is established by the presence of urinary red blood cell (RBC) casts (of any number) or hematuria in which a substantial proportion of RBCs are acanthocytes  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef130438" href="/z/d/graphic/130438.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although interstitial and vascular disorders of the kidney may also cause these abnormalities (and therefore mimic glomerular disease), the findings of dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts in the urine sediment and/or nephrotic-range proteinuria (ie, more than 3 to 3.5 g/day of proteinuria) are more specific for a glomerular origin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7196.html" rel="external">"Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Kidney function impairment</strong> – Patients with acute onset of nephrotic syndrome do not typically present with acute kidney injury (AKI). However, AKI may be seen at the time of presentation in patients with podocytopathies such as minimal change disease or primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3113.html" rel="external">"Overview of the classification and treatment of rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with chronic glomerular diseases may develop a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate and chronic kidney disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypertension</strong> – Acute onset of hypertension in someone with previously normal blood pressure or acute worsening of hypertension in someone with preexisting, controlled hypertension should raise suspicion for glomerular disease, particularly if other manifestations (eg, hematuria, edema) are also present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Edema</strong> – The presence of peripheral and/or periorbital edema in patients with hematuria or proteinuria may be a sign of primary renal sodium retention as a result of glomerular disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypercoagulability</strong> – Some types of glomerular disease, in particular membranous nephropathy or, less commonly, other causes of nephrotic syndrome, may produce a hypercoagulable state.

Thus, in patients with suspected glomerular disease, the history, examination, and initial laboratory studies should include evaluation for a systemic disorder, as examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Constitutional – Fevers, chills, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Eye – Retinitis or uveitis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ear, nose, and throat – Epistaxis, sinusitis, oral ulcers</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cardiovascular – Murmurs, pain (pericarditis), or heart failure</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lungs – Hemoptysis, infiltrates, or nodules</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Abdomen – Enteritis, colitis, or pancreatitis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nervous system – Seizures or peripheral neuropathy</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Extremities – Digital ischemia or infarction</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Skin – Purpura or rash</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Musculoskeletal – Arthritis, arthralgias, myalgias</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infections – Particularly evidence of <em>Staphylococcus</em>, <em>Streptococcus</em>, hepatitis virus, or HIV, syphilis</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2078002735"><span class="h1">EVALUATION AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF MAJOR GLOMERULAR PRESENTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Glomerular disease syndromes are typically classified based upon the pattern of urinary abnormalities, the existence of systemic features, and the degree of kidney dysfunction  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113287" href="/z/d/graphic/113287.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The nephrotic syndrome and glomerulonephritis are the prototypical presentations of glomerular disease. In the nephrotic syndrome, leakage of plasma proteins without inflammation is the primary pathogenic mechanism. Conversely, in glomerulonephritis, inflammation within the glomerulus leads not only to the passage of plasma proteins but also of inflammatory cells (leukocytes) and RBCs into the renal tubule. These classifications, however, are <strong>not</strong> exclusive, as some conditions may present with both patterns, and some disorders (eg, lupus nephritis) may progress from one pattern to the other. In addition, patients may present with mild manifestations such as isolated proteinuria or isolated hematuria.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4248130478"><span class="h2">Proteinuria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Proteinuria may be caused by glomerular disease (in which there is albuminuria) or other disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef85791" href="/z/d/graphic/85791.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3101.html" rel="external">"Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults", section on 'Types of proteinuria'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Proteinuria due to glomerular disease (in which there is albuminuria) is identified on a urine dipstick or with a quantitative measurement of urine albumin excretion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Proteinuria that is not due to glomerular disease may be due to one of three mechanisms:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tubular proteinuria, in which low-molecular-weight proteins that are filtered across the glomerulus are incompletely reabsorbed by the renal tubule</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Overflow proteinuria, in which overproduction of low-molecular-weight proteins (eg, light chains in the patients with multiple myeloma) leads to an increase in filtration and excretion</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Postrenal proteinuria, which is typically associated with a urinary tract infection and leukocyturia</p><p></p><p>Proteinuria discovered by a semiquantitative urine dipstick typically reflects glomerular proteinuria because the dipstick is insensitive to nonalbumin proteins. However, if proteinuria is discovered by a quantitative test for urinary protein (ie, a 24-hour urine collection or a random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio), the origin of the proteinuria can be determined with a dipstick, a quantification of urine albumin excretion (ie, a 24-hour urine collection or a random urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio), or with a urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation.
