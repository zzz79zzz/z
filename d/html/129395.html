         Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is a well-validated and increasingly utilized noninvasive test for the assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) in appropriately selected patients with suspected acute or chronic coronary syndromes. In addition to detecting CAD, CCTA is an excellent method to exclude angiographically significant coronary stenoses.

        <p>
         This topic will discuss the clinical role for CCTA in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute or chronic coronary syndromes. Discussions regarding coronary calcium scoring and other methods for evaluations of suspected CAD are presented separately.

         CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) may be helpful in patients who have undergone invasive coronary angiography without invasive FFR and are found to have coronary lesions of intermediate angiographic severity (some experts define this as 50 to 70 percent, whereas others define it as 40 to 70 percent) in segments &gt;2 mm in diameter when such information is likely to change clinical management.

         Although screening asymptomatic adults with CCTA frequently detects asymptomatic CAD, among 9533 patients ≥40 years of age, 46 percent had some plaque, 10 percent had “extensive” plaque (involving at least one-third of the coronary segments), and 10 percent had obstructive (≥50 percent stenosis) CAD. The presence of both extensive (regardless of stenosis) and obstructive CAD is independently related to future cardiovascular events (relative risk of myocardial infarction 8.28 [CI 3.75-18.32] and 9.19 [95% CI 4.49-18.11]). We do not recommend CCTA as a screening test in asymptomatic people, as coronary artery calcium scoring may be similarly predictive in asymptomatic patients, preventive measures in these patients have uncertain efficacy, the cost of widespread screening is significant, and due to the potential adverse effects such as radiation and incidental extracardiac findings [

         </span>
         CCTA (≥64-slice) is highly accurate for the diagnosis of obstructive CAD using invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the reference standard.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the VERDICT trial, 1023 patients presenting with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome had CCTA performed prior to invasive coronary angiography in order to exclude coronary artery stenosis ≥50 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The population was high risk; 24 percent had known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 43 percent had GRACE score &gt;140, and 78 percent had elevated cardiac troponins. CCTA had good diagnostic performance with a negative predictive value of 90.9 percent (95% CI 86.8-94.1 percent), positive predictive value of 87.9 percent (95% CI 85.3-90.1 percent), sensitivity 96.5 percent (95% CI 94.9-97.8 percent), and specificity of 72.4 percent (95% CI 67.2-77.1 percent) of obstructive CAD.
        </p>
        <p>
         The strength of CCTA relative to other noninvasive tests for CAD is its high sensitivity for anatomic and functionally significant CAD, defined by ICA and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR), respectively. Similar to invasive angiography, CCTA has modest specificity for identifying flow-limiting coronary artery lesions as defined by invasive FFR. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1514.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In a 2018 meta-analysis involving nine studies and 2078 patients who underwent both CCTA and invasive quantitative coronary angiography, the sensitivity and specificity of the former for ≥50 percent stenosis using ICA as the standard were 97 percent (95% CI 93-99 percent) and 78 percent (95% CI 67-86 percent), respectively [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Using invasive FFR ≤0.80 (seven studies, 1049 patients) rather than percent-diameter stenosis as the reference standard, CCTA was found to have sensitivity and specificity of 93 percent (95% CI 89-96 percent) and 53 percent (95% CI 37-68 percent), respectively. These findings were similar to a more recent study with over 1000 patients presenting with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors that may negatively impact the accuracy of CCTA include image artifacts resulting from coronary artery calcification, arrhythmias, or patient and/or coronary motion, as well as increased image noise due to obesity. Providers should attempt to adhere to Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography CCTA performance guidelines to ensure optimal patient selection and preparation (eg, heart rate control, breath hold practice) and CT image acquisition techniques to ensure diagnostic image quality while simultaneously minimizing patient radiation exposure [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Patients with known significant coronary calcification (ie, dense, multiple segments), inability to tolerate heart-rate-lowering medications (eg, beta blocker), advanced renal disease, concerns about radiation exposure (see
         <a class="local">
          'Procedural risks'
         </a>
         below), or allergy to iodinated contrast are not appropriate candidates for coronary CTA.

         As a purely anatomical test, standard CCTA has only modest specificity for the detection of lesions found to be physiologically significant by abnormal invasive FFR (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1514.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements"
         </a>
         ). Estimates of invasive FFR based on proprietary computational fluid dynamic modeling applied to static coronary angiograms are commercially available. There have been multiple studies assessing the accuracy of CT-FFR as compared with invasive FFR. Most were performed in high-risk patients clinically referred for ICA and demonstrate that CT-FFR improves the specificity of CCTA for prediction of invasive FFR when utilized for the assessment of lesions of intermediate stenosis severity [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In the PACIFIC trial sub-study, investigators assessed high-risk patients undergoing ICA and found CT-FFR to be the most accurate modality for the discrimination of functionally significant CAD (invasive FFR &lt;0.80) compared with CCTA, single photon emission CT (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET) alone [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for identification of functionally significant lesions was 0.94 versus CCTA (0.83, p&lt;0.01), SPECT (0.70, p&lt;0.01), and PET (0.87, p&lt;0.01). However, this study excluded 25 percent of patients who underwent CCTA who did not have adequate image quality for accurate CT-FFR analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The accuracy of CT-FFR compared with invasive FFR may be lower in patients with CT-FFR values between 0.70 and 0.80 (so called "gray zone") [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The technique is not well-validated for the assessment of left main CAD or for patients with three-vessel CAD, particularly when involving total occlusions in the coronary vascular tree. Additionally, CT-FFR may overestimate lesion physiologic significance if CT-FFR values are taken from distal coronary segments well beyond (&gt;2 cm distal to) the lesion in question. Finally, CT-FFR requires high image quality and may not be feasible in studies with significant misalignment or motion artifacts.

         Major potential complications of the procedure include radiation toxicity and contrast-induced nephropathy. Advances in cardiac CT technology and acquisition protocols have resulted in the ability to routinely perform highly diagnostic CCTA studies using significantly less radiation and iodinated contrast.

         Radiation exposure and CCTA image quality were assessed as part of the PROTECTION VI study. During a one-month period in 2017, data from CCTA performed in 61 centers across 32 countries was compared with data from a similar survey performed in 2007 [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Studies in 2017 were performed with 78 percent lower median radiation exposure (195 mGy*cm dose-length product) with no increase in nondiagnostic studies (1.9 percent of studies). Using a k-factor of 0.014 mSv/mGy*cm, this corresponds to a median dose of 2.7 mSv, which compares favorably to SPECT (7 to 12 mSv).

         The evidence presented below supports CCTA as an alternative to functional stress testing in appropriately selected patients. However, other tests such as echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging may be better choices if noncoronary causes of cardiac symptoms are suspected. Patients who are good candidates for CCTA include those who can safely receive iodinated intravenous contrast and can be expected to achieve high image quality based on ability to achieve a slow, stable heart rate at the time of scanning, able to follow breath-hold instructions, and do not have known significant coronary artery calcification.

         Large-scale registries and prospective studies have consistently demonstrated that the results of CCTA have strong prognostic value in stable patients. The following potential findings on CCTA are used for prognostication:

         Prospective studies comparing CCTA with functional testing have demonstrated that CCTA is a reasonable alternative to functional stress testing in stable patients without known CAD. Potential clinical advantages of CCTA include its high sensitivity (low likelihood to miss clinically significant CAD) and, most notably, its ability to identify nonobstructive (non-flow-limiting) coronary atherosclerosis that may refine estimates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and identify those who will likely benefit from more intensive preventive treatment, such as starting or intensifying statin therapy.

         CCTA may be an appropriate first diagnostic test for patients with stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk of CAD. Compared with invasive coronary angiography, CCTA may have fewer vascular complications.

Patients had mean age of 62 years, 20 percent had prior MI, 20 percent had prior percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery, and 57 percent had elevated troponin values. Both groups had similar risks of death or MI at one year (5.8 versus 6.1 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.62-1.35). CCTA was associated with a lower rate of invasive coronary angiography (54.0 versus 60.8 percent; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72-0.92). There was no difference in coronary revascularization, use of drug treatment for ACS, or subsequent preventive treatments between the two groups.

         Still, the absence of significant CAD on CCTA has been shown to be highly accurate for excluding ACS and allows for safe early discharge of intermediate-risk patients without detectable troponin levels or concerning changes on ECG. In contrast, the presence of a stenosis ≥50 percent, especially when accompanied by high-risk plaque features, suggests a higher likelihood of ACS  (

         CCTA is not typically recommended as a first-line test in patients with prior coronary artery revascularization. However, there may be clinical scenarios where it is useful to guide patient management.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention, stent material often results in "blooming" on CCTA images, a phenomenon that can obscure a portion of the coronary lumen within the stent and limit diagnostic accuracy. Patients with stents also often have extensive coronary calcification that can negatively impact diagnostic accuracy. As a result, CCTA is not routinely performed in patients with known intracoronary stents. However, high diagnostic accuracy can be expected in patients with larger diameter stents (≥3 mm) when excellent heart-rate control (ideally &lt;60 bpm) at the time of imaging can be achieved. In a meta-analysis of 35 studies utilizing at least 64-slice CCTA (n = 2656 patients with 4131 stents), CCTA had a per-stent sensitivity of 90 percent (95% CI 0.85-0.94) and specificity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.96) [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The accuracy was highest for stents &gt;3.0 mm, patients with heart rate &lt;65 beats per minute, and those with thinner stent struts (&lt;100 micrometers) as is seen in more contemporary stent platforms.

         CCTA is highly accurate for the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft patency and is considered an appropriate study when the patency of bypass graft conduits is the primary clinical question. However, CCTA has decreased diagnostic accuracy in native vessels in many patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery, largely due to the high burden of calcified atherosclerosis, which limits its use in this population. The high diagnostic accuracy (&gt;95 percent) of CCTA for the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts is due to the relative lack of calcification and motion in bypass conduits. In a meta-analysis that included patients with 2482 coronary artery bypass grafts, the sensitivity and specificity for bypass graft stenosis &gt;50 percent were 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.98),with an area under the curve of 0.99 regardless of type of bypass graft (venous versus arterial) [

          Indications
         </strong>
         – The major indications for coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) by patient group are  (

         <strong>
          Patients with stable symptoms
         </strong>
         – CCTA can be an initial test in patients with chronic (stable) symptoms concerning for ischemic heart disease (chronic coronary disease) who do not have previously established coronary artery disease (CAD). (See
         <a class="local">
          'As an alternative to functional stress testing'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In stable patients, CCTA may be an alternative to invasive coronary angiography as the initial diagnostic test; if the patient has nondiagnostic or equivocal stress test results and persistent symptoms and an uncertain diagnosis of CAD, a CCTA may be used. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with nondiagnostic stress tests'

         <strong>
          Patients with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
         </strong>
         – In patients with low-risk presentation of non-ST-elevation ACS (eg, absence of heart failure and refractory ischemic symptoms), when there is a clinician or patient desire to avoid invasive coronary angiography, or when the cause for troponin elevation is uncertain, CCTA may be used as an alternative to stress testing or invasive coronary angiography. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with low-risk NSTEACS'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In patients at intermediate risk for ACS when troponin and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) studies are normal or inconclusive, CCTA, along with stress testing, is a first-line testing option to exclude ACS. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with intermediate-risk acute coronary syndrome'

         <strong>
          Patients with prior revascularization
         </strong>
         – CCTA is not typically recommended as a first-line test in patients with prior coronary artery revascularization due to common occurrence of extensive coronary artery calcifications and stent artifacts. However, there may be clinical scenarios where it is useful to guide patient management. (See
