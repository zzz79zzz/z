Although the term technically refers to nutrition given either by mouth or through a feeding tube, in common usage, the term usually refers to tube feeding and includes feeding via nasogastric tube, gastrostomy tube, gastro-jejunostomy tube, or jejunostomy tube. In comparison with parenteral nutrition (the provision of nutrients via a venous catheter directly into the bloodstream), enteral nutrition offers several advantages, including lower costs, beneficial effects from utilization of the gastrointestinal tract, and avoidance of the many potential complications of parenteral nutrition.</p><p>For many pediatric patients with suboptimal nutrition, intake by mouth can be improved by offering high-calorie foods, oral supplements, or boosting the nutrient density of foods by adding high-energy supplements such as fats (oils, cream, or butter), carbohydrates (sugars and powdered supplements), and proteins (milk or other protein powders). Children who are still unable to take in sufficient energy through these approaches, or those who are unable to tolerate oral feedings because of underlying disease, are candidates for enteral nutrition.</p><p>Related content can be found in the following UpToDate topic reviews:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nutritional assessment</strong>:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5356.html" rel="external">"Measurement of growth in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5358.html" rel="external">"Indications for nutritional assessment in childhood"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2864.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children younger than two years in resource-abundant settings: Etiology and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Artificial nutrition support</strong>:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15634.html" rel="external">"Parenteral nutrition in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5026.html" rel="external">"Parenteral nutrition in premature infants"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5014.html" rel="external">"Approach to enteral nutrition in the premature infant"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific disease states</strong>:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5894.html" rel="external">"Management of short bowel syndrome in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5893.html" rel="external">"Growth failure and pubertal delay in children with inflammatory bowel disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4320422"><span class="h1">NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT IN CHILDREN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision about whether to initiate enteral nutrition in children should begin with a thorough, reliable, and valid evaluation of nutritional status.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3381963668"><span class="h2">General evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The general assessment of nutritional status begins by obtaining, plotting, and interpreting weight, length, and head circumference data on sex- and age-specific growth curves. For full-term infants and children up to 24 months of age, the growth charts developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) should be used; these standards were derived from healthy infants who were exclusively breastfed [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For children 2 to 20 years old in the United States, the growth charts developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) should be used. These growth charts include curves for weight for age, length (height) for age, as well as body mass index (BMI), on which an individual patient's values can be plotted and tracked over time. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5356.html" rel="external">"Measurement of growth in children", section on 'Recommended growth charts with calculators'</a>.)</p><p>For premature infants, evaluation of the degree of prematurity is critical and often leads to a decision to initiate tube feedings until oral feeds are possible. Enteral and/or parenteral nutrition usually is required until a premature infant reaches approximately 34 weeks gestational age. Appropriate growth curves or correction for gestational age should be employed when judging the nutritional status of premature infants. The evaluation for and management of enteral feeds in premature infants are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5014.html" rel="external">"Approach to enteral nutrition in the premature infant"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5003.html" rel="external">"Growth management in preterm infants", section on 'Normative growth data'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2631728957"><span class="h2">Determination of malnutrition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, deficits in weight for age are classified as "underweight," deficits in length for age are classified as "stunting," and deficits of weight for length are classified as "wasting"  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83941" href="/z/d/graphic/83941.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).

Nutritional assessment with standard anthropometric criteria are equally valid for children in resource-limited settings as for those in resource-abundant settings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5883.html" rel="external">"Malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings: Clinical assessment", section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Anthropometric measures of the arm provide helpful and supplementary data, especially in clinical scenarios when measurement of body weight is not possible or is inaccurate, or when height cannot be accurately measured (eg, cerebral palsy, critical illness). These include measures of triceps and/or biceps skinfold thickness (TSF and BSF, respectively) and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). TSF and BSF are measured with a skin fold caliper and MUAC with a non-stretchable tape measure, both measured by trained personnel. Standard equations can calculate mid-arm muscle area (MAMA) from TSF and MUAC. MAMA is an estimate of peripheral lean body mass, and TSF and BSF are reasonable estimates of peripheral body fat composition (though not central adiposity). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5363.html" rel="external">"Measurement of body composition in children", section on 'Anthropometrics'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1285462818"><span class="h2">Global nutritional assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) recommends combining the anthropometric data described above with other clinical information to classify a child's malnutrition using the following categories [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Illness-related versus non-illness-related – If illness-related (caused by disease, surgery, or trauma), include the presumed mechanism for the malnutrition (eg, decreased intake, increased requirement, or excessive loss of nutrients). If non-illness-related (caused by environmental or behavioral factors), describe the proximal causes of the starvation, eg, anorexia, socio-economic, iatrogenic feeding interruptions, or intolerance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute versus chronic – Use a cutoff of three months' duration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe versus moderate – Use Z-scores for "key anthropometric variables" (weight, height, BMI, and MUAC) to define the presence and severity of malnutrition  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83941" href="/z/d/graphic/83941.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Effects on growth – Serial anthropometric measurements of weight and length are optimal, if available. In general, a Z-score decrease of more than 1 in an individual anthropometric measurement indicates faltering growth in height and weight.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional status – Assessment of the effects of the malnutrition on the child's functional status.</p><p></p><p>Several nutrition screening tools have been developed for use in hospitalized children [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment (SGNA)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108963" href="/z/d/graphic/108963.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) provides one approach; it is designed to guide a thorough assessment of current nutritional status [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The STRONGkids tool  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110788" href="/z/d/graphic/110788.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) is designed to predict nutritional risk; ie, negative weight for height standard deviation scores, hospital length of stay, and need for supplementary feeding in children [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. It is relatively simple and practical to use.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other tools are the Nutrition Risk Score (NRS) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], the Pediatric Nutritional Risk Score (PNRS) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], the Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics (STAMP) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], the Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], the Pediatric Screening Nutrition Tool (PNST) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], and the Pediatric Digital Scaled Malnutrition Risk screening Tool (PeDiSMART) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p>The aim of all of these screening tools is to identify children at risk of malnutrition on hospital admission and determine the need for nutritional intervention during hospitalization. However, there are differences in the use of these tools. For example, SGNA is designed to evaluate the <strong>actual</strong> nutritional status of a child on admission, whereas STRONGkids is designed to predict the <strong>risk</strong> of children becoming malnourished during the hospital stay. A tool that predicts nutritional risk during the hospital admission may be more valuable because it is tied to clinical decision-making about nutritional interventions. However, a systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to select one of these tools over the others, based on predictive accuracy [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4320429"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR ENTERAL NUTRITION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3020954500"><span class="h2">General indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any child who is unable to meet nutritional requirements by mouth is a candidate for enteral nutrition. The decision to treat and the route of supplementation depends on the underlying disease, its severity and anticipated course, and several other patient-specific considerations.</p><p>Regardless of the technique used for nutritional assessment, preexisting undernutrition (as defined by low birth weight, underweight, or wasting) is an indication to begin enteral nutrition sooner than among well-nourished subjects. In undernourished infants and children, repletion of body weight is a primary goal for enteral nutrition and measure of its efficacy.</p><p>Indications for enteral nutrition generally fall into one of the following categories:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Impaired swallowing or oral motor development, or oral aversion</strong> – Underlying conditions include cerebral palsy or other neurologic problems (resulting in spasticity or poor coordination of skeletal muscles involved in eating), congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract, and prematurity (in which developmental skills in oral intake are incomplete).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Excessive metabolic demands</strong> – Infants with sepsis, congenital heart disease, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia or children with critical illness commonly require enteral feeding to meet their nutrient needs, which may be increased by the illness. As compared with adults, infants and children have proportionately lower reserves of body protein, carbohydrate, and fat and also have increased metabolic needs [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. As a result, the threshold for beginning supplemental enteral nutrition is also lower than in adults: In infants and children with these diseases, insufficient oral intake for three to five days is a suitable threshold for intervention.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Impaired absorption or digestion</strong> – This broad category includes children with short bowel syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Crohn disease, some inborn errors of metabolism, chronic renal insufficiency, and others. The indications and type of enteral nutrition vary depending on the underlying condition, as discussed below.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3229545917"><span class="h2">Specific disease states</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following sections present an overview of the indications for enteral nutrition for each of several disorders or categories. More details are available in the linked topic reviews.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1171061692"><span class="h3">Congenital heart disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Growth failure is a common complication of congenital heart disease. Malnutrition is probably caused by several mechanisms: These patients often have increased energy requirements due to increased work of breathing and cardiac effort and may have malabsorption from poor oxygen delivery to the intestine. In addition, they often have inadequate energy intake because of anorexia, early satiety, and general feeding intolerance, caused by congestive heart failure that leads to dyspnea, tachycardia, and fatigue [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. The severity and type of growth failure depends in part on the type of cardiac defect: Cyanotic defects are typically associated with poor gains in both weight and length, while infants with acyanotic defects have poor weight gain but relatively preserved linear growth. Chronic hypoxia can be another factor resulting in poor growth.</p><p>Children with growth failure due to congenital heart disease may not be able to meet their energy needs with oral feeds alone and often require enteral feeding support. In some cases, infants and young children with congenital heart disease also have ischemic bowel disease, with mucosal damage and sometimes requiring surgical resection, so specialized formulas may be indicated. However, the majority of children with CHD can tolerate enteral feeding with intact protein formulas. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5785.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5756.html" rel="external">"Management of isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children", section on 'Nutritional support'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3862217793"><span class="h3">Cystic fibrosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with cystic fibrosis frequently have growth failure, caused by the combination of malabsorption, increased energy needs, and reduced appetite. Initiation of enteral feedings is appropriate if the child's body mass index (BMI) cannot be kept in the target range (BMI at or above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile for age) despite optimization of pancreatic enzyme therapy and oral nutrition support. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5882.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues", section on 'Nutrition support'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4320450"><span class="h3">Gastrointestinal disease and dysfunction</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Short bowel syndrome</strong> – Both enteral and parenteral feeding are required for many infants and children with short bowel syndrome or other forms of intestinal failure [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Even small quantities of enteral feeding promote intestinal adaptation and enhance feeding tolerance; continuous feeding is usually better tolerated than bolus feeding. Over time, enteral feeds can and should be gradually increased to supply an increasing proportion of the patient's nutritional needs. Reducing dependence on parenteral nutrition is particularly important in infants with short bowel syndrome, who are at high risk for developing intestinal failure-associated liver disease and numerous complications from central venous line catheters. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5894.html" rel="external">"Management of short bowel syndrome in children", section on 'Advancement of enteral feeds'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5948.html" rel="external">"Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease</strong> – Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and particularly those with Crohn disease, frequently have nutritionally- and inflammatory-mediated deficits in growth that often precede the diagnosis of the IBD. At the time of diagnosis of Crohn disease, approximately 25 percent of children have low body weight, 80 percent have reduced height velocity, and most have delayed pubertal development. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5893.html" rel="external">"Growth failure and pubertal delay in children with inflammatory bowel disease", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nutritional support for children and adolescents with IBD depends on the degree of nutritional deficits and response to medical treatment of the IBD, ranging from dietary counseling, to liquid supplements taken by mouth, to supplemental enteral nutrition. Close monitoring of nutritional status and growth and a proactive approach to supplemental nutrition is important to optimize growth and minimize consequences of malnutrition, including bone disease. Increasingly, exclusive enteral nutrition (in which all nutritional needs are supplied as a liquid formula, taken by mouth or through enteral feeds) is used as primary therapy for the IBD itself. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5893.html" rel="external">"Growth failure and pubertal delay in children with inflammatory bowel disease", section on 'Management of growth failure and pubertal delay'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5866.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of Crohn disease in children and adolescents", section on 'Exclusive enteral nutrition'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Biliary atresia</strong> – Nutritional problems in infants and children with biliary atresia and other cases of chronic cholestatic liver disease are common and difficult to overcome. They are caused by a combination of malabsorption due to cholestasis and chronic liver inflammation. Depending on the severity of the nutritional deficit, this is managed by increasing the energy content of oral feeds or by enteral nutrition, given by nasogastric tube and/or changing to a formula with higher medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil content. Special attention should be paid to ensuring adequate fat-soluble vitamin status in children with this disorder or other causes of chronic cholestasis.

Nutritional management of children with chronic kidney disease focuses on their unique energy, protein, vitamin, mineral, and electrolyte needs and is discussed in a separate topic review.

The extent of hypermetabolism varies substantially, however, and is difficult to predict with certainty [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]; it may be less common with modern techniques for anesthesia and pain control [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. Overfeeding should be avoided because it increases the ventilatory work by increasing carbon dioxide production and can induce hepatic steatosis, cholestasis, and hyperglycemia [<a href="#rid18">18,25</a>]. Critically ill children with mild to moderate hyperglycemia do not seem to benefit from tight glycemic control with insulin infusions [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1600.html" rel="external">"Glycemic control in critically ill adult and pediatric patients"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Children with critical illness should undergo nutritional assessment upon entry into the intensive care unit (ICU) to identify preexisting nutritional problems (either underweight or overweight) as well as risk factors for the development of nutritional complications (including expectations for when the patient will be able to eat and predicted metabolic needs) due to critical illness or its therapy. Body weight should be measured on admission and periodically remeasured during the hospital stay. Serial measurements of weight are often overlooked in the ICU but provide critical information about changes in the patient's nutritional and fluid status [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Standard equations can be used to estimate energy needs but are often unreliable and can either underestimate or overestimate needs [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Therefore, the use of indirect calorimetry to measure energy needs has been recommended [<a href="#rid25">25,29-31</a>]. Periodic reassessment of nutrition needs and monitoring of actual input is important because energy requirements change during the course of an illness and because the quantity of enteral feeds actually administered is often well below the intended target due to interruptions in the feeding schedule due to intolerance or competing medical procedures, such as fasting prior to medical procedures [<a href="#rid18">18,32,33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Burns</strong> – Children with thermal injury have increased requirements for energy and protein, which must be met to achieve optimal outcomes. Their micronutrient status is likely altered as well [<a href="#rid18">18,34</a>]. This is due in part to a hypermetabolic response to the burn injury, which markedly increases energy needs. As an example, the metabolic rate in children with burn injuries of more than 40 percent of their body surface area increases by approximately 180 percent and remained elevated at 150 percent even after full healing of the wound [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. As a result of these increased needs, nutritional support should be given to patients with moderate or severe burns (based on burn depth and surface area) within 24 to 48 hours of the injury, if the patient is stable but unable to consume sufficient calories by mouth. Nutritional management of patients with severe burns, including formula selection and equations for estimating energy needs in children, are discussed in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/820.html" rel="external">"Nutritional demands and enteral formulas for adult surgical patients"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The hypermetabolic response to the injury also causes increased protein catabolism with muscle wasting, and peripheral insulin resistance, which leads to hyperglycemia. The prevention of hyperglycemia with intensive regimens including exogenous insulin has also been shown to improve outcomes in children with burns [<a href="#rid36">36-39</a>]. However, maintaining a continuous insulin infusion in burn patients is difficult because of the need for frequent interruptions in their enteral feedings, with associated risks for hypoglycemia. These and other issues related to the hypermetabolic response in adults and children with burn injuries are discussed in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/818.html" rel="external">"Hypermetabolic response to moderate-to-severe burn injury and management", section on 'Glycemic control'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/821.html" rel="external">"Overview of nutrition support in burn patients", section on 'Glycemic control'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cancer</strong> – Nutritional management of patients with cancer is critical during active disease and during the treatment regimens. Treatment such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery may cause anorexia, poor oral tolerance, and inadequate intake. Energy requirements are variable depending on stress and state of catabolism and may be impacted by tumor burden. Tube feedings for total intake or as a supplement to oral intake can be considered to support a patient during treatment and when anorexia occurs. Standard formulas can be used unless there are issues with malabsorption, in which case, a hydrolyzed formula may be advantageous.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are particularly likely to require nutritional support. In some cases, especially with allogeneic transplantation, they require parenteral rather than enteral nutrition due to gastrointestinal dysfunction from preparative chemotherapy and radiation. These children may have lower energy needs than predicted by standard equations [<a href="#rid40">40</a>], so direct measurement of nutritional needs by indirect calorimetry can help target energy intake [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4320493"><span class="h3">Neuromuscular impairment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neuromuscular disease may either decrease or increase energy requirements. As examples, children with choreoathetoid cerebral palsy (but not spastic cerebral palsy) tend to have increased energy expenditure, whereas those with Down syndrome or myelomeningocele generally have lower energy requirements than expected for their age and size. The energy requirement also may depend on the child's nutritional status: The resting energy expenditure of malnourished children with severe cerebral palsy tends to be lower than expected prior to a nutritional intervention but rises to normal after supplemental feeds are begun [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. This pattern is similar to that seen in other children with malnutrition. Because of the variable energy needs of neurologically impaired children, it is important to monitor a child's nutritional status before and after beginning a nutrition intervention and readjust energy intake as needed.</p><p>Some children with neuromuscular impairment are also at risk for aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction and/or gastroesophageal reflux; these are important considerations when selecting the route and regimen for enteral nutrition. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14537.html" rel="external">"Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in children"</a>.)</p><p>Although concentrated formulas may be useful to reduce gastric volume and the risk of gastroesophageal reflux, particularly in conjunction with gastroparesis, it is also important to ensure that the patient receives sufficient fluid. Maintenance fluid requirements depend on the child's weight and can be estimated using a simple equation or calculator (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13425.html" rel="external">calculator 5</a> and <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/121761.html" rel="external">calculator 6</a>).

In 2022, some commercial formulas had limited availability due to recalls and supply chain issues [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p>Other considerations include whether the child has dietary protein sensitivities or carbohydrate or fat malabsorption.

They are not recommended for the prevention of food allergies or for feeding infants at risk for allergic disease (eg, siblings or children of an individual with allergic disease). Soy formulas are generally not recommended for infants with food protein-induced proctocolitis, because many of these infants are sensitive to both cow's milk and soy protein. Extensively hydrolyzed formulas are generally preferred for such infants. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5897.html" rel="external">"Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis of infancy", section on 'Formula-supplemented or formula-fed infants'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Soy formulas also can be used for feeding infants if a vegan diet is preferred by the family since the protein source is from plants, or for infants with galactosemia since the carbohydrate source is lactose-free.

This approach is increasingly selected by families because of reduced cost, desire to share a family mealtime experience with their enterally fed child, and/or perception that table foods are healthier than conventional formulas [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. For homemade blenderized feedings, families need to be willing to invest time to prepare the blenderized formula and to follow proper food safety measures [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. In addition, hang times for homemade blenderized feedings are recommended to be two hours or less for food safety reasons.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Commercial blenderized formulas are also available and may or may not be nutritionally complete (ie, they meet estimated needs for energy and all macro- and micronutrients, when provided in the appropriate volume for the patient's age group). When these formulas are used, an expert clinician should review the composition and determine if the diet meets the child's estimated needs for all nutrients and fluid. Since these commercial formulas are aseptic, their hang time is not limited to two hours. Some of the newer commercial blenderized products may not be covered by insurance and may or may not be nutritionally complete, so these require careful planning to ensure that micronutrient and fluid needs are met.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Use of blenderized formulas require larger bore (16 to 18 Fr) gastrostomy tubes to prevent clogging, and they are not recommended for infusion via jejunostomy tubes. This approach is most practical for use if the patient can tolerate bolus feedings via syringe; this avoids use of a pump, which tends to cause more problems with occlusion. As with all enteral formulas, ongoing monitoring for tolerance, adequacy, and growth is essential.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Extensively hydrolyzed protein formulas</strong> are made from cow's milk protein that is extensively hydrolyzed. Although the shorter chain length of these hydrolyzed proteins makes them less likely to elicit an immunologic response in susceptible children, these formulas are not truly "hypoallergenic." These formulas are appropriate for most infants with food protein-induced proctocolitis or IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy. Most are lactose-free, and most have a component of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), which can be useful in cases of fat malabsorption. Of note, formulas that are partially hydrolyzed are also available.

Infant formulas need to be provided in volumes of 150 to 175 mL/kg/day to provide recommended requirements of energy, vitamins, and minerals (if given at standard concentrations). Younger infants or those needing catch-up growth will be on the higher end of this range. Infants with growth failure may need infant formulas concentrated to 0.74 or 0.8 kcal/mL (22 or 24 kcal/oz) to ensure adequate energy, protein, and mineral intake to promote catch-up weight gain.</p><p>In healthy infants older than six months of age, infant formulas are generally supplemented with complementary feedings, so they do not rely on formula alone to meet nutrient needs. On the other hand, older infants and children who are receiving the bulk of their nutrition via enteral nutrition due to gastrointestinal or other diseases often rely on formula for all of their nutritional needs. The total fluid, energy, and macro- and micronutrient needs of these patients therefore should be reviewed serially.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3900072499"><span class="h3">Toddlers and older children</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After one year of age, a variety of formulas are available, depending on the child's needs and some disease-specific considerations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53184" href="/z/d/graphic/53184.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).

For some patients, especially those who are likely to learn to eat by mouth, nasogastric feeding is an appropriate long-term solution rather than gastrostomy placement.</p><p>Placement of a nasogastric or orogastric tube does not require surgery or endoscopy, and parents or caregivers can be taught how to replace the tube at home. Potential disadvantages with this route are interference with oral intake, easy dislodgement, irritation to the nasal/oral area, infection, and, for older children, stigmatization with visible tube in place.

If the patient can tolerate a bolus by gravity infusion, a pump is not necessary. Bolus feeds may also reduce the risk of aspiration because they are typically administered while the infant or child is awake and upright. On the other hand, the bolus method feeding might also increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration if large volumes are given. If a bolus feed is given while the child is asleep, the head of the bed should be elevated to least at a 45° angle to help reduce aspiration risk.</p><p>Continuous feeding regimens are useful for infants and children who do not tolerate bolus feeds, either because of malabsorptive disease (eg, short bowel syndrome), feeding intolerance (eg, many infants with congenital heart disease), or gastroesophageal reflux with aspiration risk (eg, some children neurologic impairment). This method requires a pump and appropriate measures to ensure freshness of the formula or human milk in the reservoir. For human milk feeds, another challenge is loss of calories because the fat component settles in the reservoir and adheres to the tubing, particularly with continuous feeds (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5014.html" rel="external">"Approach to enteral nutrition in the premature infant", section on 'Intermittent versus continuous'</a>). In addition, continuous nocturnal feeding is used for some children with a chronic illness to supplement to their daytime oral intake (eg, children with cystic fibrosis and growth failure). When feeds are given while the child is asleep, the head of the bed should be elevated, as described above for bolus feeds. Some children may have an additional surgical procedure (eg, a fundoplication) to provide additional protection against gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration.</p><p>Unless contraindicated by the patient's condition (eg, aspiration risk), some feeds should be provided by mouth even if this provides minimal caloric content, because patients who are not fed by mouth often develop a feeding aversion that can interfere with the transition back to oral feeds [<a href="#rid56">56,57</a>]. The risk for developing feeding aversion is highest in infants and young children and if there is a prolonged period of time without oral feeds (eg, months to years). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5894.html" rel="external">"Management of short bowel syndrome in children", section on 'Oral feeding'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H997691766"><span class="h2">Poor gastric emptying or aspiration risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transpyloric or postpyloric feedings may be required for infants and children with poor gastric emptying and/or aspiration risk; they reduce but do not eliminate gastroesophageal reflux [<a href="#rid58">58,59</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2583.html" rel="external">"Enteral feeding: Gastric versus post-pyloric"</a>.)</p><p>Postpyloric feeding is given through a nasojejunal (NJ) or gastrostomy-jejunal combined tube (GJT), or occasionally with a surgically placed jejunostomy tube (JT). Postpyloric feeding requires a pump and an intermittent continuous infusion schedule of feedings because infusion of boluses directly into the small intestine results in dumping syndrome and is contraindicated. Small pumps are available and can be carried by the child in a backpack to allow mobility. Standard polymeric or hydrolyzed protein formulas may be used; amino acid-based formulas should be avoided because of their high osmolarity [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. Patients fed exclusively via the transpyloric route are at risk for deficiencies of iron, copper, zinc, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="98778" href="/z/d/drug information/98778.html" rel="external">selenium</a> because these nutrients are absorbed in the proximal gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>Short-term transpyloric feeding is given through an NJ. NJ tubes are most commonly used in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, when feeding courses are short and patient motion is minimal. Outside of the ICU setting, NJ tubes have a number of drawbacks: They are difficult to place correctly and may require fluoroscopy to guide the tube through the pylorus and ensure appropriate tip location, with the associated risk of radiation exposure. Therefore, for patients requiring long-term administration of postpyloric feeds, surgical placement of a GJT or JT is preferable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H686565055"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/110738.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Pediatric malnutrition"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/111341.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Nutrition support (parenteral and enteral nutrition) in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H869847"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition and clinical importance</strong> – Enteral nutrition consists of providing nutrients via the gastrointestinal tract; in common usage, the term usually refers to tube feeding (rather than including oral feeds). Enteral nutrition offers several advantages over parenteral nutrition including lower costs, beneficial effects from utilization of the gastrointestinal tract, and avoidance of the many potential complications of parenteral nutrition. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – Common indications for enteral nutrition in children fall into the following categories (which are not mutually exclusive) (see <a class="local">'Indications for enteral nutrition'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Impaired swallowing/oral aversion or intestinal dysfunction (eg, prematurity, cerebral palsy or other neurologic problems, or congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Excessive metabolic demands (sepsis, burns, or other type of critical illness; congenital heart disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Impaired absorption or digestion (short bowel syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Crohn disease, some inborn errors of metabolism, chronic renal insufficiency)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Formula selection</strong> – Selection of a formula for enteral feeding depends on the patient's age, weight, degree of prematurity, ability to tolerate intact protein, and sometimes on disease-specific considerations or availability. Separate formulas are used for infants  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75231" href="/z/d/graphic/75231.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) as compared with children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53184" href="/z/d/graphic/53184.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'Formula selection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nutritional requirements</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Target volume</strong> – When initiating enteral feeds, the target volume is calculated based on estimated needs for fluids and energy. For children whose growth is within a healthy range, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) provides an appropriate estimate of these needs, as shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78274" href="/z/d/graphic/78274.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). These estimates are then adjusted up for children needing catch-up growth or those with a hypermetabolic disease state, or adjusted down for those who are overweight or hypometabolic. (See <a class="local">'Nutritional requirements'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Nutritional requirements are particularly difficult to predict in patients with certain critical illnesses, including severe burn injuries or those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In such cases, measurement of the resting metabolic rate by indirect calorimetry provides accurate estimate of the patient's nutritional needs and can help to avoid under- and overfeeding. (See <a class="local">'Critical illness and postoperative states'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Monitoring and adjustment</strong> – Patients undergoing long-term enteral feeding should be periodically reassessed by plotting serial heights and weights, and the volume of feeds should be adjusted up or down to achieve optimal growth. Serial measurements of body weight are often overlooked in critically ill patients but are important to ensure adequate nutrition for recovery and growth. (See <a class="local">'Nutritional requirements'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Route of administration</strong> – Enteral feedings can be administered via intragastric (eg, orogastric, nasogastric, or gastrostomy tubes) or transpyloric (eg, nasoduodenal, nasojejunal, or gastrojejunal) tubes. The choice depends on whether the anticipated need for enteral feeds is short or long term and whether there is an aspiration risk. Unless contraindicated by the patient's condition (eg, aspiration risk), patients requiring long-term enteral feeds should also be given some feeds by mouth to avoid development of a feeding aversion.
