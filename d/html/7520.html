         </span>
         In 1950, Philip Hench and colleagues earned a Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering the dramatic beneficial effect of cortisone on a patient incapacitated by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Since that time, glucocorticoids have been a key medication for the treatment of RA, although the precise role of glucocorticoids continues to generate considerable debate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Glucocorticoids exert both antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects via several mechanisms [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ] (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3986.html" rel="external">
          "Glucocorticoid effects on the immune system"
         </a>
         ). Among those pertinent to patients with RA are the following:

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These effects are mediated by intracellular glucocorticoid receptors that translocate to the nucleus after binding with glucocorticoids, affecting the transcription of thousands of genes by directly binding to DNA at glucocorticoid response elements and by interacting with other transcription factors [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Non-genomic glucocorticoid effects may also be mediated by posttranscriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, by physicochemical interactions with biologic membranes, and by binding to membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients with RA, glucocorticoids may be administered via several different modalities. These include oral (short-term and chronic therapy), intramuscular, intravenous (pulse therapy), and intraarticular routes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/124.html" rel="external">
          "Pharmacologic use of glucocorticoids"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the use of glucocorticoids given both short-term and chronically in low doses, given intravenously as pulse therapy over a short period of time, and when administered intraarticularly in the treatment of RA [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. An overview of the management of RA is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">
          "General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         In patients with more severe, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone
         </a>
         is frequently added for a short period to the treatment regimen to rapidly reduce disease activity while awaiting a clinical response to a slower-acting disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. Moderate doses of glucocorticoids of 10 to 15 mg/day may often have a substantial clinical benefit in patients with RA. Especially when used for short-term (generally &lt;1 month) management of active joint disease, glucocorticoids are more effective than either placebo or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID).
        </p>
        <p>
         Support for the value of short-term (ie, within the first month of therapy) glucocorticoid therapy comes from a year 2003 meta-analysis of 10 studies utilizing random assignment of 320 patients with RA to groups that received glucocorticoids (equivalent to 15 mg of

         Glucocorticoid adverse effects are both dose and duration dependent, and short-term use of glucocorticoids in doses less than the equivalent of 15 mg of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9808" href="/z/d/drug information/9808.html" rel="external">
          prednisolone

         per day is seldom associated with serious adverse effects. Observational studies have suggested a small increase in harms such as serious infections even with very short courses of glucocorticoids at the population level, although for an individual patient the risk is low [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Mood disorders and hyperglycemia may be seen with daily treatment at these relatively low doses; however, short-term treatment of early RA with even high-dose
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone

         therapy has not been associated with long-term worsening of glucose tolerance [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7988.html" rel="external">
          "Major adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Several clinical trials have suggested benefits of high-dose
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone
         </a>
         therapy in early RA. The Combination Therapy Trial in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (COBRA) and the Behandel Strategieen (BeSt) trial demonstrated that the addition of higher-dose oral prednisone (60 mg/day, tapering to 7.5 mg/day by week 6 and then stopping after week 12) in combination with other conventional DMARDs leads to more rapid improvement in disease activity and also lower rates of radiographic joint damage, an effect that while small was sustained over many years [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. An open-label trial has suggested that lower initial doses of glucocorticoids (prednisone 30 mg/day) may have comparable efficacy to the higher dose used in the classic COBRA regimen [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical experience suggests that glucocorticoids continue to be effective for periods up to six months. Longer-term use is more controversial because of waning effectiveness in controlling symptoms and because of increasing risk of adverse events [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy of chronic use'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         It is notable that the more rapid onset of action of biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs (eg, janus kinase inhibitors) compared with conventional DMARDs may reduce the need for short-term glucocorticoids. In the BeST trial, patients randomized to higher-dose oral
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone

         with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">
          methotrexate
         </a>
         had similar outcomes at three months to those randomized to

          infliximab

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Many clinicians employ short-term glucocorticoids as bridging therapy when starting a DMARD, particularly in patients who have more severe or disabling symptoms despite NSAIDs. This strategy is embraced in guidelines from the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR). Guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology also acknowledge the frequent use of glucocorticoids in this setting, although they recommend against routine use of short-term glucocorticoids because of challenges tapering therapy in some patients [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15

         Evidence is conflicting regarding the benefits of chronic glucocorticoid therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We do not use glucocorticoids on a chronic basis without concurrent therapy with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or combination of DMARDs (eg, a conventional DMARD and a biologic agent), as DMARDs are more potent disease modifiers in the long term. The main conclusions from randomized trials in which patients received 7.5 to 10 mg/day of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone

         or equivalent in addition to DMARDs were that initial symptomatic benefit may be achieved and sustained for up to two years [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-24
         </a>
         ]. Radiologic progression is also modestly reduced with such doses, although these effects are less clinically relevant in the current era of more effective DMARDs. These conclusions were best demonstrated in three randomized trials:

          17
         </a>
         ]. Prednisolone was beneficial compared with placebo for reducing pain at up to six months and for reducing disability at up to 15 months. At two years, prednisolone therapy resulted in significantly fewer hand erosions (22 versus 46 percent). Among those initially administered prednisolone, an increase in erosions was seen one year after drug withdrawal [

Treatment success (continued low-disease activity and absence of disease flare over the 24-week study) was more common in those who continued prednisone instead of tapering (77 versus 65 percent), but these numbers also demonstrated that almost two-thirds of patients were able to discontinue prednisone without worsening of disease activity. Furthermore, no symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were reported.

         Taken together, the studies demonstrate that chronic glucocorticoids can have beneficial effects on disease activity and may have small effects on damage progression. Effective DMARD or DMARD combinations (including conventional and/or biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs), however, may often provide sufficient improvement so that glucocorticoids are not required or, if used, can be decreased or discontinued to minimize the potential for adverse effects [

          31-34

         ]. The role of the delayed-release form in clinical practice, for which it is available in some countries, remains uncertain. The modified-release form of the drug was developed in an effort to more effectively reduce morning symptoms by countering the effects of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, that are produced late at night [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35

         The chronic use of low-dose glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can cause multiple adverse events. These include an increased risk for infections, osteoporosis, skeletal fractures, gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, diabetes mellitus, cataracts, cardiovascular events, weight gain, skin changes, and impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7988.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Multiple observational studies have demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in the risk of serious infections with glucocorticoids. The risk of infection at doses &gt;10 mg/day is substantially greater than that of biologic therapies and even doses ≤5 mg/day are associated with a small but clinically relevant increase in the risk of infection similar to that seen with biologics [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39

In another study of 65 patients treated with an average of prednisone 5.6 mg/day, BMD in the lumbar spine and trochanter fell at a rate of 2 and 0.9 percent per year, respectively; these changes were prevented with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, which increased BMD by 0.72 and 0.85 percent per year, respectively [

          43

The standard "pulse" dose has traditionally been 1000 mg administered intravenously (IV) daily for three consecutive days once monthly, but some evidence suggests that lower doses may be as effective. One study, for example, randomized 36 patients with active RA to standard pulse therapy or 100 mg IV daily for three consecutive days once monthly; there was no statistically significant difference in initial response or in sustained clinical improvement between the two regimens [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>

         Glucocorticoids remain an important therapeutic option in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, widely accepted criteria for the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy have not been established, and, indeed, specific dosing strategies have not been well studied either for short-term flare management or long-term disease management [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ]. Studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be used as a bridge between the initiation of conventional (nonbiologic) or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and realizing the therapeutic effect of these slower acting agents and/or for the treatment of acute synovitis [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Glucocorticoids may also be used at lower doses in combination with conventional (nonbiologic) and biologic DMARDs to improve function and symptoms in patients without adequate response to DMARD therapy. Glucocorticoids have some effects on preventing joint damage, although this effect is less relevant given the greater effectiveness of currently available DMARDs for limiting radiographic progression.

         Patients should be informed about the risks and benefits of glucocorticoid therapy and about the danger of abrupt cessation of the medication after long-term use.

         Patients with more severe symptoms who have inadequate benefit with or contraindications to NSAIDs may be prescribed glucocorticoids, often at doses of 10 to 15 mg/day. Concurrent initiation of a nonbiologic or biologic DMARD permits tapering of the glucocorticoid once the patient begins to respond to the DMARD [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54

         As noted above, adverse effects of chronic glucocorticoid therapy are greatest at doses of 7.5 to 10 mg/day or higher, but infection risk is increased in patients with RA on DMARD therapy who receive any amount of chronic glucocorticoid therapy. Cardiovascular risk is also increased in patients with RA on ≥5 mg/day

         <a href="#rid54">
          54,62,63
         </a>
         ]. Patients with RA, particularly those on DMARDs, usually do not require higher daily doses for synovitis control. Even doses less than 5 mg/day may be adequate in some patients [

        <p>
         Patients on chronic glucocorticoids who achieve low-disease activity with effective DMARD therapy should attempt slow glucocorticoid tapering over a period of months to determine if glucocorticoids can be successfully discontinued and, if not, to find the lowest effective dose [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. In those who require very low doses of glucocorticoids to maintain remission (ie &lt;5 mg/day), weighing the risks of chronic glucocorticoids versus the risks of the alternative DMARDs being considered is required. (See

         Chronic therapy using monthly intramuscular (IM) glucocorticoid injections has been tried, but without sustained benefit, as shown in a study that randomly assigned 91 patients with RA and an inadequate response to a DMARD to either IM depomedrone (

         When a flare of RA occurs, it should be recognized that the underlying DMARD therapy may not be adequate, and steps should be taken to optimize the treatment. Flares of disease may be treated by an increase in the dose of oral glucocorticoid, with the intention of reducing the dose once the flare is under control. For patients on chronic

         therapy at less than or equal to 7.5 mg a day, increasing the prednisone to 15 mg a day in a single or divided dose for one to two weeks, then tapering to baseline prednisone dose over another two weeks is often adequate for management of a pauci- or polyarticular flare. For a severe flare, higher doses of 0.5 mg/kg body weight may be necessary, tapered to baseline over approximately four to six weeks. Need for frequent increases of the prednisone dose for flare management should prompt consideration of changing DMARD therapy. Pulse intravenous

         BMD testing and prophylactic measures have been underutilized in patients at risk for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. This was illustrated in a review of the medical records of 212 patients who received one year of oral glucocorticoid therapy. Only 21 percent of these patients had documented evidence of BMD testing, and only 31 percent were receiving medication for osteoporosis prevention [

         Osteoporosis prevention counseling has been underutilized in patients taking glucocorticoids.

         The attitudes of 148 patients with RA to oral glucocorticoid treatment were surveyed, and the factors influencing these views and their likely clinical impact were assessed in a study published in 2003 [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. The majority (68 percent) of the patients were not willing to be treated with an oral glucocorticoid. The patients who were willing to be treated were older and had higher mean erythrocyte sedimentation rates, worse function, and greater use of DMARDs. Many patients refused to participate due to their high level of concern about the adverse effects of glucocorticoid treatment [

          Goals of therapy
         </strong>
         – We primarily use glucocorticoids as a bridge between the initiation and realization of therapeutic effects of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with more severe disease and/or for the treatment of acute synovitis. At lower doses (generally &lt;5 to 7.5 mg a day
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone
         </a>
         equivalent), we use glucocorticoids in combination with conventional and biologic DMARDs in patients who have not achieved an adequate response with DMARDs alone, attempting slow glucocorticoid tapering if patients reach low disease activity. We do not use glucocorticoids in the absence of concurrent DMARD therapy. Comorbidities associated with an increased risk of toxicity should be considered when deciding whether to initiate glucocorticoid therapy. Patients should be informed about the risks and benefits of glucocorticoid therapy and about the danger of abrupt cessation of the medication after long-term use. (See

         <strong>
          Short-term glucocorticoids
         </strong>
         – When used for a period of one month or less, glucocorticoids are more effective than either a placebo or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), and clinical experience suggests that glucocorticoids continue to be effective for periods up to 24 months. (See

          Long-term glucocorticoids
         </strong>
         – Evidence is conflicting regarding the risks and benefits of chronic glucocorticoid therapy for patients with RA. Specific management strategies for use of chronic glucocorticoid therapy have been poorly studied. In trials in which patients received 7.5 to 10 mg/day of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone
         </a>
         or equivalent, there was initial symptomatic benefit that was not sustained at the initial dose, but, with these doses, radiologic progression may be slowed. It is less clear whether similar efficacy can be achieved with doses of 5 to 7 mg/day, but even lower doses, such as 1 to 4 mg/day continued indefinitely, may be effective in some patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy of chronic use'

         <strong>
          Adverse events
         </strong>
         – The chronic use of low-dose glucocorticoids in RA can cause multiple adverse events, including an increased risk for infections, osteoporosis, skeletal fractures, gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, diabetes mellitus, cataracts, cardiovascular events, weight gain, skin changes, and impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response. A major goal for patients with RA treated chronically with glucocorticoids is to minimize adverse events. We try to limit the dose to a maximum of 10 mg/day and preferably to less than 5 mg/day, and we use other measures to minimize bone loss. (See

         <strong>
          Pulse glucocorticoids
         </strong>
         – Pulse therapy consists of the administration of high doses of glucocorticoids over a short period of time; pulse glucocorticoids remain a modality of last resort for the treatment of RA. The available studies examining pulse glucocorticoids are very limited, and serious cardiovascular adverse events and infections may occur. The utility of pulse glucocorticoid therapy among patients with RA has been limited to the treatment of acute flares and to the use as a therapeutic bridge between the initiation of and response to DMARDs. The average duration of response to pulse therapy alone is six to eight weeks. The authors do not use "pulse" glucocorticoid therapy for management of active articular disease in patients with RA.

         <strong>
          Intraarticular glucocorticoids
         </strong>
         – Intraarticular glucocorticoids are frequently helpful for the treatment of symptomatic synovitis in patients with RA; such therapy is palliative rather than disease-modifying. Intraarticular injections of multiple joints may have advantages over intramuscular injections for patients experiencing a disease flare. Although rare, risks associated with intraarticular injection include tendon rupture, osteonecrosis, acute synovitis (transient postinjection flare which usually resolves within 48 hours), septic arthritis, and systemic effects. In general, the frequency of intraarticular injections should be limited to four per year or fewer. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intraarticular therapy'

         <strong>
          Glucocorticoid management
         </strong>
         – The dose of glucocorticoids should be tapered as quickly as possible to the lowest effective dose when chronic use is anticipated. Glucocorticoids are best administered in the morning to minimize interference with the normal diurnal hormonal pattern. Patients who have been on glucocorticoids long-term should taper glucocorticoids slowly over a period of months, as tolerated, once they have improved or after other effective agents have been added.

         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – We obtain baseline studies to monitor toxicity, including serum glucose, a lipid profile, and appropriate studies for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. We monitor patients for the presence of polydipsia, edema, shortness of breath, visual changes, weight gain, and changes in blood pressure at each visit following the initiation of glucocorticoids.
