In addition, chronic exposure to high, modest, or even low levels of lead may produce no symptoms but increase the risks for long-term development of adverse health outcomes.</p><p>The consequences of lead exposure may be reduced by taking an occupational and environmental health history, recognizing the early symptoms of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) and lead poisoning, having a low threshold for suspecting asymptomatic lead exposure based on an occupational and environmental history or medical findings, and checking BLL in such cases to verify the diagnosis and provide appropriate advice and treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2749.html" rel="external">"Overview of occupational and environmental health", section on 'Occupational and environmental history'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will focus on lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in non-pregnant adults.

However, ascribing a specific numeric BLL as a definition of adult lead toxicity is evolving, as research continues to identify adverse health effects in association with lower levels of adult lead exposure.</p><p>To be consistent with current practice and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>], we use these terms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood lead reference value (BLRV) – </strong>An elevated BLRV is defined as &gt;3.5 mcg/dL. In 2022, based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for lead, the Environmental Health Committee of the CSTE found a found a mean BLL for adults of 0.855 mcg/dL and a 97.5 percent BLL of 3.49 mcg/dL and thus proposed this BLRV [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This BLRV is not a toxicity threshold; rather, it is used to identify patients at the upper end of the population BLL distribution. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Previously, the case definition for an elevated BLL for an adult had been defined as ≥5 mcg/dL by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)/CDC's Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The reference BLL has been lowered from the previous levels of &gt;10 mcg/dL (0.48 micromol/L), and, prior to that, ≥25 mcg/dL (1.21 micromol/L), based upon declining mean population BLLs [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adult lead toxicity</strong> – Mean BLL ≥10 mcg/dL, although there is evidence that chronic lead exposure below 10 mcg/dL is associated with long-term risks [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adult lead poisoning</strong> – Adult lead toxicity accompanied by symptoms or signs. In pregnant individuals, some experts might identify lead poisoning even in the absence of symptoms or signs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111468.html" rel="external">"Occupational and environmental risks to reproduction in females: Specific exposures and impact", section on 'Lead'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Goal BLL</strong> – The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends that BLLs among all adults be reduced to &lt;10 mcg/dL, which is consistent with the current lower levels in the population as well as research concerning long-term effects of low level exposures [<a href="#rid1">1,4,5</a>]. The US Occupational Health and Safety Administration’s (OSHA) standard for lead exposure, which allows workers to continue working in a leaded environment with BLL of 40 mcg/dL, is widely recognized as out of date and not adequately protective of health [<a href="#rid1">1,6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'OSHA and other governmental lead regulations'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H627133467"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The full extent of adult lead poisoning and toxicity is difficult to ascertain because of limited data; existing data and research findings suggest that it remains an important environmental and public health problem even if population levels are decreasing [<a href="#rid4">4,7-9</a>]. In 2016, the estimated prevalence of BLL ≥10 mcg/dL was 16 per 100,000 employed adults according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program, which monitors laboratory-reported elevated BLL among employed adults in 26 states [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of elevated lead levels is decreasing in the United States [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. The prevalence of BLL ≥25 mcg/dL decreased from 14 to 2.8 per 100,000 employed adults from 1994 to 2016 [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. There were also decreases in the percentage of adults with BLL ≥10 mcg/dL, from 3.1 to 0.7 percent for ages 20 to 59 years and from 6.5 to 0.7 percent for ages &gt;60 years between 1991 and 1994 and between 1999 and 2002 [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The background mean BLL in the adult population is now &lt;1 mcg/dL. Available data from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that, from 2017 to 2018, average adult BLL was 0.855 mcg/dL and the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile BLL was 2.62 mcg/dL, with higher levels among adult males than females [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H615488032"><span class="h1">LEAD SOURCES AND ABSORPTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Sources of exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among adults, the majority of lead exposure occurs in the workplace [<a href="#rid5">5,11</a>]. However, there are many other sources of exposure, including the home environment, hobbies, environmental exposure, and unintentional oral ingestion of material contaminated with lead  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53953" href="/d/graphic/53953.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Sources of exposure to lead include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Workplace exposure</strong> – Workplace exposure to lead can occur in numerous settings, including work that involves batteries, pigments or paint, paper-hanging, lead and ore mining, smelting and refining, welding, soldering, ammunitions, shooting ranges, car radiators, cable and wires, construction and demolition, some cosmetics, ceramics with lead glazes, plumbing, and tin cans [<a href="#rid5">5,13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Paint</strong> – Lead paint exposure can occur occupationally or in the residence [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The lead content of paint was unregulated in the United States until 1977, so lead paint is widely dispersed in homes as well as on five billion square feet of nonresidential surfaces in the United States (eg, most steel bridges) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Construction workers, residents (especially children), and do-it-yourself home renovators in lead-painted homes can also sustain heavy exposure to lead [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. There are also rare situations of lead poisoning occurring in adults and older children with autism who have pica and eat lead paint or soil that may be contaminated with lead [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>]. Lead from paint also increases soil lead levels when natural disasters (eg, hurricanes) destroy homes [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gasoline</strong> – Formerly, most lead in the air originated from automobile exhaust [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The introduction of lead-free gasoline in the 1980s contributed to a 99 percent decrease in air lead levels in the United States and consequently a decrease in average blood lead levels (BLLs) [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. Use of leaded gasoline has declined worldwide, particularly in industrialized countries, but it is still used in aviation, racing cars, some farm equipment, marine engines, and in some countries (eg, Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Yemen, Myanmar, North Korea), conventional automobiles.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bullets</strong> – Leaded bullets can lead to lead toxicity through a variety of mechanisms. At firing ranges, exposure occurs due to dust generated from use of leaded bullets [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>]. Leaching from bullets also raises lead levels in those who consume wild game that has been hunted using lead bullets [<a href="#rid26">26</a>] and in individuals with retained lead bullet fragments, especially when located in a body fluid compartment such as intra-articularly [<a href="#rid27">27-29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Drinking water</strong> – Drinking water can be contaminated with lead both from external source contamination as well as from passage through lead or lead-soldered pipes with corrosion. In 1991, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the Lead and Copper Rule, with subsequent updates to minimize lead and copper levels through various measures to reduce corrosivity, and established an action level for lead of 15 mcg/L, with an ideal maximum contaminant level goal of zero [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. 15 mcg/L is not a health-based benchmark, but rather a level based upon the feasibility of public water systems to control corrosion in their distribution system.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In 2014 in Flint, Michigan, the source of municipal drinking water was switched from treated Lake Huron water to water from the Flint River, which was more corrosive and did not contain corrosion inhibitors, leading to more lead leaching from the city's aging service lines into the municipal water supply [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Drinking water lead levels varied widely, with multiple reports of water lead levels greater than 100 mcg/L [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After the switch, among children younger than age 5, there was an increase in the proportion of children with BLL &gt;5 mcg/dL (from 2.4 to 4.9 percent) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Among those tested, 10 children had BLL greater than 5 mcg, nine had levels between 5 to 9 mcg/dL, and one had a BLL between 10 to 14 mcg/dL [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. However, the impact of the exposure on BLL is likely underestimated since there were no surveillance studies performed on formula-fed infants, pregnant individuals, or the general adult population.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A study including females of childbearing age in Flint found no evidence of a spike in BLL during the water crisis period compared with levels measured before and immediately after [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. However, sample sizes were modest (&lt;100) and the included subjects were different (ie, this was not a longitudinal study involving the same individuals), thus reducing the ability to draw conclusions from the comparisons. In a separate study of newborn cord BLL (which reflect maternal lead exposure) comparing Flint with Detroit populations, there was a higher prevalence of cord BLL &gt;1 mcg/dL in Flint compared with Detroit mothers [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. However, the data were confined to births that occurred mostly after the Flint water crisis, limiting the ability to draw conclusions. Overall, although adults are known to absorb less dietary lead (including water) than children, it is likely that some adult lead exposure occurred, a concern given the increasing evidence of the impact of low-level exposure on adult health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, as well as implications for fetal lead exposure. A report commissioned by the Governor of Michigan concluded that the exposure was "a story of government failure… unpreparedness, delay, inaction, and environmental injustice" [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For most adults, drinking water with elevations mildly above the EPA action level of 15 parts per billion (15 mcg/L) for lead may not contribute significantly to their overall BLL, but the risks may be greater for infants and small children given that their gastrointestinal absorption of dietary lead is typically substantially higher than that of adults. There is not a simple calculation to correlate lead in drinking water with BLL, since there may be various contributing factors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There are measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of lead from drinking water [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. In addition, individuals who repair or remove older leaded pipes (eg, plumbers, construction workers) may encounter considerable lead exposure.<strong> </strong>Additional information about lead in drinking water is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6493.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention", section on 'Water'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cosmetics and personal care products</strong> – These products sometimes contain lead that can cause toxicity. As an example, litargirio (also known as litharge or lead monoxide), a lead-based powder used particularly by people in some communities as an antiperspirant/deodorant, foot fungicide, burn/wound healing treatment, or for other purposes as a traditional remedy [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]; and tiro, an eye cosmetic from Nigeria [<a href="#rid38">38</a>], have caused lead toxicity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Illegally distilled alcohol ("moonshine”)</strong> – Sometimes made in stills with lead-containing solder, moonshine liquor can expose drinkers to lead. In one study comparing consumers of moonshine with non-consumers, the median BLL was higher (11.0 versus 2.5 mcg/dL [0.53 versus 0.12 micromol/L]), and the percentage of patients with BLL ≥25 mcg/dL (1.21 micromol/L) was higher (26 versus 0 percent) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Herbal supplements</strong> – In one study, BLL was 10 percent higher among females who used herbal supplements compared with non-users, although mean BLL was low in both male and female users (&lt;2.0 mcg/dL [0.97 micromol/L]) [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. BLL was also found to be higher among females reporting use of Ayurvedic [<a href="#rid41">41</a>] and/or traditional Chinese medicine herbs, as well as St. John's wort, compared with non-users [<a href="#rid42">42-44</a>]. BLLs were found to be elevated in adult users of <em>rasashastra</em> Ayurvedic medications in New York City, and the medications when analyzed contained lead, mercury, and arsenic at levels above permissible limits [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. There is also a case report of 31-year-old male in India taking many supplements for body building who developed lead poisoning [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Others</strong> – Lead exposure can occur with other exposures as well [<a href="#rid5">5,17,47</a>], including the use of lead-glazed tableware or cookware [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>] and the use of oral radiographic film that was stored in lead-lined boxes, where lead dust deposited on the film resulted in lead exposure during a dental radiograph [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Lead has also been found as an adulterant in marijuana [<a href="#rid51">51</a>], opium [<a href="#rid52">52,53</a>], candy [<a href="#rid54">54</a>], lipstick [<a href="#rid55">55</a>], cake-decorating products [<a href="#rid56">56</a>], and other consumer products.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Living near a major source of occupational lead exposure can cause lead toxicity. For example, mass lead intoxication has been reported among people living around lead battery manufacturing and recycling plants or artisanal gold mines, particularly in low-income countries [<a href="#rid57">57-61</a>].</p><p></p><p>The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the EPA maintain lists of <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atsdr.cdc.gov%2Fcsem%2Fleadtoxicity%2Flead_found.html&amp;token=j%2BtF41plvYHq0KcVLVNCgqxAd0%2FB81P2DFQIrQVK%2Btk%2BRdmVzN%2FZjG0GHtXbEYBwOkWUAoevaD2lBVoQqwd77Q%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2773" target="_blank">sources of lead exposure</a> (including <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Flead%2Fprotect-your-family-exposures-lead&amp;token=8nhqRPgfpp%2FQSAqk1Cz%2BV4yQ6jHfmFMmI7sP0MqUeMip7h4%2BQYFFtz77VuZUIR0sO3f8o4Q7w2foWpwNyorTla8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2773" target="_blank">the home environment</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H793246814"><span class="h2">Lead absorption and distribution</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lead is absorbed into the body through the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and to a lesser extent, the skin  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99977" href="/d/graphic/99977.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The respiratory tract is the most significant route of lead absorption in adults, with an average absorption rate of approximately 50 percent [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Respiratory exposures can occur with activities such as scraping, sanding, or burning leaded paint from surfaces as well as with various smelting/burning/welding processes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The gastrointestinal tract is not the major route of absorption for adults, but can be a significant contributor, particularly for those working or eating in a lead-contaminated environment.
