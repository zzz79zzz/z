         Nearly all cases of pulmonic valve stenosis (PS) are congenital in origin, and most cases occur as an isolated lesion. Acquired cases of stenosis of the native pulmonary valve are encountered less commonly and may be caused by carcinoid or rheumatic heart disease (in which case PS is always associated with other valve abnormalities). (See

         The natural history and treatment of congenital valvular PS will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and evaluation of PS and management of pregnancy and PS are discussed separately. (See

         Right ventricular (RV) outflow obstruction may also persist or occur after surgical reconstruction for congenital cardiac disorders such as tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, truncus arteriosus, double outlet RV, or transposition of the great arteries with PS. Reconstruction often entails the placement of a pulmonary valve prosthesis, right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery homograft, or valved conduit, which will degenerate over time, and can manifest as stenosis, regurgitation, or both. Management of these conditions is discussed separately. (See

         Congenital pulmonic valve stenosis (PS) occurs in three predominant forms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Although these are distinct forms under direct visualization, echocardiography in adults may not distinguish leaflets well enough to clearly determine valve morphology.

         <strong>
          Dome-shaped
         </strong>
         – Most cases involve dome-shaped PS, which is characterized by a narrow central opening with preserved valve motion. Three rudimentary raphes are generally present without clear-cut commissures. The pulmonary trunk may be dilated due to a medial abnormality and eccentric flow from the stenotic valve. Calcification of the valve is rare but is noted in some older patients.

         <strong>
          Pulmonic valve dysplasia
         </strong>
         – Approximately 20 percent of cases involve pulmonic valve dysplasia, with thickened valve cusps and relative immobility of the valve, often associated with severe stenosis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91432" href="/z/d/graphic/91432.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ). Dysplastic pulmonic valves are often associated with hypoplasia of the pulmonary annulus and proximal pulmonary artery and are not commonly associated with pulmonary artery dilation. Dysplastic pulmonic valves are a common component of Noonan syndrome, occurring in up to half of patients in some studies. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8120.html" rel="external">

          Associated with complex congenital heart disease
         </strong>
         – More complex congenital heart disease, such as cases of tetralogy of Fallot or transposition of the great arteries, may be associated with a unicuspid or bicuspid pulmonic valve, which may be obstructive. (See

         The natural history and approach to therapy of pulmonic valve stenosis (PS) are determined by the hemodynamic severity of the obstruction.
        </p>
        <p>
         The severity of PS is classified by major society guidelines using the following echocardiographic criteria [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]:

          Mild PS
         </strong>
         is identified by a peak Doppler gradient across the valve &lt;36 mmHg (equal to peak Doppler jet velocity &lt;3 m/s) [
         <a href="#rid1">

          Moderate PS
         </strong>
         is identified by a peak Doppler gradient of 36 to 64 mmHg (peak jet velocity of 3 to 4 m/s) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2

         <strong>
          Severe PS
         </strong>
         is identified by a peak Doppler gradient &gt;64 mmHg (peak jet velocity of &gt;4 m/s) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2

         Doppler gradient &gt;35 mmHg [
         <a href="#rid2">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The above thresholds for PS apply to patients with normal RV systolic function. Patients with severe RV systolic dysfunction may have a low stroke volume, and Doppler gradients may underestimate severity of stenosis, similar to low flow, low gradient aortic stenosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although mean gradients have been less commonly used to quantify PS, the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines for adults with congenital heart disease include a mean gradient criterion for severe PS since this may reflect the catheter-derived peak-to-peak gradients more accurately than do peak Doppler gradients [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. A study of 90 patients with isolated PS found that the mean Doppler gradient more accurately reflected the catheter-derived peak-to-peak gradient [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The peak Doppler gradient averaged 24 mmHg higher than the catheter-derived peak-to-peak gradient. Additionally, the studies that demonstrated the effectiveness of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement in patients with prosthetic pulmonic valves or pulmonary homografts used mean gradients as an inclusion criterion. Consequently, mean gradient is commonly used when deciding treatment timing for patients with RV outflow obstruction. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86481.html" rel="external">
          "Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, most patients with congenital PS do not have significant pulmonic regurgitation (PR); mixed PS and PR is more commonly seen with acquired pulmonary valve disease or after intervention for PS. (See

         Pulmonic valve stenosis (PS) in children is usually associated with a benign clinical course, and excellent treatment options are available for severe cases. Thus, there is a high rate of survival into adulthood.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients with PS are asymptomatic [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The life-expectancy in patients with isolated PS is similar to that of the general population [
         <a href="#rid4">

         Mild PS causes no symptoms. If a patient with mild PS has symptoms, the symptoms should not be attributed to PS. Some adults with mild stenosis will have been diagnosed during childhood [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ], but many cases will have gone undetected. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The course during adulthood is generally benign with little progression of stenosis and a persistently high functional status in most patients. In the Natural History Study of Congenital Heart Defects (NHS), for example, among patients with baseline peak systolic valve gradient &lt;25 mmHg, 96 percent were free of operation at 10-year follow-up [
         <a href="#rid4">

         Moderate PS is often detected in childhood and is frequently symptomatic. Dyspnea on exertion and fatigue may occur due to the limitation of RV cardiac output. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14578.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         A minority of patients with moderate PS receive a pulmonic valve procedure during childhood, as discussed separately. These individuals generally survive into adulthood with life expectancies that are not different from the general population [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Long-term follow-up of patients in the NHS found that only 4 percent who had surgical valvotomy or balloon valvotomy in childhood required reoperation [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with moderate stenosis treated medically in childhood may fare well into adulthood, although some may show evidence of progression of stenosis and require an intervention [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6

         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Both groups had low levels of cardiac drug use (4 percent) and excellent clinical status as defined by New York Heart Association criteria (97 percent were in class I)  (

         Severe PS most often presents in childhood with right ventricular failure and cyanosis. Severe valvular PS does not spontaneously remit and may progress over time, resulting in elevated RV end-diastolic pressure and risk of irreversible RV dysfunction. (See

         </span>
         The decision to perform a valve intervention depends on the valve anatomy, severity (gradient), and symptoms. In most cases, the valve is amenable to balloon valvotomy (dome-shaped or selected dysplastic valves that are amenable to balloon valvotomy). Surgical valve intervention may be preferred or required if the anatomy is not favorable (dysplastic pulmonic valves not amenable to balloon valvotomy, an associated hypoplastic pulmonary annulus, severe pulmonic regurgitation (PR), or subvalvular or supravalvular pulmonic stenosis [PS]), if balloon valvotomy fails to relieve the stenosis, or if the patient is undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication (eg, severe tricuspid regurgitation)  (

         – For patients with moderate PS (36 to 64 mmHg) with associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cyanosis from interatrial right-to-left communication, and/or exercise intolerance), we suggest intervention (generally balloon valvotomy). (See

         Patients with mild stenosis are generally asymptomatic and do not require intervention. Asymptomatic patients with moderate stenosis also generally do not require intervention, although they should be monitored for worsening of the gradient and/or development of symptoms. (See

         There are no definite indications for intervening for an asymptomatic dilated pulmonary artery, as these are low-pressure aneurysms with an extremely low risk of dissection or rupture. Repair for evidence of symptomatic compression of neighboring structures and repair at the time of valve replacement are reasonable approaches. Some suggest elective repair for pulmonary artery aneurysms over 80 mm and individualized management for all other patients [

         Most patients with pulmonic valve stenosis (PS) requiring intervention are candidates for balloon valvotomy. For patients with PS who are not candidates for balloon valvotomy, options include surgical intervention (valvotomy or replacement) and transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation. Surgical intervention may be preferred in patients with a concurrent indication for cardiac surgery. (See

         Pulmonic regurgitation (PR) commonly develops after balloon valvotomy or surgical valvotomy for pulmonic valve stenosis (PS), with higher rates of significant PR observed after surgical valvotomy. While mild degrees of PR are well tolerated, more significant PR may result in RV enlargement and dysfunction sufficient to consider pulmonary valve replacement. Imaging criteria (eg, echocardiographic or cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging criteria for RV dilation or dysfunction) for intervention for PR in asymptomatic patients post-balloon valvotomy or surgical valvotomy for isolated PS have not been established. While some practitioners may utilize criteria for other diseases for which PR is a common sequela, such as tetralogy of Fallot, data are lacking to support such an approach.

          Forms of congenital pulmonic stenosis
         </strong>
         – Congenital pulmonic valve stenosis (PS) occurs in three predominant forms: dome-shaped (the most common form), pulmonic valve dysplasia, and PS associated with complex congenital heart disease in which the valve may be unicuspid or bicuspid. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Grading PS
         </strong>
         – The severity of PS is classified according to either the peak or mean Doppler echocardiographic gradients across the valve. Although peak gradients have been more commonly used, the mean gradients may more accurately reflect catheter-derived peak-to-peak gradients. The pulmonary valve gradient may be affected by right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction. (See
         <a class="local">

          Natural history
         </strong>
         – The majority of adult patients with PS have mild stenosis and are asymptomatic. Patients with moderate PS may develop symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue. Patients with severe stenosis commonly have symptoms and are at risk for developing progressive RV hypertrophy and both systolic and diastolic dysfunction if the PS is left untreated (See
         <a class="local">

          Indications for valve intervention
         </strong>
         – The decision to perform a valve intervention depends on the valve anatomy, severity (gradient), and symptom status  (

          algorithm 1

          Severe stenosis
         </strong>
         – For patients with severe PS (Doppler peak gradient &gt;64 mmHg or mean Doppler gradient &gt;35 mmHg), we recommend pulmonic valve intervention (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). Patients with severe PS are usually symptomatic and are likely to develop progressive RV hypertrophy with systolic and diastolic RV dysfunction if not corrected. For patients with asymptomatic severe PS who are not candidates for balloon valvotomy, timing of intervention is based upon an individualized assessment weighing the risks and benefits of valve replacement.

          Moderate stenosis with associated symptoms
         </strong>
         – For patients with moderate PS (36 to 64 mmHg) with associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, exercise intolerance), we suggest pulmonic valve intervention (

         For patients who are not optimal candidates for balloon valvotomy, options include surgical intervention (valvotomy or replacement) or transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement. Surgical intervention is usually preferred in patients undergoing concurrent cardiac surgery. (See

         Balloon valvotomy, surgical pulmonary valve replacement, surgical valvotomy, and transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement procedures are generally well tolerated, with higher procedural risk associated with surgical intervention. (See

         The main long-term complication of balloon or surgical valvotomy is PR, which may be more prominent after surgical valvotomy. Patients with moderate or greater PR may develop RV enlargement and/or dysfunction. Options for management of PR include transcatheter or surgical pulmonary valve replacement.  (
