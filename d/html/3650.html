While HCV infection is estimated to account for 15 percent of symptomatic cases of acute hepatitis in the United States, the majority of patients with acute HCV go undetected [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. This is due in large part to the fact that patients with acute HCV are typically asymptomatic. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that there were 33,900 new HCV infections in 2015, of which only 2436 cases were reported [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This reflects a nearly three-fold increase in the incidence of HCV infection over a five-year period, which parallels the rising rates of injection drug use  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116122" href="/d/graphic/116122.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). </p><p>This topic will review acute HCV in adults. Issues related to the transmission of HCV, screening for HCV, and managing patients with chronic HCV are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3675.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3672.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3673.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89950.html" rel="external">"Screening and diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H32277948"><span class="h1">GUIDELINES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of HCV infection were released jointly by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), are continuously updated, and can be accessed at <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hcvguidelines.org%2F&amp;token=sL%2Bp%2BgWoM5K8OZ3TcR7z2aLRyWCGNBK9vbXZNzy9A7wOhWa41Lo4fh2xvvlb%2BhyX&amp;TOPIC_ID=3650" target="_blank">www.hcvguidelines.org</a> [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The discussion in this topic is generally consistent with those guidelines.</p><p>Links to these and other guidelines can be found below. (See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H495128408"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients who are acutely infected with HCV are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients may experience jaundice, nausea, dark urine, and right upper quadrant pain. Patients with acute HCV infection typically have moderate to high serum aminotransferase elevations (see <a class="local">'Laboratory findings'</a> below). These may go undetected in asymptomatic patients. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H936452947"><span class="h2">Timing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients who are symptomatic, symptoms typically develop 2 to 26 weeks after exposure to HCV, with a mean onset of 7 to 8 weeks [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The acute illness usually lasts for 2 to 12 weeks. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H164593365"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of patients with acute HCV are asymptomatic. In a review that included five studies from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Study of Transfusion-Associated Non-A, Non-B, and Type C Hepatitis, more than two-thirds of patients with acute HCV were asymptomatic during the acute episode [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Among those patients presenting with symptomatic acute HCV infection, jaundice is commonly reported. In a study that included 51 patients with symptomatic acute HCV, patients reported jaundice (68 percent), dark urine and white stool (39 percent), nausea (34 percent), and abdominal pain (25 percent, predominantly right upper quadrant pain) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Additional symptoms reported in other studies include fatigue, low-grade fever and chills, loss of appetite, pruritus, muscle aches, mood disturbances, joint pain, dyspepsia, and confusion [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Fulminant hepatic failure due to acute HCV infection is very rare but may be more common in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis B virus infection [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Conversely, spontaneous clearance of acute HCV infection is also more common in people with underlying current or past hepatitis B virus infection [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3574.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in adults: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H164593372"><span class="h2">Laboratory findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aminotransferase levels are often greater than 10 to 20 times the upper limit of normal in patients with acute HCV, but can be highly variable [<a href="#rid13">13-16</a>]. In one of the largest series that included 259 patients with acute HCV, the mean alanine aminotransferase was 1174 unit/L, with a range of 5 to 5185 unit/L (20 microkat/L, range 0.09 to 88 microkat/L) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. During the course of acute infection, aminotransferase levels can vary widely within short time intervals, in contrast to chronic infection, during which they are often elevated but relatively stable over time [<a href="#rid9">9,17,18</a>]. </p><p>Among patients who develop symptoms, the aminotransferases start to increase shortly before the onset of clinical symptoms and usually before anti-HCV antibodies are detectable. However, since the levels often fluctuate (sometimes quite widely) and may even normalize, not all patients will have elevated aminotransferase levels at the time of presentation. Normalization of the serum aminotransferase concentrations after acute infection does not necessarily mean that the infection has cleared.</p><p>Patients with acute HCV infection may also have elevated total bilirubin levels [<a href="#rid9">9,15,19,20</a>]. In the study of 259 patients, 51 percent had a bilirubin level above 3 mg/dL (51 micromol/L) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In a second study with 28 patients with acute HCV, the mean bilirubin concentration was 4.4 mg/dL (75 micromol/L) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A detectable HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the setting of undetectable anti-HCV antibodies that subsequently become detectable within 12 weeks is generally considered definitive proof of acute HCV infection. Alternately, newly detectable HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibodies with documentation of negative tests within the prior six months is also diagnostic of acute HCV infection. In the absence of such documentation, the distinction between acute HCV infection and newly discovered chronic infection is not straightforward, since in both settings patients may have detectable HCV RNA, HCV antibodies, and elevated serum aminotransferases. </p><p>Diagnosing acute HCV infection is important as spontaneous clearance can still occur, treatment regimens may differ from those in chronic infection, and a careful history can identify risk factors for ongoing transmission. The approach to diagnosis of acute HCV infection differs slightly depending on the clinical presentation, whether the patient presents with acute hepatitis or with a distinct HCV exposure. This is discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H936453010"><span class="h2">Diagnostic approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute HCV infection should be suspected in patients with clinical manifestations of acute hepatitis or with possible recent exposure to HCV (eg, needle-stick injury, recent injection drug use). Such patients should be tested for the presence of HCV RNA and antibodies in the serum. The timing of testing is influenced by when HCV RNA and antibodies become detectable in the blood  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68723" href="/d/graphic/68723.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60223" href="/d/graphic/60223.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H936453016"><span class="h3">Patients with acute hepatitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For a patient presenting for the first time with acute hepatitis (eg, markedly elevated transaminases and/or jaundice), we immediately obtain HCV RNA by PCR and anti-HCV antibody testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101863" href="/d/graphic/101863.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Establishing the diagnosis of acute hepatitis C or the need for further testing for acute HCV depends on results of these tests:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HCV RNA negative </strong>– Acute HCV infection is unlikely. Typically, HCV RNA is detectable by the time a patient has symptoms. If the HCV antibody is positive at this time point but the HCV RNA is negative, that is suggestive of a prior, cleared HCV infection, and this should be confirmed with repeat HCV RNA after 12 weeks. Follow-up confirmatory HCV RNA testing in this situation is important since HCV RNA levels can fluctuate widely during acute HCV infection and may even become transiently undetectable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a person with acute hepatitis and repeatedly negative HCV RNA, an alternative etiology for acute hepatitis should be sought. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3576.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests", section on 'Marked elevation without liver failure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HCV RNA positive and HCV antibody negative</strong> – Acute HCV infection is likely. We then either treat immediately (see <a class="local">'Management'</a> below) or recheck HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody in 12 weeks (or a total of 12 weeks following a known or presumed exposure). Most patients will develop anti-HCV antibodies by 12 weeks after exposure, and it is preferable to make a diagnosis as soon as possible to help guide management. A positive anti-HCV result at this subsequent time point confirms seroconversion and acute HCV infection. Persistently detectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks indicates a high risk for subsequent chronic infection, whereas a negative HCV RNA suggests spontaneous viral clearance, which requires confirmation with repeat HCV RNA testing after another 12 weeks because HCV RNA can become transiently undetectable during acute infection. (See <a class="local">'Spontaneous viral clearance'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HCV RNA positive and HCV antibody positive</strong> – This pattern confirms HCV infection, but in isolation, cannot distinguish between acute and chronic infection. If there is documentation of a serum sample within the prior six months with negative HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody, then acute HCV infection is diagnosed. Similarly, if there is documentation of a recent negative HCV RNA following treatment or spontaneous clearance of a prior HCV infection, acute reinfection is likely. In the absence of such documentation, the distinction between acute HCV infection and newly discovered chronic infection is not straightforward since, in both settings, patients may have detectable HCV RNA, anti-HCV antibodies, and elevated serum aminotransferases. In some cases, there is suggestive circumstantial evidence for new infection, such as a history of a recent high-risk exposure, new clinical features of acute hepatitis (including the degree of elevation of the transaminases), consistently normal aminotransferase levels on prior testing, and absence of risk factors for HCV infection in the past. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Repeat HCV RNA testing (eg, at least six weeks later) might help to distinguish acute from chronic infection in this setting. Fluctuating and/or low levels of HCV RNA are suggestive of acute HCV, whereas higher HCV levels that do not fluctuate are suggestive of chronic infection. As an example, in one report, low HCV RNA levels (&lt;10<sup>5</sup> international units/mL) were seen in 17 of 21 patients with acute HCV (81 percent) compared with 81 of 623 patients with chronic HCV (13 percent) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Viral load fluctuations during a 10-week period among those with acute HCV were &gt;1 log in 18 patients (86 percent). In contrast, other studies have found that viral load fluctuations in chronic infection tend to be less than 1 log international units/mL over many years of infection [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3672.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Viral levels'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Similarly, aminotransferase levels fluctuate more widely in acute than chronic HCV infection. Markedly elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in a patient with newly diagnosed HCV infection should raise suspicion for acute infection, particularly if history reveals recent risk exposures. Although there is no clearly defined threshold, we explore the possibility of acute HCV infection in patients with ALT levels above 300 units/L with no other explanation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Finally, evidence of hepatic fibrosis can suggest chronic rather than acute infection, although this can be misleading if the patient has other potential causes of liver disease (such as heavy alcohol use). Fibrosis assessment is not needed to establish the diagnosis of HCV infection, but it can help differentiate acute from chronic HCV in cases where there is doubt. Noninvasive measures of fibrosis can be used instead of biopsy; however, the marked inflammation that can occur during acute HCV infection can falsely elevate fibrosis scores with transient elastography or serum panels that include aminotransferases (eg, APRI (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/101830.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>)or FIB-4 (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/109106.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>) calculations) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1239.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: Overview of serologic tests and imaging examinations"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>For patients who have acute HCV infection, we repeat interval HCV RNA testing to evaluate for spontaneous clearance. (See <a class="local">'Spontaneous viral clearance'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to diagnostic testing for acute HCV infection, evaluation of patients presenting with acute hepatitis includes testing for other causes (eg, hepatitis B virus infection, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatotoxicity). This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3576.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests", section on 'Elevated serum aminotransferases'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H936453022"><span class="h3">Patients with discrete HCV exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For a patient presenting following a known, discrete exposure to HCV (eg, needle-stick injury, recent injection drug use), we first obtain tests for HCV RNA, HCV Ab, and serum aminotransferases to establish the baseline HCV status  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101864" href="/d/graphic/101864.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Within one to two days following an exposure, a patient without prior infection should have negative HCV RNA, negative HCV Ab, and normal aminotransferases. Thus, this baseline HCV status can be used to document subsequent new seroconversion (if the exposure leads to infection) or to establish previously undiagnosed chronic HCV infection. Further testing depends on the results of the HCV RNA test:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Negative baseline HCV RNA </strong>– Individuals who have negative HCV RNA at baseline are at risk for new HCV infection following an exposure. In such patients, we repeat testing to monitor for HCV infection: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Four weeks after exposure: HCV RNA and serum aminotransferases (anti-HCV antibody is not expected to be detectable at this time if it was negative at baseline)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Three to four months after exposure: HCV RNA, anti-HCV antibody (if not previously positive), and serum aminotransferases</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Six months after exposure: HCV RNA, anti-HCV antibody (if not previously positive)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Elevated aminotransferases at the above time points would be a trigger to check HCV RNA sooner if not already detectable. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>HCV RNA becomes detectable</strong> – If the HCV RNA becomes detectable at one of the time points above, acute HCV infection is diagnosed. We then recheck anti-HCV antibody (if not already detected at one of these time points) 12 weeks later to confirm seroconversion and acute HCV. For such patients, we also repeat HCV RNA testing to evaluate for spontaneous clearance or initiate treatment. (See <a class="local">'Spontaneous viral clearance'</a> below and <a class="local">'Management'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>HCV RNA remains undetectable</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients who have a baseline positive anti-HCV antibody (suggestive of prior spontaneously cleared or treated HCV infection), if HCV RNA remains negative throughout the testing period outlined above, HCV reinfection has not occurred, and testing can be stopped. If there is ongoing risk of exposure (eg, continued injection drug use or sexual exposure, particularly HIV-positive men who have sex with men), repeated screening for reinfection can be performed with HCV RNA testing [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients who had a baseline negative anti-HCV antibody, if HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody remain negative during the testing period, then HCV infection has not occurred, and testing can be stopped. In some cases, the anti-HCV antibody becomes reactive over time but the HCV RNA remains undetectable. This suggests acute HCV infection with spontaneous clearance and is confirmed when HCV RNA remains negative over 12 weeks and for at least six months after exposure. In rare instances, anti-HCV antibody may not become detectable after an acute infection, either because of a low inoculum with spontaneous clearance or an immunocompromising condition (eg, advanced HIV infection or hemodialysis), even if chronic infection ensues. With the newest generation HCV antibody assays, however, false-negative results are rare.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These recommendations for post-exposure testing are generally similar to those suggested by other expert guidelines, with slight differences in testing intervals [<a href="#rid5">5,24,25</a>]. As an example, in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that, following an HCV exposure, health care personnel who have negative baseline HCV testing be tested with HCV RNA three to six weeks later [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. If that HCV RNA test is negative, they should be tested again with anti-HCV antibody with reflex HCV RNA testing at four to six months; health care personnel who are immunocompromised or have underlying liver disease can be re-tested with HCV RNA at that time even if the anti-HCV antibody is negative. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3647.html" rel="external">"Prevention of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection among health care providers"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis treatment is not recommended.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Detectable baseline HCV RNA</strong> – Individuals with a detectable HCV RNA are HCV infected. If the anti-HCV antibody is also positive, this likely indicates preexisting chronic infection, although it can also represent an acute reinfection after prior spontaneous clearance or successful treatment. Aside from history, the level of ALT and other features mentioned above can help distinguish preexisting chronic infection from an acute reinfection. If the anti-HCV antibody is negative with a detectable baseline HCV RNA, this suggests acute HCV infection, particularly if the exposure was more than a few days prior. In such cases, we recheck the anti-HCV antibody at 12 weeks to confirm seroconversion and repeat HCV RNA testing to evaluate for spontaneous clearance. A small proportion of immunocompromised individuals (eg, those with advanced HIV infection or on hemodialysis) may not develop antibodies; however, this is rare with the newest generation HCV antibody tests.

Harm-reduction strategies, including opiate agonist therapy, should be recommended for patients who use injection drugs to reduce transmission risk and to reduce the risk of overdose and other drug use-related harms.

These benefits may be greatest with immediate treatment (eg, at the first detection of a positive HCV RNA), which is the approach endorsed by the joint AASLD/IDSA guidelines [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, some patients may reasonably prefer to wait to see if they achieve spontaneous clearance and avoid unnecessary treatment. In this case, we typically recheck the HCV RNA at 12 weeks following the estimated date of infection (since most patients who spontaneously clear HCV will do so within this time frame) and initiate treatment if still detectable (see <a class="local">'Spontaneous viral clearance'</a> below). Patients who opt for this approach should be counseled on the need for follow-up and the risks of transmission.

The high efficacy rates of DAA regimens for chronic HCV infection (cure rates &gt;95 percent) reduce this efficacy benefit of treating early.

Excluding those with nonvirologic failure (death, reinfection, loss-to-follow-up), SVR rates were 90 versus 98 percent in the 6- versus 12-week arms.

Several more recent studies of acute HCV infection report spontaneous viral clearance around 50 percent [<a href="#rid57">57-62</a>].</p><p>A number of biologic factors are associated with spontaneous clearance. Patients with symptomatic acute HCV infection are more likely to have spontaneous clearance than asymptomatic patients [<a href="#rid8">8,53,63,64</a>]. In a study of patients with acute HCV, spontaneous clearance occurred in 24 of 46 patients (52 percent) who were symptomatic and in 0 of 9 who were asymptomatic [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Symptoms are thought to reflect a more robust immune response targeting the virus, which leads to more rapid HCV RNA decline and increases the likelihood of clearance [<a href="#rid18">18,46,56,65</a>].</p><p>Other factors consistently associated with a higher chance of spontaneous clearance include younger age at acquisition, female sex [<a href="#rid55">55,66</a>], genotype 1 (versus non-1 [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]), and polymorphisms in the interferon-lambda 4 gene [<a href="#rid55">55,56,66-68</a>]. Chronic or resolved (ie, HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive) hepatitis B infection is also associated with spontaneous clearance, whereas HIV coinfection is associated with persistence [<a href="#rid12">12,69</a>]. Those who have previously had spontaneous clearance are more likely to have clearance again upon reinfection, but clearance of chronic infection following successful treatment does not appear to influence the risk of spontaneous clearance following reinfection [<a href="#rid66">66,70</a>].</p><p>The wide variability in estimated clearance rates across studies may be due, in part, to the study methodology used. Because not all exposed individuals develop antibodies and antibody titers wane over time and may eventually disappear, spontaneous clearance rates may be underestimated by population-based studies that use the prevalence of anti-HCV antibody positivity and HCV PCR negativity in untreated patients to identify clearance. Consistent with this explanation, prospective studies consistently report higher clearance rates than retrospective population-based studies. In addition, for those with ongoing risk factors, such as continued injection drug use, some episodes of spontaneous clearance may be missed if reinfection occurs in between testing intervals. This may, in part, explain the relatively low rates of clearance (20 percent or less) among people who use injection drugs [<a href="#rid60">60,71,72</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3634966778"><span class="h2">Timing of viral clearance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients who are destined to spontaneously clear HCV viremia do so within 12 weeks [<a href="#rid8">8,18,73</a>]. </p><p>As an example, in a study of 27 patients with acute HCV infection who were not receiving treatment, 8 patients (30 percent) spontaneously cleared the virus, 88 percent of whom did so before week 12 (with the final patient doing so at week 14) [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. </p><p>However, spontaneous clearance after longer follow-up, up to two years after initial infection, has also been described, although this may be in part related to differing methodology [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. The International Collaboration of Incident HIV and Hepatitis C in Injecting Cohorts (InC3) combined cohorts of people who actively injected drugs, were anti-HCV negative at entry, and underwent routine serial screening for HCV infection [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Of 632 individuals in whom acute HCV infection was diagnosed through seroconversion, 25 percent spontaneously cleared the virus within one year, at a median of 16 weeks after the estimated date of infection. Among those who cleared, 34, 67, and 83 percent had cleared the virus by 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Although this is one of the largest studies to evaluate spontaneous HCV clearance, the longer times to clearance compared with smaller studies may be due, in part, to the methodology used to estimate the date of infection (defined in this study as the midpoint between the last negative and the first positive HCV antibody test). It is likely that the date of infection estimated by this approach was earlier than the true date of infection for many individuals, and this would result in longer estimated times to clearance.</p><p>Patients who achieve spontaneous viral clearance should be aware that they remain at risk of reinfection if they are again exposed to HCV. Although the antibody to HCV is not protective against reinfection, reinfection after spontaneous clearance is associated with a shorter duration, lower peak of viremia, and a higher chance of spontaneous clearance, suggesting a degree of protective immunity [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. </p><p>Once chronic infection ensues, typically an average of six months after exposure, spontaneous clearance is very infrequent. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up studies have documented that spontaneous clearance of chronic infection does occasionally occur. In a large Scottish study, spontaneous clearance was reported at a rate of 0.36 per 100 person-years [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].
