         The treatment of coronary heart disease has evolved significantly due in part to improvements in both medical therapy and surgical and percutaneous revascularization techniques. The majority of patients with chronic stable angina are treated with medical therapy, but there are a variety of indications for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention.

         The perioperative and in-hospital mortality rate after CABG will be reviewed here. Cardiac and noncardiac complications of CABG and the long-term outcome after CABG are discussed separately. (See

          OPERATIVE MORTALITY

         </span>
         Using registry data in the United States, the perioperative and in-hospital mortality rate after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) between 1997 and 2001 averaged about 1 percent for the lowest risk elective patients, and 2 to 5 percent for all patients [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. However, the risk is highly dependent upon comorbid disease, postoperative complications, and the hospital volume of CABG procedures [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-6
         </a>
         ]. Patients who undergo CABG at low volume centers are more likely to be at high risk [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ], while patients who undergo CABG at high volume centers are more likely to be at low risk [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         These mortality rates are probably not applicable to all countries. This was illustrated in a report from the National Health Service in Brazil in which the perioperative mortality was 7.0 percent in almost 66,000 CABG procedures performed between 2000 and 2003 [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Possible contributors to this increase in risk are bias (some of the American registries are voluntary and therefore may underestimate events) and a greater number of cases performed in low-volume hospitals. The difference in outcomes may affect clinical decision making on the indications for CABG.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The most effective way of stratifying cardiac surgical patients according to operative risk is to use one of several available risk prediction algorithms that incorporate multiple variables to derive a risk score. One of the most widely used algorithms for this purpose in the United States is that developed by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. This algorithm, which incorporates patient age, sex, and variables reflecting comorbidities as well as the severity and acuity of cardiac disease, is proprietary and available only to institutions participating in the STS database [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Another such algorithm, the EuroSCORE  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82521" href="/z/d/graphic/82521.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), is widely used in Europe [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ], is available and has been validated in a North American population [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One analysis compared the performance of the STS algorithm and the EuroSCORE in predicting the survival of 4497 patients undergoing isolated CABG between 1996 and 2001 [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Overall 30-day mortality was 1.9 percent and was accurately predicted by both risk scores. Within individual deciles of risk, both scores performed well, but the EuroSCORE had significantly greater discriminatory power.
        </p>
        <p>
         A variety of other algorithms are also available for patients undergoing CABG. In a review of 19 such algorithms in 4351 patients undergoing isolated CABG, EuroSCORE had the highest discriminatory power for both 30-day and one-year mortality, followed by algorithms from New York State and the Cleveland Clinic [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].

          Limitations of the models

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The principle limitation of these risk prediction algorithms is that they may not be applicable to patient populations, which differ in one or more significant ways [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. As the patient population changes and as surgical technique changes, risk analyses can become outdated. Thus, the greater discriminatory power of the EuroSCORE in the above analysis may derive, at least in part, from the fact that the patient data upon which it is based were collected in 1995, while those upon which the STS algorithm is based were collected from 1990 to 1993. The STS continues to gather new data to permit progressive algorithm revision.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another example of this limitation is that currently, most patients referred for CABG undergo an elective procedure, but that the risk models discussed above were derived from patients who underwent both elective and urgent/emergent procedures. The ACEF (Age, Creatinine, Ejection fraction) score was derived to address this issue, as it included only three variables and was developed from a population of individuals who underwent elective open heart surgery at a single institution [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. ACEF was able to predict mortality as well as or better than five other more complex risk scores such as EUROSCORE or the Cleveland Clinic model.
        </p>
        <p>
         A related limitation is that, as many patients are candidates for either CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a simple, bedside risk prediction model that could be applied to either procedure would be useful. The Mayo Clinic Risk Score (MCRS), which uses seven preprocedural variables, is the first such model. It was initially validated in a population of patients scheduled to undergo PCI [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1562.html" rel="external">
          "Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         When tested in over 300,000 patients scheduled to undergo isolated CABG surgery in the STS database, there was moderate positive correlation between MCRS and the observed in-hospital mortality [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. When compared to the 26 variable STS algorithm, performance was inferior.

         The in-hospital mortality after CABG is related to the volume of CABG procedures performed at the hospital, as illustrated by the following observations:

         In an analysis of over 900,000 CABG procedures in the Medicare database between 1994 and 1999, the adjusted in-hospital or 30-day mortality was inversely related to hospital volume, ranging from 6.1 percent for hospitals performing &lt;230 procedures per year to 4.8 percent when the volume was &gt;849 procedures per year [

         In a report on over 200,000 procedures from the STS National Cardiac Database between January 2000 and December 2001, the overall operative mortality was 2.7 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The mortality rate ranged from 3.5 percent for hospitals performing ≤150 procedures per year to 2.4 percent for hospitals performing &gt;450 procedures per year.

         Similar observations have been made in Brazil where a report from the National Health Service for all types of cardiac surgery noted a progressive increase in perioperative mortality from 5.8 percent in hospitals performing more than 341 procedures per year (highest quartile) to 9.7 percent in hospitals performing less than 131 procedures per year (lowest quartile) [

         In the STS database report, adjustment for clinical risk, year of surgery, and patient clustering within centers reduced the impact of annual hospital volume on mortality, with an adjusted mortality range from 3.1 percent (≤150 procedures) to 2.4 percent (&gt;450 procedures) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. For patients under 65 years and for those estimated to be at low operative risk, there was no association of hospital volume with mortality.

         <span class="glyph">

         Similar findings were noted in a review of 13,644 patients seen in hospitals performing a low (&lt;200) or high (&gt;200) number of procedures per year: Four established predictors (age, sex, surgical priority, and severity of illness) were used to classify risk status (minimal, low, moderate, high, and severe) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. In-hospital mortality in low-volume hospitals was significantly higher in patients at moderate risk (5.3 versus 2.2 percent for high-volume hospitals) and high risk (23 versus 12 percent); there was no difference in mortality in the other risk groups.
        </p>

         A different conclusion, however, was reached in an analysis of 57,150 CABG operations performed in New York State between 1997 and 1999; there were 1260 (2.2 percent) in-hospital deaths [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. A logistic regression model was used to classify patient risk as low (predicted in-hospital mortality &lt;2 percent) or moderate to high (predicted in-hospital mortality ≥2 percent). When low-volume hospitals were defined as those performing fewer than 200 operations per year, the odds of in-hospital death were lower at the high-volume hospitals for both low- and moderate- to high-risk patients (adjusted odds ratios 0.53 and 0.62, respectively). The advantage of high-volume hospitals persisted when the definition of low volume was changed to less than 600 operations per year.

         One report retrospectively reviewed the outcome of 3330 patients over the age of 70 in whom isolated CABG was performed between 1982 and 1996 [

The prevalence of high-risk older patients rose from 16.2 to 26.9 percent, but the operative mortality in these individuals fell from 17.2 to 8.9 percent. Independent predictors of mortality in older adults were similar to those of younger patients and included poor left ventricular function, previous CABG, female sex, peripheral artery disease, and diabetes.

Compared to younger patients, octogenarians have significantly higher rates of in-hospital mortality (9.2 versus 3.8 percent) and stroke (4.7 versus 1.6 percent) after CABG. After adjustment of comorbidities, age ≥80 was an independent predictor of mortality. The relative increase in mortality was greatest with urgent (10.3 versus 3.9) and emergency surgery (17.0 versus 12.1 percent).

         The EuroSCORE risk prediction algorithm includes underlying chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine &gt;2.3 mg/dL [200 µmol/L]) as a risk factor for surgical mortality  (

A subsequent prospective study of 4403 consecutive patients undergoing first-time isolated CABG found that even mild renal dysfunction (serum creatinine 1.5 to 2.3 mg/dL [133 to 199 µmol/L]) was associated with a higher operative mortality than in patients with serum creatinine concentrations under 1.5 mg/dL (6.1 versus 2.1 percent, multivariate adjusted odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-3.03) [

         A graded relationship between the degree of renal dysfunction and operative mortality was noted in a report from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Adult Cardiac Database of almost 500,000 patients undergoing isolated CABG [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29

Operative mortality rose from 1.3 percent in patients with a normal estimated GFR (≥90 mL/min) to 1.8 percent with a GFR of 60 to 89 mL/min (mild kidney disease, present in 51 percent), 4.3 percent with a GFR of 30 to 59 mL/min (moderate kidney disease, present in 24 percent), and 9.0 to 9.3 percent with a GFR less than 30 mL/min or on dialysis (severe kidney disease, present in 4 percent). After multivariable adjustment, preoperative GFR was one of the most powerful predictors of operative mortality (adjusted odds ratio for mortality 1.55 and 3.82 with moderate and severe kidney disease, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to the increase in operative mortality and morbidity, chronic kidney disease is also predictor of increased long-term mortality after CABG [

         Longer red blood cell storage times are associated with structural and functional changes that may worsen outcomes in the recipient. In a retrospective study of over 6000 patients who underwent open heart surgery and were transfused, those who received blood stored for more than 14 days had significantly worse outcomes (intubation beyond 72 hours, renal failure, sepsis or septicemia, and in-hospital and one-year mortality) compared to those with shorter storage times [

         A number of preoperative and intraoperative factors have been demonstrated to influence the rate of operative mortality after CABG. These include hospital and surgeon experience, degree of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, increasing age, the presence and extent chronic kidney disease, and the type and number of bypass grafts. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Predictors of risk'
         </a>

         Risk prediction algorithms have been developed to predict perioperative risk. EuroSCORE and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons algorithm are two widely used examples. (See
