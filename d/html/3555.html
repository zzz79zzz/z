         Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only widely available curative therapy for thalassemia. A number of potential post-transplant risks and complications must be addressed to ensure the best prognosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses the care of patients with thalassemia who have undergone HCT, divided into two sections: completion of the transplant (eg, optimizing engraftment and immune status) and subsequent management, including assessment and therapy for excess iron stores; organ damage, which is often related to iron overload; and late complications of transplant such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
        </p>
        <p>
         A general review of the treatment of thalassemia as well as indications for HCT, pretransplant evaluation, donor selection, stem cell source, conditioning regimen, and immediate post-transplant hematopoietic support are discussed in detail separately. (See

         Initial post-transplant management focuses on engraftment of the allogeneic hematopoietic cells and restoration of normal immune status. Important aspects of care include assessing and optimizing engraftment, treating infections, managing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and tapering immunosuppressive therapy.

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         For transplant to be effective, the donor hematopoietic cells need to engraft sufficiently to support hematopoiesis and non-thalassemic erythropoiesis. Engraftment is typically indicated by return of hematopoiesis in all three cell lines (white blood cells [WBCs], red blood cells [RBCs], and platelets) with decreasing need for transfusional support in the immediate post-transplant period.
        </p>
        <p>
         The complete blood count (CBC) is monitored daily while the patient is hospitalized and frequently (eg, twice weekly) once the patient has been discharged from the hospital through the second post-transplant month. Once the patient is transfusion-free, hemoglobin analysis and chimerism testing using bone marrow cells are performed to confirm engraftment. Genetic testing can be substituted for hemoglobin analysis but is not routinely performed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Engraftment status is routinely analyzed in the bone marrow. We perform this assessment at 30 and 60 days post-transplant (days +30 and +60). This includes determination of bone marrow cellularity and the degree of chimerism. If complete chimerism (full engraftment) is established, no further bone marrow examination is scheduled. If the patient is a mixed chimera, additional bone marrow examinations are performed, which we do at days +180, +365, and +730 (ie, at 6, 12, and 24 months). Additional bone marrow examinations are also performed based on clinical indications such as unexplained decreases in hemoglobin levels or decreased proportion of donor hematopoietic cells.
        </p>
        <p>
         Engraftment is seen in the majority of patients who undergo HCT (eg, in 80 to 90 percent). This rate of engraftment was illustrated in a 2017 series of 176 children and adolescents who underwent allogeneic HCT for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (median age 5.5 years), in which 15 (9 percent) had primary graft rejection and 25 (14 percent) had secondary graft rejection [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Most of the secondary graft rejection occurred within the first year (19 of 25 [76 percent]). Of the 17 who had a second transplant due to graft failure, three had graft failure again. Engraftment typically takes two to three weeks, but chimerism can take up to two years to stabilize.
        </p>
        <p>
         The degree of chimerism (relative contributions of donor and host cells) is routinely assessed as a component of engraftment. Several methods have been used to assess chimerism after HCT. These methods all depend on the ability to detect and quantify a polymorphic marker that differs between donor and recipient. Examples include the following:

         Possible outcomes range from full donor engraftment, various degrees of mixed chimerism, or graft rejection with thalassemia recurrence or marrow aplasia. It can take up to two years for the source of hematopoiesis to stabilize. Changes have been reported after longer intervals, but this is much less common [

         Full donor engraftment occurs when the donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are fully responsible for hematopoiesis with no detectable contribution from recipient hematopoietic cells. This is also referred to as "complete chimerism" or "full chimerism." When sustained, it is interpreted as cure of the thalassemia. This is the most common outcome after successful HCT for thalassemia and is seen in 60 to 90 percent of individuals, with higher rates in those with optimal pretransplant and donor characteristics.

         </span>
         Mixed chimerism occurs when both donor and recipient hematopoietic cells are contributing to hematopoiesis at a level that can be detected molecularly. Chimerism is a dynamic condition in which contributions of donor and recipient cells vary greatly as the bone marrow stem cell niche becomes repopulated, which can take up to two years to stabilize (see
         <a class="local">
          'Engraftment'
         </a>
         above). Thus, chimerism can be transient (typically defined as during the first two years after transplant) or stable (persisting beyond two years). Some individuals have transient mixed chimerism while others have stable mixed chimerism for years [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We do not intervene in individuals with mixed chimerism unless they have evidence that the graft is failing (eg, unexplained drop of hemoglobin level or decrease in the ratio of mixed chimerism [eg, from 70 to 50 percent or less]). In these individuals, it is critical to determine whether worsening anemia is in fact due to graft failure (or impending graft failure) as other causes of anemia can arise [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Options for individuals with graft failure are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Graft failure'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with early mixed chimerism, we monitor the percentage of mixed chimerism regularly. In principle, the degree of chimerism can differ in the bone marrow and peripheral blood or can differ in different cell lines since some progenitor cells may produce more mature progeny than others, although most individuals do not have large variations when chimerism markers are tested in different cell populations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dynamic changes in the percentage of donor cells were illustrated in a 1996 study that included 35 individuals who underwent transplant for thalassemia and had persistent mixed chimerism during a one-year period of observation [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Of these, 20 gradually converted to full donor hematopoiesis (100 percent donor cells), while the remaining 15 had a functioning graft in coexistence with host cells. It was noted that 20 percent donor engraftment provided a sufficient, stable, and persistent level of hemoglobin production (effective erythropoiesis) to allow transfusion independence and health without signs or symptoms of thalassemia intermedia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most individuals with mixed chimerism have sufficient donor hematopoiesis to correct the thalassemic phenotype and avoid transfusions. Some authors have suggested that approximately 3 to 10 percent donor cells is sufficient for functional correction in the hemoglobinopathies based on case reports of stable mixed chimerism with donor hematopoiesis as low as 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors that determine the likelihood of mixed chimerism include the following [

         Source of stem cells. It is possible that use of hematopoietic cells from cord blood rather than bone marrow is associated with greater reciprocal tolerance between donor and host hematopoietic cells [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. In a series that included 27 children with thalassemia who received a cord blood transplant from an HLA identical sibling donor, all showed engraftment with mixed chimerism at the time of hematopoietic engraftment [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Approximately one-half converted to full donor chimerism (eight within six months and five within one year), and the remaining 14 showed stable mixed chimerism at a median follow-up of 42 months. By comparison, graft failure occurred in 3 of 42 children (7 percent) in the same series who received bone marrow from a related donor and in 5 of 37 children (14 percent) in the same series who received bone marrow from an unrelated donor.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Mixed chimerism is a risk factor for graft rejection; however, stable mixed chimerism does not adversely affect survival [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Graft failure'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The relationship between mixed chimerism and thalassemia recurrence is illustrated in the following studies:

         A 2008 study involved 97 consecutive patients who underwent HCT for thalassemia and had the percentage of donor and recipient hematopoietic cells assessed using STR markers [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Of these 97, 43 (44 percent) had evidence of early mixed chimerism, 50 (52 percent) had full donor engraftment, and four had early graft failure or died in the immediate post-transplant period. Serial analysis of STR markers documented thalassemia recurrence within the first two months in 1 of the 50 with full engraftment and 7 of the 43 with mixed chimerism (2 versus 16 percent). The likelihood of disease recurrence correlated with the percentage of residual host cells.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         A Pesaro series of 295 individuals who underwent HCT for thalassemia and were followed for at least two years found that the proportion of patients with mixed chimerism gradually declined over time following HCT, from 32 percent at two months to 13 percent at one year to 9 percent at two years [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Thalassemia recurrence did not occur in any of the 200 individuals with full donor engraftment, whereas 33 of the 95 (35 percent) with mixed chimerism at two months eventually had graft rejection. We also saw a correlation between the percentage of residual host cells and rejection of the graft, with graft rejection in 18 of 19 who had &gt;25 percent host cells versus only 4 of 55 who had &lt;10 percent host cells (95 and 7 percent, respectively).

        </p>
        <p>
         Other studies have used different cutoffs for the percent of recipient hematopoiesis but have reached similar conclusions regarding a greater likelihood of graft rejection in those with greater percentages of recipient-derived cells [

         Failure of the donor hematopoietic cells to engraft can be primary (without any evidence that the donor cells engrafted) or can occur later, following a period of apparent engraftment and hematopoietic recovery [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,21
         </a>
         ]. The mechanism may be mediated by immunologic rejection of the graft, low stem cell inoculum, or bone marrow insult (eg, from infection or drug toxicity). Graft failure can be associated with recurrence of thalassemia or marrow aplasia, depending on the degree of marrow ablation in the recipient.
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●

         The rate of graft failure in individuals without significant pretransplant iron overload has been estimated to be less than 5 percent [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Graft rejection appears to be more of a concern in children than adults. In an old 1997 experience with over 1000 patients, graft rejection at two years affected approximately 7 percent of children, whereas graft rejection was only seen in 4 percent of adults [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The limited experience with transplantation in adults does not permit updating of these findings. In modern practice, options for individuals with graft failure include medical therapy or retransplantation from the same or a different donor. If recipient hematopoiesis does not resume (ie, if there is bone marrow aplasia), retransplantation is the only option.

          Medical therapy
         </strong>
         – Medical therapy with regular transfusions and iron chelation is an option for those with recurrence of thalassemia following HCT. We are most likely to use this approach in individuals who have a complete return of thalassemia due to host hemopoietic reconstitution and do not plan a second transplant in the near future. (See

          Second transplant
         </strong>
         – Retransplantation may be an option for individuals who have recurrence of thalassemia. If this approach is pursued, the second transplant can be delayed until the patient recovers from toxicities of the first transplant. Retransplantation is the only option for individuals with marrow aplasia, in which case it is performed urgently. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Thalassemia recurrence'
         </a>
         below and

         The use of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) following transplant for thalassemia was illustrated in a series of 19 individuals who were presumed to have impending graft rejection based on an ongoing transfusion requirement, along with a low level of donor hematopoiesis (residual host cells &gt;25 percent) or a decline in donor hematopoiesis in the first two to six months after transplant [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Of these individuals, three developed full donor chimerism, nine continued to have mixed chimerism but no longer required transfusions, and seven had graft rejection. DLI therapy was generally well tolerated, with three individuals developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). While these results are encouraging, it is not clear what proportion of these individuals had their post-transplant course altered by DLI and what proportion would have had the same outcome without the procedure since many individuals have dynamic changes during the first two years and/or stable mixed chimerism for long periods of time without graft failure. Prudence is required in this situation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mixed chimerism'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanism by which DLI can restore donor hematopoiesis is thought to involve an expanded donor immunologic reaction against host hematopoietic cells, similar to the graft-versus-tumor effect seen in hematologic malignancies treated with this approach. (See

         The incidence of thalassemia recurrence varies with patient factors and conditioning regimen; the overall rate is approximately 6 to 8 percent of individuals who undergo HCT. It may be more likely in those who receive reduced-intensity conditioning and less likely in adults [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. (See

          "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for transfusion-dependent thalassemia", section on 'Outcomes: allogeneic transplantation versus medical therapy'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Options for the individual with thalassemia recurrence include medical management (resumption of transfusions and chelation therapy) and second transplant, as noted above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Graft failure'
         </a>
         above). The optimal approach is unknown; only small series have been published describing management in this setting [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,25
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, the approach is individualized according to the ability of the original donor to provide a second donation, the availability of a different HLA identical donor, and the patient's overall medical condition and ability to tolerate a second transplant. Small series of second transplants suggest that it is best to wait at least a year to allow recovery from the toxic effects of the conditioning regimen, provided that an optimal transfusion and chelation treatment can be offered and accepted. There is no evidence to suggest any benefit from changing to a different donor or a different stem cell source.

         Bone marrow aplasia occurs when the donor HSCs fail to engraft and the patient's bone marrow remains ablated. Persistent aplasia is rare. These patients are at risk for life-threatening infections from neutropenia and bleeding from thrombocytopenia, and they require ongoing transfusional support, similar to individuals with very severe aplastic anemia. Urgent retransplantation should be pursued as this is the only available salvage approach.

         Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is classically defined as acute if it occurs within the first 100 days after HCT and chronic if it begins after 100 days. Clinical features can also be used to distinguish findings more typical of acute rather than chronic GVHD at times beyond the first 100 days.

         Immunosuppressive therapy to reduce the risk of GVHD is routinely administered following infusion of the donor hematopoietic cells. (See

        <p>
         Following HCT, the immunosuppressive therapy can be weaned slowly, beginning at 60 days post-transplant (ie, at day +60). The weaning schedule is calculated to have the patient be free of immunosuppression before the one-year post-transplant follow-up evaluation. The taper may be done more slowly than that used for individuals treated with HCT for hematologic malignancies, in which tapering is done more rapidly to allow a graft-versus-tumor effect to emerge earlier in the transplant course.

         The incidence of clinically significant acute GVHD in individuals who have undergone HCT for thalassemia has been reported in the range of approximately 25 percent, with higher rates in those who received stem cells from sources other than bone marrow [

         Our approach to monitoring, preventing, and treating chronic GVHD is similar to that in other underlying diseases treated with HCT, with the exception that there is no need to maintain a graft-versus-tumor effect. Thus, a slower tapering of prophylactic immunosuppression is scheduled compared with that used in hematologic malignancies. (See

         Clinically significant thalassemia leads to iron overload from ineffective erythropoiesis that is exacerbated by chronic transfusions. This is mitigated by pretransplantation iron chelation, but excess iron stores are often seen, even among those receiving chelation therapy. This was illustrated in a 2017 series of 176 children and adolescents with beta thalassemia who underwent HCT [

         Following successful engraftment, excess iron should be removed to reduce organ damage, which may exacerbate (or be exacerbated by) toxicities of the conditioning regimen, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), or medications. Phlebotomy is typically used for iron removal as long as erythropoiesis is sufficient to allow it.
        </p>
        <p>
         We typically wait to address excess iron stores until approximately 12 to 18 months after transplant or after the patient has discontinued the calcineurin inhibitor and other transplant-related medications for approximately six months (which may be longer than 18 months after transplant in some cases). This allows the patient to recover from the procedure, develop adequate immune function, and increase their hemoglobin level as much as possible before starting phlebotomy (calcineurin inhibitors have a mild depressive effect on erythropoiesis). Earlier treatment is not usually necessary since no significant progression of liver disease has been observed when comparing liver biopsies taken at baseline and at 18 months after transplantation [

         There appears to be a very good correlation between hepatic iron concentration using liver biopsy and total body iron stores, provided the liver biopsy specimen is adequate (≥1 mg dry weight) and cirrhosis is absent. This was illustrated in our series of 25 patients who underwent HCT for thalassemia and subsequently had determination of liver iron by biopsy and total body iron stores by serial phlebotomy, which allows determination of the number of units that can be removed before the iron stores normalize (serum ferritin &lt;100 ng/mL) [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. This study showed a strong correlation between liver iron and total body iron, as illustrated in the figure  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ), and allowed us to calculate that total body iron stores in mg/kg body weight are approximately equal to the hepatic iron concentration multiplied by 10.6. The correlation of liver iron with total body stores was much better than the correlation of serum ferritin with total body iron stores as long as the liver biopsy contained ≥1 mg dry weight.

         In modern practice, iron stores can be determined by liver MRI.

         The ideal target for iron reduction in patients who are post-HCT for thalassemia is unknown. Ideally, the iron load should be reduced to normal. Our practice largely extrapolates from data in hereditary hemochromatosis, which suggest that the following goals are appropriate:

         The two methods of iron removal are phlebotomy and iron chelation. Both methods are effective. Their advantages, disadvantages, differ substantially  (

         ), highlighting the need to incorporate patient values and preferences in the choice between them. For most individuals with excess iron stores who have access to phlebotomy and can tolerate the procedure, we suggest phlebotomy based on its low risk of adverse events and low cost; however, some individuals may use chelation if they are not able to tolerate phlebotomy, and others may reasonably choose chelation for other reasons. The cost of oral iron chelators has significantly decreased in modern times, facilitating their use.

         A 2017 trial randomly assigned 26 children and adolescents who had undergone HCT for thalassemia and had evidence of excess iron stores (serum ferritin &gt;500 ng/mL on two occasions and liver iron &gt;3 mg/g dry weight) to be treated with phlebotomy or the oral iron chelator

         ]. Iron stores were greatly reduced in both arms as measured by serum ferritin level or R2 MRI for liver iron concentration. There was a trend towards greater reduction in ferritin with phlebotomy and a trend towards greater reduction in liver iron with chelation. Adverse events were seen in five phlebotomy patients (four with difficult venous access and one with emotional distress) and two chelation patients (one with rash and one with increased liver function tests). Most of the phlebotomy patients' parents expressed a desire to switch to chelation because time off work and time spent in appointments would be reduced. However, this trial was very small. Additional randomized trials have not been performed.

         Experience with chelation for thalassemia-related iron overload in the pretransplant setting is presented separately; this includes observational studies demonstrating that chelation is effective for iron removal and suggesting that chelation is associated with improved survival compared with no chelation (in individuals treated during the pre-chelation era).

         For individuals with mixed chimerism, we use chelation rather than phlebotomy. Chelation and phlebotomy are not combined unless the individual has very severe iron overload (eg, &gt;15 mg/g dry weight) and requires more intensive therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Iron removal (chelation or phlebotomy) may not be tolerated in individuals with more severe GVHD. However, those with mild GVHD may tolerate either of these methods, and iron removal may improve organ function. Thus, the decision to initiate iron removal in an individual with chronic GVHD as well as the choice between iron removal methods depends on the extent of excess iron deposition and GVHD severity, as well as the sites affected by GVHD.

         Phlebotomy is our preferred method of iron removal for patients with excess iron stores as long as they can tolerate the procedure, as discussed above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Comparison of iron removal methods'

         The general phlebotomy protocol that we use has not changed in decades and consists of the following steps [

         Phlebotomy is delayed if the hemoglobin is &lt;9.5 g/dL or the systolic blood pressure is significantly below the patient's baseline. Patients who are ill or symptomatic are evaluated as appropriate, and phlebotomy is reinstituted once it is clear the individual is recovered and/or feeling well.

         Routine laboratory testing to assess hemoglobin level and iron stores includes a complete blood count (CBC) before each phlebotomy, liver and kidney function testing at baseline and then every three months, and serum ferritin every two months.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         This protocol is continued until the serum ferritin concentration is &lt;100 ng/mL (&lt;100 mcg/L) on at least two occasions. Once the ferritin is below 100 ng/mL, no additional testing is required. At this point, patients are free from iron overload and no maintenance therapy is required. The number of phlebotomies required depends on the baseline iron stores and ranges from a few months to several years [

         In the majority of transplanted thalassemic patients, reduction or normalization of the iron pool results in marked improvement in liver enzymes and liver histology (piecemeal necrosis, intralobular degeneration, and portal inflammation) [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33,34
         </a>

         Although well-tolerated in the major of patients, phlebotomy can lead to some adverse effects. In our first series of 41 patients, these included mild and spontaneously reversible thrombocytopenia (five patients), a few episodes of low blood pressure, and a single episode of anemia (hemoglobin 7 g/dL) that quickly reversed after temporary suspension of the program [

        </p>
        <p>
         Hepatic iron overload and HCV infection are independent risk factors for post-transplant progression of liver disease  (

          figure 2

        <p>
         With modern effective HCV treatment, very few patients approach HCT with an active virus infection (pre-transplant HCV eradication is recommended). However, experience indicates that the combination of toxic factors has a multiplicative effect on liver damage, supporting the need of complete iron removal after transplantation.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is some evidence that chronic hepatitis and even cirrhosis are reversible if excess iron is removed  (

         <a href="#rid44">
          44

        <p>
         Once excess iron is removed, follow-up is directed to other causes of liver disease such as viral hepatitis or chronic GVHD. In an individual free of these complications, obtaining liver function tests once per year is more than adequate unless more frequent or extensive testing is required for another indication, such as drug monitoring.

         The risks associated with HCV infection and the choice of appropriate therapy are discussed in detail separately; if possible, HCV should be treated before transplant rather than after transplant to avoid potential bone marrow or other toxicity of the virus and/or antiviral therapies in the post-transplant period.

         The risk of endocrine dysfunction in individuals with thalassemia was illustrated in a series involving 50 children with thalassemia who underwent HCT before puberty (mean age, 11 years) [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Of these, 40 percent entered puberty normally despite the usual presence of clinical and hormonal evidence of hypogonadism. Despite these observations, young children transplanted in the early phase of thalassemia appear to have a good prognosis for growth and fertility. Several reports have described successful pregnancies (not requiring assisted reproductive technologies) following HCT [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,49,50
         </a>
         ]. In principle, iron-related endocrinopathies may be reversed using iron depletion after HCT, but this remains to be demonstrated. (See

         Limited and conflicting data regarding the risk of cancer after HCT have been reported in the thalassemia population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Solid tumors have been infrequently reported in individuals who have undergone HCT for thalassemia and do not appear to be substantially increased over the rates seen in individuals with thalassemia who have not undergone HCT, although direct comparisons have not been performed in this population.
        </p>
        <p>
         A retrospective nationwide study from France that followed 99 transplant patients for a median of 12 years did not observe cancer development; the median age at the time of transplant was 5.9 years [

        <p>
         A large report involving almost 20,000 individuals who underwent HCT for a variety of underlying disorders found an increased risk of solid tumors compared with the general population, but many of these individuals may have had underlying malignancies, may have received total-body irradiation as part of the conditioning regimen (which we do not use in thalassemia), and/or may have been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy other than that used for HCT. Thus, extrapolation to the thalassemia population may not be appropriate [

         Quality of life is a major consideration, especially as many HCT recipients will be young children at the time of their transplant. Studies that have evaluated quality of life following HCT for thalassemia have found quality of life to be good, with levels of education, employment, and mental health to be similar to the general population and better than those of individuals with thalassemia who did not undergo HCT [

         A 2013 study assessed quality of life in a cohort of 109 patients who had undergone HCT for thalassemia at a median follow-up of 23 years (range, 12 to 30) [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49

         ]. Results of surveys evaluating general health and sociodemographic variables were mostly similar to peers in the general population and similar to or better than scores in a control group of 124 individuals with thalassemia who had not undergone HCT. Mental health, education level, employment status, marital status, living arrangements, and birth rate were compatible with normal living patterns. The greatest predictor of impaired quality of life was the presence of chronic GVHD.

Results of questionnaires about health, use of medical aids, and interpersonal relationships found better ratings for those who underwent HCT, even after adjusting for comorbidities. Quality of life tended to improve with a greater duration of time since HCT. The only area for which the score was lower in the transplant group was related to school; participants noted distress about absence from school caused by the time required for treatments.

          Engraftment
         </strong>
         – Initial post-transplant management focuses on engraftment of the allogeneic hematopoietic cells and restoration of normal immune status. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Completion of the transplant'

         Engraftment and chimerism are routinely assessed in the bone marrow. The degree of chimerism is determined using markers that differ between donor and recipient (Y chromosome, short tandem repeats). It can take up to two years for the source of hematopoiesis to stabilize. (See

         Mixed chimerism is a risk factor for graft rejection; however, some patients have stable mixed chimerism that does not adversely affect survival. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mixed chimerism'

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Graft failure can be due to rejection of the donor cells with recurrence of thalassemia or to bone marrow aplasia. Therapeutic options include donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), medical therapy, or retransplantation from the same or a different donor. (See

          GVHD prophylaxis
         </strong>
         – Immunosuppressive therapy to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can be weaned slowly in individuals with thalassemia (typically over the course of one year, which is slower than in individuals with hematologic malignancies) since there is not a need to promote graft-versus-tumor effect. Therapy for GVHD is presented separately. (See

          Iron stores
         </strong>
         – Iron stores must be addressed following engraftment, even if iron chelation was used before transplant. We typically wait to assess and treat excess iron stores until approximately 18 months after transplant or after the patient has discontinued cyclosporin and other transplant-related medications for approximately six months. Phlebotomy and iron chelation therapy are both effective; their advantages and disadvantages differ  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68353" href="/z/d/graphic/68353.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ); patient values and preferences impact decision-making. For most individuals with excess iron stores who have access to and can tolerate phlebotomy, we suggest phlebotomy rather than chelation (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
