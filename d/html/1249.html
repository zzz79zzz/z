The presence of SBP, which almost always occurs in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, is suspected because of suggestive signs and symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, or altered mental status  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71038" href="/z/d/graphic/71038.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), though some patients are asymptomatic and are detected when they undergo paracentesis after being admitted to the hospital for another reason. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1247.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Clinical manifestations"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the diagnosis of SBP, as well as distinguishing SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis or alcoholic hepatitis with ascites. The performance of paracentesis, the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of SBP, and the general evaluation of adults with ascites are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16203.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic and therapeutic abdominal paracentesis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1246.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1247.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Clinical manifestations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1248.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1250.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis variants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1261.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of adults with ascites"</a>.)</p><p>The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and other professional societies have updated their guidance on the management of adult patients with ascites due to cirrhosis [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. The discussion that follows is generally consistent with society guidance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H155430461"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) should be suspected in patients with cirrhosis who develop signs or symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, altered mental status, abdominal tenderness, or hypotension  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71038" href="/z/d/graphic/71038.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In addition, patients with ascites admitted to the hospital for other reasons should also undergo paracentesis to look for evidence of SBP. A low clinical suspicion for SBP does <strong>not</strong> obviate the need for testing [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Paracentesis can be performed in the interventional radiology suite or at the bedside. It is important that trained personnel be available to perform the procedure at off hours (such as at night or on weekends). Paracentesis should be carried out promptly in patients with suspected SBP, as delays in performing paracentesis have been associated with increased mortality. (See <a class="local">'Paracentesis'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1247.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Clinical manifestations", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16203.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic and therapeutic abdominal paracentesis"</a>.)</p><p>The importance of paracentesis was demonstrated in a review of a database of 17,711 patients with cirrhosis and ascites who were admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of ascites or encephalopathy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Paracentesis was performed in 61 percent. Patients who underwent paracentesis had a lower in-hospital mortality rate than those who did not undergo paracentesis (6.5 versus 8.5 percent; adjusted odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.74).</p><p>If SBP is suspected, a paracentesis should be performed with analysis of the ascitic fluid  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122552" href="/z/d/graphic/122552.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). It is important that the paracentesis be performed <strong>prior</strong> to the administration of any antibiotics. Appropriate handling of the ascitic fluid is crucial to ensure the proper tests are obtained, to minimize the risk of skin flora contaminating the cultures, and to avoid obtaining a falsely negative culture. Tests obtained on the fluid include aerobic and anaerobic cultures, cell count and differential, and fluid chemistries (albumin, protein, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, and in some cases bilirubin). (See <a class="local">'Handling the ascitic fluid'</a> below.)</p><p>A diagnosis of SBP is made if the polymorphonuclear cell (PMN, also referred to as neutrophils) count in the ascitic fluid is ≥250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, culture results are positive, and secondary causes of peritonitis are excluded. However, in selected cases, fluid chemistries may be needed to support the diagnosis. While awaiting the results of the fluid cultures, patients with a PMN count ≥250 cells/mm<sup>3 </sup>should be started on empiric antibiotic treatment. Some publications recommend treatment when the PMN count is &gt;250 cells/mm<sup>3 </sup>and no treatment if the PMN count is &lt;250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. However, some patients will have a PMN count equal to 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and such patients should be treated. (See <a class="local">'Interpretation of ascitic fluid test results'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1248.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis", section on 'Treatment'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59508237"><span class="h1">OBTAINING ASCITIC FLUID</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) depends on analysis of the ascitic fluid, which is typically obtained by performing a paracentesis. Prior to performing a paracentesis in a patient suspected of having SBP, it is important to have the equipment necessary not only to obtain the fluid, but also to send it for analysis (eg, blood culture bottles, purple- and red-top blood-drawing tubes).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">Paracentesis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is vital that patients suspected of having SBP undergo abdominal paracentesis <strong>before</strong> receiving any antibiotics (a single dose of a broad-spectrum antibiotic can lead to no growth in 86 percent of patients after six hours) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In the vast majority of patients, a paracentesis can be safely carried out despite an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). Giving fresh frozen plasma to attempt to correct the international normalized ratio (INR) may be futile and even harmful in one-third of patients [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Paracentesis should not be delayed in patients suspected of having SBP. In a retrospective study of 239 hospitalized patients with SBP, mortality rates were higher for those who underwent paracentesis 12 to 72 hours after hospitalization compared with those who underwent paracentesis within 12 hours of hospitalization (27 versus 13 percent; adjusted odds ratio 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-4.8) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Each hour of delay in paracentesis was associated with a 3.3 percent increase in mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16203.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic and therapeutic abdominal paracentesis", section on 'Abnormal coagulation studies and thrombocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p>The performance of paracentesis and the complications that may occur during and after paracentesis are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16203.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic and therapeutic abdominal paracentesis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59507197"><span class="h2">Handling the ascitic fluid</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Appropriate handling of the ascitic fluid is crucial to minimize the risk of skin flora contaminating the cultures. Appropriate handling of the ascitic fluid is also required to minimize the risk of obtaining a falsely negative culture, possibly leading to the diagnosis of culture-negative neutrocytic ascites (ie, ascites with a PMN count ≥250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, but with negative cultures of the ascitic fluid) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Most patients with culture-negative neutrocytic ascites actually have SBP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1250.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis variants"</a>.)</p><p>The ascitic fluid should be tested for the following: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aerobic and anaerobic culture</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cell count and differential</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gram stain </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Albumin </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Protein </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Glucose </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lactate dehydrogenase </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Amylase </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bilirubin (if the fluid is dark orange or brown)</p><p></p><p>Typically, two 20 mL syringes of ascitic fluid will be needed for the above tests.</p><p>If tuberculous peritonitis is suspected, additional fluid should be obtained and sent for an acid-fast bacteria smear and mycobacterial culture. However, these tests will frequently fail to detect tuberculous peritonitis, so if there is high suspicion, peritoneoscopy with mycobacterial culture and histology of a biopsied tubercle are the most rapid route to the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1238.html" rel="external">"Abdominal tuberculosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59507434"><span class="h3">Culture</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cultures should be sent in blood culture bottles. At least two bottles (one for aerobic and one for anaerobic culture) should be inoculated immediately at the bedside using a new, sterile needle. A needle that has passed through the skin should <strong>not</strong> be used to inoculate the bottles because it may lead to contamination of the sample with skin flora. Ideally, at least 10 mL of fluid should be introduced into each bottle. The volume of fluid introduced is ideally coordinated with the local pathology laboratory.  </p><p>We use the following approach when obtaining ascitic fluid cultures:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immediately prior to the paracentesis, we wipe the top of each blood culture bottle with an alcohol wipe and leave the wipe on the bottle top in an attempt to maintain sterility while the paracentesis is being performed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During the paracentesis, a 20 mL syringe is connected to the needle that is in the abdominal wall and filled with ascitic fluid. Additional syringes are filled to obtain fluid for additional testing (eg, cell count and chemistries), and if needed, to increase the volume of fluid obtained for culture. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immediately after the paracentesis, a new, sterile needle should be placed on the 20 mL syringe. The new needle can be used to inoculate multiple bottles. However, each syringe should have its own new needle. This is to decrease the risk of a needle-stick injury that could occur if the needle is transferred among syringes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The alcohol wipes are removed and the blood culture bottles are inoculated, preferably with at least 10 mL of ascitic fluid each. However, some bottles will not permit more than the recommended amount of fluid to be instilled without infringing upon the "head space" in the bottle, in which case the upper end of the recommended amount of fluid should be instilled. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If tuberculous peritonitis is suspected, ascitic fluid should be sent to the lab as per local procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The blood culture bottles are sent to the microbiology laboratory immediately for both aerobic and anaerobic culture.</p><p></p><p>It is important to use blood culture bottles because SBP is a low-colony-count monomicrobial infection similar to bacteremia. If a syringe or tube of fluid is sent to the laboratory for culture, the sensitivity for detecting SBP is dramatically decreased [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. Culturing ascitic fluid as if it were blood (with immediate bedside inoculation of ascitic fluid into blood culture bottles) has been shown to increase the culture-positivity of the ascitic fluid. In a study of patients with an ascitic fluid PMN count ≥250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (in the absence of prior antibiotic treatment, pancreatitis, tuberculous peritonitis, or malignancy-related ascites), immediate inoculation increased the sensitivity of cultures from about 50 to 77 percent (with delayed inoculation) to 80 to 100 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,10,11</a>].</p><p>The volume of fluid cultured also has a dramatic impact on the sensitivity of ascitic fluid cultures. In one report, for example, inoculation of 10 or 20 mL of fluid into 100 mL blood culture bottles led to a much higher culture-positivity rate than a 1 mL inoculum (93 versus 53 percent) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59507460"><span class="h3">Gram stain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A few milliliters of ascitic fluid should be sent for Gram stain in a sterile urine container or red-top tube. Centrifugation of the fluid prior to performing a Gram stain is not necessary since it does not increase the yield and may actually decrease the likelihood of obtaining a positive result [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p>Fluid from the blood culture bottles can only be used for Gram stain after they have incubated for 12 to 24 hours, so sending a separate sample immediately after the paracentesis permits receiving the Gram stain results much more rapidly.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Cell count</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 1 mL of fluid should be injected into a purple-top EDTA blood-drawing tube for cell count. An accurate cell count cannot be obtained if the fluid is allowed to clot or is submitted in a non-anticoagulated tube. The cell count and differential should be ordered "stat," otherwise many laboratories will prioritize the cell count below routine peripheral blood counts. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59507442"><span class="h3">Chemistries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several milliliters of fluid should be injected into a red-top blood-drawing tube for chemistries. Chemistries obtained should include albumin (so the serum-ascites albumin gradient can be determined), total protein concentration, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, and amylase. If the fluid is dark orange or brown, a bilirubin concentration should be obtained. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59507452"><span class="h1">INTERPRETATION OF ASCITIC FLUID TEST RESULTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is typically diagnosed if there is an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear cell (PMN, also referred to as neutrophils) count (≥250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture, and absence of secondary causes of peritonitis, such as bowel perforation. However, in some cases, additional tests may be needed to support the diagnosis or to differentiate SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59507681"><span class="h2">Culture and Gram stain results</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the setting of an elevated PMN count (≥250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), positive culture results from ascitic fluid not only confirm a diagnosis of SBP, but also allow for tailored antibiotic therapy. However, antibiotic therapy should not be delayed while awaiting culture results in patients with a PMN count ≥250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Instead, patients should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, with narrowing of the antibiotic coverage once a pathogen has been identified. Pathogens commonly associated with SBP included <em>Escherichia coli</em>, streptococcal species, and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80188" href="/z/d/graphic/80188.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1248.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis", section on 'Treatment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1246.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis", section on 'Microbiology and bacterial entry into ascitic fluid'</a>.)</p><p>Gram stain is notoriously insensitive for detecting SBP and is associated with a high false-positive rate [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. One study found that 16 of 31 positive Gram stains were false positives, and that only 1 Gram stain out of 796 led to a change in antibiotic treatment [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, a Gram stain can help differentiate SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis due to gut perforation. In the latter, the Gram stain may show multiple different bacterial forms. (See <a class="local">'Ascitic fluid analysis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59507564"><span class="h2">Ascitic fluid cell count</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The absolute PMN count in the ascitic fluid is calculated by multiplying the total white blood cell count (or total "nucleated cell" count) by the percentage of PMNs in the differential. The diagnosis of SBP is established by a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture and an elevated ascitic fluid absolute PMN count (≥250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>).</p><p>If the laboratory provides an "expanded differential" including bands or even earlier forms of PMNs, these should be added to the count of PMNs. The cell count and differential are performed manually, so the accuracy of the differential is dependent upon the skill of the medical technologist. Some investigators have found that automated cell counts can be accurate [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, this has not been our experience; we have found that their accuracy is poor when the PMN count is low. Nevertheless, the automated approach has the potential to improve the speed with which results are obtained if it can be validated [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>One potential source of error in the PMN count is that hemorrhage into the ascitic fluid, as in a traumatic paracentesis, leads to red cell and white cell entry into the fluid. A corrected PMN count should be calculated if there is bloody fluid:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One PMN is subtracted from the absolute PMN count for every 250 red cells/mm<sup>3 </sup>[<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p></p><p>PMNs lyse rapidly, much more so than red cells. Thus, if the bleeding episode occurred prior to (rather than during) paracentesis, the PMNs that entered the fluid may have lysed, and the corrected PMN count may be a negative number.</p><p>The results of the cell count should be reviewed and a decision made about treatment within a few hours of the paracentesis. Delaying empiric antibiotic treatment could result in the death of the patient from infection. It is prudent to write the initial antibiotic order to be given "stat" to prevent an inadvertent delay in administration of the first dose. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1248.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis"</a>.) </p><p>Use of dipsticks to detect PMNs could provide presumptive evidence of SBP in 90 to 120 seconds and is being studied. Use of dipsticks could lead to initiation of treatment within minutes rather than hours.

Thus, the concentration of PMNs in ascitic fluid and their degree of stimulation have a rough inverse correlation with the glucose concentration [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The glucose concentration generally remains above 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) in SBP but frequently falls below this level in secondary bacterial peritonitis. This difference may be related to the fact that patients with SBP typically have lower ascitic fluid PMN counts than patients with secondary bacterial peritonitis [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In the setting of gut perforation, the ascitic fluid glucose concentration may fall to near zero [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Ascitic fluid lactate dehydrogenase</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in ascitic fluid is released from PMNs that have lysed.

One study, for example, analyzed 22 patients whose ascitic fluid was examined before and then during an episode of SBP. The LDH concentration increased significantly during infection [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The upper limit of normal for LDH varies by laboratory.

In one report, two patients with pancreatic ascites had a mean ascitic fluid amylase concentration of 1957 international unit/L, a value more than five times that in the plasma. By contrast, the mean amylase concentration in patients with nonpancreatic ascites was 42 international unit/L, a value just under one-half of the plasma value [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Ascitic fluid bilirubin concentration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An elevated bilirubin concentration in the ascitic fluid suggests perforation of the gallbladder into the peritoneum (choleperitoneum) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The bilirubin concentration should only be measured if the ascitic fluid is dark orange or brown. Gallbladder perforation is likely if the ascitic fluid bilirubin concentration is higher than that of serum, is greater than 6 mg/dL, and is not associated with an elevated ascitic fluid amylase (which would suggest upper intestinal perforation rather than gallbladder perforation). In patients with causes of ascites other than gallbladder perforation, the ascitic fluid bilirubin concentration is typically low. In one report of patients with ascites not due to gallbladder perforation, the ascitic fluid bilirubin concentration averaged 0.7 mg/dL, a value that was approximately one-third of the plasma value [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H155430739"><span class="h2">Investigational tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Testing for leukocyte esterase (and thus PMNs) in ascitic fluid using a dipstick as a rapid bedside test for SBP is being developed but is not yet available. </p><p>Initial tests used a reagent strip designed for testing urine [<a href="#rid25">25-28</a>].

One practical issue in the United States and other countries is the requirement that bedside laboratory testing comply with hospital accreditation standards.</p><p>Measurement of ascitic fluid lactoferrin has also been proposed as a marker for SBP. Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that is believed to help protect humans from enteric pathogens and contributes to the antimicrobial effects of PMNs. Higher levels in ascitic fluid have been correlated with the presence of SBP. A study involving 148 patients with ascites (with 218 ascitic fluid samples) found a sensitivity and specificity of 96 and 97 percent, respectively, using a cutoff level of 242 ng/mL [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

The distinction of SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis is based largely upon ascitic fluid analysis, imaging studies, and the response to treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122552" data-inline-graphics="122552" href="/z/d/graphic/122552.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p>Two varieties of secondary bacterial peritonitis have been reported: perforation peritonitis (eg, perforated peptic ulcer into ascites) and nonperforation peritonitis (eg, perinephric abscess) [<a href="#rid6">6,33,34</a>].</p><p>The distinction of secondary bacterial peritonitis from SBP is crucial because of the importance of appropriate therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The mortality of secondary bacterial peritonitis approaches 100 percent if treatment consists only of antibiotics with no surgical intervention [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The mortality of SBP is approximately 80 percent if a patient receives an unnecessary exploratory laparotomy [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p></p><p>A scoring system for distinguishing SBP from secondary peritonitis has been developed, although differentiating the two conditions may be challenging [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].
