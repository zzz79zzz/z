Inadequate oxygenation, mechanical obstruction (eg, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax), neurologic dysfunction (eg, high-spinal cord injury), and cardiac dysfunction represent other potential causes or contributing factors [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Hemorrhagic shock is a common and frequently treatable cause of death in injured patients and is second only to traumatic brain injury as the leading cause of death from trauma [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the initial management of hemorrhagic shock in the adult trauma patient.

Clinicians should note that significant drops in blood pressure are generally not manifested until Class III hemorrhage develops, and up to 30 percent of a patient's blood volume can be lost before this occurs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127887.html" rel="external">"Approach to shock in the adult trauma patient", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class I hemorrhage involves a blood volume loss of up to 15 percent. The heart rate is minimally elevated or normal, and there is no change in blood pressure, pulse pressure, or respiratory rate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class II hemorrhage occurs when there is a 15 to 30 percent blood volume loss and is manifested clinically as tachycardia (heart rate of 100 to 120), tachypnea (respiratory rate of 20 to 24), and a decreased pulse pressure, although systolic blood pressure (SBP) changes minimally if at all. The skin may be cool and clammy, and capillary refill may be delayed. This can be considered moderate hemorrhage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class III hemorrhage involves a 30 to 40 percent blood volume loss, resulting in a significant drop in blood pressure and changes in mental status. Any hypotension (SBP less than 90 mmHg) or drop in blood pressure greater than 20 to 30 percent of the measurement at presentation is cause for concern. While diminished anxiety or pain may contribute to such a drop, the clinician must assume it is due to hemorrhage until proven otherwise. Heart rate (≥120 and thready) and respiratory rate are markedly elevated, while urine output is diminished. Capillary refill is delayed. Both class III and class IV should be considered severe hemorrhage. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class IV hemorrhage involves more than 40 percent blood volume loss leading to significant depression in blood pressure and mental status. Most patients in Class IV shock are hypotensive (SBP less than 90 mmHg). Pulse pressure is narrowed (≤25 mmHg), and tachycardia is marked (&gt;120 beats per minute). Urine output is minimal or absent. The skin is cold and pale, and capillary refill is delayed.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4166879139"><span class="h1">INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial management of the adult trauma patient in shock is focused on the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recognizing and reversing life-threatening injuries (eg, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade) immediately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127887.html" rel="external">"Approach to shock in the adult trauma patient", section on 'Clinical features of shock'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128479.html" rel="external">"Control of external hemorrhage in trauma patients", section on 'Rapid assessment'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preventing or limiting ongoing blood loss (see <a class="local">'Initial management of hemorrhage'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Restoring intravascular volume if necessary</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintaining adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs</p><p></p><p>Assessment and treatment are performed simultaneously in the seriously injured patient  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76631" href="/z/d/graphic/76631.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Management of the adult trauma patient and the assessment of traumatic shock are reviewed in greater detail separately. Important interventions for the adult with hemorrhagic shock due to trauma are discussed below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">"Initial management of trauma in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127887.html" rel="external">"Approach to shock in the adult trauma patient"</a>.)</p><p>Direct pressure is the primary and preferred means for controlling external hemorrhage. A tourniquet may be required to control bleeding from a severe extremity injury. (See <a class="local">'Initial management of hemorrhage'</a> below.)</p><p>Vascular access is required and should be obtained as rapidly as possible: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preferred access – Two short, large-bore (16-gauge or larger) intravenous (IV) lines placed in the antecubital region are ideal since blood products can be rapidly infused  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef123118" href="/z/d/graphic/123118.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), but these are not always possible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13824.html" rel="external">"Peripheral venous access in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When a peripheral IV cannot be rapidly placed within minutes or difficulty is anticipated, the following are options:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intraosseous (IO) devices can be placed rapidly and offers an effective alternative. A multicenter study of 581 adult trauma patients (1410 vascular access attempts) with hypotension within five minutes of emergency department arrival found that IO had higher success rates compared with peripheral IV or central venous catheter (CVC; 93 versus 67 versus 59 percent, respectively) and had a faster time to resuscitation when it was the initial access attempt (5.8 versus 6.7 minutes) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The improved time to resuscitation was more pronounced (5.7 versus 7.5 minutes) in a subgroup analysis of 123 patients who arrived without vascular access (430 access attempts) and had IO as the initial access attempt. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6321.html" rel="external">"Intraosseous infusion"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ultrasound-guided placement of a peripheral IV catheter or placement of a CVC (size 8 French) are reasonable approaches when rapid adequate peripheral access cannot be obtained; these should be placed following or simultaneously (if feasible) with IO access since they require more time. A CVC also allows measurement of central venous pressure. CVC placement under ultrasound guidance offers high success rates with fewer complications than procedures performed without ultrasound [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. While IO access may be the best option for initial access, either peripheral or CVC access should be obtained once stability permits. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13824.html" rel="external">"Peripheral venous access in adults", section on 'Role of ultrasound guidance'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6315.html" rel="external">"Basic principles of ultrasound-guided venous access"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8194.html" rel="external">"Central venous access in adults: General principles"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Some experts advocate use of distal saphenous vein cutdowns due to ease of access and consistency of anatomy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p>Traumatic shock occurs most often from hemorrhage. Massive hemorrhage can occur in the chest, abdomen, retroperitoneum, and from major external wounds. The thigh can hold up to approximately 1 L of blood. Scalp lacerations can bleed profusely and are often overlooked. Causes of shock in trauma are provided in the table and discussed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63698" href="/z/d/graphic/63698.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127887.html" rel="external">"Approach to shock in the adult trauma patient"</a>.) </p><p>Ultrasound is an integral part of the initial evaluation of the trauma patient and reliably identifies free intra-abdominal and pericardial fluid in the hands of proficient ultrasonographers [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. During the initial resuscitation, the extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (E-FAST) exam is performed to assess first for pericardial blood and then for intraperitoneal bleeding and pneumothorax. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13853.html" rel="external">"Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma"</a>.)</p><p>Ultrasound has largely replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) in the initial assessment of the trauma patient, although DPL may retain a role in specific circumstances. If ultrasound is unavailable or its findings are equivocal or inconsistent with the clinical picture, a DPL or diagnostic peritoneal tap (DPT) can provide important information. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/348.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults", section on 'Diagnostic peritoneal lavage'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/360.html" rel="external">"Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management", section on 'Diagnostic tests'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3959512564"><span class="h1">INITIAL MANAGEMENT OF HEMORRHAGE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2303255334"><span class="h2">Control of compressible or extremity bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bleeding from external wounds must be controlled as rapidly as possible. Direct pressure is the primary and preferred means for controlling external hemorrhage. While clamping bleeding vessels under direct visualization is acceptable when necessary, blind clamping should <strong>not</strong> be performed. Management of external hemorrhage is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128479.html" rel="external">"Control of external hemorrhage in trauma patients", section on 'Management of hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p>Scalp lacerations can bleed profusely and are often overlooked if significant thoracic or abdominal injuries are present. Scalp lacerations can be managed by injecting <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> directly into the wound, by placing clips (eg, Raney clips  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52581" href="/z/d/graphic/52581.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>)), or by closing the wound with running (ie, non-interrupted) or running locked stitches using heavy suture. Running or interrupted sutures may also be used to control severe bleeding from extremity wounds when direct pressure is inadequate and the few available clinicians must perform other important interventions for an unstable trauma patient. </p><p>A hemostatic-impregnated dressing can be applied, followed by holding direct pressure for at least three minutes. A deep wound can be packed with gauze or a hemostatic agent, thus putting direct pressure on the vessels within the wound. Available hemostatic agents are presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852" href="/z/d/graphic/71852.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) and discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15069.html" rel="external">"Overview of topical hemostatic agents and tissue adhesives", section on 'External agents'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128479.html" rel="external">"Control of external hemorrhage in trauma patients", section on 'Wound packing'</a>.)</p><p>Use of a tourniquet is acceptable to stop hemorrhage in cases of amputation or severe extremity injury when other measures have not successfully controlled bleeding. Tourniquets should be released as soon as possible, and the time of application and duration in use should be clearly recorded. In a patient with a junctional wound (ie, shoulder, axilla, groin) that is too proximal for an extremity tourniquet, application of an external compression device (ie, junctional tourniquet) can be attempted, although evidence has not shown a clear benefit in civilian trauma [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15150.html" rel="external">"Severe lower extremity injury in the adult patient", section on 'Control of hemorrhage'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128479.html" rel="external">"Control of external hemorrhage in trauma patients", section on 'Extremity tourniquets'</a>.)</p><p>Tourniquet placement techniques and conversion to a pressure dressing are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128479.html" rel="external">"Control of external hemorrhage in trauma patients", section on 'Extremity tourniquet techniques'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H537861750"><span class="h3">Hemorrhage from pelvic fracture</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unstable pelvic fractures and associated vascular injuries can cause hemorrhagic shock. Preliminary stabilization of the pelvis by applying a circumferential pelvic binder or tying a sheet firmly around the pelvis can reduce bleeding. Such interventions are most important with "open-book" pelvic fractures (in which the symphysis pubis is disrupted [≥2.5 cm], the pelvis opened, and the retroperitoneal space enlarged)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73047" href="/z/d/graphic/73047.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). In addition to immediate orthopedic consultation, interventional radiology and vascular surgery may be needed to help control hemorrhage. When available, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) has demonstrated favorable outcomes in patients with massive bleeding from pelvic trauma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/360.html" rel="external">"Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management", section on 'Management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16863.html" rel="external">"Endovascular methods for aortic control in trauma", section on 'Pelvic trauma at risk for hemodynamic collapse'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15151.html" rel="external">"Severe pelvic fracture in the adult trauma patient"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H615879332"><span class="h2">Control of non-compressible bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Methods for identifying noncompressible bleeding include focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) for the abdomen, chest radiograph for the chest, and computed tomography (CT) for the retroperitoneal space. Hemodynamically stable patients can undergo CT for further assessment. Unstable patients should be stabilized either by resuscitation in the operating room or, in some situations, with REBOA prior to going to the CT scanner.

To limit the adverse systemic effects of injury and massive transfusion (eg, coagulopathy), either whole blood or a balanced ratio of blood components (ie, 1:1:1 of PRBCs, plasma, and platelets) are best for the initial resuscitation. The evidence supporting these approaches is reviewed in detail separately.

The goal of DCR is to control hemorrhage rapidly and prevent coagulopathy by minimizing crystalloid use and transfusing early, using relatively high ratios of plasma and platelets to red blood cells [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. This may entail allowing patients to remain relatively hypotensive during some portion of their resuscitation (so-called permissive hypotension) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

When to begin transfusion depends on clinical circumstances. As an example, immediate transfusion is needed when exsanguination is imminent, such as a patient with a thoracic injury whose chest tube releases over 2 L of blood upon placement. Another patient with a self-inflicted wrist laceration may not require any transfusion despite being hypotensive because hemorrhage is promptly controlled, the wound is easily repaired, and comorbidities are absent. Thus, the best approach to transfusion varies by clinical scenario; common and important scenarios are reviewed below.

With severely injured patients, our goal is to minimize crystalloid administration, while avoiding significant hypotension, until blood is available. The transition from crystalloid to blood should occur as early as possible in unstable trauma patients. Excessive infusion of crystalloid (ie, ratio of crystalloid to PRBCs &gt;1.5:1 or volume of crystalloid &gt;1 L) has been associated with worse outcomes in patients with severe hemorrhage, according to observational data, and should be avoided [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. </p><p>Many hospitals have whole blood or blood products immediately available in the emergency department (ED). In such hospitals, immediate transfusion, rather than fluid resuscitation, should be performed for patients with severe hemorrhage in obvious need of transfusion. </p><p>If whole blood or blood products are not immediately available, we suggest that initial fluid resuscitation for trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock consist of 500 mL boluses of isotonic crystalloid given as rapidly as possible through short, large gauge (16 or larger) peripheral IVs. Central venous catheters are used when peripheral IVs are not available. Fluid resuscitation should be limited to the extent possible, using such boluses only until whole blood or blood products are available or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 80 to 90 mmHg is achieved. However, if significant traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal injury is suspected, then the goal for resuscitation is a mean arterial pressure of 85 to 90 mmHg. (See <a class="local">'Delayed fluid resuscitation/controlled hypotension'</a> below and <a class="local">'Spinal cord injury in the setting of hemorrhagic shock'</a> below.) </p><p>One prospective observational study looking at goal directed resuscitation in the prehospital setting found that infusions of more than 500 mL of isotonic crystalloid were associated with worse outcomes in patients without hypotension (defined as a SBP &lt;90), but not in patients with hypotension, suggesting that resuscitation should be goal directed based on the presence or absence of hypotension [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p>Harm can ensue in cases when excessive amounts of fluid are given to a patient at increased risk (eg, patient with coagulopathy of trauma or acute renal injury caused by hypoperfusion during a period of hemorrhagic shock).

On the other hand, large volume resuscitation using LR can cause a metabolic alkalosis, as lactate metabolism generates bicarbonate. However, the typical volumes of either NS or LR used during a trauma resuscitation do not appear to have significant clinical consequences. The constituents of NS, LR, and other commonly used intravenous solutions are described in the following table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117769" href="/z/d/graphic/117769.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Of note, LR and blood must be infused through separate IV tubing because of the risk of clotting, which may be problematic in the setting of trauma. </p><p>Debate over the best approach to fluid resuscitation in traumatic shock is likely to continue. A systematic review of prehospital fluid resuscitation in trauma found insufficient evidence for the superiority of any particular fluid type [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Some researchers claim LR is superior to NS in the resuscitation of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, stating that patients who receive large volumes of NS experience increased blood loss and greater hypercoagulability; other researchers argue just the opposite [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. A subsequent multicenter trial involving over 15,000 critically ill patients, including nontrauma and trauma patients, reported that those treated with balanced crystalloids (eg, LR) had lower mortality (10.3 versus 11.1 percent) and fewer major kidney injuries (14.3 versus 15.4 percent) compared with those who received NS [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Harm from either is highly unlikely if used in limited (2 L or less) amounts. The relative merits and use of different crystalloid solutions for resuscitation are discussed in detail separately.

Further research to determine the appropriateness and effectiveness of this approach is needed [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Based on current data, limiting fluid resuscitation to 1 L or less and moving directly to transfusion appears to be the best strategy. (See <a class="local">'Transfusion'</a> above.)</p><p>In one widely cited prospective study of 598 patients with penetrating chest injuries treated at a major trauma center, delayed fluid resuscitation until operative intervention to control bleeding was associated with a statistically significant improvement in patient survival (70 versus 62 percent in those given immediate fluid repletion) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Care must be taken when extrapolating the results of this trial. Stratification was not performed to identify which patients might benefit from delayed therapy, subjects were primarily young and healthy, and the mean time from injury to operation was two hours, results that are not attainable in most circumstances.</p><p>In a preliminary analysis of a trial conducted at another major trauma center, 90 young adults with penetrating (n = 84) or blunt (n = 6) trauma resulting in at least one SBP reading below 90 mmHg, and hemorrhage requiring immediate laparotomy or thoracotomy, were randomly assigned upon arrival to the operating theater to resuscitation using a low-goal mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg (LMAP group) or a high-goal mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg (HMAP) [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Among the patients excluded were those with traumatic brain injury. Anesthesiologists did not intervene to lower the blood pressure of patients in the LMAP group whose MAP exceeded 50 mmHg. Patients in the LMAP group had lower postoperative mortality (6 versus 10 deaths), received fewer blood products (1594 versus 2898 mL), and did not develop coagulopathy or multiple organ failure (MOF), compared with seven cases of coagulopathy and two cases of MOF in the HMAP group. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in overall mortality at 30 days. </p><p>Other results favoring controlled hypotension or controlled resuscitation for both penetrating and blunt trauma patients include European guidelines published in 2019 recommending a target SBP of 80 to 90 mmHg until major bleeding has been stopped in the initial phase following trauma without brain injury [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

Subgroup analysis found TXA decreased 30-day all-cause mortality if administered within one hour of injury (4.6 versus 7.6 percent, difference -3.0 percent, 95% CI -5.7 to -0.3 percent) and for patients with severe shock (systolic blood pressure &lt;70 mmHg; 18.5 versus 35.5 percent, difference -17 percent, 95% CI -25.8 to -8.1 percent). There was no association between TXA and thromboembolic events. The PATCH trial included 1310 adult trauma patients at risk for significant hemorrhage who could be administered TXA within three hours after injury [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. Compared with placebo, TXA (bolus of 1 g IV before hospital admission, followed by a 1 g infusion over eight hours after arrival at the hospital) decreased 28-day mortality (17.3 versus 21.8 percent, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99) but was not associated with a difference in survival with good functional outcomes after six months. </p><p>TXA administered within three hours of injury is safe for most patients, but use of TEG to guide treatment may decrease risk for adverse events. A meta-analysis evaluated the incidence of thrombotic events associated with TXA administration in studies of traumatic, other surgical, and medical bleeding and found no significant increase in thrombotic events associated with any TXA dosing regimen [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. However, patients who present with the more common "shutdown" fibrinolytic phenotype appear to be at higher risk of thromboembolic complications and long-term organ failure and thus may remain conceptually at increased risk of harm from TXA treatment. Thus, in clinical settings in which immediate access to viscoelastic assays allows early determination of the presenting fibrinolytic phenotype, we suggest that an empiric bolus dose of TXA be given as early as possible (provided that it can be administered within three hours of injury) and that the viscoelastic assay results may be an appropriate guide to whether additional doses of TXA are needed. Patients who maintain subphysiologic levels of fibrinolysis after initial TXA administration are unlikely to benefit from additional TXA dosing. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3565583670"><span class="h2">Bleeding readily controlled in ED</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Severe bleeding can sometimes be controlled effectively in the ED or trauma bay. Closure of scalp lacerations and compression of venous extremity wounds reduce the threat of further bleeding, even though significant hemorrhage may have occurred. Application of a tourniquet can prevent further bleeding from what would otherwise be a life-threatening extremity wound. </p><p>Whether to transfuse after bleeding has been controlled depends on the clinical situation and the patient's underlying comorbidities. Patients that are experiencing symptoms due to anemia from blood loss may require transfusion even after bleeding has been controlled. As an example, a patient with coronary artery disease who is experiencing chest pain suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome should be given blood. The hemoglobin thresholds for patients with comorbidities are discussed separately and summarized in the following table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93934" href="/z/d/graphic/93934.html" rel="external">table 7</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults"</a>.)</p><p>There is no evidence of benefit from transfusing patients in whom bleeding has been controlled and who are not experiencing any symptoms related to anemia.

The answer depends on the clinical scenario, including the extent of known or suspected injuries, the blood products available, and the capabilities of the transport team. </p><p>Sometimes it is necessary to transfer a patient being actively resuscitated for as yet unknown injuries. In these situations, we recommend limiting the administration of crystalloid prior to transfer (in part to prevent infusions of large volumes during transfer), and emphasizing transfusion of whole blood or a balanced ratio of blood products (ie, 1:1:1) whenever possible. We exceed one liter of crystalloid only if whole blood or blood products are not available. If whole blood is unavailable and only one blood product can accompany the patient during transfer, PRBCs should be taken, bearing in mind the ultimate goal of giving a 1:1:1 ratio of blood products [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].

While controlled hypotension may be appropriate for many trauma patients, those with SCI, like those with TBI, are at greater risk for complications from hypotension. Thus, a higher blood pressure is needed to ensure adequate perfusion of the spinal cord. Guidelines from 2013 recommend maintaining a MAP of at least 85 to 90 mmHg for patients with SCI [<a href="#rid59">59</a>], and subsequent studies support this goal [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Acute SCI and the management of TBI are discussed separately.

Therefore, transfusion is prioritized. However, long-term morbidity in such patients depends largely upon the ability to maintain MAP in the goal range. Thus, vasopressor therapy should be added expeditiously if an appropriate MAP cannot be achieved with transfusion alone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1619.html" rel="external">"Use of vasopressors and inotropes"</a>.)</p><p>For patients with SCI and hemorrhagic shock, we recommend transfusion as described above for patients with severe ongoing bleeding, with the goal of maintaining a MAP of 85 to 90 mmHg. Vasopressor therapy is needed for patients with SCI when transfusion alone have failed to raise or maintain the MAP in the 85 to 90 mmHg range. While there are no data to support a particular timeline, given the critical importance of maintaining perfusion in patients with TBI or SCI, we suggest initiating vasopressor therapy within 15 minutes of blood product resuscitation if a MAP of 85 has not been achieved.

Thromboelastography (TEG), or comparable rapid point-of-care assessment of coagulation, should be used to guide blood transfusion whenever available. However, in many community hospitals, such resources are not available. In such cases, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 65 mmHg or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 80 to 90 mmHg is a reasonable goal for patients with penetrating trauma. For blunt trauma patients, particularly those with possible traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI), a MAP above 85 mmHg or a SBP above 120 mmHg is reasonable. These goals may need to be adjusted upward in patients with a known history of uncontrolled hypertension. (See <a class="local">'Management by clinical scenario'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15147.html" rel="external">"Etiology and diagnosis of coagulopathy in trauma patients"</a>.) </p><p>Most experts advocate strictly limiting the amount of IV fluid used for trauma resuscitation in the absence of hypotension or obvious injury [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. Early blood transfusion is preferred to continued administration of IV fluids.

Careful, continual monitoring of these patients is crucial. </p><p>Some trauma patients, particularly in community hospitals, must be managed in the emergency department (ED) for prolonged periods when surgical resources or transport is not immediately available. It remains unclear what resuscitation targets are most useful for guiding management. Those emergency clinicians without access to sophisticated noninvasive technologies such as TEG must rely on standard physiologic and laboratory measurements to determine whether resuscitation is adequate.

A patient with ≥2 of the following criteria (Assessment of Blood Consumption score) are likely to need a massive transfusion (see <a class="local">'Predicting the need for massive transfusion'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Penetrating mechanism of injury</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Positive focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) examination (ie, evidence of hemorrhage)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>SBP of 90 mmHg or less</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Heart rate of 120 beats per minute (bpm) or greater</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Supportive care during transfusion</strong> – In trauma patients who are receiving blood transfusions, additional elements of care include preventing hypothermia and avoiding all unnecessary infusions of crystalloids. (See <a class="local">'Moderate to severe ongoing hemorrhage'</a> above and <a class="local">'Intravenous fluid resuscitation'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tranexamic acid</strong><strong> (TXA)</strong> – In patients with suspected moderate to severe active hemorrhage who present within three hours of injury, we recommend administering TXA (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). The initial dose is 1 gram given over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 1 g over eight hours. Where available, viscoelastic assays such as thromboelastography (TEG) or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) can be used to guide treatment, but if these assays are unavailable, TXA should be administered empirically. TXA reduces all-cause and bleeding-related mortality if given within three hours of injury in patients with significant hemorrhage. (See <a class="local">'Patient within three hours of injury'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring and goals during resuscitation </strong>– TEG, or comparable rapid point-of-care assessment of coagulation, should be used to guide blood transfusion whenever available. When unavailable, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 65 mmHg or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 80 to 90 mmHg is a reasonable goal for patients with penetrating trauma. For blunt trauma patients, particularly those with possible traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI), a MAP above 85 mmHg or an SBP above 120 mmHg is reasonable. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring and goals for prolonged resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of clinical scenarios</strong> – Scenarios other than moderate to severe ongoing hemorrhage include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Readily controlled hemorrhage</strong> – Patients that are experiencing symptoms due to anemia from blood loss may require transfusion even after bleeding has been controlled. There is no evidence of benefit from transfusing patients in whom bleeding has been controlled and who are not experiencing any symptoms related to anemia. (See <a class="local">'Bleeding readily controlled in ED'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hemorrhage in patient requiring transfer</strong> –<strong> </strong>In a patient who needs transfer with an unidentified injury, limit the administration of crystalloid prior to transfer and transfuse whole blood or a balanced ratio of blood products (ie, 1:1:1) whenever possible. We exceed 1 liter of crystalloid only if whole blood or blood products are not available. If whole blood is unavailable and only one blood product can accompany the patient during transfer, PRBCs should be taken. (See <a class="local">'Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion for the transfer patient'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Spinal cord injury and hemorrhage</strong> –<strong> </strong>These patients are at greater risk for complications from hypotension, and a higher blood pressure is needed to ensure adequate perfusion of the spinal cord (maintain a MAP of at least 85 to 90 mmHg). (See <a class="local">'Spinal cord injury in the setting of hemorrhagic shock'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pregnant patient with hemorrhage</strong> – Important considerations include rapid obstetrical consultation, displacing the uterus to the patient's left side, recognizing that substantial changes in vital signs may not occur until more than 20 percent of total blood volume has been lost, need for continuous fetal heart rate monitoring, and treat with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9858" href="/z/d/drug information/9858.html" rel="external">anti-D immune globulin</a> when needed.
