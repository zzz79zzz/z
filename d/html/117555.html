         Patients seeking to participate in recreational self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving may ask their primary care clinician for advice and an evaluation to determine if it is safe for them. Such requests may be general in nature or with specific medical conditions in mind. Whenever possible, we recommend that questions about diving fitness in patients with specific health conditions be addressed with a diving medicine specialist. Resources that include a list of specialists trained in fitness to dive examinations are available below. (See

         This topic will review basic information about fitness for recreational diving and the risks posed by common medical conditions; a comprehensive discussion of related medical complications and contraindications to diving is beyond its scope. Examinations for scientific or occupational diving have different requirements and should be performed by a diving medicine specialist. The diagnosis and management of SCUBA-related complications are discussed separately. (See

          BASIC PHYSIOLOGY OF SCUBA DIVING

         An understanding of the basic physiology of immersion and breathing compressed gas, and their effects on the body, helps to inform the evaluation of prospective divers. Nuances about differences in gas composition and the effects of extreme depth will not be considered, but basic concepts of immersion, pressure, exposure, inert gas uptake, and oxygen toxicity are discussed.
        </p>
        <p>
         SCUBA diving can be defined simply as breathing compressed gas while immersed underwater. Most often, recreational divers breathe compressed air (21 percent oxygen), though gas composition may vary. The recreational diving depth is commonly defined as no deeper than 130 feet (40 meters), but with advanced technical diving, far greater depths can be reached.
        </p>
        <p>
         Elements of diving with important physiologic effects include the following:

         <strong>
          Immersion
         </strong>
         – Immersion in water has multiple physiologic effects, including peripheral vasoconstriction leading to increased intrathoracic blood volume and right heart pressures [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. This results in diuresis and may cause pulmonary edema in susceptible individuals, as well as potentially exacerbating underlying cardiac conditions. (See

         <strong>
          Pressure
         </strong>
         – Changes in ambient pressure affect all air-filled spaces in the body in accordance with Boyle's law. Boyle's law states that at a constant temperature, the volume of a gas varies inversely with the ambient pressure. In other words, the volume of a gas decreases as pressure increases (descent during dive) and increases as pressure decreases (ascent from dive). Inability to equilibrate pressures may cause barotrauma, particularly to the middle ear, sinuses, and lungs. (See

         <strong>
          Gas exposure
         </strong>
         – Increased ambient pressure results in increased partial pressures of breathing gases. In the case of nitrogen, supersaturation of tissues with this gas may cause decompression sickness (DCS). In the case of oxygen, exposure to high partial pressures may lead to oxygen toxicity (either pulmonary or central nervous system). (See

          Work of breathing

         There is no standard approach to medical evaluation or re-evaluation for recreational diving. In many regions, including much of the United States, a screening medical questionnaire is given to prospective divers. This is typically done prior to initial certification or during advanced certification courses and sometimes is required by diving charter operations. If the prospective diver does not respond "yes" to any of the medical screening questions, they are permitted to proceed without any further medical evaluation. The most commonly used screening form is the

         The degree of exertion required to participate in SCUBA diving varies depending on several factors including the type of diving and location. At a minimum, a diver should be able to maintain an exertion level of six metabolic equivalents of task (METs), equivalent of jogging 14 minutes/mile (nine minutes/km), with the understanding that exertion exceeding this level may be required occasionally [

         In general, any medical condition that impairs someone's ability to exert themselves underwater safely, such as untreated coronary artery disease or pulmonary disease, is considered an absolute contraindication to SCUBA diving  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139446" href="/z/d/graphic/139446.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). A history of spontaneous pneumothorax and pregnancy are considered absolute contraindications. In addition, any conditions that entail a risk of incapacitation or loss of consciousness, such as seizure disorders or syncope, are contraindications to diving. If stable and well managed, some conditions may be considered relative contraindications.
        </p>
        <p>
         Below are brief summaries of common conditions, organized by organ system, that are typically contraindications to diving or require further investigation before diving is permitted. Evidence about the safety of diving with these medical conditions is limited, and recommendations are typically based on expert opinion. Expert groups that have released fitness to dive recommendations include the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS), Divers Alert Network (DAN), South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society (SPUMS), British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the UK Diving Medical Committee (UKDMC). While there is substantial overlap and general agreement among these organizations as to general guidance, there are some differences of opinion about specific conditions. Recommendations from many of these organizations are cited below.

         Cardiovascular disease likely represents the greatest risk to divers. In the 2019 Divers Alert Network (DAN) annual fatality report, the most common cause of disabling injury among divers was cardiovascular disease [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Broadly speaking, the cardiovascular evaluation of a prospective diver should focus on conditions that could cause a loss of consciousness or incapacitation of any kind, impaired exercise tolerance, or increased risk for decompression sickness (DCS) or arterial gas embolism. These conditions include arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, decompensated heart failure, and septal defects [

         The South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society (SPUMS) published guidelines in 2020 that added left ventricular dysfunction of any kind to the list above, with the caveat of those with an ejection fraction above 50 percent and good exercise capacity might be able to dive but require careful evaluation [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. While the author agrees with general guidance around the contraindications listed here, individual exceptions do occur (eg, otherwise healthy and fit young adult with mild, nonobstructive cardiomyopathy may be able to dive). Such patients are best assessed on a case-by-case basis by or in consultation with a diving medicine specialist.

        <p>
         More challenging is screening patients with potentially undiagnosed cardiac disease at risk of an adverse event while diving. Ultimately, the extent of such screening is determined by the clinician, but it is worth noting that cardiac disease represents a significant risk, particularly to the aging diver [

         Well-controlled hypertension is not an absolute contraindication to diving but should be evaluated carefully before a patient is cleared to dive. Hypertension is a risk factor for left ventricular hypertrophy, and thus for arrhythmia, as well as for coronary artery disease [

         Another frequently encountered challenge when evaluating prospective divers is screening for cardiac septal defects and providing management recommendations should such defects be discovered. Below, we discuss patent (also called persistent) foramen ovale (PFO), the most common septal defect, estimated to be present in approximately 27 percent of the population [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1420.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The primary concern in divers with a PFO is the movement of venous gas bubbles to the arterial circulation via an intracardiac shunt. Venous gas bubbles occur with some regularity when diving. Their appearance increases with gas loading (increased time and depth of breathing compressed inert gas, most commonly nitrogen) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The presence of gas bubbles alone does not necessarily cause disease, as they are often filtered by the capillary system in the pulmonary vasculature. However, if a right-to-left shunt exists that bypasses the pulmonary system, gas bubbles may pass to the arterial side and cause decompression illness, sometimes called a paradoxical arterial gas embolism.
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of a PFO is associated with an increased risk of DCS. Experts often give the risk as 2.5 times greater for DCS overall and 4 times greater for neurologic DCS. However, the degree of risk varies based on several factors including the size of the shunt. The absolute risk is low, with the estimated incidence of neurologic DCS in divers with PFO at 4.7 cases per 10,000 dives [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Closure of a PFO is associated with some risk, and treatment recommendations must take this into account.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2016, SPUMS and the UK Diving Medical Committee (UKDMC) issued a joint statement about screening and management of PFO in divers with the following recommendations [

        <p>
         In a joint statement, DAN and UHMS have suggested that screening for a PFO be performed in patients with a history of more than one episode of DCS associated with cerebral, spinal, vestibulocochlear, or cutaneous manifestations [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The author believes that divers with a history of DCS should be evaluated by or in consultation with a diving medicine specialist before returning to dive [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If investigation is indicated, the screening must include a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with bubble contrast and provocative maneuvers to evaluate for right-to-left shunting. TTE without bubble contrast is not sufficient. A spontaneous right-to-left shunt or large, provoked shunt is likely a significant risk factor for decompression illness. The risk of decompression illness with smaller shunts is likely increased, but the magnitude has not been quantified. The decision whether to repair a PFO and/or continue diving (with possible modifications) should be made in conjunction with a cardiologist and diving medicine specialist. Following PFO closure, a repeat bubble TTE should be performed at least three months after to ensure closure [

         Decisions about diving with a pacemaker must be made carefully, accounting for factors such as the indication for the device and the device itself.

         The most common injury sustained from SCUBA diving is middle ear barotrauma, which can occur due to the changes in pressure that develop during descent and ascent. Equilibration of the pressures in air-filled spaces must occur to avoid such barotrauma. Procedures to accomplish this in the middle ear must be performed actively by the diver during descent (eg, Valsalva) but occur passively during ascent unless there is an obstruction (eg, mass, edema, hemorrhage). Similarly, pressure in the sinuses should equilibrate passively unless there is obstruction. Other air-filled spaces, such as dental caries, poor-fitting fillings, and those created by periodontal prosthetics, are also at risk for barotrauma [

         Any diver with a history of ear or sinus surgery should be evaluated by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat [ENT] surgeon) prior to diving, as should those with a history of tympanic membrane rupture or conditions that increase the risk for such rupture (eg, history of tympanostomy tubes, eustachian tube dysfunction). Unhealed tympanic membrane rupture or the presence of tympanostomy tubes is generally considered disqualifying. Some conditions may prevent the patient from diving only temporarily. These include sinusitis, otitis media, and some causes of obstruction (eg, cerumen impaction, polyps). After resolution and re-evaluation, the candidate may be considered fit for diving.

         Any condition that causes vertigo (eg, Meniere disease, labyrinthitis, other causes of vestibular dysfunction) is potentially disqualifying and should be carefully evaluated. Vertigo that occurs underwater may be debilitating and cause disorientation, vomiting and aspiration, or drowning [

         Diabetes mellitus was previously considered a contraindication to diving due primarily to the risk of hypoglycemia and incapacitation. However, many divers with diabetes participate safely, and in 2005, UHMS and DAN published a set of consensus guidelines for diver selection, glucose management, and safe diving practices [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Diabetics who are controlled only on oral agents that do not cause hypoglycemia are likely to be at less risk than those on insulin or oral agents that may cause hypoglycemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         It should also be noted that specific devices such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors that are commonly worn by diabetic patients are unlikely to be tested or rated for immersion or depth. They may need to be removed or disconnected during the dive.

         In general, any severe or uncontrolled psychiatric disorder, including substance abuse, is considered a contraindication to diving. Diving with well-controlled psychiatric disorders may be possible, but special consideration should be paid to any candidate with a history of panic, anxiety, or claustrophobia. Panic underwater may lead to poor decision-making or rapid ascent, which can result in severe injury or death. The potential effects of psychiatric medications should be accounted for when considering diver safety. (See

         Pregnancy is generally considered a contraindication to diving. The fetus is not protected from DCS and is at greater risk of malformation and arterial gas embolism due to the lack of an effective pulmonary capillary filter [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. In addition, changes in blood flow during pregnancy and abnormal temperature regulation in the mother can increase the risk of DCS, while congested mucous membranes can lead to sinus and ear barotrauma. However, termination of pregnancy is not recommended in women who have dived early in pregnancy, and normal infants have been born to women who continued diving throughout gestation.

         Any diver with a history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) should be evaluated by a physician before beginning (or returning to) diving.

         – A history of seizure other than isolated childhood febrile seizure is widely considered a contraindication to diving. Migraine with aura is associated with PFO, and appropriate evaluation should be performed as indicated. Other neurologic conditions are discussed in the text. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Neurologic'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat conditions
         </strong>
         – Middle ear barotrauma is the most common injury sustained from diving. Individuals with a history of ear or sinus surgery, tympanic membrane rupture, or conditions that increase the risk of tympanic membrane rupture (eg, history of tympanostomy tubes, eustachian tube dysfunction) should be evaluated by an otolaryngologist prior to diving. Conditions such as sinusitis, otitis media, and some causes of obstruction (eg, cerumen impaction, polyps) may temporarily disqualify prospective divers. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Any condition that causes vertigo (eg, Meniere disease, labyrinthitis) is potentially disqualifying and should be carefully evaluated. Vertigo that occurs underwater may be debilitating and cause disorientation, vomiting and aspiration, or drowning.

         <strong>
          Diabetes
         </strong>
         – Diabetes mellitus has been considered a contraindication to diving due primarily to the risk of hypoglycemia and incapacitation, but many diabetic patients participate safely by following specific safety guidelines. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diabetes'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Other conditions and medications
         </strong>
         – Other conditions that may be contraindications to participation in diving are discussed in the text. While few medications constitute an absolute contraindication to SCUBA diving, many may pose a potential threat to diver safety and warrant careful consideration. (See
         <a class="local">
