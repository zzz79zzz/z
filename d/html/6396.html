(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6388.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children", section on 'Classification'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6397.html" rel="external">"Shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Initial management", section on 'Further management by type of shock'</a>.)</p><p>Classification of pediatric shock and typical causes include the following [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypovolemic shock</strong> – Hypovolemic shock is the most common type of shock in children. Causes include fluid and electrolyte loss (as from gastroenteritis or osmotic diuresis), hemorrhage (as from trauma), capillary leak (as from bowel obstruction or burns), inadequate fluid intake, and insensible losses (eg, fever, tachypnea, or burns). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6389.html" rel="external">"Hypovolemic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Initial evaluation and management", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">By definition, preload is decreased in hypovolemic shock. SVR may be increased as the result of compensatory mechanisms. Cardiac contractility is typically normal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6389.html" rel="external">"Hypovolemic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Initial evaluation and management", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Distributive shock</strong> – Distributive shock physiologically refers to a condition in which SVR is initially decreased. It may occur as the result of sepsis, anaphylaxis, or neurologic injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6388.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children", section on 'Distributive shock'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">With sepsis and anaphylaxis, volume depletion may also develop because of losses related to the underlying infection (septic shock), or inflammatory cascade (anaphylaxis). Both processes are associated with increased capillary permeability with loss of plasma from the intravascular space into the tissues. Myocardial dysfunction can also contribute to poor tissue perfusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In septic shock, abnormal distribution of blood flow as the result of changes in vasomotor tone causes inappropriate tissue perfusion (such as decreased splanchnic circulation with increased flow to skin and muscle). SVR may be low, producing increased blood flow to skin and a wide pulse pressure (warm shock) or SVR may be increased, in which case, blood flow to skin is decreased and the pulse pressure is narrow (cold shock). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6395.html" rel="external">"Sepsis in children: Definitions, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Neurogenic shock may develop in a child with a high spinal cord injury (above the sixth thoracic spinal level) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Uncontrolled vasodilation occurs as the result of the sudden loss of sympathetic tone. Compensatory sympathetic mechanisms (such as tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) are absent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6561.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiogenic shock</strong> – Cardiogenic shock results from pump failure because of intrinsic cardiac disease (eg, congenital heart disease, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67841" href="/d/graphic/67841.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)). Physiologic features of cardiogenic shock include tachycardia, increased SVR, and decreased cardiac output [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6388.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children", section on 'Cardiogenic shock'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Obstructive shock</strong> – Obstructive shock describes physical obstruction of systemic blood flow from the heart which causes abrupt impairment of cardiac output  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67841" href="/d/graphic/67841.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Causes of obstructive shock include cardiac tamponade, tension pneumo- or hemothorax and massive pulmonary embolism. Infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart lesions, such as coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left ventricle syndrome, may also present in shock when the ductus arteriosus closes during the first few weeks of life. Conditions that cause obstructive shock must be recognized quickly because they generally require specific treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6388.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children", section on 'Obstructive shock'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6467.html" rel="external">"Approach to the ill-appearing infant (younger than 90 days of age)", section on 'Initial stabilization'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>For any given condition that can cause shock, the classification may be mixed. Patients with distributive shock, in particular, often have multiple physiologic abnormalities. As an example, children with distributive shock from sepsis may also have volume loss (from vomiting, diarrhea, poor intake, or increased insensible fluid loss from tachypnea and fever) and myocardial depression from the effect of inflammatory mediators released in response to infection [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Clinical classification of shock'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children can compensate for circulatory dysfunction (primarily by increasing heart rate, systemic vascular resistance [SVR], and venous tone) and maintain normal blood pressures despite significantly compromised tissue perfusion. Consequently, hypotension is a very late and ominous finding [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>]. The challenge for the clinician is to recognize children in shock early (before they develop hypotension), when they are more likely to respond favorably to treatment.</p><p>Although the cause of shock may not be initially apparent, treatment must begin immediately. A systematic approach to the evaluation of children with evidence of poor perfusion typically identifies features of the history, physical examination, and ancillary studies that suggest the underlying condition  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81356" href="/d/graphic/81356.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>The goals of the initial evaluation of shock in children include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immediate identification of life-threatening conditions (eg, tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, or pulmonary embolism)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rapid recognition of circulatory compromise</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early classification of the type and cause of shock</p><p></p><p>The initial management of undifferentiated shock is provided in the algorithm and discussed in detail separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129655" href="/d/graphic/129655.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).
