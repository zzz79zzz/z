         Regular posttreatment follow-up is an essential part of the care of patients who are treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goals of posttreatment surveillance are the early detection of locoregional recurrences, distant metastases, or second primary malignancies, and evaluation for and management of treatment-related complications.
        </p>
        <p>
         Posttreatment surveillance in patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer is reviewed here. An overview of the treatment of head and neck cancer is presented separately. (See

          Recurrent disease and second primary malignancies

         The rationale for surveillance is that early detection of either a recurrence or a second primary tumor allows for appropriate treatment and better functional and survival outcomes. However, controlled prospective data demonstrating a survival benefit for any follow-up strategy do not exist. Therefore, retrospective data and observational studies are used to guide surveillance recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether early detection of recurrent disease alters outcomes is uncertain. Routine surveillance has been associated with a survival benefit in some observational studies when patients diagnosed at routine follow-up were compared with those who presented with symptoms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. However, other studies have not observed a survival benefit from detecting asymptomatic recurrences [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7
         </a>
         ]. One explanation for the lack of a survival benefit may be the high proportion of recurrences that are symptomatic. Other studies suggest that survival in patients with recurrent disease is determined primarily by the extent of prior disease, its therapy and time to recurrence, and the location of the recurrence [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. A randomized controlled trial of no meaningful follow-up versus surveillance after head and neck cancer treatment is impossible due to ethical considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Posttreatment surveillance may be most effective in patients who initially had limited disease, thereby retaining an option for future curative therapy, such as those with early T stage (T1 and T2) tumors who received a single modality with either surgery or radiation therapy [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,9
         </a>
         ]. In one report, 87 percent of those who survived two years or longer after salvage therapy had T1 or T2 index tumors, and only 30 percent had node-positive disease [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Research suggests that patients who recur after treatment for early stage disease have better outcomes, especially when they are surgically salvageable and undergo adjuvant radiation or chemoradiotherapy [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite high compliance with recommended surveillance, survival remains poor for patients who were previously treated for advanced stage disease or who initially presented with regional disease [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Decreasing morbidity by treating recurrent tumors and, thereby, providing palliation of symptoms is also an important goal and can often be accomplished by single- or multimodality therapy [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].

         Although early detection of recurrences or second primary malignancies may not significantly improve survival, posttreatment surveillance also offers an opportunity to manage therapy-related complications (xerostomia, dental disease, hypothyroidism, osteoradionecrosis) and assess functional voice and swallowing rehabilitation, nutritional issues, ongoing alcohol and tobacco use, depression, and comorbid conditions. Furthermore, regular follow-up may provide important emotional and psychological support for patients and their families. (See

         Our general approach is to see and examine patients every one to three months in the first year after treatment. In the second year, this is extended to every two to four months, in years 3 to 5, every four to six months, and after five years, every 12 months. Some practitioners stop seeing their patients at this time; however, we believe in lifelong surveillance.
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, the intensity of follow-up is greatest in the first two to four years since approximately 80 to 90 percent of all recurrences after curative-intent treatment occur within this timeframe [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,5
         </a>
         ]. Although proven benefit from more prolonged follow-up is lacking, surveillance beyond five years is generally recommended because late recurrences are occasionally observed and because the risk of a second primary malignancy remains elevated for at least 10 years after treatment of the index tumor [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>

         Patients should be educated about possible signs and symptoms of tumor recurrence, including hoarseness, pain, dysphagia, bleeding, enlarged lymph nodes and other masses, cranial nerve deficits, weight loss, and difficulty breathing. Additional points that may be elicited in the interim history include otalgia (ear pain), hemoptysis, symptoms of aspiration, facial numbness, or symptoms due to cranial nerve involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recent illnesses (eg, pneumonia) or changes in overall health (eg, weight loss, chronic fatigue) may heighten suspicion of recurrent disease. In addition, fatigue, persistent lymphedema, or cold intolerance may suggest hypothyroidism.

         Tobacco smoking, when continued during and after therapy, decreases local control and survival, and increases the risk of second primary malignancy, in addition to its role as a major risk factor for head and neck cancer [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18

         The follow-up physical examination should be methodical and comprehensive. Signs of tissue asymmetry should be specifically sought and any findings carefully evaluated. Examination of the ears should note serous or acute otitis media, which can indicate eustachian tube dysfunction by an obstructing nasopharyngeal mass. The anterior nasal cavity can be evaluated with a nasal speculum, but complete evaluation of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx requires rigid or fiberoptic endoscopy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Inspection of the mouth should include careful visual examination and palpation of the mucous membranes, floor of the mouth, the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, palate, tonsillar fossae, buccal and gingival mucosa, and posterior pharyngeal wall. The dentition should be examined for signs of loose teeth, exposed bone, or osteoradionecrosis. Denture fit and any changes could also signify a malignant process. Additionally, tongue mobility and presence of trismus should be recorded. The structures within the oral cavity and oropharynx should be palpated, including the base of tongue and vallecula.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy is indicated for most patients to evaluate the primary tumor site and search for second primary cancers. This minor procedure is really an extension of the head and neck exam and should be performed by a clinician who is skilled in the conduct of a proper head and neck examination. This is a rapidly performed office procedure, with or without local anesthesia, that causes only minor discomfort. This allows for a much more thorough examination of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and subglottis than is possible with an indirect mirror examination. Aside from mucosal irregularities, other abnormalities that should be specifically searched for are impaired vocal cord mobility, pooling of secretions, asymmetries, and bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Advances in optical technology, such as high definition images and narrow band imaging, may also help to detect early or subtle precancerous lesions [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Some flexible endoscopes have working channels that will allow for biopsies to be taken in appropriate candidates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Transnasal esophagoscopy can be carried out in patients with new symptoms such as dysphagia to evaluate the esophagus for carcinomas, strictures, and gastroesophageal reflux [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Second primary malignancies of the esophagus are significantly increased in patients with primary carcinogen-related squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, and these may be either synchronous or metachronous. (See

         Surveillance imaging for recurrence

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The role of imaging to assess the response to treatment is well established. By contrast, the role of surveillance imaging for recurrence is controversial. Surveillance with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET) has not been rigorously studied in randomized studies and is, therefore, not routinely recommended. However, some experts advocate surveillance imaging for patients felt to be at high risk of recurrence during the first several years. One retrospective analysis reported that PET scans at regular intervals beginning three to four months after treatment were highly sensitive for detecting locoregional or distant recurrences [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, another observational study suggested that posttreatment PET/CT appears to predict outcome regardless of p16 status [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Since the median time to radiologic recurrence was six months, some of these would be discovered with routine posttreatment imaging, and half would have been found with an additional scan.
        </p>
        <p>
         While patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) related oropharyngeal cancer may have late or unusual sites of distant metastases, the rate remains low, and the value of detecting asymptomatic recurrences is unclear; thus, routine chest CT or PET is not recommended. (See

         Following definitive treatment all patients should receive imaging to evaluate response and/or define a new baseline. The timing and choice of imaging modality (CT, MRI, or PET/CT) depends on the type of therapy received.

         The role of surveillance imaging in head and neck cancer is controversial and practice patterns vary. There are no prospective, randomized trials which support the role of surveillance. Decisions about obtaining surveillance imaging should be made based on the risk of recurrence, options for treatment if a recurrence is found, and patient specific factors. CT, MRI, PET/CT, and ultrasonography have been used in posttreatment surveillance for locoregional recurrence [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29-31
         </a>
         ]. Each has its own merits, and the choice of imaging modality should be based on prior imaging, available radiologic expertise, and cost.
        </p>
        <p>
         PET/CT may be the preferred modality for surveillance given its high sensitivity which may lead to earlier detection of relapse, which might improve overall survival (OS). In a case control study that compared surveillance with PET/CT versus CT alone (each at 12, 24, and 36 months), those undergoing PET/CT had superior OS at 3 years (73 versus 64 percent) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. In a subgroup analysis this benefit was limited to patients with stage 3 and 4 disease (69 versus 55 percent). While there was a numerically higher OS with PET/CT in patients with stage 1 or 2 disease this did not reach statistical significance (85 versus 79 percent). This study had several limitations including lack of randomization, so further data are needed to confirm an OS benefit with PET/CT surveillance. Even though of interest, the reported findings are derived from a single institution retrospective data with all the limitations that this entails and therefore need further confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
         When planning the posttreatment surveillance strategy, care should be taken to limit the number of CT or PET scans, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies [

         Routine imaging with chest radiographs has never been demonstrated to be associated with a survival benefit. However, randomized trials have demonstrated that annual low-dose helical CT improves the detection of lung cancer and results in a significant survival advantage compared with annual chest radiographs in individuals who are at high risk of developing lung cancer. Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network classify patients who have had head and neck cancer and have a history of 20 pack years of smoking area as being at high risk and recommend annual screening with CT [

          Posttreatment evaluation
         </strong>
         – For patients treated with definitive radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy, we obtain a PET/CT at or shortly after week 12 to evaluate response. For patients treated with curative-intent surgery, we perform a CT or MRI of the primary tumor site and neck at least once during the first six months after treatment to establish a baseline for future reference.

          Posttreatment surveillance
         </strong>
         – The role of surveillance imaging in head and neck cancer is controversial and practice patterns vary. Decisions about obtaining surveillance should be made based on the risk of recurrence, options for treatment if a recurrence is found, and patient specific factors. (See

          Screening for lung cancer
         </strong>
         – Annual low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) scanning of the lung is indicated for patients at high risk for the development of a second primary tumor in the lung. This includes those with a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and a history of 20 or more pack years of smoking. (See
