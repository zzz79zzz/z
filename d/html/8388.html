         The polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) is the primary defense against bacterial and fungal invasion. Defects of neutrophil number and function commonly present with recurrent and severe bacterial and fungal infections, often involving the skin and respiratory tract as well as deep tissue sites.

         This topic reviews the laboratory evaluation of neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction. The overall approach to the patient with neutropenia, including a discussion of indications for bone marrow evaluation and the individual neutrophil function defects, are discussed separately:

         Initial testing for neutropenia is done with the complete blood count and differential, along with a review of the peripheral blood smear. Recognition of neutropenia is straightforward (ie, absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1500/microL), although there are some age and racial differences in the normal values (eg, higher ANC during the first few days of life, lower ANC in some Black individuals and Yemenites). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8375.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of neutropenia in children and adolescents", section on 'Definitions and normal values'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The ANC is calculated as the product of the white blood cell (WBC) count and the fraction of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and band forms in the differential analysis (

         The peripheral blood smear may show additional helpful findings, including the presence of malignant cells, specific neutrophil inclusions or missing components, or other morphologic defects (eg, bilobed nuclei). (See

         Neutropenia can be caused by decreased production of granulocytes in the bone marrow, shift of circulating granulocytes to marginated or tissue pools, neutrophil destruction, or a combination of these causes. Information about the pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of these syndromes is discussed in separate topic reviews:

         Importantly, the cause of the neutropenia has implications for the ability of the patient to handle infections. Depending on the underlying cause, fever and neutropenia may either be a medical emergency with a risk of life-threatening sepsis, or the risks may be similar to the general population. (See

         Bone marrow evaluation, including an aspirate and a biopsy, often plays an important role in evaluating neutropenia and distinguishing between decreased neutrophil production and peripheral neutrophil destruction/sequestration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Specific findings that may be helpful include the bone marrow cellularity, presence of an arrest at a specific stage of neutrophil maturation (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8380.html" rel="external">
          "Regulation of myelopoiesis", section on 'Neutrophil production and maturation'
         </a>
         ), and/or abnormalities of myeloid cells (eg, nuclear findings, malignant populations of cells).
        </p>
        <p>
         An early myeloid arrest is associated with a higher risk of infection due to inability to deliver mature neutrophils to the tissues, whereas even severe neutropenia in the face of a late myeloid arrest is rarely associated with increased propensity for infection due to the neutropenia (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101294" href="/z/d/graphic/101294.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8375.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of neutropenia in children and adolescents", section on 'Propensity to infection and significance of neutropenia'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         While the bone marrow evaluation allows classification of neutropenia as due to decreased neutrophil production or peripheral neutrophil destruction/sequestration, it rarely provides a specific diagnosis. Thus, once a defect in neutrophil production is documented, a search for related disorders such as lupus, or genetic testing for specific neutrophil defects, is often the next step. In fact, due to the common availability of exome panels, we often go directly to genetic testing even before bone marrow aspiration as marrow morphology often does not provide a specific diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Genetic testing'
         </a>

         We do not feel that testing for anti-neutrophil antibodies is clinically useful, though a positive result may provide some reassurance regarding the mechanism. Details about this testing and its use in research are presented separately. Anti-neutrophil antibodies can be present in the absence of neutropenia, and neutropenia can be present in the absence of detectable antibodies, even if the setting suggests autoimmune disease. (See

         Testing for neutrophil function defects is appropriate in a patient whose clinical presentation is consistent with defective phagocytic function (eg, chronic bacterial or fungal infections) and who has a normal absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (

         Although a large number of neutrophil function assays have been described, the extreme rarity of primary disorders and lack of special expertise needed to properly interpret the results makes them inappropriate for routine clinical laboratories. Most of the functional assays are appropriate only in a research setting. The general aspects of a few selected tests that can be performed outside the realm of a neutrophil research laboratory will be described here.

         Neutrophil dysfunction disorders can be understood as defects in one or more steps in normal neutrophil processes, including adhesion to the vascular wall, chemotaxis into the tissues, phagocytosis of pathogens, and bacterial killing; these steps are illustrated in the figure (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100385" href="/z/d/graphic/100385.html" rel="external">
          figure 2

         ). These normal neutrophil functions are described in more detail in review articles and in a separate topic review [

         All of the genetic neutrophil dysfunction disorders that result from defects along this pathway are very rare disorders and, with the exception of those listed in this section and in the table (

Currently, an early, if not the first step in diagnosis of neutrophil dysfunction disorders is to obtain a focused exome panel.

          Chronic granulomatous disease
         </strong>
         – Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is due to defects in the neutrophil NADPH oxidase and related pathways that result in an inability of neutrophils to make superoxide. Superoxide production is the major mechanism of intracellular killing of bacteria (the final step in the figure (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100385" href="/z/d/graphic/100385.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         )). Neutrophils in patients with CGD have markedly impaired ability to kill bacteria. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3925.html" rel="external">
          "Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Pathogenesis'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Approximately 70 percent of patients with CGD are males who have X-linked disease; the remaining cases are autosomal recessive. Female carriers of X-linked disease have no increased risk of infection. Rarely, in cases of extreme lyonization (skewed X-inactivation), female carriers who have &lt;5 to 10 percent of neutrophils able to make superoxide may have clinical symptoms of mild CGD. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3925.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The diagnosis of CGD is established by showing absence of the ability to make superoxide in response to stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100391" href="/z/d/graphic/100391.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Superoxide production is indirectly assayed as an inability to reduce dihydrorhodamine (DHR) to its fluorescent form (which can be assayed using flow cytometry) or to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), which is assayed using the NBT slide test (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100539" href="/z/d/graphic/100539.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         Individuals with recessive CGD, particularly defects in p47phox component of the oxidase, and some very rare patients with X-linked disease may make a very small amount of superoxide that is detectible by DHR reduction. This small amount of superoxide production is generally not detectable by the NBT slide test. The patients who make a small amount of superoxide have fewer infections and improved survival [
         <a href="#rid2">

         </span>
         In female carriers of X-linked disease, approximately 50 percent of the neutrophils have no superoxide production, and 50 percent have completely normal superoxide production. Thus, there is usually a clear bimodal distribution of DHR fluorescence by flow cytometry and a bimodal distribution of NBT reduction on the NBT slide test (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100539" href="/z/d/graphic/100539.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Of note, the reaction with DHR depends on myeloperoxidase; thus, patients with concomitant complete myeloperoxidase deficiency can have a false positive DHR-based test (ie, no fluorescence detected) and a CGD-like phenotype. Some female patients with a high degree of lyonization may have low percentages of DHR-positive or NBT-positive cells.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Carriers of X-linked disease with less than 10 to 15 percent activity may have symptomatic infections and may require treatment for mild disease. Some patients, particularly the patients with defects in p47phox, may make a very small amount of superoxide and have a somewhat milder clinical course [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Genetic testing is recommended for the proband, to classify the defect and permit prenatal diagnosis if required. NBT or DHR on fetal blood samples has been performed but is very difficult and unreliable. Essentially, all of the patients have a detectable genetic defect.

          LAD-I
         </strong>
         – Leukocyte adhesion deficiency I (LAD-I) is caused by reduction or absence of the transmembrane protein CD18, the common chain of the beta 2 integrin family, which in turn reduces the amount of the linked alpha subunit receptors CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c used for neutrophil adhesion to the vessel wall (the second step in the figure (

         )). These integrins mediate firm adhesion at sites of endothelium where intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) are upregulated on vascular endothelium due to local infection and cytokines. Subsequently, transmigration and chemotaxis are triggered. This receptor also mediates complement-mediated phagocytosis. Motility is affected because the cells cannot grip the endothelial substrate. Patients with LAD-I have high white blood cell (WBC) counts and severe infections from birth, due to motility and phagocytosis defects. The diagnosis is established by flow cytometry with fluorescently labeled antibodies against CD11b (

         Patients with neutrophil dysfunction present with chronic recurrent bacterial infections. Severe chemotactic defects in particular have been associated with chronic skin and mucosal infections. Patients with severe chemotactic defects may also present with omphalitis (infection/inflammation of the umbilical cord stump) at birth. These are significant lesions and are characterized by the absence of exudate in the setting of significant leukocytosis [

         Unlike patients with severe neutropenia, patients with neutrophil dysfunction rarely present with overt sepsis but rather with more indolent infections in the lymph nodes, lung, or liver.

Thus, unless there is a family history suggestive of a neutrophil dysfunction syndrome (eg, known familial syndrome, history of frequent skin and soft tissue infections without evidence of cellular immunodeficiency), it is appropriate to eliminate other disorders first, including those of immunoglobulins, complement, or T cells, before a primary neutrophil dysfunction syndrome is considered. Details of the diagnostic evaluation for humoral and T cell disorders are presented separately. (See

         Individuals who remain without a diagnosis despite this testing may require referral to a clinician with more specialized expertise in immunodeficiency or hematologic disorders. Ultimately, definitive diagnosis may require specialized flow cytometric or molecular methods available in reference laboratories or specialized centers [

         A number of assays have been developed to assess neutrophil adhesion, transmigration, shape change, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, bactericidal killing, and respiratory burst. These have been employed in clinical settings. However, these assays measure cellular behavior; they have tremendous inherent variability and require special laboratory expertise and constant practice to make them work, along with careful determination of normal age-related controls. Thus, while these assays have been useful in the research laboratory setting to clarify the cellular physiology of various specific disease states, they have essentially no place in routine clinical practice, with the exception of measurement of the respiratory burst for the diagnosis of CGD.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to the challenges of performing these biological assays, another issue is the effect of clinical factors other than primary neutrophil dysfunction on the results. As examples, neutrophil functions are significantly affected by general inflammation, methods of blood drawing, age of the specimen, and myriad other issues, making the interpretation very difficult. Thus, with the exception of genetic disorders that impair neutrophil production, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to tell if the measured change in neutrophil function is the cause of infection or if the infection and attendant inflammation is causing the decrease in neutrophil function.

         Genetic testing is appropriate for patients with a suspected genetic cause of neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction based on findings from the patient and family history, physical examination, complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, bone marrow, and/or neutrophil function assay. Specific gene defects associated with each of the disorders are presented in the table (

         </a>
         ). The choice of gene test, and decision of whether to test for all genetic defects or to test a panel of genes, is individualized depending on specific clinical factors, available testing, and input from a clinician with expertise in immunodeficiency and hematologic disorders.

         – Isolated neutropenia can be caused by an acquired condition (usually immune destruction) or an inherited condition. (See

         Individuals with the Duffy null [Fy(a-b-)] red blood cell phenotype have isolated mild neutropenia that is not associated with defective immunity; the condition was formerly called benign ethnic neutropenia. (See
