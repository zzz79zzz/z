Patient counseling before pregnancy should include a discussion about the risks of adenoma growth during pregnancy and the potential effects of exposure to dopamine agonists on the fetus (which is very low).</p><p>The management of women with lactotroph adenomas before and during pregnancy will be reviewed here.

The risk that an increase in lactotroph adenoma size will be clinically important depends upon the size of the adenoma before pregnancy. Thus, all patients with a lactotroph adenoma should be treated prior to pursuing pregnancy to lower serum prolactin concentrations and decrease adenoma size (macroadenomas) (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134593" href="/d/graphic/134593.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pituitary growth during normal pregnancy</strong> – The theoretical basis for adenoma growth during pregnancy is lactotroph hyperplasia in response to rising levels of serum estradiol [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In a study of 32 pregnant women and 20 nonpregnant women, pituitary volume (as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) was more than double the size in the pregnant women by the third trimester compared with the nonpregnant women (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73519" href="/d/graphic/73519.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Similarly, in women with lactotroph adenomas who become pregnant, the higher levels of estradiol of pregnancy may increase the size of the lactotroph adenoma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Microadenoma</strong> – For a microadenoma (&lt;10 mm in diameter), the risk of growth is very low [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>]. A review of 14 studies reporting a total of 764 patients with lactotroph microadenomas showed that only 2.4 percent exhibited a symptomatic increase in the size of the adenoma during pregnancy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Macroadenoma</strong> – The risk of growth of a lactotroph macroadenoma (≥10 mm) during pregnancy is substantially higher. In the same review as above [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], while only 4.8 percent of 148 women who had macroadenomas that had been treated by prior surgery or radiation developed clinically significant enlargement during pregnancy, 22.9 percent of 214 women without such treatment did. Enlargement not accompanied by symptoms or visual field deficit was not counted.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3915728273"><span class="h2">Fetal risk of dopamine agonist exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although dopamine agonists are typically discontinued when pregnancy is confirmed, pregnancy has usually progressed at least two weeks before confirmation occurs, so the fetus is exposed to the dopamine agonist during that time. Available evidence does not suggest risk to the fetus from this exposure, and a woman considering pregnancy should be so informed (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134593" href="/d/graphic/134593.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Data from over 6000 pregnancies suggest that the administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9164" href="/d/drug information/9164.html" rel="external">bromocriptine</a> during the first month of pregnancy does not harm the fetus [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In this series, the incidence of spontaneous abortions (9.9 percent), multiple births (1.7 percent), and malformations (1.8 percent) was no higher than in the general population. In addition, in a study of children followed for up to nine years after exposure to bromocriptine in utero, no harmful effects were noted [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Rarely, dopamine agonist treatment is resumed during pregnancy if adenoma size increases so much as to impair vision. Continuous use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9164" href="/d/drug information/9164.html" rel="external">bromocriptine</a> during pregnancy has been reported in approximately 100 women. Although the rate of congenital malformations did not appear to be higher than nonexposed pregnancies, there was one case of undescended testis and one of talipes deformity [<a href="#rid6">6,8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Treatment of enlarging adenoma'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the number of pregnancies in women taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8600" href="/d/drug information/8600.html" rel="external">cabergoline</a> at the time of conception is much smaller (968), the evidence suggests that this drug is safe as well. In one review of over 700 cases, the incidence of spontaneous abortions (7.5 percent), multiple births (2.4 percent), and malformations (2.4 percent) was no higher than in the general population [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Patients with Parkinson disease treated with high doses of cabergoline (eg, &gt;20 mg per week) have an increased risk of valvular heart disease, but this risk has not been demonstrated using the lower doses used for lactotroph adenomas [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

Serum prolactin concentrations between 50 to 100 ng/mL (normal &lt;15 to 20 ng/mL), typically cause either amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, while levels greater than 100 ng/mL result in deficient estradiol and progesterone secretion and amenorrhea (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134593" href="/d/graphic/134593.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6638.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia", section on 'Menstrual cycle dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>For women with lactotroph microadenomas, treatment with a dopamine agonist usually normalizes prolactin and thereby removes the inhibition of gonadotropin secretion and restores normal ovulation and fertility. As noted, available evidence does not suggest risk to the fetus from dopamine agonist use for ovulation induction.

A marked reduction in the serum prolactin concentration often occurs within two to three weeks (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72539" href="/d/graphic/72539.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Restoration of ovulation occurs in over 90 percent of women with hyperprolactinemia and anovulation (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134593" href="/d/graphic/134593.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6630.html" rel="external">"Management of hyperprolactinemia", section on 'Overview of dopamine agonists'</a>.)</p><p>The occurrence of regular menstrual cycles during treatment indicates that the woman is probably ovulating. Following correction of hyperprolactinemia, successful pregnancy can be achieved in over 85 percent of patients [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Neither <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8600" href="/d/drug information/8600.html" rel="external">cabergoline</a> nor <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9164" href="/d/drug information/9164.html" rel="external">bromocriptine</a> has been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, congenital malformations, or pregnancy complications such as preterm deliveries.</p><p>We suggest stopping the dopamine agonist in women with a microadenoma once pregnancy has been confirmed. Because of the limited number of patients who have been treated throughout pregnancy, the safety of continued usage has not been established.</p><p>The choice of dopamine agonist and dosing are described below.

If unsuccessful, gonadotropin therapy may be needed, although this therapy is associated with high serum estradiol concentrations during treatment and a significant risk of multiple gestations (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134593" href="/d/graphic/134593.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). If pregnancy is not achieved using a dopamine agonist and clomiphene, we recommend referral to a specialist in reproductive endocrinology and infertility.

(See <a class="local">'Maternal risk of adenoma growth'</a> above.)</p><p>We recommend a dopamine agonist as the initial treatment of a lactotroph adenoma, whether or not the adenoma is elevating the optic chiasm. Once the adenoma size has decreased dramatically and is well within the confines of the sella and ovulation has been restored, pregnancy can be attempted.

When a dopamine agonist is needed to lower the serum prolactin concentration to permit ovulation, cabergoline has the advantage that it is more likely to be tolerated and more likely to be effective in lowering the prolactin, although bromocriptine has the advantage of the somewhat greater certainty that it does not cause congenital anomalies.

Apoplexy can occur in patients with pituitary micro- or macroadenomas, including women with lactotroph macroadenomas during any trimester of pregnancy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In its most dramatic presentation, apoplexy causes the sudden onset of excruciating headache, diplopia due to pressure on the oculomotor nerves, and hypopituitarism. All pituitary hormonal deficiencies can occur, but the sudden onset of corticotropin (ACTH) and therefore cortisol deficiency is the most serious because it can cause life-threatening hypotension. It should be treated with high-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8535" href="/d/drug information/8535.html" rel="external">hydrocortisone</a>.

The main concern for the mother is adenoma growth, while the main concern for the fetus has been exposure to a dopamine agonist. Fortunately, available evidence suggests that both <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9164" href="/d/drug information/9164.html" rel="external">bromocriptine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8600" href="/d/drug information/8600.html" rel="external">cabergoline</a> are safe.

(See <a class="local">'Restoration of ovulation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8600" href="/d/drug information/8600.html" rel="external">cabergoline</a> rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9164" href="/d/drug information/9164.html" rel="external">bromocriptine</a> as initial therapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Cabergoline is more likely to be tolerated and to be effective in lowering the prolactin. However, bromocriptine has the advantage of the greater certainty that it does not cause congenital anomalies.
