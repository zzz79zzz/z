IPV can affect anyone, but women are more often victims than men. Lifetime estimates for IPV involving people identifying as women in the United States range from 22 to 39 percent [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. In countries around the world, 10 to 69 percent of women report physical assault by an intimate partner at some time in their life [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>The term "intimate partner violence" describes actual or threatened psychological, physical, or sexual harm by a current or former partner or spouse. IPV can occur among people with any gender identity or sexual orientation and does not require sexual intimacy.</p><p>All too frequently, IPV is undiagnosed since patients often conceal that they are in abusive relationships or situations due to perceived stigma as well as privacy and safety concerns. The clues pointing to abuse may be subtle or absent. Many groups advocate screening all patients, or all female patients, for IPV.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical presentation and diagnosis of IPV and issues related to population screening with recommendations of various groups. The epidemiology and health consequences of IPV and management of people in whom IPV is identified are discussed separately. Elder mistreatment is also addressed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15306.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Intervention and patient management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2789.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Epidemiology and health consequences"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3007.html" rel="external">"Elder abuse, self-neglect, and related phenomena"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8920150"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) are found among people of all ages, socioeconomic classes, ethnicities, gender identities, and sexual orientations. While certain risk factors have been identified (younger age, female, lower socioeconomic status, family or personal history of violence), IPV should be considered in all people who present with a history or findings consistent with undisclosed violence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2789.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Epidemiology and health consequences"</a>.)</p><p>Certain aspects of the history or observations made during the clinical encounter should heighten the clinician's suspicion for IPV. These include [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An inconsistent explanation of injuries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delay in seeking treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequent emergency department or urgent visits. Typically, abusers do not want their victims to form an ongoing allegiance with one clinician. They may feel the victim will be less likely to find an ally in an emergency department where care may be more fragmented.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Missed appointments. The patient may not keep appointments because the abuser will not allow medical attention/travel outside of the home. In one study, 17 percent of survivors of IPV felt that their partner interfered with their access to practitioner visits, compared with 2 percent of those not living with abuse [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In pregnancy, late initiation of prenatal care.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Repeated abortions. Unplanned pregnancy may result from sexual assault and/or not being allowed to use birth control (reproductive coercion) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medication nonadherence. Victims may not take medicines because the batterer has taken them away or not allowed the partner to fill prescriptions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inappropriate affect. Victims may appear jumpy, fearful, or cry readily. They may avoid eye contact and seem evasive or hostile. A flat affect or dissociated appearance may be present and could suggest posttraumatic stress disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overly attentive or verbally abusive partner. The clinician should be suspicious if the partner is overly solicitous or answers questions for the patient. If the partner refuses to leave the examination room, the clinician should find a way to get the partner to leave before questioning the patient. Partner reluctance to leave the patient alone is an important sign.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Apparent social isolation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reluctance to undress or have a genital, rectal, or oral examination, or difficulty with these or other examinations.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8920157"><span class="h2">Common presenting concerns</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IPV is associated with a perception of overall poor health. This was shown in a multi-country report, sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO), based on surveys of women aged 15 to 49 years [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Although confounding issues may account for some of the observed associations, violence is associated with difficulty in ambulation, difficulty with daily activities, memory loss, dizziness, emotional distress, and pelvic concerns.</p><p>Gynecologic conditions that are seen more frequently in abuse-exposed persons include premenstrual syndrome, sexually transmitted infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, unintended pregnancy (via reproductive coercion) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], and chronic pelvic pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5490.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in nonpregnant adult females: Causes"</a>.)</p><p>Somatic concerns associated with IPV include chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, headaches, and musculoskeletal pain.</p><p>Psychological conditions associated with IPV include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Depression, suicidality (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1721.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anxiety and panic disorder (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/496.html" rel="external">"Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14628.html" rel="external">"Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Eating disorder (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2093.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Substance use (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7807.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Clinical assessment"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Posttraumatic stress disorder (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110594.html" rel="external">"Health care for female trauma survivors (with posttraumatic stress disorder or similarly severe symptoms)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/500.html" rel="external">"Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dissociative disorders (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14699.html" rel="external">"Dissociative aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p>Health consequences associated with IPV are discussed in detail separately.

Any injury without a good explanation, particularly involving the head and neck, teeth, or genital area, should raise concern. Typically, survivors of domestic violence present with injuries on the central part of the body such as the breasts, abdomen, and genitals. Wounds on the head and neck, particularly neck bruising, may be caused by attempted strangulation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86280" href="/z/d/graphic/86280.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Wounds on the forearms often occur when a person is in a defensive position. Bruises of different ages may be present due to repeated abuse.</p><p>There may be evidence of sexual assault, including sexually transmitted infections (including HIV infection) or unintended pregnancy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8920180"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The assessment for intimate partner violence (IPV) in patients who present with concerns or findings suggestive of underlying abuse is considered a diagnostic evaluation. This is to be distinguished from a screening evaluation, which involves questioning all persons who are seen for care, regardless of whether they present with a history or examination that raises concerns about possible abuse.</p><p>Routinely asking about IPV significantly increases its detection in certain clinical situations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53373" href="/z/d/graphic/53373.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In one study, for example, 5.6 percent of 359 female trauma survivors were identified as having injuries due to IPV before institution of a screening protocol in the emergency department, compared with 30 percent of 412 patients following use of the protocol [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8920187"><span class="h2">General principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The setting in which questioning occurs is important. The clinician must assure that the patient feels safe and comfortable. Clinicians should not display hesitancy, judgment, or discomfort, and they should avoid using the phrases "domestic violence" or "victim" but rather should ask about being hurt or experiencing violence or fear.</p><p>Patients are more likely to disclose their experience of violence when [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Practitioners are ready to listen and use open-ended questioning.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Questioning is done in privacy. Others present should be asked to leave for the interview and examination. Resistance to leaving may be important diagnostic information about perpetration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Practitioners assure confidentiality, unless someone is in grave danger, when reporting may be necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15306.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Intervention and patient management", section on 'Mandatory reporting'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One or only a few questions are posed.</p><p></p><p>The relational aspect of the questioning (eg, concern, eye contact), rather than the particular words used, may be the most important factor in assisting patients with disclosure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8920194"><span class="h2">Patient expectations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A meta-analysis of qualitative studies identified the following expectations of women in regard to assessment for IPV [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Health care professionals who are nonjudgmental and compassionate</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assurance of confidentiality</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recognition of the complexities of violence and the difficulty of a quick resolution</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoidance of "medicalizing" the issue</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Discussion that is not rushed or hurried</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confirmation that the violence is undeserved</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Supportive listening and feedback to empower the patient</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ability to progress at their own pace </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No pressure to disclose, leave the relationship, or press charges </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Shared decision-making and respect for the patient's decisions</p><p></p><p>Another study found that women prefer a patient-centered interview format in which the clinician follows up on the patient's own cues, rather than a structured interview following tool-driven checklists [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. One qualitative study found that women did not want to be counseled in a directive way to leave their relationship, go to a shelter, or be told they would be reported to the police [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. They wished to be acknowledged and supported in their autonomy, the complexity of their life situations, and evaluated for where they were in stages of change.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3244688"><span class="h2">Caveats</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is essential to avoid frightening, intimidating, or shaming a patient. Patients who have experienced IPV are likely to be extremely vulnerable and may misinterpret the practitioner's best intentions. The Massachusetts Medical Society has proposed the following caveats [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid using terms like "victim," "abused," or "battered." Instead, mirror the patient's own word choices or use words like "hurt," "frightened," or "treated badly."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do not inquire about abuse in the presence of the partner, friends, or family members.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do not disclose or discuss your concerns with the patient's partner.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do not ask the patient what they did to bring on the abuse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do not ask why the patient has not left the partner, or why they may have returned to the batterer.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1620205"><span class="h2">Patient denial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>People experiencing abuse may deny the abuse for several reasons. They may not be emotionally ready to admit the reality of the situation; they may blame themselves, or feel like a failure if they admit to being abused. They may fear rejection by the clinician, be ashamed, believe that the abuse will not happen again, fear reprisal by the abuser, believe that they have no alternatives, or lack knowledge of resources that could help. There may be language or cultural barriers between clinicians and patients that interfere with communication, and discomfort with using an interpreter to discuss sensitive issues.</p><p>Patients for whom IPV is suspected but not acknowledged should be asked again at subsequent visits. There are some data to suggest that patients are more likely to disclose information after they have been asked about violence repeatedly in the health care setting, thereby normalizing inquiry [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8920202"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many tools have been proposed to detect or screen for intimate partner violence (IPV) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. There is no “gold standard” available, analogous to a biopsy, to determine the true sensitivity or specificity of these tools. The 39-item Conflict Tactics Scale-Revised (CTS-2) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>] is the most widely used reference standard for IPV in the social science and medical literature for evaluating IPV screening tools [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. However, lengthy tools, ideal for nuanced research, are impractical in a busy clinic setting.</p><p>Several short survey tools are available for practicing clinicians (see <a class="local">'Short surveys for clinicians'</a> below). Framing the inquiry is important as a lead-in to the questions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4532982"><span class="h2">Framing the inquiry</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before inquiring about violence exposure, it can be helpful to "normalize" the inquiry, setting the tone and framing the questions about emotional and/or physical/sexual violence as a routine part of everyday practice (eg, this is in our purview of providing a safe environment and being concerned about health).</p><p>Sample framing statements include [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"Violence can be a problem in many people's lives, so I now ask every patient about trauma or abuse they may have experienced in a relationship."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"Many patients I see are coping with an abusive relationship, so I've started asking about intimate partner violence routinely."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"When people have the symptom you are experiencing, and the approaches you’ve tried don’t make it better, I wonder if they could have been hurt at some point in their life.

In addition, we suggest inquiring about IPV on visits to the emergency department and on hospital admissions.</p><p>IPV is widely prevalent and is often longstanding prior to diagnosis. Identifying patients who are exposed to violence provides clinicians with insight in order to appropriately address medical problems that may be sequelae of violence and to intervene to prevent bodily harm. Educating patients about violence by making it a part of the medical conversation may make it more likely for reticent patients to disclose at a subsequent visit. It also sends a message about prevention to victims and perpetrators by heightening awareness that practitioners feel this behavior is wrong and that they are willing and able to assist.</p><p>Any of the short questions discussed above would be appropriate for screening.

Interventions for acknowledged or suspected IPV are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15306.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Intervention and patient management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4534239"><span class="h3">Benefits and harms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies have found that routine screening of asymptomatic patients increases the detection of IPV [<a href="#rid36">36-39</a>]. A systematic review of eight randomized trials evaluating the effect of screening for IPV in health care settings found that, compared with usual care, screening increases the identification of women experiencing IPV (odds ratio [OR] 2.95, 95% CI 1.8-4.9), particularly for pregnant women (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.8-11.3) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p>However, most studies have not shown that screening improved health outcomes for the abused or the perpetrator [<a href="#rid36">36,40-43</a>]. Evidence for the impact of screening for IPV on patient outcomes is limited by methodologic and ethical challenges. These include the inability to withhold intervention from control group participants identified with IPV, reliance on self-reported measures, lack of a reference standard, a high loss to follow-up among this patient population, and inability to conduct a double-blind trial. The results of a meta-analysis of 11 randomized or quasi-randomized studies, including more than 13,000 patients, suggest that screening increases identification of IPV [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. However, the included studies did not show that screening leads to long-term benefits except possibly in antenatal populations. A previously reported systematic review by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found similar results but concluded that screening should be recommended because the limitations of the studies did not rule out a potential benefit [<a href="#rid2">2,44,45</a>].</p><p>No adverse effects of screening and intervention for IPV were identified in two of three trials that included adverse effects as on outcome event [<a href="#rid40">40,46</a>]. One trial involving home visitation for at-risk new mothers suggested an increase in verbal abuse for women randomly assigned to the intervention, although the difference was not statistically significant compared with women in the control group [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Up to 20 percent of women patients in surveys of general practices in London and Ireland objected to screening for domestic violence [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Discomfort with screening was greatest among women who experienced physical or sexual violence related to IPV [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Concerns raised by survey respondents included loss of privacy, worries about provoking abuse with disclosure, emotional distress, fear of judgment by the practitioner, and disappointment in the practitioner's response. This highlights the fear and sensitivity of survivors of abuse and the need for assuring safety and support with screening.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H623583255"><span class="h3">Barriers to implementation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both practitioners and patients have expressed discomfort with screening for IPV. Though many national groups have recommended routine screening, rates of screening in primary care settings have been low (less than 13 percent in one internal medicine clinic) [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review evaluating the most common provider barriers to screening for IPV, five categories were identified: personal barriers, resource barriers, perceptions and attitudes, fears, and patient-related barriers [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. The most commonly cited provider concerns were personal discomfort, lack of knowledge, and time constraints. Other issues underlying clinician reluctance to integrate routine screening into practice include uncertainty regarding how to offer assistance if IPV is identified as well as privacy, legal, and personal safety concerns. In a study evaluating providers by subsets, male clinicians and those in private practice expressed more discomfort with IPV screening, and gynecologists, hospital-based providers, and clinicians practicing for 5 to 10 years expressed more comfort with screening [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p>A systems model approach can improve screening uptake and patient referral for services [<a href="#rid52">52-54</a>]. This may involve staff training (including medical and mental health clinicians, social workers, and administrative staff), providing materials for distribution to patients, implementing computer-based or other self-administered screening tools, alerts on patient charts reminding providers to inquire about IPV or follow-up when IPV is identified, and identifying and coordinating with community referral resources and advocates.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2207911876"><span class="h2">Pregnancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Screening for IPV is a recommended part of prenatal care. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises that all women be screened for IPV at periodic intervals, including during obstetric care (at the first prenatal visit, at least once per trimester, and at the postpartum checkup) [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Clinicians should offer ongoing support and review available prevention and referral options. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/446.html" rel="external">"Prenatal care: Initial assessment", section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>Two systematic reviews have concluded that screening for IPV may improve health outcomes in pregnancy [<a href="#rid2">2,36</a>].

One survey suggested that problem drinking in perpetrators was associated with an eightfold increase in IPV [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. Many, but not all of these studies have been done in male college students, raising some question of generalizability.

While not all patients experiencing IPV exhibit symptoms or signs, certain features should heighten suspicion of IPV. These include inconsistent explanation of injuries, delay in seeking treatment or missed appointments, frequent emergency department visits, late prenatal care, inappropriate affect, overly attentive partners, and reluctance to be examined. IPV is associated with a perception of overall poor health with somatic and psychologic impact. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessment of IPV</strong> – Routinely asking about IPV significantly increases its detection in certain clinical situations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53373" href="/z/d/graphic/53373.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In inquiring about IPV, practitioners should be cognizant of patient's expectations for nonjudgmental, compassionate listening that allows the patient to progress at their own pace, with shared decision-making, respect for the patient's decisions, and no pressure to disclose, leave the relationship, or press charges. Terms like "victim," "domestic violence," "abused," or "battered" should be avoided; choose "trauma," "hurt," or "injured" instead. (See <a class="local">'Assessment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Caveats'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>People experiencing trauma may deny the abuse for multiple reasons. Patients for whom IPV is suspected but not acknowledged should be asked again at subsequent visits. (See <a class="local">'Patient denial'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Framing the inquiry</strong> – Before asking a patient about abuse, it can be helpful to "normalize" the inquiry and frame the questioning as a routine part of everyday practice. Possible statements include "Violence can be a problem in many people's lives, so I now ask every patient about trauma they may have experienced in a relationship" or "Many patients I see are coping with difficulties/danger in a relationship, so I've started asking about intimate partner violence routinely." (See <a class="local">'Framing the inquiry'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Screening tools</strong> – Several short tools have been developed for use in screening for IPV. Single questions may be sufficient for screening. Self-administered questionnaires, including computer-based assessment tools, may be more effective that face-to-face questioning, though their widespread use is limited by patient literacy. (See <a class="local">'Short surveys for clinicians'</a> above and <a class="local">'Computer-based screening'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Who should be screened</strong> – We suggest routine IPV screening for all patients on initial primary care and obstetrician-gynecologist visits, in the emergency department, and on hospital admission given the high prevalence of IPV and the lack of harm and potential benefits of screening (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Multiple professional organizations endorse screening for IPV but differ in suggested target populations and do not address screening frequency. In addition, all people who present with an injury or conditions that have been associated with IPV should be assessed. (See <a class="local">'Screening recommendations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Methodologic problems intrinsic to studies of IPV make it difficult to design a randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of screening on patient outcomes. Screening appears to increase the identification of IPV and does not appear to cause harm.
