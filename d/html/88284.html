         Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary valve atresia and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (TOF/PA/MAPCAs) is the most extreme variant of TOF, in which complete atresia of the pulmonary valve replaces pulmonary stenosis.

         TOF/PA is a rare form congenital heart disease (CHD), with an estimated incidence of 0.7 per 10,000 live births [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. While TOF is the most common cyanotic CHD lesion, TOF/PA/MAPCAs is the most extreme form of TOF and accounts for a small subset of cases (ie, 20 percent of TOF cases have TOF/PA, and approximately 30 to 65 percent of these have MAPCAs) [
         <a href="#rid1">

         TOF/PA is a complex lesion that includes characteristic features of TOF (anterior malaligned ventricular septal defect [VSD] and overriding aorta) with PA. PA may be limited to the valve itself (membranous PA) or involve the subpulmonary infundibulum (muscular PA) and results in no antegrade flow from the right ventricle (RV) to the pulmonary artery. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87462.html" rel="external">
          "Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS)", section on 'Anatomy'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The lack of antegrade pulmonary blood flow in utero leads to a range of morphologic findings in the pulmonary artery vasculature. If the ductus arteriosus is present, confluent true pulmonary arteries of variable size may develop. Without flow through the ductus arteriosus or one or more MAPCAs, fetal vessels derived from the splanchnic vascular plexus may persist after birth [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. These vessels connect the systemic and pulmonary arterial vasculature, thereby supplying pulmonary blood flow. MAPCAs are tortuous vessels that arise directly from the aorta or its branches. MAPCAs vary in number and origin; follow circuitous routes to reach central, lobar, and segmental pulmonary arteries; and have variable areas and locations of stenosis. Their arborization pattern is unpredictable and often incomplete, leaving some lung segments with either excessive or insufficient flow, and they can become narrow over time [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. As a result, a given segment of the lung may be supplied solely from the true pulmonary arteries, solely from the MAPCAs, or both. The morphology of the pulmonary vasculature and MAPCAs plays a critical role in determining management decisions. (See

         A right-sided aortic arch and left-sided lesions, such as dilation of the ascending aorta and aortic valve abnormalities, are more common in patients with TOF/PA/MAPCAs than in those with other TOF variants [

         Children with unrepaired TOF/PA/MAPCAs are cyanotic due to the right-to-left intracardiac shunt. The degree of cyanosis depends on the amount of pulmonary blood flow supplied by the MAPCAs and, in some cases, the ductus arteriosus. Some patients may have torrential pulmonary blood flow with high oxygen saturations and, if left unrepaired for a prolonged period of time, are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension due to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. In these patients, there is a large volume load to the left ventricle (LV), which may lead to the development of heart failure. In contrast, other patients may have very little pulmonary blood flow and present with cyanosis, which can progress over time if the MAPCAs become narrower. (See

         Advances in ultrasound technology have enabled routine antenatal screening around 18 to 22 weeks gestation to establish a fetal diagnosis of TOF/PA/MAPCAs. In one case series of 6587 scanned fetuses by a tertiary service for fetal cardiology between 1997 and 2006, 11 cases of TOF/PA/MAPCAs were identified by detecting systemic-to-pulmonary arterial connections other than a patent ductus arteriosus for pulmonary blood flow. Of the latter six pregnancies in this series, four were electively terminated [

         Although most patients with TOF/PA/MAPCAs present as neonates, the range of symptoms and clinical manifestations vary and are dependent on the ratio of pulmonary blood flow to systemic blood flow (Qp to Qs ratio). The clinical presentation and management decisions are based on the character of the MAPCAs and whether or not pulmonary blood flow is dependent on the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus.

         If the MAPCAs are large with relatively few areas of stenosis, blood flow to the pulmonary vascular bed is typically unrestricted and patients may have mild or no evidence of cyanosis (ie, they appear pink). In some patients with unrestricted flow, heart failure may develop as their pulmonary vascular resistance decreases after birth with an increased left ventricular (LV) volume load, and these patients may require medical therapy.

         Some newborns may have a patent ductus arteriosus supplying blood flow to one or both lungs. These patients typically have moderate degrees of cyanosis with true, confluent pulmonary arteries and may not have extensive MAPCAs. Prostaglandin E1 infusion is required to maintain ductal patency and pulmonary blood flow; otherwise, they become increasingly cyanotic and hypoxic as the patent ductus arteriosus closes.

         Most infants with suspected cyanotic CHD undergo initial testing, including pulse oximetry, chest radiography, and electrocardiogram (ECG). The findings on these tests are nonspecific, and the diagnosis of TOF/PA/MAPCAs is typically made by echocardiography and confirmed with computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and/or cardiac catheterization.

         ). The systemic oxygen saturation depends on the amount of left-to-right shunt from the aorta to the pulmonary arteries via systemic-to-pulmonary arterial connections. There is no difference between pre- and postductal arterial saturations, since flow across a patent ductus arteriosus (if present) is left to right. (See

Therefore, patients at our institution undergo diagnostic angiography and cardiac catheterization to obtain detailed anatomic and hemodynamic data needed for decisions regarding intervention. (See

         Diagnostic angiography is required to identify all sources of pulmonary blood flow, the presence and arborization of true pulmonary arteries, and the origins and contributions of all MAPCAs. All communications between MAPCAs and the true pulmonary artery system must be identified since surgical planning depends on whether each lung segment receives blood flow from MAPCAs, true pulmonary arteries (isolated supply), or both (dual supply). In addition, all areas of stenosis in each MAPCA need to be identified. (See

         The management of patients with TOF/PA/MAPCAs is challenging, given the wide spectrum of pulmonary artery architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
         Neonates should be cared for at a medical center with experience in managing complex congenital heart disease (CHD). When an antenatal diagnosis is made, maternal transfer should be performed so that neonatal care can be provided immediately after birth by a cardiac team with this expertise. (See

         Subsequent management focused on complete separation of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. This is accomplished by restructuring pulmonary blood flow to create a low-pressure system, establishing antegrade pulmonary blood flow from the right ventricle (RV), and closing the ventricular septal defect (VSD).

         Initial management is focused on stabilizing cardiac and pulmonary function and ensuring adequate pulmonary blood flow and systemic oxygenation. However, the range of interventions varies depending on the initial oxygen saturation.

         pulmonary blood flow due to unrestricted MAPCAs may develop pulmonary congestion and heart failure, especially as pulmonary vascular resistance declines after delivery. Medical intervention depends on the severity of symptoms and may include use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics. Medical management of heart failure is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         In patients with sufficient, but not excessive, pulmonary blood flow, no intervention may be necessary in the neonatal period, since these patients may maintain acceptable oxygen saturations in the 75 to 85 percent range without medical treatment.

         Surgical management is tailored to the anatomy of each individual patient and depends on the presence and caliber of true pulmonary arteries and the anatomy of the MAPCAs. Management is focused on lowering post-repair RV pressure as much as possible because elevation of the RV:left ventricle (LV) pressure ratio is associated with increased mortality [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. It is therefore of utmost importance to maximize the pulmonary vascular cross-sectional area by recruiting as many lung segments as possible and relieving any significant obstruction to blood delivery from the RV to the pulmonary microvasculature. Establishing antegrade flow as early as possible is also important to facilitate the postnatal growth of the underdeveloped pulmonary arterial tree, thereby allowing access for future interventional procedures, if needed.

          The timing of VSD closure is important, especially related to RVOT reconstruction. Closing the VSD too early may result in pulmonary hypertension and RV failure. However, delay in closing the VSD after unifocalization may result in excessive pulmonary blood flow, causing pulmonary congestion, left-sided heart failure, and, if this physiology persists, pulmonary hypertension. In our center, the decision to close the VSD is made based on data that predict postoperative pulmonary artery pressure from an intraoperative flow study and cardiac catheterization [
          <a href="#rid18">
           18
          </a>
          ]. During the intraoperative flow study, if the mean pulmonary artery pressure stays consistently &lt;25 mmHg at a pulmonary blood flow of 2.5 L/min/m
          <sup>
           2
          </sup>
          , the VSD can be closed as it predicts a postoperative RV:LV pressure ratio at or below 0.5, which is associated with a good outcome. However, if it exceeds 25 mmHg, the VSD is not closed and the reconstruction of the RVOT is not performed.

         A small subgroup of patients have dual pulmonary blood supply with true, small-caliber pulmonary arteries that are confluent and arborize to all segments as well as multiple small collaterals that are connected peripherally into the true pulmonary arterial system. Because the collateral vessels are small in caliber, there is little material for unifocalization. In this setting, an initial palliative procedure, an aortopulmonary window (end-to-side anastomosis of the small main pulmonary trunk to the ascending aorta), is performed in the neonatal period in order to stimulate native pulmonary artery growth. The patient undergoes cardiac catheterization three to six months postoperatively to evaluate whether there has been suitable pulmonary artery growth to undergo unifocalization. A review of 35 patients undergoing aortopulmonary window from our institution showed 87 percent were able to achieve complete intracardiac repair by three years following placement of the window [

         For patients with extensive segmental-level stenoses, multiple-stage unifocalization procedures are required. For each unifocalization, a modified Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt (also commonly called a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt) is created from a major systemic artery to the newly unifocalized pulmonary arterial tree. Subsequent intracardiac repair is performed based on results from cardiac catheterization and the intraoperative flow study that demonstrates low mean pulmonary artery pressure.

         The success of this strategy was demonstrated by a retrospective review of 462 patients (median age at operation 7.7 months) who were treated over 15 years [

         ]. In this cohort, approximately one-half of the patients had large MAPCAs without significant stenosis and were able to undergo a single-stage operation with unifocalization and complete intracardiac repair. One-quarter of patients underwent single-stage unifocalization and subsequent intracardiac repair. At five-year follow-up, 90 percent of patients were completely repaired and there was an overall 6 percent mortality rate. The actuarial five-year survival rate was 86 percent.

         Because of these respiratory complications, patients undergoing unifocalization procedures are at risk for prolonged postoperative respiratory failure. In a study of 35 patients managed at our center, one-third of patients required mechanical ventilation beyond postoperative day 5 [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. In multivariate analysis, delayed sternal closure was an independent predictor of prolonged respiratory failure, whereas fluid balance and experiencing bronchospasm were not independently associated with increased risk.

          Anatomy and genetics
         </strong>
         – Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (TOF/PA/MAPCAs) is a rare form of congenital heart disease (CHD). It is the most extreme variant of TOF and has the characteristic features of TOF (anterior malaligned ventricular septal defect [VSD] and overriding aorta) with complete atresia of the pulmonary valve. Blood flow to the pulmonary vasculature is provided via one or more MAPCAs. Several genetic variants have been associated with TOF/PA. In particular, deletions within the 22q11.2 locus are seen in approximately one-third of cases. (See

          Presentation
         </strong>
         – TOF/PA/MAPCAs may be detected antenatally on routine obstetric ultrasound. Patients who present postnatally can have variable presentations depending on the amount of pulmonary blood flow through the systemic-to-pulmonary artery connections. The degree of cyanosis is dependent on the restriction of blood flow through the systemic-to-pulmonary artery connections. The left-to-right shunt decreases in patients with narrow MAPCAs, resulting in more severe cyanosis. In contrast, unrestricted pulmonary blood flow may lead to pulmonary congestion and heart failure as the neonate's pulmonary vascular resistance decreases. (See

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Most infants with suspected cyanotic CHD undergo initial testing with pulse oximetry, chest radiography, and electrocardiogram (ECG). The characteristic chest radiograph finding in all forms of TOF is a boot-shaped heart (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The definitive diagnosis of TOF/PA/MAPCAs is made by echocardiography, with the characteristic findings of an anterior malaligned VSD, overriding aortic valve, PA, and one or more aortopulmonary collaterals. (See

         ). This first stage consists of unifocalization and creation of a shunt between the central aorta and a neopulmonary artery. The aortopulmonary shunt promotes pulmonary arterial growth. Intracardiac repair with VSD closure and RVOT reconstruction is performed later, pending reevaluation of the pulmonary vascular bed by catheterization.

         Extensive segmental-level stenoses – Patients with extensive segmental-level stenoses generally require multiple staged unifocalization procedures. For each unifocalization, a modified Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt is created from a major systemic artery to the newly unifocalized pulmonary arterial tree. Subsequent intracardiac repair is performed based on results from cardiac catheterization and the intraoperative flow study that demonstrates low mean pulmonary artery pressure.

         Other patients – For the small subset for patients with dual pulmonary blood supply with true, small-caliber pulmonary arteries that are confluent and arborize to all segments as well as multiple small collaterals that are connected peripherally into the true pulmonary arterial system, we suggest an initial palliative procedure in the neonatal period (ie, creation of an aortopulmonary window) (

          Grade 2C

         ). This approach is preferred because there is little material for unifocalization and creation of an aortopulmonary window stimulates native pulmonary artery growth. The patient undergoes cardiac catheterization three to six months postoperatively to assess suitability for unifocalization.
