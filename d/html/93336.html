Most head trauma in children is minor and not associated with brain injury or long-term sequelae. However, a small number of children who appear to be at low risk may have a clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI).</p><p>The clinical challenge for evaluating minor head trauma in pediatric patients is to identify those infants and children with ciTBI while limiting unnecessary radiographic imaging and radiation exposure. Neuroimaging, usually with computed tomography (CT), is highly sensitive for identifying brain injury requiring acute intervention. However, individual clinical predictors for ciTBI are often nonspecific, particularly in young children. Thus, evaluation for high-risk findings and the use of a clinical decision rule can provide a balanced approach that identifies almost all infants and children with ciTBI after minor head trauma without overuse of CT. Most infants and children with minor head trauma can be safely discharged home after careful evaluation without undergoing imaging. If neuroimaging is performed, those patients with normal clinical findings and imaging may also be discharged home.</p><p>The management of infants and children with mild head trauma is presented here.</p><p>The clinical features of head-injured children with and without brain injury and the evaluation of minor head trauma in children, concussion and mild head trauma in adolescents, severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children and adolescents, and abusive head trauma in children are reviewed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6559.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in infants and young children (&lt;2 years): Clinical features and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90569.html" rel="external">"Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91282.html" rel="external">"Concussion in children and adolescents: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4828.html" rel="external">"Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85893.html" rel="external">"Sideline evaluation of concussion"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6566.html" rel="external">"Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children: Initial evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12673558"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12673565"><span class="h2">Minor head trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because of the difference in mechanisms and presentations, it is best to define minor head trauma differently by age as follows (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6559.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in infants and young children (&lt;2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127071.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in children (≥2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children younger than two years of age</strong> – Minor head trauma is generally defined separately in children younger than two years of age for the following reasons [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Clinical assessment is more difficult</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infants with intracranial injuries are frequently asymptomatic</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Skull fractures or clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) may occur despite minor trauma</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Inflicted injury occurs more frequently</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Experts define minor head trauma in these patients as a history or physical signs of blunt trauma to the scalp, skull, or brain in an infant or child who is alert or awakens to voice or light touch [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children two years of age and older</strong> – The definition of minor head trauma for children two years of age and older has often been based upon the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Some have defined minor head trauma as a GCS score of 15, whereas others have included children with scores ≥13  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662" href="/d/graphic/59662.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. However, the rate of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children with a GCS score of 13 is as high as 20 percent, which makes neuroimaging indicated for children with this degree of altered mental status.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Thus, for the purposes of this discussion, we define minor head trauma in previously healthy children two years of age and older as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>GCS score of 14 or 15 at the initial examination</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No abnormal or focal findings on neurologic examination</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No physical evidence of skull fracture</p><p></p><p>However, the clinician should regard these patients as having <strong>apparently</strong> minor head trauma because approximately 5 percent have TBI on neuroimaging, and 1 percent have ciTBI.

Like minor head trauma, patients with mild TBI usually have GCS scores of 13 to 15, measured approximately 30 minutes after the injury. In comparison, patients with moderate TBI generally have initial GCS scores between 9 and 12, whereas those with severe injury have GCS scores ≤8  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662" href="/d/graphic/59662.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].

Thus, neuroimaging with the risk of radiation exposure if CT of the head is performed is not indicated.

Data are limited as many studies (including PECARN and the Canadian Assessment of Tomography for Childhood Head injury [CATCH]) specifically exclude children with head injury who present more than 24 hours after injury. However, observational studies suggest that the risk of traumatic brain injury may be significant, and that neuroimaging is often warranted in well-appearing children with non-frontal hematomas or signs of skull fracture:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>In a prospective, observational study of almost 20,000 children with minor head trauma, of the 1,000 children who presented &gt;24 hours after minor head injury and had a GCS score of 14 to 15, nearly 4 percent had an abnormal head CT, 0.8 percent had ciTBI, and 0.2 percent required neurosurgery [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Nonfrontal scalp hematoma and clinical suspicion for a depressed skull fracture were strongly associated with ciTBI.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>In a retrospective study of 76 children &lt;24 months of age who presented with scalp swelling greater than 24 hours following head trauma, 42 percent had isolated linear/nondisplaced skull fracture, and 41 percent had linear/nondisplaced skull fracture with associated extra-axial hematoma (epidural or subdural hematoma) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. No patient had neurologic deficits, and none required surgical intervention nor experienced neurologic decline.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>In a retrospective study of 344 children younger than 24 months with CT imaging for head trauma, 68 (19.8 percent) had late presentations (&gt;24 hours from the injury). Of those with late presentations, 15 (22 percent) had significant TBI on CT (intracranial bleeding, pneumocephalus, cerebral edema, depressed or diastatic fracture), two (3 percent) had ciTBI, and one (2 percent) required neurosurgical intervention. There was no significant difference in rates of ciTBI or neurosurgical intervention between those who presented early and late. Since only patients who had CT were included in the analysis, incidence of ciTBI could not be calculated for the total head injury population presenting early or late [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Not low risk with normal neuroimaging</strong> – We recommend that infants and children with minor head trauma who are initially <strong>not</strong> at low risk for ciTBI but have normal neuroimaging, a normal level of consciousness, and meet all discharge criteria undergo discharge home rather than hospital admission. (See <a class="local">'Discharge criteria'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additional considerations may exist for children with selected skull fractures that may necessitate observation or hospital admission.

As an example, in a multicenter observational study of 13,543 children who were evaluated in children's hospital emergency departments for isolated minor head trauma (GCS 14 or 15) and who had normal cranial CT scan results, repeat neuroimaging (CT or MRI) was performed in 2 percent of 11,058 discharged patients and 6 percent of admitted patients [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Of these, 0.05 and 0.6 percent of discharged patients and admitted patients, respectively, subsequently had positive findings upon repeat head CT.

In two small observational studies describing such patients, no further seizure activity or neurologic sequelae were noted within the first day to week after injury [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. In a larger, multicenter, prospective study, 457 patients had a post-traumatic seizure, no TBI on CT (or no CT performed) and known recurrent seizure status. Of these, five individuals (1.1 percent) had seizure recurrence, only one of these presented with a GCS score of 15, and none required neurosurgical intervention [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Although there is limited evidence to support a particular approach, we typically observe these children for several hours until they are back to baseline mental status and then discharge them if they meet criteria and have close follow-up assured. (See <a class="local">'Discharge instructions'</a> below.)</p><p>Evidence is limited to guide the management of children with more concerning features (eg, focal or prolonged seizure, strong family history, known seizure disorder). Such patients may benefit from hospital admission for observation, further evaluation (eg, electroencephalogram), and/or consultation with a neurologist, depending upon specific aspects of their clinical presentation.</p><p>Based upon low-quality evidence, prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy is unlikely to be helpful for patients with early post-traumatic seizures (ie, soon after the head trauma). Although observational studies indicate that these patients are at a modestly increased risk of epilepsy (standardized incidence ratio of 1.5 to 2.0 for children with mild head injury relative to the normal population) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], studies of prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy in adult and pediatric patients with moderate or severe head trauma have shown no benefit beyond the first week after injury.
