         Globally, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy, accounting for over two million cases each year [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It is also the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. In the United States, breast cancer is the most common female cancer, and the second most common cause of cancer death in women [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Once a diagnosis of breast cancer is established, it is important to accurately define the initial extent of disease since this information will affect treatment recommendations. This topic will review the clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and staging following a diagnosis of breast cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         The factors that modify breast cancer risk, the treatment approach to in situ and invasive breast cancer, and the use of prognostic and predictive factors when making adjuvant treatment decisions are reviewed as separate topics.

         Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, including low- and middle-income countries [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The incidence rates are highest in North America, Australia/New Zealand, and in western and northern Europe and lowest in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. These international differences are likely related to societal changes as a result of industrialization (eg, changes in fat intake, body weight, age at menarche, and/or lactation, and reproductive patterns such as fewer pregnancies and later age at first birth). Studies of migration patterns to the United States are consistent with the importance of cultural and/or environmental changes [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In general, incidence rates of breast cancer are greater in second-generation migrants and increase further in third- and fourth-generation migrants.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the United States, breast cancer accounts for approximately 300,000 cases each year and is responsible for over 40,000 deaths [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The incidence rates decreased from 1999 to 2007 by 1.8 percent per year [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. This decline in incidence reflects the end of the prevalence peak of screening. When women are screened for the first time, there is a "prevalence peak" that is due to cancers that have been building up in the population added to the cancers that are detected early due to the screening. An extended prevalence peak was seen with the gradual uptake of screening in the United States from the mid-1980s to 1999. The drop in incidence starting in 1999 reflected the end of the prevalence peak when participation in screening plateaued and, as expected, breast cancer incidence began to fall back to baseline. Discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) had previously been touted as the major reason for this decline, although subsequent results from the Women's Health Initiative indicate HRT is safe in many postmenopausal women [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-12
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7427.html" rel="external">
          "Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks", section on 'Breast cancer'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Breast cancer mortality rates have been decreasing since the 1970s [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. This decrease in mortality is due to improved breast cancer screening and improvements in adjuvant therapy [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. Therapy saves lives when breast cancers are treated earlier, as demonstrated in a landmark article in which women age 40 to 69 years who participated in organized mammography screening had a 60 percent lower risk of dying from breast cancer within 10 years of diagnosis and a 47 percent lower risk of dying from breast cancer within 20 years of diagnosis compared with women who did not participate in screening [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>

         In countries with established breast cancer screening programs, most patients present due to an abnormal mammogram. However, up to 15 percent of women are diagnosed with breast cancer due to the presence of a breast mass that is not detected on mammogram (mammographically occult disease), and another 30 percent present with a breast mass in the interval between mammograms (interval cancers) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. In addition, women without access to screening mammograms and younger women under 40 years who may not be undergoing routine screening mammograms may present with a breast or axillary mass with or without skin changes.

         The "classic" characteristics of a cancerous lesion include a hard, immovable, single dominant lesion with irregular borders. However, these features cannot reliably distinguish a benign from a malignant tumor. (See

         The signs of more advanced locoregional disease include axillary adenopathy (suggesting locoregional disease) or skin findings such as erythema, thickening, or dimpling of the overlying skin (peau d'orange), suggesting inflammatory breast cancer. (See

         Classic mammographic findings of breast cancer include the presence of a soft tissue mass or density  (

          image 1
         </a>
         ) and suspicious microcalcifications. The most specific feature is a spiculated, high-density mass, with nearly 90 percent representing an invasive cancer. A more detailed discussion on the mammographic presentation of breast cancer is covered separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/808.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Breast ultrasound is often used to distinguish a benign versus malignant lesion. Sonographic features of malignancy include hypoechogenicity; internal calcifications; shadowing; a lesion taller than it is wide; and spiculated, indistinct, or angular margins [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. A typical ultrasound of early breast cancer is depicted here  (

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically used to screen women at high risk for breast cancer. Although nearly all invasive breast cancers enhance on gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI, MRI is not specific enough to obviate the need for biopsy. MRI features of breast cancer include irregular or spiculated mass margins, heterogeneous internal enhancement, and rim enhancement  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51605" href="/z/d/graphic/51605.html" rel="external">

          19
         </a>
         ]. Nonmass enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI may also increase suspicion of an invasive lesion, particularly if the enhancement is associated with a mass or exhibits segmental distribution [

          19,20

         Infiltrating ductal carcinomas are the most common type of invasive breast cancer, accounting for 70 to 80 percent of invasive lesions.

         For women who undergo a biopsy, the pathologic differential diagnosis must include other breast lesions beyond invasive breast cancer. Given the heterogeneity in the presentation and pathologic features of invasive breast cancer, expertise in breast pathology is often required to distinguish invasive carcinoma from other breast lesions. Breast lesions that should be considered in the review of pathology include:

         Mammographic assessment of the extent of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early invasive carcinoma begins during diagnostic mammography and continues through the biopsy, specimen management, and the postexcision mammogram [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Mammography of both breasts is particularly important in the patient with DCIS or invasive cancer who is considering breast conservation. Preoperative diagnostic mammography can help to define the extent of disease and may identify multifocal or multicentric cancer that could preclude breast conservation or signal a potential difficulty in achieving clear surgical margins. Multifocal disease is usually defined as involvement of several areas within a breast quadrant, probably representing disease along an entire duct. By contrast, multicentric disease involves multiple areas within different quadrants, probably representing involvement of multiple ducts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the extent of mammographic nonlinear branching microcalcifications frequently underestimates the pathologic extent of the malignancy, the discrepancy is less than 2 cm in 80 to 85 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Several groups of microcalcifications separated by normal-appearing tissue should not be interpreted as multifocal or multicentric disease. Often, these represent areas of contiguous tumor that is only partially calcified within a ductal lobule [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35,36
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The combination of a mass and associated calcifications often indicates the presence of an extensive intraductal component (EIC). EIC is defined pathologically as DCIS found adjacent to an invasive carcinoma, accounting for more than 25 percent of the volume of disease. This finding can be a predictor for more widespread residual tumor (usually DCIS) following gross excision of the lesion [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14219.html" rel="external">
          "Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Postoperative mammograms to look for residual calcifications after surgical resection should be considered when the microcalcifications are not clearly or completely documented on the specimen radiograph, or when margins are close or positive [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39
         </a>
         ]. If a re-excision is to be recommended based on residual calcifications, care should be taken to ensure that the calcifications are associated with malignancy on histopathology and not benign tissue. Multifocal disease is not necessarily a contraindication to breast conservation but is one of the factors that should be taken into consideration along with breast size relative to the extent of disease on imaging. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/807.html" rel="external">
          "Breast-conserving therapy"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A significant limitation of mammographic assessment of disease extent is the obscuring of the borders or extent of the primary tumor by dense overlying tissue. Dense breasts can limit the sensitivity of mammography both for detection of breast cancers and for delineating disease extent [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40-42
         </a>
         ]. In this setting, contrast-enhanced breast MRI may complement mammographic staging. If the clinical extent of disease is larger than what can be appreciated by mammography, MRI may be considered. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/808.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnostic evaluation of suspected breast cancer", section on 'Breast MRI'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Contrast enhanced mammography is a new technology that approaches accuracy of MRI for pre-operative staging and may be considered in patients unable to obtain breast MRI [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Mammographic assessment of tumor size for the staging of multifocal disease presents a unique dilemma. Most staging classifications require that the largest tumor mass be utilized for T staging, even in cases where multifocal disease is suspected. However, others suggest that the total surface area, volume, or aggregate measurements are a better indicator of prognosis [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44-46
         </a>
         ]. Accurate delineation of the extent of odd-shaped, irregular, or multifocal tumors is important for treatment planning. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/800.html" rel="external">
          "Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For invasive cancers that are contiguous to the chest wall and not completely included on mammographic projections, ancillary imaging techniques such as MRI may be necessary to assess posterior tumor extension and pectoralis fascia or muscle involvement if that will determine a change in surgical approach or the use of neoadjuvant therapy [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Breast MRI may also be useful for evaluating response to neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced breast cancers and can provide prognostic information. In a multicenter trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, functional tumor volume at MRI was a stronger predictor of recurrence-free survival than pathologic complete response [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48

         Breast cancer is staged using the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union for Cancer Control classification system for Tumor, Nodes, and Metastases (TNM). The eighth edition of the TNM staging system, which was effective as of January 1, 2018, includes anatomic stage groups  (

        <p>
         In the TNM system, patients are assigned a clinical stage (cTNM) preoperatively. Following surgery, the pathologic stage (pTNM) is then determined. For patients who undergo neoadjuvant treatment, the final pathologic stage is designated by the letter y (ypTNM). (See

         Clinical tumor (T) stage is assessed by clinical examination and/or imaging. While the majority of breast cancers are associated with abnormal mammographic findings, breast ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging may be required to accurately assess tumor size, particularly in patients presenting with a breast mass that is not identified on mammography.

         The status of the regional lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic factors in early-stage breast cancer. Physical examination is neither a sensitive nor a reliable method to ascertain the status of the axillary lymph nodes because metastatic lymph nodes are often not palpable and reactive lymph nodes may be mistaken for metastases. The positive predictive value of clinical palpation ranges from 61 to 84 percent, while the negative predictive value is only 50 to 60 percent [

         Most patients presenting with breast cancer have disease confined to the breast (stage I to II) with no or limited (ie, less than three) nodes involved. We do not routinely stage such patients in the absence of signs or symptoms suspicious for metastatic disease.

          Presentation
         </strong>
         – In countries with established breast cancer screening programs, most patients present due to an abnormal mammogram. However, women with advanced cases of breast cancer may present with skin changes (also known as peau d'orange) or axillary adenopathy. Less than 5 percent of patients present with signs or symptoms of metastatic breast cancer. (See

         The diagnosis of breast cancer is defined by the presence of malignant epithelial cells (carcinoma) showing evidence of stromal invasion. (See

         Most breast malignancies are carcinomas that arise from epithelial elements. However, there are various histologic types of breast carcinomas, such as sarcomas, that differ in microscopic appearance and biologic behavior. (See

         Breast cancer can be categorized based on expression of estrogen (ER), progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor (HER2) receptors. Each of these factors influence prognosis for patients with invasive breast cancer and is used to individualize treatment options. (See

          Staging
         </strong>
         – Breast cancer is classified according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union for Cancer Control for tumor, nodes, and metastases (TNM;  (

         )). In the TNM system, patients are assigned a clinical stage (cTNM) preoperatively. Following surgery, the pathologic stage (pTNM) can be assigned. For patients who undergo neoadjuvant treatment, the final pathologic stage is designated by the letter y (ypTNM). (See
