This topic focuses upon the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders in patients with ESKD who are treated with maintenance dialysis. Other aspects of dialysis are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1866.html" rel="external">"Indications for initiation of dialysis in chronic kidney disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1851.html" rel="external">"Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3919190814"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H631911057"><span class="h2">Epidemiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychopathology is common in patients who are treated with maintenance dialysis. In a prospective study that enrolled 70 dialysis patients (mean age 53 years) and assessed them for psychiatric disorders using a semistructured interview and standardized diagnostic criteria, the point prevalence of any current psychiatric diagnosis was 71 percent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Psychiatric disorders that are common in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) include [<a href="#rid1">1,4-7</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder (see <a class="local">'Anxiety disorders'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Depressive disorders, such as unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132291.html" rel="external">"Depression in adults receiving maintenance dialysis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neurocognitive disorders, such as delirium and dementia (see <a class="local">'Neurocognitive disorders'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Substance-related and addictive disorders, such as alcohol use disorder (see <a class="local">'Other disorders'</a> below)</p><p></p><p>One review reported that the prevalence of depression, dementia, and substance-related and addictive disorders was each greater in dialysis patients than the general population [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1981645750"><span class="h2">Potential adverse consequences</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychiatric comorbidity in ESKD may lead to poor adherence with dialysis and disruptive behavior on dialysis units [<a href="#rid3">3,6,9</a>]. As an example, depressive symptoms are independently associated with missed hemodialysis treatments, as well as abbreviated treatments that are shortened by patient request [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Comorbid psychiatric disorders in patients on maintenance dialysis are also associated with significant morbidity [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In a retrospective study that examined patients who initiated dialysis and were followed during the first year of dialysis, the primary findings included the following [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among patients age 22 to 64 years (n = approximately 400,000), hospitalization with a primary or secondary psychiatric diagnosis occurred in 2 and 25 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among patients age ≥65 years (n &gt;600,000), hospitalization with a primary or secondary psychiatric diagnosis occurred in 2 and 19 percent.</p><p></p><p>Among patients who initiate dialysis, mortality is greater in those who develop psychiatric illnesses [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A retrospective study used a national registry dedicated to chronic kidney disease and ESKD to identify patients who were hospitalized within the first year of starting dialysis, either with a psychiatric diagnosis (n &gt;11,000) or a nonpsychiatric diagnosis (controls, n &gt;300,000) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The most common psychiatric disorders leading to hospitalization included depression, neurocognitive disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders, and the mean duration of follow-up was approximately three years. After controlling for potential confounding factors such as sociodemographic variables and general medical comorbidities, the analyses found that all-cause mortality was nearly 30 percent greater in patients with psychiatric disorders than controls (hazard ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.26-1.32).</p><p>Psychiatric disorders in dialysis patients are also associated with suicide [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Suicide'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H778306117"><span class="h2">Diagnosis and treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients who are treated with maintenance dialysis, the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders are identical to those used in the general population [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Psychiatric disorders in patients receiving maintenance dialysis are often underdiagnosed [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. One reason may be that symptoms of psychiatric disorders overlap with symptoms of inadequate dialysis, complications of ESKD, and medication adverse effects [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p>In addition, psychiatric illnesses in patients with ESKD are undertreated and relatively few studies have examined how to treat these comorbidities [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Thus, the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for comorbid psychiatric conditions is often not clear, and treatment recommendations are generally based upon the general population of patients with psychiatric disorders. The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy is likely to be successful, and may be cost effective [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1408269628"><span class="h3">Referral</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although some nephrologists have the requisite training and experience to diagnose and manage specific psychiatric disorders (eg, unipolar major depression), most patients are referred to psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians if these specialists are available [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Indications for referral include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suicidal ideation and behavior (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1708.html" rel="external">"Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychotic features (eg, auditory hallucinations commanding patients to kill themselves) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17193.html" rel="external">"Psychosis in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Catatonia – Prominent psychomotor disturbances, such as immobility, mutism, and posturing, which occur during most of the mood episode (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14683.html" rel="external">"Catatonia in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15869.html" rel="external">"Catatonia: Treatment and prognosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Impulsive and dangerous behavior (eg, significant aggression)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fluctuating symptoms</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional impairment (eg, chronic marital conflicts or unemployment)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple comorbid psychiatric disorders (eg, depressive disorder plus a substance-related and addictive disorder)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Administering psychotherapy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior history of recurrent episodes of the psychiatric disorder</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poor adherence with psychiatric treatment</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Discontinuing psychiatric treatment following a period of stability, or with no clear precipitant</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recalcitrant psychiatric symptoms despite appropriate treatment, or poor tolerance to multiple treatments</p><p></p><p>In addition, referral to social work is often appropriate; indications include problematic social circumstances, such as intimate partner violence or other trauma, poverty, or homelessness. Social workers may also facilitate treatment uptake.</p><p>Nephrologists who refer patients on dialysis to psychiatric specialists are encouraged to remain involved in management. The nephrologist often knows the patient’s personal situation and can help educate patients and families about psychotropics and psychotherapy, reinforce the need for adherence, and typically collaborates in monitoring treatment effectiveness by virtue of frequent interactions with patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1013421742"><span class="h3">Psychopharmacology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients treated with maintenance dialysis, the dose of most psychotropic medications does not need to be adjusted because they are metabolized in the liver [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, the metabolites are often excreted by the kidney and some drugs may require a dose adjustment. Dosing recommendations that are specific for hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be found in the Lexicomp drug information topic for that drug, in the section on dosing in renal impairment. Some of the dose recommendations are based upon the European Renal Best Practice guideline [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The Lexicomp drug information topics are included in UpToDate.</p><p>If uncertainty exists regarding the dose of a psychotropic to use in patients on dialysis, it is prudent to start at a lower dose (eg, one-half) than that used for the general population of patients [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In addition, dose titration should also proceed more slowly than the standard rate.</p><p>The therapeutic dose of some drugs is determined by their serum concentrations; one example is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10035" href="/z/d/drug information/10035.html" rel="external">valproate</a>, which may be indicated for bipolar disorder. However, in patients with ESKD, total serum concentrations of drugs that are highly protein bound may be misleading because uremic toxins may displace the drug from serum proteins and increase the unbound fraction of the drug [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. If feasible, it is preferable to monitor the free concentration of the drug rather than the total concentration.</p><p>It is unlikely that dialysis will remove meaningful amounts of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines [<a href="#rid1">1-3,14</a>]. These medications typically undergo hepatic metabolism, are highly bound to plasma proteins, and are lipophilic and have a large volume of distribution.</p><p>However, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9566" href="/z/d/drug information/9566.html" rel="external">lithium</a>, which may be indicated for bipolar disorder and unipolar major depression, is completely dialyzed [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. After each hemodialysis session, patients generally receive a single supplemental dose of 300 mg. At least two to three hours should elapse after dialysis before lithium serum concentrations are assayed because the drug re-equilibrates and is released from tissue stores immediately following dialysis.</p><p>For patients who are treated with hemodialysis, clinicians should try to avoid drugs that can prolong the QT interval because these patients are at increased risk of adverse cardiac events due to comorbid cardiovascular disease and electrolyte shifts during dialysis [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Psychotropic drugs that can cause QT prolongation include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8874" href="/z/d/drug information/8874.html" rel="external">citalopram</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9991" href="/z/d/drug information/9991.html" rel="external">thioridazine</a>, and tricyclics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14675.html" rel="external">"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects", section on 'Citalopram'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1717.html" rel="external">"Tricyclic and tetracyclic drugs: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects", section on 'Cardiac'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14773.html" rel="external">"First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects", section on 'QT interval prolongation and sudden death'</a>.)</p><p>We also try to avoid drugs that can cause orthostatic hypotension (eg, tricyclic antidepressants and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10013" href="/z/d/drug information/10013.html" rel="external">trazodone</a>) in patients on hemodialysis [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Fluid shifts during the dialysis session can cause intradialytic hypotension as well as symptoms that persist for several hours after the treatment ends and can render patients more vulnerable to orthostasis.</p><p>In addition, drug-drug interactions can occur between psychotropic medications and other medications that may be prescribed for patients with ESKD [<a href="#rid1">1,6,14</a>]. Interactions of a specific drug with other medications may be determined using the <a class="external" href="/drug-interactions">drug interactions program</a> included in UpToDate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2085023839"><span class="h1">ANXIETY DISORDERS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anxiety disorders include acute procedure anxiety, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Another disorder that may arise in patients on hemodialysis is specific phobia, due to a fear of needles, the sight of blood, and vascular access cannulation.</p><p>Anxiety disorders and clinically significant symptoms frequently occur in patients treated with maintenance dialysis [<a href="#rid14">14,16</a>]. Meta-analyses of observational studies found that the prevalence was as follows [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anxiety disorders (9 studies, n &gt;1000 patients) – 19 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated anxiety symptoms (52 studies, n &gt;10,000 patients) – 43 percent</p><p></p><p>These results, when compared with studies in the general population, suggest that anxiety may be greater in dialysis patients than the general population. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/496.html" rel="external">"Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Prevalence'</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors associated with elevated anxiety symptoms in dialysis patients include concomitant depression, increased duration of hospitalization, and reduced quality of life [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>Symptoms of anxiety such as fatigue or impaired concentration may overlap with symptoms of inadequate dialysis [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In addition, anxiety may manifest with somatic symptoms such as dyspnea, palpitations, and gastrointestinal distress, which can overlap with general medical illnesses (eg, cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders). Somatic anxiety symptoms are associated with an increased number and severity of dialysis symptoms [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. </p><p>Onset of anxiety in dialysis patients may occur prior to or at commencement of dialysis and persist during dialysis. A prospective study enrolled 182 patients who were starting dialysis and followed them for a median of 20 months; assessments included a self-report questionnaire at baseline and during follow-up [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, which were present at baseline in 24 percent, did not improve during the first year of follow-up and dialysis.</p><p>Quality of life among dialysis patients is worse in those with comorbid anxiety disorders [<a href="#rid7">7,20,21</a>].</p><p>Among patients who are treated with maintenance dialysis, the diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders are the same as those used in the general population [<a href="#rid9">9,11</a>]. In addition, treatment of anxiety in dialysis patients typically includes the standard lifestyle modifications, psychotherapies, and pharmacotherapies that are used for anxiety in the general population. If a benzodiazepine is indicated, we prefer <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9573" href="/z/d/drug information/9573.html" rel="external">lorazepam</a> because it does not have an active metabolite [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders are discussed in separate topics.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MAJOR DEPRESSION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Major depression is common in patients treated with maintenance dialysis.

As an example, one review found that among patients older than age 55 years, moderate to severe chronic cognitive impairment is present in up to 70 percent [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Another review estimated that the point prevalence of impairment is three to five times greater in dialysis patients than the general population [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In addition, cognitive impairment occurs more frequently in dialysis patients age 21 to 54 years, compared with individuals in the general population over 65 years.</p><p>In prospective, cross-sectional studies of dialysis patients, cognitive impairment was identified in approximately 30 to 85 percent, and was often not recognized [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One study included 458 dialysis patients (mean age 52 years) who were screened with a modified version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, and found that global cognitive function was impaired in 28 percent [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A third study administered a battery of nine cognitive tests to assess executive function, language, and memory in 338 hemodialysis patients aged 55 years and older [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

Several studies in patients treated with dialysis indicate that although impairment across multiple domains of neuropsychological functioning is common, it is often unrecognized [<a href="#rid23">23,24,27</a>]. Periodic screening (eg, every 12 months) is important for recognizing cognitive impairment in ESKD that develops or progresses over time and may uncover subtle symptoms that are not obvious when the patient is being observed during dialysis. (See <a class="local">'Course of illness'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients on maintenance dialysis are screened for cognitive impairment with the same instruments that are used in the general population [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].

Other reasonable choices include the Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination and the Clock-Drawing Test. No scale has been validated in ESKD.

In assessing patients who make this request, clinicians should determine that the patient wants no further interventions to treat psychiatric disorders that may be associated with the request for withdrawal of dialysis. In addition, clinicians must establish that the patient has decision making capacity and fully comprehends the consequences, including imminent death (eg, within one to two weeks) and the symptoms of the dying process.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or email these topics to your patients.

Relatively common illnesses include anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Potential adverse consequences – Psychiatric comorbidity in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) may sometimes lead to poor adherence with dialysis and increased rates of hospitalization, suicide, and all-cause mortality. (See <a class="local">'Potential adverse consequences'</a> above and <a class="local">'Suicide'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis and treatment</strong> – Among patients who are treated with maintenance dialysis, the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders are identical to those used in the general population. In addition, treatment recommendations for comorbid mental disorders are generally based upon patients in the general population of patients with psychiatric disorders. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Referral – Nephrologists may have the requisite training and experience to diagnose and manage psychiatric disorders; however, most patients are referred to psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians if these specialists are available. (See <a class="local">'Referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Psychopharmacology – Although the dose of most psychotropic medications does not need to be adjusted for patients on dialysis, some drugs may require a dose adjustment. Clinicians should try to avoid drugs that can prolong the QT interval or cause hypotension. (See <a class="local">'Psychopharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anxiety disorders</strong> – Among patients treated with maintenance dialysis, anxiety disorders and clinically significant symptoms occur in approximately 20 to 45 percent, which may be greater than the rate in the general population. (See <a class="local">'Anxiety disorders'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Major depression</strong> – Major depression is common in patients treated with maintenance dialysis.

(See <a class="local">'Specific deficits'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Screening and assessment<strong> </strong>– Screening dialysis patients for cognitive impairment can be useful, provided services are in place to ensure appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Widely used instruments include either the clinician administered Mini-Mental State Examination or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. (See <a class="local">'Screening and assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Management – Management of cognitive impairment in patients treated with dialysis depends upon the severity of impairment and whether a specific neurocognitive disorder diagnosis is established. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dementia</strong> – Dementia is marked by a significant decline in one or more cognitive domains, and the deficits interfere with independence in activities of daily living. Dementia appears to affect up to 20 percent of patients on maintenance dialysis, and the prevalence of dementia may be approximately two times greater in dialysis patients than the general population. Dialysis patients appear to be more susceptible to vascular dementia than other dementias. (See <a class="local">'Dementia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Delirium</strong> – Delirium is a disturbance of attention and awareness that develops over a short period of time and is accompanied by additional cognitive impairment. The disturbance is caused by a medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or medication side effect. (See <a class="local">'Delirium'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pathogenesis – Causes of delirium that are specifically relevant for patients on maintenance dialysis include uremic encephalopathy, dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, and electrolyte disorders. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Treatment – Treatment of delirium rests upon identifying and managing the underlying cause.
