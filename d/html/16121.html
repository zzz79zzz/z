Medical fitness, genetic features of the MDS cells, institutional/clinician approach, and patient preference are important factors for selecting treatment, and we suggest referral to transplantation specialists soon after diagnosis to evaluate eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) and to define donor options; age alone should not be an exclusion for this evaluation.

However, most patients are symptomatic with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or recurrent infections. Supportive care for symptoms associated with MDS (eg, transfusions, erythropoiesis stimulating agents, antibiotic therapy) is discussed separately.

A broad range of treatment options exists, and choices vary based on clinician/institutional approach, goals of care, and personal preference. Medical fitness, rather than age alone, should inform the selection of therapy. Other important factors for selecting treatment are availability of a suitable stem cell donor and/or caregiver and genetic features of the MDS cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119697" href="/d/graphic/119697.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), as described below. (See <a class="local">'Options for suitable patients'</a> below.)</p><p>Most medically fit patients are eligible for intensive treatments, such as allogeneic HCT and/or remission induction chemotherapy; these approaches have the potential to achieve long-term disease-free survival, but they are associated with substantial short-term and long-term toxicity. Some patients may instead choose lower intensity therapy with hypomethylating agents, which cause less toxicity and can provide relief of symptoms, improve the quality of life, and extend survival; however, these agents do not have the potential to cure MDS. For patients with particular genetic features, treatment with a targeted agent may be an option, but the role and long-term outcomes with such agents for MDS are presently uncertain. Certain medically fit patients may select supportive care alone based on goals of care, personal preference, advanced age, or lack of an available caregiver.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H805664240"><span class="h2">Intermediate fitness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intermediate medical fitness comprises a broad range of patients, some of whom have only modest, recent, or transient impairment of functional status, while others have substantial comorbid illnesses, cognitive impairment, or other conditions that may affect their ability to tolerate treatment.</p><p>Some patients of intermediate fitness are suitable for intensive treatment (eg, allogeneic HCT or remission induction therapy), but comorbidities may affect the balance of benefits versus toxicity and/or may influence eligibility. Selection of treatment for patients of intermediate fitness depends on institutional approach, goals of care and personal preference, availability of a stem cell donor and/or caregiver, and genetic features of the MDS cells. Geriatric consultation and evaluation by transplantation specialists may be valuable for determining whether a patient of intermediate medical fitness is a suitable candidate for intensive treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16870.html" rel="external">"Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p>For patients who are candidates for intensive therapy, our approach is described below.

However, soon after the diagnosis of high/very high risk MDS is established, the patient should be referred to transplantation specialists to evaluate eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Age alone should not preclude this evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16870.html" rel="external">"Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p>Treatment selection is influenced by pathologic features (eg, the presence of adverse or targetable genetic features), availability of a suitable stem cell donor and caregiver, patient preference, and institutional approach  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119697" href="/d/graphic/119697.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Treatment options involve different levels of treatment intensity and toxicity, so decisions must carefully weigh the balance of benefits and risk in alignment of the individual patient's goals of care. (See <a class="local">'Goals of care'</a> above.)</p><p>Because of a variety of stem cell donor options (eg, siblings, unrelated donors, haploidentical donors, umbilical cord blood donors), a suitable match can be found for most patients. Eligibility criteria for allogeneic HCT vary by institution but, in general, patients should have normal cardiac, pulmonary, liver, and renal function, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2, as described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16870.html" rel="external">"Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Impact of individual factors'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients who are suitable for intensive therapy may select supportive care alone, based on personal preference or goals of care.

For patients with adverse genetic features, we suggest treatment with either allogeneic HCT or lower intensity therapy with a hypomethylating agent (HMA)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119697" href="/d/graphic/119697.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), rather than intensive remission induction therapy. Treatment choices are influenced by the specific genetic features, comorbidities, patient preference, and institutional approach.</p><p>In this setting, allogeneic HCT offers the possibility of long-term disease control but may cause acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infections, and other toxicity. HMAs are associated with less toxicity than either transplantation or intensive chemotherapy and can control symptoms, enhance the quality of life, and improve cytopenias, but do not offer the possibility of cure. In the setting of adverse genetic features, intensive remission induction therapy alone does not achieve high rates of durable disease control, yet is associated with substantial toxicity. </p><p>Either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8797" href="/d/drug information/8797.html" rel="external">azacitidine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8855" href="/d/drug information/8855.html" rel="external">decitabine</a> is acceptable for most patients. However, if an HMA is selected for treatment of MDS with mutant <em>TP53</em>, some experts favor decitabine over azacitidine, as described below.

Although there is presently only limited direct evidence of the benefit of these agents for MDS, this suggestion is based on their favorable balance of toxicity and efficacy for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="118520" href="/d/drug information/118520.html" rel="external">Ivosidenib</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114206" href="/d/drug information/114206.html" rel="external">enasidenib</a> are inhibitors of mutant forms of IDH1 and IDH2, respectively, and each is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in patients with mutations of these genes [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. We consider them to be acceptable options for off-label treatment of MDS with mutation of <em>IDH1 </em>or <em>IDH2</em>, based on results with AML. However, the role of these agents for MDS is not well defined, and it is unclear if they can achieve long-term disease control. Because of this, suitable patients who have major responses to these agents should be considered for allogeneic HCT while in remission. These agents are generally well tolerated, but each is associated with a risk of differentiation syndrome. Use of ivosidenib and enasidenib for treatment of relapsed or refractory AML and differentiation syndrome are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4540.html" rel="external">"Treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia", section on 'Remission re-induction'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4351.html" rel="external">"Differentiation syndrome associated with treatment of acute leukemia"</a>.)</p><p>High/very high risk MDS shares biologic features and aspects of management with AML, and ongoing development of targeted agents for AML will likely alter the therapeutic options for MDS in the future.
