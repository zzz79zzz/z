A preferred approach is attempted downstaging with neoadjuvant therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91436" href="/z/d/graphic/91436.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

Other indications of local unresectability include encasement (more than one-half of the vessel circumference) or occlusion/thrombus of the SMA, unreconstructable SMV or SMV/portal vein confluence occlusion, or direct involvement of the inferior vena cava, aorta, or celiac axis, as defined by the absence of a fat plane between the low-density tumor and these structures on computed tomography (CT) scan or endoscopic ultrasound. Management of these locally advanced but unresectable patients usually entails initial chemotherapy and not surgical exploration  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91436" href="/z/d/graphic/91436.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2501.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer", section on 'Definitions of unresectable and borderline resectable disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2479.html" rel="external">"Initial chemotherapy and radiation for nonmetastatic, locally advanced, unresectable and borderline resectable, exocrine pancreatic cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2475.html" rel="external">"Initial systemic chemotherapy for metastatic exocrine pancreatic cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contribution of serum tumor markers</strong> – Preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) levels should not be used to direct the initial treatment strategy. Elevated levels of CA 19-9 can help to predict the presence of radiographically occult metastatic disease, the likelihood of a microscopically complete (R0) resection, and long-term outcomes in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, while high levels of CA 19-9 may help surgeons to better select patients who need staging laparoscopy, the use of CA 19-9 alone as an indicator of operability is not advised [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Furthermore, although a year 2016 clinical practice guideline on management of potentially curable pancreatic cancer from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and guidelines from the NCCN suggest that chemotherapy could be used before surgery for patients who had potentially anatomically resectable but high-risk tumors (as judged by elevated preoperative levels of CA 19-9, among other factors), there was no recommendation for a specific cutoff value of CA 19-9 to select patients for neoadjuvant therapy [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2501.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer", section on 'Carbohydrate antigen 19-9'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3448099644"><span class="h2">Multidisciplinary assessment and symptom burden</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multidisciplinary collaboration to formulate treatment plans is preferred. Baseline performance status and a comorbidity profile should be evaluated. Goals of care, patient preferences, psychologic status, support systems, and symptoms should guide decisions for treatment [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95552.html" rel="external">"Discussing goals of care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2505.html" rel="external">"Supportive care for locally advanced or metastatic exocrine pancreatic cancer"</a>.)</p><p>All patients should have a full assessment of symptom burden, psychologic status, and social supports as early as possible. In some cases, this will indicate a need for formal palliative care consultation and services [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Early initiation of palliative care services improves clinical and quality of care outcomes, and may prolong survival. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care", section on 'Rationale for palliative care'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with pancreatic cancer who are jaundiced are at risk for associated coagulopathy, malabsorption, and malnutrition. It was hoped that relief of biliary obstruction preoperatively would correct these defects and decrease postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. However, results from randomized trials have not been consistent. Uncertainty as to the benefit of preoperative biliary drainage has led to differing approaches. Some surgeons routinely decompress jaundiced patients with an endoscopically placed stent prior to surgery. However, most reserve biliary decompression for patients whose serum bilirubin concentration exceeds 20 mg/dL, for those in whom surgery will be delayed for longer than two weeks (particularly if neoadjuvant therapy is chosen), and in those with debilitating pruritus or cholangitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2482.html" rel="external">"Overview of surgery in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer and prognosis", section on 'Role of preoperative biliary drainage'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H726576759"><span class="h2">Initial resection versus neoadjuvant therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment plans for all patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer should be guided by radiographic disease extent, performance status, comorbidities, goals of care, patient preferences, psychosocial issues, and symptom burden. Management of potentially resectable disease is in evolution. We consider neoadjuvant therapy to be a reasonable alternative to upfront surgery followed by adjuvant therapy in patients who appear to have potentially resectable tumors, as long as performance status and comorbidity are sufficient to tolerate treatment. Surgery could then be reconsidered at a later time if appropriate. Further studies are necessary to clarify the optimal approach, and we encourage patients to enroll in clinical trials comparing neoadjuvant/perioperative therapy with upfront resection followed by adjuvant therapy.</p><p>Given the poor outcomes with upfront surgery, many institutions have embraced neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy for initial therapy of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, followed by re-evaluation for surgical exploration, and this is now a preferred approach. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2479.html" rel="external">"Initial chemotherapy and radiation for nonmetastatic, locally advanced, unresectable and borderline resectable, exocrine pancreatic cancer", section on 'Benefit of neoadjuvant therapy'</a>.)</p><p>However, many centers, including those of several of the authors and editors associated with this review, have taken the view that nearly all patients who appear to have "potentially resectable" pancreatic cancer should in fact be considered to have "borderline resectable" disease given the inaccuracy of imaging and the very high rates of a positive resection margins with initial surgery, a finding that is associated with poor overall survival (OS). Although only limited data are available in patients with potentially resectable disease, accumulating data from prospective randomized trials and a meta-analysis support benefit for neoadjuvant therapy in combined populations of patients with potentially resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. (See <a class="local">'Rationale and benefit over initial resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Although guidelines from ASCO and NCCN suggest that neoadjuvant therapy could be offered to certain "high-risk" patients with initially resectable disease, including those with a high initial CA 19-9 level [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>], in our view, preoperative serum CA 19-9 levels should not be used to direct the initial treatment strategy. (See <a class="local">'Assessing resectability'</a> above.)</p><p>Our general approach to patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer is outlined in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91436" href="/z/d/graphic/91436.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), and the approach to patients with potentially resectable tumors is described in detail in the sections below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4231474225"><span class="h1">UPFRONT PANCREATECTOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary surgical resection is an appropriate option for patients with no distant metastatic disease, a performance status and comorbidity profile that are appropriate for major abdominal surgery, and no radiographic interface between the primary tumor and the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, or common hepatic artery. For those patients who have radiographic interface between the tumor and the mesenteric vasculature as well as those who have potentially resectable tumors, and a performance status or comorbidity profile that is not appropriate for a major abdominal operation but is potentially reversible, we suggest initial chemotherapy rather than upfront surgery. Surgery could then be reconsidered at a later time if appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>An overview of surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer is provided elsewhere.

Despite the better overall survival (OS) compared with ductal adenocarcinoma, we treat these patients the same as those with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, offering adjuvant chemotherapy to most patients with resected disease, with the possible exception of those with well-differentiated T1 tumors and negative resection margins, as they have a relatively favorable prognosis. (See <a class="local">'Choice of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>We would also consider these patients to be appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy, just as we do for those with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. (See <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>ACCs are rare malignant neoplasms that constitute approximately 1 percent of all malignant nonendocrine pancreatic tumors. Histologically, there is clear evidence of acinar cell differentiation, which can be identified immunohistochemically by staining for trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, or lipase; or can be ultrastructurally identified by the presence of zymogen granules, although variant histologic patterns reflect different degrees of differentiation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71854" href="/z/d/graphic/71854.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2510.html" rel="external">"Pathology of exocrine pancreatic neoplasms", section on 'Acinar cell carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>Some ACCs give rise to a clinical syndrome related to lipase hypersecretion with distant manifestations: subcutaneous fat necrosis (termed "pancreatic panniculitis"), eosinophilia, and polyarthralgia (the so-called "Schmidt's triad"). This syndrome is associated with poor prognosis [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7606.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous manifestations of internal malignancy"</a>.)</p><p>The available evidence suggests high recurrence rates, even after complete surgical resection [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. However, the overall prognosis for patients with ACC is better than that for patients with ductal adenocarcinoma [<a href="#rid12">12,15-17</a>]. Patients with ACC tend to present at a younger age than do those with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; they are more likely to have localized disease (15 versus 8 percent) and are more likely to undergo resection (39 versus 11 percent) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Five-year survival rates among patients with resected disease range from 44 to 72 percent [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>]; in one large series, the stage-stratified five-year survival rates for ACC versus pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were as follows [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage I – 52 versus 28 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage II – 40 versus 10 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage III – 23 versus 7 percent</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6493811"><span class="h3">Timing and duration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients who undergo initial resection without neoadjuvant therapy, including those with pathologic T1N0 disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111135" href="/z/d/graphic/111135.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), we recommend six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant treatment should be started within eight weeks of surgery, if possible, but it can be started beyond eight weeks if treatment is delayed by postoperative complications.
