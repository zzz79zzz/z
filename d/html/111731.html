         The use of radiation therapy (RT) has contributed to significant improvements in disease-specific survival for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and other malignancies involving the thoracic region. However, cancer survivors who were treated with RT, either alone or in combination with other modalities, are at risk for late complications from treatment. Late effects of RT include second cancers and cardiovascular effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of HL frequently includes supradiaphragmatic RT portals that include portions of the heart. HL survivors are at an increased risk for both early and late cardiovascular complications. Clinical manifestations of cardiotoxicity include acute or delayed pericardial disease, myocardial ischemia or infarction, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, valvular abnormalities, and conduction defects. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14232.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to the adult survivor of classic Hodgkin lymphoma", section on 'Cardiovascular disease'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of HL has evolved with the goal of decreasing the intensity of therapy without sacrificing long-term disease control. These efforts include modifications in RT techniques to reduce the volume and dose of incidental cardiac irradiation and the impact of RT when given with chemotherapy (ie, combined modality therapy). Contemporary techniques appear to have substantially decreased the incidence of delayed complications of RT, although the residual risk remains uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
         The incidence of cardiotoxicity and its clinical manifestations secondary to RT in patients with HL or pediatric malignancies are discussed in this topic.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pathophysiology of RT-induced cardiac injury and the role of RT-induced cardiotoxicity in other malignancies are discussed separately. (See

          INCIDENCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         A significant increase in the incidence of cardiovascular disease has been observed in multiple studies of long-term survivors of HL [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The cardiotoxic effects of RT in HL survivors were illustrated by a comprehensive analysis of 1474 patients who were treated between 1965 and 1995 according to European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) protocols [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The median age at the start of treatment was 26 years, and the median follow-up was 19 years. The initial treatment consisted of RT only in 28 percent of the patients, chemotherapy alone in 5 percent, and combined RT and chemotherapy in 67 percent. Overall, 84 percent of patients received RT to the mediastinum. The standardized incidence ratios for various complications were calculated compared with age- and sex-matched incidences in the general population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Key findings included the following:

         The most common cardiovascular diagnoses observed in HL survivors were valvular disorders, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction. The median time to diagnosis of these cardiac complications was approximately 19 years after treatment. The incidence of each of these complications was significantly elevated, with standardized incidence ratios between 3 and 5.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>

         Mediastinal irradiation significantly increased the risks of coronary heart disease, heart failure, and valvular disorders, in multivariate analysis. Use of anthracyclines further increased the risks of heart failure and valvular disorders associated with mediastinal irradiation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The increased risk of cardiovascular disease persisted for at least 25 years after the index HL treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a linear dose-response relationship for coronary heart disease, based on data from a nested case-control study of 2617 five-year survivors treated with mediastinal radiation between 1965 and 1995 in the Netherlands support [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The risk was related to both the volume of the heart irradiated and the dose received by the heart. Three hundred and twenty-five patients developed coronary heart disease manifested by myocardial infarction or angina requiring intervention. These patients were compared with 1204 matched controls. For patients receiving a mean heart dose of 20 Gy, there was a 2.5-fold increase in the risk of coronary heart disease compared with patients not treated with mediastinal RT. The excess relative risk seemed to decrease with increasing age, increased for patients with risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia), and decreased with high levels of physical activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         A study of 615 Canadian HL survivors treated between 1988 and 2000 has demonstrated that modern treatment methods continue to be associated with cardiac morbidity, even within 10 to 15 years after therapy. This study also suggested that the risk from combined modality therapy (mediastinal RT of 30 to 35 Gy and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/z/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">

         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) was greater than mediastinal RT alone, although the difference in risk between the two groups was not statistically significant due to small sample size [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The relative risk for cardiac disease is increased within the first few years after RT, and this risk appears to increase over time [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A large, survey-based study of patients treated for HL on nine collaborative EORTC-Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) trials (mean follow-up nine years after diagnosis) reported that the hazard ratio for cardiovascular events increased with the estimated mean cardiac doses in an approximately linear fashion, but the confidence intervals were large [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of cardiovascular complications following RT appears to be even greater when HL patients are treated during childhood. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations in pediatric patients'
         </a>
         below.)

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         The factors that influence the risk of cardiac damage in HL patients include the total dose and volume of RT, the dose per fraction, the specific RT technique, and the extent to which the coronary arteries are included in the RT field.
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of combined modality treatment that includes cardiotoxic chemotherapy, such as an anthracycline, appears to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, as illustrated by a study of 1474 HL survivors younger than 41 years at treatment and followed for a median of 19 years. Multivariate analysis showed that the combination of mediastinal RT plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy significantly increased the risk of both heart failure and valvular disorders (hazard ratio 2.8 and 2.1, respectively, compared with mediastinal RT alone) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The cumulative incidence of heart failure 25 years after combined RT and anthracycline treatment for HL was 7.9 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to treatment-related issues, patient-specific factors that are likely to influence the risk of developing coronary artery disease can be important. These include the patient age at the time of treatment and the presence of other known cardiac risk factors, such as smoking, high serum cholesterol, and hypertension.
        </p>
        <p>
         A limited number of exercise intervention studies in lymphoma survivors (HL and non-HL), both on and off active treatment, suggest that aerobic exercise is safe and can improve cardiac function and energy levels, at least in the short term. These included two randomized trials [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ] and one nonrandomized trial [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ] demonstrating increased maximum oxygen consumption and self-reported energy level in HL survivors with chronic fatigue. However, the sample size was too small to correlate these changes, and none of the three studies was limited to just patients who had or were receiving RT. (See

         Multiple studies have demonstrated that the risk of a fatal myocardial infarction in HL survivors is 2.2 to 7.6-fold greater than in the general population [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,7,12-16
         </a>
         ]. The increased risk of death from myocardial infarction was illustrated by an analysis of 7033 HL survivors treated between 1967 and 2000 [

         Patients with a history of cardiac irradiation can present with heart failure due to radiation-induced restrictive-, constrictive-, ischemic-, or valvular-cardiomyopathies. The physiologic correlate of this observation is that mediastinal RT appears to have a greater impact on diastolic, rather than systolic cardiac function [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. This is in contrast to the effects of anthracyclines, which predominantly cause systolic dysfunction. The prevalence of dysfunction varies depending upon RT technique and dose, concomitant use of anthracyclines, length of follow-up, and method of screening.

         ]. The average time from radiation treatment to assessment was 18 years. Exercise-induced ischemia was more common in patients with diastolic dysfunction (23 versus 11 percent in those with normal function). Patients with diastolic dysfunction had worse event-free survival than patients with normal function (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.06-2.4).

         Both cardiac irradiation and anthracycline-containing chemotherapy increase the incidence of symptomatic heart failure (HF) in survivors of HL. The rate of HF increases in association with anthracycline dose and increased mean left ventricular dose (MLVD) of radiation. (See

         Mediastinal RT has been associated with an increased risk of clinically significant valvular abnormalities particularly involving the aortic, mitral and tricuspid valves in 6 to 40 percent of HL survivors [

          19,21-24

         The risk of valvular heart disease and its relationship to dose of radiation is well illustrated by a case-control study nested within a cohort of 1852 five-year survivors of HL treated between 1965 and 1995 at three centers in the Netherlands [
         <a href="#rid24">

         The cumulative risk for valvular heart disease in the entire series was 8 percent at 30 years. The median interval between the diagnosis of HL and the diagnosis of valvular heart disease was 23 years. However, for patients treated with the doses of 20 to 30 Gy that are currently used, the 30-year risk is increased by only approximately 1.4 percent.

Severe disease was present in 24.5 and 3.4 percent of survivors in each group, respectively (p = 0.016). Aortic regurgitation was most prevalent, and irradiated patients had significantly more mild or more severe regurgitation compared with the unirradiated patients (38.2 versus 6.8 percent, p = 0.007).

         Radiation can cause fibrosis of the conduction pathways in the heart, potentially leading to life-threatening arrhythmias and/or conduction defects years after therapy for HL. Abnormalities observed after mediastinal RT include bradycardia, complete and lesser degrees of heart block, and sinus node dysfunction (ie, sick sinus syndrome) [

The most common findings were conduction delays in the right anterior bundle, which suggests that the anterior structures of the intracardiac conduction system are at greatest risk for fibrosis from mediastinal RT. In addition, 24-hour Holter monitoring suggested a high rate of autonomic dysfunction; 24 of 42 patients (57 percent) had a monotonous heart rate and/or loss of circadian variability, while 13 (31 percent) had sustained tachycardia over 24 hours (&gt;90 beats per minute). In this study, only four patients had received anthracyclines, and the average mediastinal radiation dose was 40 Gy.

         Cardiac and cardiovascular mortality are increased in survivors of pediatric cancer who received anthracycline therapy and/or radiation to the heart (even relatively low doses). However, reductions in exposure to cardiac radiation have been associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease among adult survivors of childhood cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Childhood Cancer Survivors Study (CCSS) included more than 23,000 five-year survivors of childhood cancer (age &lt;21 years at diagnosis of leukemia, brain cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, renal tumors, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcomas, and bone sarcomas) [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33-35
         </a>
         ]. Cardiac irradiation was associated with increased risk for heart failure, myocardial infarction, pericarditis, and valvular abnormalities. However, over successive decades, there were significant decreases in the 20-year cumulative incidence of heart failure (0.69 percent for those treated in the 1970s to 0.54 percent for treatment in the 1990s) and coronary artery disease (0.38 to 0.19 percent); rates of valvular disease, pericardial disease, and arrhythmias did not change. Compared with survivors who were not treated with RT to the heart, those who received 5 to 20 gray (Gy) to more than half of the heart had a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) relative risk (RR) for serious cardiac events; the RR was 2.4 (95% CI 1.4-4.2) for those who received high doses (&gt;20 Gy) to smaller volumes of the heart.

        <p>
         In a multicenter study of 4122 survivors &lt;15 years at diagnosis of a solid tumor (leukemia was excluded), cardiac deaths were related to radiation to cardiac irradiation and treatment with an anthracycline [

         We advocate a strategy of minimizing risk of harm, based on modifying both treatment- and patient-related risk factors whenever possible. For patients with favorable, early stage, mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma, omitting radiation therapy is sometimes an option to minimize the risk of delayed cardiotoxicity.

          Description
         </strong>
         – Patients who received radiation therapy (RT) as a component of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and other thoracic malignancies are at an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) diseases. While treatment has evolved to decrease the intensity of therapy without sacrificing long-term disease control, patients continue to experience acute and late adverse effects of RT.

          Incidence
         </strong>
         – The most common CV diagnoses in these cancer survivors are valvular disorders, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction. The relative risk for CV complications is increased three- to fivefold compared with the general population. The median time to diagnosis is nearly two decades after treatment, and elevated risk persists for at least 25 years. (See

          Risk factors

         – Risk for coronary artery disease and valvular disorders is related to aspects of treatment and patient-specific factors (eg, smoking, high serum cholesterol, hypertension). Treatment-related factors include RT technique, treatment volume, total dose and dose per fraction, and inclusion of coronary arteries in the treatment field; chemotherapy (eg, anthracycline dose); and combined modality therapy (chemotherapy plus RT).
