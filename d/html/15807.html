Patients with HIV are at high risk for acquiring HBV due to shared routes of transmission (eg, sexual transmission, injection drug use) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In addition, if acquired, individuals with HIV are less likely to develop a protective immune response with production of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) during acute infection. Thus, such patients are at increased risk of developing chronic infection, cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease compared with patients without HIV [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. </p><p>This topic will address how to prevent HBV infection in individuals with HIV. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and treatment of HBV in patients with HIV are discussed elsewhere.

Individuals should be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3741.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of adults with HIV", section on 'Screening for coinfections'</a>.)</p><p>The results of serologic testing are used to determine the need for vaccination and additional preventive interventions. As an example, patients who are negative for anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and HBsAg have no evidence of immunity and should be vaccinated. There may also be a role for vaccinating those who have isolated anti-HBc. (See <a class="local">'Whom to vaccinate'</a> below and <a class="local">'Patients with isolated anti-HB core antibody'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9249266"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF PREVENTION STRATEGIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with HIV who do not have evidence of immunity to HBV, there are several strategies to reduce to the risk of infection. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vaccination is the best way to prevent HBV infection. Patients with HIV should be vaccinated against HBV if they do not have evidence of protective immunity. Individuals are most likely to develop a protective serologic response if their CD4 count is ≥350 cells/microL and their HIV viral load is undetectable [<a href="#rid8">8-11</a>]. Serologic testing should be performed one to two months after vaccination to confirm that the patient is immune. Repeat vaccination may be needed for some individuals. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Additional prevention interventions may be needed during the course of vaccination and for those who do not respond to the vaccine. These include behavioral interventions to decrease high-risk behaviors and possibly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8520" href="/z/d/drug information/8520.html" rel="external">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> if an exposure occurs. Antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV (eg, tenofovir, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9544" href="/z/d/drug information/9544.html" rel="external">lamivudine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8594" href="/z/d/drug information/8594.html" rel="external">emtricitabine</a>) may also provide some protection against HBV infection, but they are not the preferred strategy to prevent HBV infection.</p><p></p><p>These strategies are reviewed in detail below.

They use an aluminum adjuvant and typically require three doses over a six-month period to provide protection. These vaccines used to contain very small amounts of thimerosal, but those formulations were discontinued. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In November 2017, a new recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (designated HepB-CpG; sold as Heplisav-B) received approval for use in adults 18 years of age and older [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. This vaccine consists of recombinant HBsAg with a novel immunostimulatory adjuvant [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].

HepB-CpG is not approved for use in children, pregnant persons, or patients on hemodialysis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In general, patients should complete the vaccine series using the same type of vaccine  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117603" href="/z/d/graphic/117603.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). If this is not feasible (eg, due to vaccine availability), vaccination should not be deferred. The approach to vaccination in this setting is presented elsewhere.

The dosing schedule varies with the type of vaccine.</p><p></p><p>A more detailed discussion on the different vaccine formulations is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3641.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus immunization in adults", section on 'Dose regimens'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3641.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus immunization in adults", section on 'Types of vaccines'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H589898416"><span class="h2">Whom to vaccinate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recommend hepatitis B vaccination for patients without evidence of prior HBV exposure (eg, negative for HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs], and hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc]) [<a href="#rid7">7,21</a>]. We also vaccinate certain patients who are only positive for anti-HBc (ie, negative for HBsAg and anti-HBs). (See <a class="local">'Patients with isolated anti-HB core antibody'</a> below.) </p><p>We administer the hepatitis B vaccine to patients, regardless of CD4 count. Although individuals are most likely to develop a protective serologic response with the conventional hepatitis B vaccines if their CD4 count is ≥350 cells/microL, some immunosuppressed individuals will still respond. It is particularly important that vaccination not be deferred in HBV-uninfected patients who are engaging in high-risk behaviors (eg, unprotected sex with a partner with chronic HBV infection, active injection drug use) or who have household members with chronic HBV. Repeat vaccination can be performed for individuals who do not develop protective immunity. (See <a class="local">'Response to vaccination'</a> below and <a class="local">'Assessing vaccine response'</a> below and <a class="local">'Anti-HBs &lt;10 milli-international units/mL after initial series'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients will have anti-HBs levels &lt;10 milli-international units/mL after receiving their initial hepatitis B vaccine series. Such individuals should be revaccinated. The management of patients who do not respond to their initial vaccine series is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Anti-HBs &lt;10 milli-international units/mL after initial series'</a> below.) </p><p>It is important to vaccinate patients with HIV against HBV, since such patients are at increased risk of developing chronic infection. Persons with HIV who develop chronic HBV are at a higher risk of subsequently developing cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease compared with patients without HIV. The efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination in preventing HBV in adults was established in the early 1980s using an inactivated plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine. In a randomized study of 1083 men who have sex with men who were at high risk for HBV infection, the incidence of hepatitis B was reduced more than 90 percent [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In addition, subsequent population-based studies have shown a marked reduction in the incidence of HBV in vaccinated populations [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination has been found to correlate with an anti-HBs titer of &gt;10 milli-international units/mL, and vaccine-induced seroprotection is considered a surrogate for clinical protection [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Thus, most of the studies evaluating the efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination in patients with HIV have assessed the serologic response. (See <a class="local">'Likelihood of response'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H608784670"><span class="h2">Vaccine strategies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conventional hepatitis B vaccines (eg, Engerix-B or Recombivax HB) using standard doses and vaccine schedules are used in many patients with HIV. However, the initial immune response to conventional hepatitis B vaccines can be lower in individuals with HIV compared with those who are HIV uninfected. (See <a class="local">'Likelihood of response'</a> below.)</p><p>Certain strategies may help improve the likelihood of responding to vaccination. As an example, hepatitis B vaccine should ideally be administered <strong>before</strong> the CD4 count declines to &lt;350 cells/microL to improve immunogenicity, although we do not defer vaccination if the CD4 count is less than this. (See <a class="local">'Whom to vaccinate'</a> above.)</p><p>Other strategies include increasing the dose of the vaccine and using formulations with novel adjuvants.</p><p>All patients with HIV should be tested for anti-HBs one to two months after completing the vaccine series to make sure they develop a protective immune response. Those who do <strong>not</strong> develop protective immunity will require additional doses to achieve an adequate serologic response. (See <a class="local">'Assessing vaccine response'</a> below and <a class="local">'Anti-HBs &lt;10 milli-international units/mL after initial series'</a> below and <a class="local">'Waning immunity'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2091738999"><span class="h3">Approach for most patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our general approach to hepatitis B vaccination for patients with HIV is reviewed here, and depends in part upon the availability of the different vaccine formulations. Additional considerations for those with ongoing risk for HBV, those who are anti-HBc positive, and pregnant persons are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Patients with ongoing risk for acquiring HBV'</a> below and <a class="local">'Patients with isolated anti-HB core antibody'</a> below and <a class="local">'Pregnant persons'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preferred approach</strong> – For most patients, we suggest hepatitis B vaccination using <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8521" href="/z/d/drug information/8521.html" rel="external">conventional recombinant hepatitis B vaccines</a> (eg, Engerix-B or Recombivax HB) rather than HepB-CpG (Heplisav-B), a vaccine that uses a novel immunostimulatory adjuvant (see <a class="local">'Vaccine formulations'</a> above). Although HepB-CpG is more immunogenic in healthy adults than conventional vaccines, data are limited in persons with HIV, and the optimal dosing schedule has not been determined. By contrast, there is extensive experience with conventional vaccines demonstrating safety, and more than half of individuals with a CD4 count &gt;500 cells/microL will respond to the initial vaccine series. (See <a class="local">'Likelihood of response'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The hepatitis B vaccine series using conventional hepatitis B vaccines consists of three doses, administered intramuscularly at zero, one, and six months. Although some studies have evaluated a four-dose series, there is insufficient evidence to suggest this regimen over the standard three-dose regimen [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When using the conventional hepatitis B vaccine, we suggest starting with a double dose of the vaccine (eg, Engerix-B vaccine at 40 rather than 20 mcg/mL). In a meta-analysis of 10 studies, the double dose had better response rates in patients with HIV compared with the standard dose at four to six weeks (odds ratio [OR] 1.76, 95 % CI 1.36-2.29) and at &gt;12 months (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.73-3.01) after vaccine completion [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, the standard dose of vaccine continues to be used in many settings. When this occurs, the higher dose can be used if the patient did not respond to the initial vaccine series. (See <a class="local">'Anti-HBs &lt;10 milli-international units/mL after initial series'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alternative approach</strong> – HepB-CpG is a reasonable alternative when the vaccine formulation is dictated by availability. However, HepB-CpG is not approved for use in children, pregnant persons, or patients on hemodialysis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The HepB-CpG vaccine series is administered as two doses separated by at least four weeks. The dose is the same, regardless of HIV status. In one retrospective study of 64 persons with HIV who received Heplisav-B, the seroprotective rate was 79 percent among HBV vaccine-naïve patients [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. A detailed discussion of the efficacy and safety of HepB-CpG in healthy adults is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3641.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus immunization in adults", section on 'Yeast-derived'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3641.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus immunization in adults", section on 'Adverse reactions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ideally, the vaccine series should be completed using the same formulation for all doses. However, if this is not feasible (eg, due to vaccine availability), vaccination should not be deferred. The single-antigen vaccines can be used interchangeably, except that a two-dose vaccine series should only be used when both doses consist of HepB-CpG [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Vaccine series that consist of a combination of a dose of HepB-CpG and a dose of another HBV vaccine should consist of three total vaccine doses: the interval between dose 1 and dose 2 should be at least 4 weeks; the interval between dose 2 and dose 3 should be at least 8 weeks; and the interval between dose 1 to dose 3 should be at least 16 weeks.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2514711503"><span class="h3">Patients with ongoing risk for acquiring HBV</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with ongoing risk for HBV infection (eg, injection drug users, those with sexual partners who have chronic HBV) we initiate a three-dose series using a double dose of the conventional hepatitis B vaccine, as described above. (See <a class="local">'Approach for most patients'</a> above.)</p><p>However, the two-dose series using HepB-CpG may be preferred for those with ongoing risk if there is concern that the patient is unlikely to complete a three dose series at 0, 1, and 6 months using the conventional recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. Several studies have described low completion rates among those who initiate the hepatitis B vaccine series [<a href="#rid1">1,26</a>]. </p><p>An accelerated dosing schedule of conventional hepatitis B vaccine (eg, Engerix-B or Recombivax HB), using standard doses at zero, one, and three weeks, has also been evaluated but may not be as effective, especially for patients with CD4 count counts &lt;500 cells/microL [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. In a study that evaluated this accelerated HBV immunization schedule in 761 patients with HIV with a range of CD4 counts (&lt;200 cells/microL, 200 to 500 cells/microL, and &gt;500 cells/microL) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>], adherence was better in the accelerated-vaccination arm, but overall seroconversion rates were lower in the group that received the accelerated series compared with those who received the standard dosing regimen (39 versus 50 percent). The response varied significantly by CD4 count, and the accelerated schedule was inferior in all patients, except those with a CD4 count &gt;500 cells/microL.

(See <a class="local">'Vaccine formulations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>When both vaccines are available, we suggest using the three dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8521" href="/z/d/drug information/8521.html" rel="external">conventional recombinant hepatitis B vaccines</a> rather than HepB-CpG for most patients (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). There is extensive experience with conventional vaccines in persons with HIV, and although the serologic response is lower compared to those without HIV, many individuals will respond. (See <a class="local">'Approach for most patients'</a> above and <a class="local">'Likelihood of response'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">To increase the immunogenicity of conventional hepatitis B vaccines, we suggest using a double dose rather than the standard dose of the vaccine (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). In addition, the vaccine should ideally be administered <strong>before</strong> the CD4 count declines to &lt;350 cells/microL, although we do not defer vaccination if the CD4 count is less than this. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>HepB-CpG is a reasonable alternative when the vaccine formulation is dictated by availability. In addition, it may be preferred for patients who are at high risk for acquiring HBV and those who are unlikely to complete the conventional hepatitis B vaccine series. Only two doses of HepB-CpG are required to complete the series, and in persons without HIV, it appears to be more immunogenic. However, HepB-CpG is <strong>not</strong> approved for use in children, pregnant persons, or patients on hemodialysis. (See <a class="local">'Approach for most patients'</a> above and <a class="local">'Patients with ongoing risk for acquiring HBV'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessing response to vaccination</strong> – Patients should have serologic testing (ie, anti-HBs) one to two months after they complete their vaccine series to confirm the presence of a protective serologic response (anti-HBs ≥10 milli-international units/mL). For patients who develop a protective immune response and have potential ongoing HBV exposures, we perform follow-up anti-HBs testing yearly, since declining antibody titers can be seen in individuals with HIV. (See <a class="local">'Assessing vaccine response'</a> above and <a class="local">'Anti-HBs ≥10 milli-international units/mL'</a> above and <a class="local">'Waning immunity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to nonresponders</strong> – Patients who do <strong>not</strong> develop an anti-HBs ≥10 milli-international units/mL after the initial vaccine series should receive a second vaccine series. The conventional recombinant hepatitis B vaccine or HepB-CpG can be used. If the conventional vaccine is administered, we suggest using a double dose (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Anti-HBs &lt;10 milli-international units/mL after initial series'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients who have an anti-HBs &lt;10 milli-international units/mL after receiving two complete vaccine series are considered nonresponders. For such patients, we suggest <strong>not</strong> giving additional doses of HBV vaccine (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, these patients remain at risk for HBV infection, and additional prevention strategies are needed. (See <a class="local">'Anti-HBs &lt;10 milli-international units/mL after repeat vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional prevention strategies </strong>– Additional prevention interventions are needed during the course of vaccination and for those who do not respond to the vaccine. These include behavioral interventions to decrease high-risk behaviors and possibly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8520" href="/z/d/drug information/8520.html" rel="external">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> if an exposure occurs. Antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV (eg, tenofovir-emtricitabine) also provide some protection against HBV infection. (See <a class="local">'Overview of prevention strategies'</a> above and <a class="local">'Avoiding HBV exposure'</a> above and <a class="local">'Postexposure prophylaxis'</a> above and <a class="local">'The role of antiretroviral therapy'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Kellerman SE, Hanson DL, McNaghten AD, Fleming PL.
