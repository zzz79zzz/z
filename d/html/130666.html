         Levo- or L-looped transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA) is a rare form of congenital heart disease characterized by atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial discordance (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83845" href="/z/d/graphic/83845.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). It is also commonly referred to as congenitally corrected TGA, double discordance, or ventricular inversion.
        </p>
        <p>
         L-TGA usually does not present with cyanosis unless there are associated cardiac defects. Isolated L-TGA is "physiologically corrected" because systemic deoxygenated venous blood returns to the pulmonary circulation and oxygenated pulmonary venous blood returns to the systemic circulation. Patients with L-TGA are at increased risk for heart failure as adults due to progressive decline in systemic right ventricular (RV) function.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management and outcome of L-TGA will be presented here. The anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of L-TGA are discussed separately. (See

         There has been a paradigm shift from "physiologic" repair of the associated cardiac lesions while maintaining the congenitally corrected atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial discordance to an "anatomic" repair, which makes the morphologic left ventricle (LV) become the systemic pump and the morphologic right ventricle (RV) the pulmonary ventricle. Anatomic repair involves more complex surgical interventions and may require LV retraining. These two approaches (physiologic and anatomic repair), including their associated complications and outcomes, are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Physiologic repair'
         </a>
         below and

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal surgical approach for patients with L-TGA is uncertain as there are limited data to inform decision-making. The rationale for anatomic repair is based upon the theory that functional status in adulthood may be improved with this approach. As long-term data on outcomes after anatomic repair become available, there will be a better understanding of whether this approach does in fact improve long-term prognosis, particularly regarding quality of life, functional status, and other morbidities that can result from atrial and arterial switches (tachyarrhythmias, AV block, baffle obstructions, neo-aortic regurgitation, and LV dysfunction).

         Decisions regarding the choice of surgical repair in patients with L-TGA are individualized based on the patient's age, anatomy, and degree of symptoms. Our general approach is as follows:

          Pediatric patients
         </strong>
         – The management approach in children depends upon whether L-TGA is associated with lesions that predispose to systemic heart failure (eg, clinically significant ventricular septal defect [VSD], LV outflow tract [LVOT] obstruction, and/or Ebstein-like malformation of the tricuspid valve):

          Patients with lesions predisposing to systemic heart failure
         </strong>
         – For pediatric patients with L-TGA associated with lesions that predispose to systemic heart failure (eg, clinically significant VSD, LVOT obstruction, and/or Ebstein-like malformation of the tricuspid valve), we suggest anatomic repair. These patients are at greatest risk for developing systemic heart failure with physiologic repair.

         If a patient requires LV retraining with pulmonary artery (PA) band placement, this should be performed early in childhood. (See

          Patients without lesions predisposing to systemic heart failure
         </strong>
         – In pediatric patients without associated lesions that predispose to systemic heart failure, the choice of anatomic repair versus medical management is controversial. The surgical procedures are complex, require substantial time on cardiopulmonary bypass, and incur risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality, while their long-term outcome remains uncertain. However, there are also risks associated with foregoing surgical anatomic correction. Adults with isolated L-TGA who have not undergone anatomic repair are at risk for systemic heart failure, though the risk is lower in this population compared with patients who have additional associated lesions that increase the work of the systemic RV. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83229.html" rel="external">
          "L-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Isolated L-transposition of the great arteries'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Based on the available data, our approach is to discuss with the family the potential benefits and complications of the proposed surgical procedures and the areas of uncertainty. The final decision is individualized based on our overall assessment of the patient's potential for heart failure without anatomic correction versus the potential complications of the anatomic repair, as well as the preference of the family.

         <strong>
          Adult patients
         </strong>
         – Patients who are diagnosed with L-TGA in adulthood usually present with heart failure, systemic tricuspid valve regurgitation, or arrhythmias. Patients with systemic tricuspid regurgitation should be referred for systemic AV valve repair before they develop morphologic RV failure or progressive dysfunction (systemic RV ejection fraction less than 40 percent). PA banding has been found to improve systemic AV valve regurgitation in select patients. Cardiac transplantation or ventricular assist device placement should be considered in patients with persistent heart failure refractory to these surgical options and standard medical management.

         The presence of associated lesions remains the major determinant regarding surgical repair of L-TGA. The poor late outcome associated with conventional repair has led to an alternative approach of anatomic correction to make the morphologic LV the systemic pump and the morphologic RV the pulmonary ventricle. This generally requires equally sized ventricles and a morphologic LV that is prepared (ie, sufficiently hypertrophied or "trained") to take over the workload of the systemic ventricle, thereby minimizing the likelihood of postoperative LV failure.

          Determine need for PA banding
         </strong>
         – In patients in whom the LV is not initially ready to become the systemic ventricle, PA banding is used to "train" the LV. (See

         PA banding is often not required in infants who have significant pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, or an unrestrictive VSD. In these patients, the LV is already functioning at pressure levels consistent with what will be required as the systemic ventricle.

          Selection of a definitive surgical intervention

         Senning-Rastelli (SR) procedure is performed in patients with a large VSD and LVOT obstruction. It involves creating an intra-atrial baffle (Senning tunnel), closing the VSD with a baffle that directs blood flow from the LV into the aorta, and placing a conduit between the RV and PA (Rastelli procedure).

         <strong>
          LV "training"
         </strong>
         – In L-TGA patients with an LV that is not ready to function as the systemic ventricle, placement of a band on the PA is used to increase the afterload of the morphologic LV. This exposure to near-systemic pressure increases the LV posterior wall thickness (ie, LV "training") [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Altering the LV and RV pressure ratio may also reduce the RV sphericity and improve the geometry of the RV prior to anatomic correction [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Several case series have shown that PA banding stabilizes systemic AV valve regurgitation and improves systemic ventricular function [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. Typically, PA banding appears to be more successful in younger patients, and the younger the patient, the shorter interval required for training [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,7
         </a>
         ]. Patients older than 16 years of age appear to be unlikely to achieve sufficient LV function to proceed to anatomic correction [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although pediatric cardiac surgical centers use varying measurements to determine if a morphologic LV is adequately prepared for the systemic circulation, most published reports suggest that a morphologic LV pressure of 66 to 90 percent of systemic pressure is sufficient [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Serial echocardiograms and cardiac catheterizations are recommended to determine that sufficient LV pressure is obtained prior to surgical correction. In addition, others recommend that normal LV mass and thickness for systemic function using echocardiography and/or magnetic resonance imaging be required prior to anatomic correction [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Repeat banding is often required when the PA band has become too "loose" and the goals for LV pressure have not been met. Risk factors for failure of PA band retraining include mild LV dysfunction before banding, development of significant LV dilation and dysfunction, and postoperative development of tricuspid regurgitation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         The reported median time from PA banding to the DS procedure ranges from 2 to 14.5 months [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,7,9-11
         </a>
         ]. One center reported LV training using a more stringent threshold of 90 percent systemic pressure for the LV and typically preparing the ventricle for 9 to 12 months. Of their 26 patients with L-TGA, 92 percent met this threshold of successful LV retraining. Of the 19 patients who underwent a DS procedure in this cohort, survival was 100 percent at a mean follow-up of five years.

          Reducing pulmonary blood flow in patients with large VSDs
         </strong>
         – In infants with a large unrestrictive VSD, an increase in pulmonary blood flow may result in heart failure in the first few weeks of life as the pulmonary vascular resistance falls. The placement of a PA band can be considered in patients who are refractory to medical management. Creating increased resistance to the pulmonary circuit will reduce pulmonary blood flow, improve the symptoms of heart failure, and promote weight gain. Promotion of growth is desired since anatomic surgical correction is easier to perform in a larger infant. (See

         The DS operation consists of an atrial switch procedure that creates an intra-atrial baffle (Mustard or Senning procedure) and an arterial switch operation (ASO). The intra-atrial baffle diverts the deoxygenated systemic venous return into the subpulmonary ventricle and oxygenated pulmonary venous return to the subsystemic ventricle. The ASO involves transection of both great arteries and then translocation of the vessels to the opposite root, similar to the ASO procedure performed for D-TGA requiring coronary artery transfer.
        </p>

         After a DS procedure, normal concordance is established with systemic deoxygenated blood baffled across the tricuspid valve into the morphologic RV and flow into the PA. In addition, the oxygenated pulmonary venous return is baffled from the left atrium across the mitral valve into the morphologic LV and then pumped across the neo-aorta to the systemic circulation.

         This operation is a technically difficult and challenging procedure with a long cardiopulmonary bypass time. Therefore, identifying the ideal surgical timing is a complex issue.

         In patients with L-TGA that have a VSD and LVOT obstruction, the SR procedure is typically used. In this intervention, the intra-atrial baffle (Senning tunnel) is created and the VSD is closed by a baffle so that the blood from the LV is directed into the aorta and a conduit is placed between the RV and PA (Rastelli procedure). The Rastelli procedure requires a sizable and appropriately located VSD so that the baffle can be placed to redirect blood flow into the aorta. The intermediate-term results show improved survival of this group compared with the patients undergoing a DS operation [

         In physiologic repair (also referred to as "conventional repair"), the congenitally corrected AV and ventriculoarterial discordance are maintained (ie, the morphologic RV remains the systemic ventricle). Surgical interventions focus on repairing the associated lesions present with L-TGA. As examples, a patient with a VSD would undergo VSD closure and a patient with LVOT obstruction would undergo surgical placement of an LV-to-PA conduit. Some affected patients may not undergo any surgical procedure initially if there are no associated lesions that require intervention. On the other end of the spectrum, patients with complex straddling of AV valves across the ventricular septum or ventricular hypoplasia might undergo single-ventricle palliation.
        </p>
        <p>
         the physiologic approach to repair is associated with increased risk of systemic ventricular (RV) failure and tricuspid valve (systemic AV valve) regurgitation in adulthood. Surgical tricuspid valve replacement may be required in patients who develop significant tricuspid regurgitation. In a case series of 44 adults with isolated L-TGA who were not operated on in childhood and who were followed for a mean 12 years, 68 percent required tricuspid valve replacement after developing moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and ventricular dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Four patients required cardiac transplantation. Preoperative systemic ventricular dysfunction (ie, ejection fraction [EF] &lt;40 percent) predicted poor outcome (death or cardiac transplantation) [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on these findings, patients with L-TGA who do not undergo anatomic correction should have close monitoring of systemic ventricular function (morphologic RV) and tricuspid valvar function. Surgical interventions in these patients may include:

         The complications associated with anatomic correction in patients with L-TGA are primarily due to conduction abnormalities (ie, complete heart block and arrhythmias), left ventricle (LV) dysfunction, and neo-aortic regurgitation. In addition, some of the baffle-associated complications seen in patients with dextro-TGA (D-TGA) who undergo arterial switch operation (ASO) repair may also occur in patients with L-TGA who undergo DS operation.

         Complete heart block and tachyarrhythmias occur in patients with L-TGA due to the abnormal configuration of conduction tissue. In addition, new-onset complete heart block and atrial arrhythmias are common complications postoperatively [

         Because the central tenet of anatomic repair is based on the assumption that long-term outcome would be improved with reestablishment of atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial concordance compared with conventional repair, it is important to determine the long-term incidence and severity of morphologic LV function.
        </p>
        <p>
         Morphologic LV dysfunction occurs in approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients after anatomic repair [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,8,12,15,26
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         In one case series, 16 of the 113 patients (14 percent) developed LV dysfunction postoperatively, all of whom were in the DS group [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Of these 16 patients, five were deemed high risk because they had heart failure prior to surgical intervention. Seven of the remaining 11 patients had pulmonary artery (PA) banding for LV training. There was no association between LV dysfunction and mild and moderate neo-aortic insufficiency, which was a common postoperative finding in patients who underwent DS operation. Another case series of 25 patients reported that PA banding before two years of age was associated with a lower risk of subsequent LV dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In another case series of 106 patients managed at the authors' institution with a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, LV function was normal in 70 percent, mildly depressed in 18 percent, and moderately or severely depressed in 12 percent [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Risk factors for LV dysfunction included older age at repair, neo-aortic regurgitation, and pacemaker dependence. All 12 patients with moderate to severe LV dysfunction were pacemaker dependent from high-grade or complete heart block. This experience has led the authors' group to place biventricular pacing systems (ie, cardiac resynchronization therapy) to reduce the short-term development of LV dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid15">

         Further data are necessary to ascertain the long-term LV function after anatomic correction. Determining and correcting the factors that predict poor LV function may improve long-term outcome. In addition, these data may be useful in guiding new surgical innovations for at-risk patients.

         Longitudinal follow-up care is required in all patients with L-TGA by a cardiologist with expertise in congenital heart disease. Clinicians need to know the potential complications following the various surgical repairs and in unoperated patients. Follow-up routine care includes focused history, physical examination, and detailed imaging study by echocardiography and/or magnetic resonance imaging.

         Routine testing includes electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography.
        </p>
        <p>
         ECG is performed yearly to detect and diagnose arrhythmias. ECG is essential to look for complete heart block since there is a 2 percent increased annual risk for the development of complete heart block [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

         ]. Holter or event recorder monitoring may be useful in patients with a history suggestive of arrhythmia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Routine echocardiography is used to assess ventricular function, detect PA stenosis, and evaluate competency of the neo-aortic valve. Evaluation of the systemic and pulmonary venous baffles can also be performed with echocardiography.
        </p>
        <p>
         If there are historical features suggestive of ischemia or signs of unexplained depressed ventricular function on echocardiography, coronary artery insufficiency must be considered. Angiography remains the preferred modality to diagnose coronary artery occlusions in patients who undergo the arterial switch operation (ASO).
        </p>
        <p>
         Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent tool to quantify ventricular function. It should be used when evaluating adults who have not undergone repair and can be used to accurately assess left ventricular (LV) thickness and function in those patients who have undergone PA banding. This diagnostic modality is also helpful in identifying fibrosis and scar formation.

         – Levo- or left-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA; also referred to as congenitally corrected TGA, double discordance, or ventricular inversion) is a rare and complex form of congenital heart disease characterized by atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial discordance (

          Surgical management
         </strong>
         – Surgical management of L-TGA in children has shifted from "physiologic" repair (ie, repair of the associated lesions without addressing the AV and ventriculoarterial discordance) to "anatomic" repair, which makes the morphologic left ventricle (LV) the systemic pump and the morphologic right ventricle (RV) the pulmonary ventricle. Physiologic repair is associated with poor long-term outcome due to subsequent RV failure. The rational for anatomic repair is that long-term outcome may be improved by having the morphologic LV serve as the systemic ventricle. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Surgical management'

         For pediatric patients with L-TGA associated with lesions that predispose to systemic heart failure (eg, clinically significant ventricular septal defect [VSD], LV outflow tract [LVOT] obstruction, and/or Ebstein-like malformation of the tricuspid valve), we suggest anatomic repair (

         </span>
         In patients with isolated L-TGA, anatomic repair is controversial and the choice of anatomic repair versus medical management is individualized based on a patient-specific assessment of potential risks and benefits as well as the preference of the family. (See
         <a class="local">

         </span>
         The two procedures for anatomic repair are the double switch (DS) operation and the Senning-Rastelli (SR) procedure. The choice between the two is dependent on the presence of a large VSD and subpulmonary obstruction. (See
         <a class="local">

          Surgical morbidity

In addition, baffle-associated complications may also occur in patients who undergo a DS operation. Surgical reintervention is common in patients who undergo either a DS operation or an SR procedure.
