         Numerous cardiac disorders can lead to a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without heart failure (HF) symptoms, which is referred to as asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction (ALVSD). The finding of ALVSD requires further evaluation to identify its cause and may require treatment.

        <p>
         The epidemiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of ALVSD will be reviewed here.

        <p>
         The management of ALVSD is presented separately. (See

         ALVSD is defined as the presence of an LVEF &lt;55 percent in the absence of HF symptoms. ALVSD is synonymous with the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association’s Stage B HF (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120580" href="/z/d/graphic/120580.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of ALVSD is dependent on the LVEF; we do not recommend using other measures of systolic function (eg, qualitative LVEF, global longitudinal strain, fractional shortening) to establish the diagnosis of ALVSD, though these measures can be used to corroborate the finding of a low EF.

         The prevalence of ALVSD is between 1 to 8 percent but varies with the method used to define LV systolic dysfunction (eg, echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance [CMR] imaging), the choice of LVEF used to define LV systolic dysfunction, and the population under study, as follows:

         </strong>
         adults with either echocardiography or natriuretic peptide testing. Screening for ALVSD has not been shown to be effective in the general population, which is likely a result of the relatively low prevalence of ALVSD, the inability of less expensive tests (ie, serum B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]) to accurately identify patients with ALVSD, and the unclear benefit of early treatment of ALVSD [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. While therapy for patients with an LVEF is ≤40 percent is effective, patients with an LVEF in this range are rarely detected by screening. (See

        <p>
         Of the two proposed methods for population screening, BNP screening has been studied more extensively than echocardiography, which is likely due to the prohibitively high cost of echocardiography as a screening test. In general, BNP has a sensitivity &lt;70 percent, which is unacceptably low for population screening. The studies of BNP screening include:

         A prospective cohort study from the Framingham Heart Study included 3177 asymptomatic participants (mean age 58) of whom 5.6 percent had LV systolic dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         Suboptimal performance of natriuretic peptide screening was also noted in a community-based study of 2042 randomly selected residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. This sample of asymptomatic patients was screened with plasma BNP measurements and echocardiography, and 1 percent had an LVEF ≤40 percent. The ability of plasma BNP to detect or exclude the presence of LV systolic dysfunction was low (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve 0.51). The authors concluded that BNP screening would lead to nondiagnostic echocardiography in 10 to 40 percent of the screened population and would miss 10 to 60 percent of patients with ALVSD.

         Similar to BNP, screening with plasma N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) to detect individuals with ALVSD has not proven effective [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-16
         </a>
         ]. Screening with NT-proBNP typically has a negative predictive value ≥99 percent but the positive predictive value (eg, 1 to 26 percent) and sensitivity (33 to 80 percent) are too low for screening in the general population.

         In patients who do not have HF symptoms or signs of cardiac disease but who have advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, or peripheral vascular disease, we do not routinely screen for ALVSD.

         Patients with evidence of LV systolic dysfunction should be reevaluated for exertional and rest symptoms to be certain that symptoms are truly absent; the management of patients with symptomatic HF, especially those with an LVEF &lt;40 percent, is markedly different than the management of asymptomatic patients.

        </p>
        <p>
         In patients where management would change based on the presence or absence of HF symptoms (eg, defibrillator placement) and the subjective history is inconclusive, we recommend a treadmill exercise test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to determine whether a cardiac limitation to exercise is present. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         While patient-reported symptoms are required to assign an appropriate New York Heart Association class and choose therapy, there is evidence to suggest that some patients with apparent ALVSD have decreased exercise capacity. In a single-center study, patients with ALVSD and patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) underwent CPET testing at the discretion of the referring clinician [

         – Asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction ALVSD is defined as the presence of an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;55 percent in the absence of heart failure (HF) symptoms. ALVSD is synonymous with the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association’s Stage B HF (

          Review of echocardiography

         – For patients who already have an echocardiogram or other imaging study showing an LVEF &lt;55 percent, the images should be evaluated to confirm that the measurement of low LVEF is accurate.

         – The evaluation of LV systolic dysfunction in asymptomatic patients is similar to the evaluation of patients with symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). (See
