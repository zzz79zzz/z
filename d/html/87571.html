         Oppositional defiant disorder and/or conduct disorder (ODD/CD) are syndromes defined by patterns of behaviors that lead to conflict with adults and/or peers and are associated with impairment in home, school, and/or community settings [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Although both ODD/CD can be diagnosed in adults, symptoms typically begin during childhood or adolescence.
        </p>
        <p>
         The symptoms of ODD include chronic irritability (eg, low frustration tolerance, frequent temper outbursts) and behavior problems (eg, persistent defiance and obstinance beyond what it is expected for the developmental age of the individual). Symptoms of ODD typically first appear during the preschool and childhood years and may precede the development of CD [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The symptoms of CD include severe chronic behavior problems including insensitivity to other people’s needs or feelings. Typical behaviors associated with CD include serious rule violations and infringing on the rights of others (eg, theft, truancy, physical fights). Symptoms of CD most often begin during adolescence and may precede a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder in adulthood [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. More serious symptoms often appear between middle childhood and middle adolescence. Adolescents with severe CD often encounter the juvenile justice system and might receive treatment during and/or following a stay at a residential treatment facility or juvenile detention center.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment for ODD/CD as well as subthreshold symptoms of the disorders that cause psychosocial disruption in childhood or adolescence are reviewed here and in algorithms  (

         We prefer to treat all children or adolescents that present with or are referred for behavior or conduct problems that cause psychosocial or academic distress or impairment. We do this whether they meet full criteria for either disorder. Treatment outcome trials often include participants who meet diagnostic criteria for either disorder or have subthreshold symptoms.

         </span>
         We work closely with the patient, referral source, and family to individualize treatment goals. The overarching goal for treatment of children and adolescents with diagnosed or subsyndromal oppositional defiant disorder and/or conduct disorder (ODD/CD) is to help develop alternative, more adaptive behaviors to cope with stressors or stressful situations, increase frustration tolerance, or decrease severity of temper outbursts.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the treatment of ODD or its symptoms, we focus on diminishing a persistent and sometimes severe irritable mood.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the treatment of CD or its symptoms, we focus on diminishing maladaptive behaviors and developing empathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         We address comorbid disorders such as mood disorders or substance use disorders concurrently. Lack of identification or treatment of comorbid disorders may interfere with the treatment of ODD/CD or their symptoms or worsen their prognosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Children or adolescents with either of these disorders may not be seeking treatment. In many cases, they are referred by schools, teachers, social services, or the court system.

         We maintain and enhance our therapeutic alliance through continuous support of the individual and family, offering easy availability of services especially during periods of crisis, education about symptoms and symptom management, nonjudgmental listening, medication when needed, and referral to outside community support as appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         As improvements may be difficult to measure and may not be seen for several weeks or longer maintaining a strong alliance may encourage adherence to treatment. Poor alliance with the patient and family often leads to early termination. (See

         Our preference is to treat most children or adolescents with symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder and/or conduct disorder (ODD/CD) with an evidence-based psychosocial intervention as first-line treatment  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Psychosocial interventions for ODD/CD are routinely delivered in both individual, family, and group formats and in a wide variety of settings including traditional outpatient clinics, homes, schools, and primary care settings. Data from research indicate that evidence-based psychosocial interventions are at least modestly effective for children with disruptive behavioral problems regardless of treatment modality and setting [

        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, a meta-analysis of 158 studies investigating psychosocial treatments to reduce conduct problems in children and adolescents reported an overall effect size (standardized mean difference at posttreatment = 0.46) between treatment and control conditions [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>

         In a review of 13 trials including 1078 participants of group parenting programs for conduct problems in children (age 3 to 12), reductions in child behavior problems were reported by parents (standardized mean difference -0.53, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.34) or independent assessment (standardized mean difference -0.44, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.11) for those subjects in the intervention group as compared with control condition including waitlist, treatment as usual, and no treatment [

          8

         ]. Greater improvement in child disruptive behavior was reported at treatment end (standardized mean difference -0.43, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.06) in parent training group as compared with the waitlist condition. Additional improvements in other measures such as negative parenting and negative parent-child interactions were reported.

         Concerns have been raised over possible iatrogenic effects of group interventions for adolescents with delinquent behaviors. The perspective is that delinquent youth might learn from and/or reinforce one another’s delinquent behaviors through a process termed “deviancy training” [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. However, the empirical evidence for such iatrogenic affects is weak and inconsistent. In a systematic review, only 1 of 18 meta-analytics tests supported the presence of iatrogenic effects [

         We do not routinely treat individuals with ODD/CD in residential treatment facilities as a first-line treatment. Treatment in a residential facility requires separating the child from their family and is extremely costly. We consider residential care to be a treatment of last resort when therapeutic services cannot be provided in a family/outpatient environment. This recommendation is consistent with a 2014 consensus statement by the American Orthopsychiatric Association [

         Our preference the specific first-line psychosocial intervention depends on the age of the child and the symptoms to be addressed. Effective treatments are typically skills-focused and usually involve the participation of both the child and parent.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         These treatments have overlap in content and technique and can be categorized into behavioral parent management training (for parents), cognitive-behavioral skills (for children) and systemic family therapy. (See

         Behavioral parent management training is a broad category of treatment that involves teaching parents skills and techniques such as labeled praise, positive attention, tangible rewards, effective commands, response cost, time-outs, problem-solving, loss of privileges, consequences, and reward systems. This treatment has the most evidence for efficacy compared with other psychosocial interventions for ODD/CD and subthreshold disruptive behavior problems, particularly in younger children (preschool and school-age children) [

         Cognitive-behavioral skills training for youths involves teaching a variety of cognitive and/or behavioral skills to children and adolescents (often in groups) with conduct problems. These skills training programs focus on one or more skill deficits that are believed to be contributing to the pathogenesis and maintenance of the conduct problems. Skill deficits that are frequently targeted include social skills, anger coping skills, and problem-solving skills. Cognitive-behavioral skills training for youth has been studied as part of multicomponent treatment only. Our recommendation is based on clinical experience.

          Multisystemic therapy
         </strong>
         – Our first choice of systemic therapy is multisystemic therapy. Multisystemic therapy is a particularly intensive form of systemic therapy developed for older youth (middle childhood and adolescence) with more severe forms of conduct problems than are typically addressed in parenting groups or traditional family therapy. The treatment is typically delivered in the home setting and includes components of cognitive-behavioral therapy and parent management training as described above (see
         <a class="local">
          'For preschool-age children'
         </a>
         above and

          'For school-age children (age 6 to 12)'
         </a>
         above). Antisocial behaviors, delinquency, and substance problems are seen within the larger context of multiple systems of influence including individuals, family, peer, school, and community. Treatment in multisystemic family therapy uses multiple sessions and hours per week.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Clinical trials on the efficacy of multisystemic therapy for older children (age 10 to 17) with behavioral problems have been inconclusive [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. Although several individual studies point to the efficacy of multisystemic therapy, critical reviews with attention to methodologic limitations and potential biases point to mixed results. In a meta-analysis including eight randomized trials, multisystemic therapy was compared with usual services [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Treatment with multisystemic therapy was found to lead to similar rates for of out of home placement (33 versus 32 percent), arrest, or conviction (47 versus 42 percent) as compared with control condition. Pooled results include studies with data of varying quality tend to favor multisystemic therapy; however, small sample sizes and heterogeneity limit interpretation of data. Despite limited support for this treatment, there are few evidence-based alternatives and we have found it to be efficacious in some patients.

         We use pharmacotherapy concurrently or adjunctively for individuals with irritability or aggressive behavior that interfere with implementation of the therapy or causes psychosocial disruption. We also use adjunctive pharmacotherapy to address co-occurring disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or mood disorders. We agree with the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, which concluded that medication may be a useful adjunct to psychosocial interventions for severe mood symptoms of irritability and aggression when present in oppositional defiant disorder and/or conduct disorder (ODD/CD) with or without comorbidity  (

         For children and adolescents with ODD/CD with severe and frequent verbal and/or physical aggression and/or irritability that affects psychosocial functioning or interferes with psychosocial interventions, we typically begin treatment with combined psychosocial therapy and pharmacologic management. In some cases, the patient may require prompt control of the aggression/irritability with medications before the therapy is effective.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our preference is treatment with a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA). SGAs have been found to rapidly improve aggression and irritability in children and adolescents with a variety of disorders [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>

         , we begin with a dose of 25 mg twice daily and increase by 25 mg twice daily every three to five days depending on response and side effects up to doses of that range between 50 to 600 mg/day. Once at therapeutic range we monitor for four weeks to assess effectiveness prior to further increases and side effects (eg, metabolic syndrome).

         Studies investigating the effects of pharmacotherapy for the management of impulsive aggression and/or irritability in youth with ADHD (which often is comorbid with ODD/CD), intellectual disabilities, or autism spectrum disorders are informative for the treatment of ODD/CD because aggression and irritability are key symptoms associated with these disorders. Almost all studies examining the use of antipsychotics for aggression and/or irritability as symptoms of various disorders or as part of the behavior disorders have been carried out using SGAs in youths with ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, or intellectual disabilities [

For individuals on antipsychotic medications, we monitor metabolic parameters including weight on a regular basis  (

         For individuals with poor or partial response to the initial treatment, our first steps are to confirm treatment adherence, review the history to confirm the diagnosis, and reassess for overlooked comorbid disorders and environmental factors (eg, conflicts, abuse) that warrant management. For those treated with antipsychotic medications, we make sure that a full eight-week trial has been completed at maximum tolerated dose within the therapeutic range.

          For those managed with psychosocial intervention
         </strong>
         – For those with a poor or partial response to initial psychosocial intervention, we suggest trying a second evidence-based psychosocial treatment. As an example, for school-age children (age 6 to 12) who do not respond to a first-line combination of behavioral parent management training and skill training for children we would switch to a multicomponent treatment such as multisystemic therapy or, if unavailable, functional family therapy. Functional family therapy uses behavioral approaches, such as modifying family member behaviors using contingency management techniques and behavioral contracts. (See
