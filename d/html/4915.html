         A post-cardiac injury syndrome may occur one week to three months after MI [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. This syndrome was first described by Dressler in 1956 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Dressler syndrome differs from early post-MI pericarditis and/or effusion which occurs within a few days after transmural MI as a result of involvement of the epicardial surface or rupture of the free wall of the left ventricle. These conditions are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'
         </a>

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although data are limited, the frequency of post-cardiac injury syndrome after MI appears to be low, particularly among patients with MI treated with early myocardial reperfusion.

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In studies performed prior to the use of widespread early reperfusion therapy, rates of post-MI pericarditis ranged from 3 percent (of 1809 patients) to none (of 282 patients) [
         <a href="#rid5">

         With early reperfusion therapy for MI, post-MI cardiac injury with pericarditis appears to have largely disappeared, perhaps due to a decrease in size and transmural extent of most MIs [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In a cohort of 201 consecutive patients with acute MI treated with fibrinolysis, only one patient developed post-cardiac injury syndrome, and this patient had no evidence of reperfusion [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 743 patients with MI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, late post-MI pericarditis was identified in only 1 patient (0.1 percent) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].

         The term "postpericardiotomy syndrome" replaced the prior term "postcardiotomy syndrome" after it was discovered that the syndrome can occur after the pericardium is opened even if no other cardiac structures are involved (eg, after surgery for bronchogenic lung carcinoma).
        </p>
        <p>
         Limited data are available on rates of postpericardiotomy syndrome. Differences in rates are likely related to differing thresholds for reporting the condition as well as differing types and combinations of cardiothoracic procedures performed:

         Among a cohort of 28,761 patients in Finland undergoing only one type of surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, valve, or aortic surgery), 493 patients (1.7 percent) developed post-cardiac injury syndrome requiring hospital admission or contributing to mortality [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Thus, this study identified only severe cases of the syndrome. The risk appeared higher in patients undergoing valvular or aortic surgery, compared with patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In a much smaller cohort of 360 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 54 patients (15 percent) developed post-cardiac injury syndrome [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In this study, 32 percent of patients underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery plus another procedure such as valve surgery. Patients with postpericardiotomy syndrome more frequently underwent more than one type of surgery during each procedure (31.5 versus 16.3 percent) or underwent pleural incision (66.7 versus 34.6 percent).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Risk factors for pericardial effusions after cardiac surgery appear to be different for early (within seven days) pericardial effusions versus late effusions. This was illustrated in a registry of patients with significant pericardial effusions after cardiothoracic surgery who underwent pericardiocentesis guided by echocardiography [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was an important contributing factor in approximately one-third of late effusions. Anticoagulant therapy was considered to be a contributing factor for early (&lt;7 days) and late effusions. (See
         <a class="local">

         Patients may develop pericarditis following traumatic pericardial and/or myocardial injury. Pericardial injury may result from blunt trauma (eg, steering wheel contact in an automobile accident or a fall from a significant height) or sharp penetrating trauma (eg, injury inflicted by a knife or bullet).

         Post-cardiac injury syndrome may also occur after iatrogenic pericardial and/or myocardial injury (eg, associated with percutaneous coronary intervention, insertion of a pacing or defibrillator lead, percutaneous valvular procedures, or catheter radiofrequency ablation) [
         <a href="#rid13">

         The role of immune complexes in patients who develop the postpericardiotomy syndrome is uncertain. It has been proposed that cardiac injury releases cardiac antigens which stimulate antibody production. The immune complexes that are generated are then deposited in the pericardium, pleura, and lungs, eliciting an inflammatory response [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The initial prospective study that identified immune complexes in the post-cardiac injury syndrome compared children who did and did not develop a postpericardiotomy syndrome after cardiac surgery [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Those who developed postpericardiotomy syndrome had increased antimyocardial antibodies. Several subsequent studies have demonstrated the presence of antimyocardial antibodies in patients who develop the postpericardiotomy syndrome [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16,19
         </a>
         ]. Antimyocardial antibodies in pleural fluid have also been reported [

          20,21
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the significance of antimyocardial antibodies and their relation to the severity of myocardial injury is unclear [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. There is some evidence that antiheart antibodies may be an epiphenomenon. In a prospective study of 20 surgical patients in whom serum was sampled for antiheart antibodies before and periodically after elective coronary artery bypass surgery [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ], antiheart antibodies were absent in all patients on the day before surgery. Three patients developed postpericardiotomy syndrome. All were seronegative at the time of diagnosis, but they became seropositive within the ensuing 14 days.

         Patients with suspected post-cardiac injury syndrome should have laboratory testing including complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and troponin I or T. Most but not all patients will have an elevated white blood cell count and inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR). There is little consensus on the need for serial or follow-up studies, but most experts recheck inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) following the resolution of symptoms (typically within one to two weeks) to ensure that the inflammation is resolving prior to tapering or discontinuing therapy.

         A 12-lead ECG should be performed in all patients with suspected post-cardiac injury syndrome, although it is difficult to make the diagnosis based on ECG findings alone. The ECG is usually abnormal following an MI and after various types of cardiac surgery for a variety of reasons (eg, ischemic ST-segment or T-wave changes, developing Q waves, various nonspecific ST-T abnormalities, postoperative epicardial pacing, etc). However, when ECG changes suggestive of pericarditis are present (ie, diffuse ST-segment elevation in association with PR depression) and represent a change from the patient's baseline ECG, this is highly suggestive of post-cardiac injury syndrome. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4940.html" rel="external">

         Similar to the ECG, a chest radiograph should be performed in all patients with suspected post-cardiac injury syndrome. Although it is not possible to definitively make the diagnosis based on radiographic findings alone, the chest radiograph is helpful in excluding other pathology (eg, pneumonia, pneumothorax, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
         The chest radiograph in a patient who has developed a postoperative pericardial effusion often reveals an increase in heart size (particularly when compared with a baseline radiograph). When this is seen, the presence of an effusion should be promptly confirmed or excluded by echocardiography. In a significant minority of patients, the chest radiograph also reveals a pleural effusion, usually unilateral, although this may become apparent only on a subsequent radiograph. Pulmonary infiltrates are occasionally seen. (See

         All patients with suspected post-cardiac injury syndrome should be evaluated with echocardiography. In most instances, transthoracic echocardiography is satisfactory, but transesophageal echocardiography may be required in patients with difficult or limited imaging windows (as can frequently occur postoperatively) in whom the transthoracic study is nondiagnostic. The echocardiogram is used to determine the presence or absence of pericardial effusion, to quantify the size of an effusion, and to detect the various echocardiographic signs that are used to support or refute the presence of cardiac tamponade.

         The diagnosis of post-cardiac injury syndrome is typically suspected based upon the characteristic clinical picture of pleuritic chest pain and/or fever developing one week to three months following an MI, cardiothoracic surgery with pericardiotomy, chest trauma, or percutaneous cardiac intervention.

         Abnormalities seen on laboratory testing (leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein), ECG (diffuse ST-segment elevation in association with PR depression), chest radiograph (increased heart size, pleural effusion), and echocardiogram (pericardial effusion) are supportive, but none are specific enough to definitively make the diagnosis. The combination of a pericardial friction rub and ECG findings typical of pericarditis strongly supports the diagnosis, and the diagnosis is also strongly supported if an echocardiogram reveals a pericardial effusion at a time when effusions are no longer routine (nontrivial effusions are uncommon after 7 to 10 days postinjury).

         – Infectious causes (such as pneumonia) are typically associated with sputum production, while noninfectious causes such as malignancy may have other associated systemic symptoms (eg, weight loss, night sweats, signs of the primary malignancy, etc). Chest imaging (eg, chest radiograph and chest CT) is used to identify causes of pleural disease. (See

          Pulmonary embolism
         </strong>
         – Patients with pulmonary embolism will often have an associated risk for thromboembolism (eg, surgery, immobility, malignancy) and are typically hypoxic. The considerable overlap in clinical presentation between post-cardiac injury syndrome and pulmonary embolism with associated pulmonary infarction usually requires CT angiography to distinguish between the two entities. Pulmonary embolism is typically diagnosed when filling defects are seen on CT pulmonary angiography. (See

          colchicine

We treat with a 30-day course of colchicine beginning one to three days following surgery (0.5 or 0.6 mg twice daily for patients ≥70 kg, 0.5 or 0.6 mg daily for those &lt;70 kg). Our approach to prophylactic colchicine use in this population places a higher value on the reduction in post-cardiac injury syndrome and its potential complications rather than the risk of medication-related side effects. Patients who place a higher value on the avoidance of additional medications and potential colchicine-related side effects may opt to not use colchicine, in which case the treating clinician should emphasize with the patient the importance of early recognition of potential symptoms and treatment should symptoms arise.

         ]. Given its effectiveness in the treatment of other inflammatory pericardial disease states (acute pericarditis and recurrent pericarditis), colchicine may also be effective in the treatment of post-cardiac injury syndrome, although there are limited data in this setting. In one single-center, retrospective study of 239 patients with post-cardiac injury syndrome following cardiac surgery in which 51 patients (21 percent) received colchicine as part of their treatment, patients treated with the combination of colchicine and an antiinflammatory drug were less likely to require intervention (ie, pericardiocentesis, pericardial window, pericardiectomy) for complications of post-cardiac injury syndrome (adjusted odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.90) [

         ]. In a double-blind randomized trial of 197 patients with asymptomatic moderate- to large-sized pericardial effusions at 7 to 30 days after surgery, both colchicine and placebo had similar effects on the effusion volume and the likelihood of late cardiac tamponade [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Similar findings were reported in a randomized trial in 149 patients with asymptomatic pericardial effusions (mild to moderate in size) identified by echocardiography three weeks after surgery, in which patients randomized to colchicine had similar outcomes to patients who received placebo [
         <a href="#rid39">

For patients who require glucocorticoid therapy for refractory post-cardiac injury syndrome, we follow an approach similar to that for recurrent acute pericarditis, with moderate initial doses of glucocorticoid (eg, 0.25 to 0.50 mg/kg/day of

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Post-cardiac injury syndromes are conditions in which inflammatory pericardial disease occurs after pericardial and/or myocardial injury, with a latent period (ranging from days to months) between the injury and the development of pericarditis. (See
         <a class="local">

          Causes

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – Patients who develop post-cardiac injury syndrome present with symptoms and signs similar to those seen in patients with acute pericarditis in other clinical settings, such as pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub  (

          Evaluation
         </strong>

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of post-cardiac injury syndrome is typically suspected based upon the characteristic clinical picture of pleuritic chest pain and fever, pericardial friction rub, and typical ECG changes in a patient with an MI or pericardial injury/invasion within the appropriate time frame. The diagnosis is also strongly supported if an echocardiogram reveals a pericardial effusion at a time when effusions are no longer routine (nontrivial effusions are uncommon after 7 to 10 days postinjury), but a pericardial effusion is not always present. (See
         <a class="local">

          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). Colchicine is the only therapy that has been demonstrated to reduce post-cardiac injury syndrome following cardiac surgery. However, there are concerns about adverse effects, mainly diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complaints, that have limited adoption of colchicine in this setting. Side effects appear to be lower when colchicine is started postoperatively rather than preoperatively. We begin colchicine one to three days following surgery (0.5 mg twice daily for patients ≥70 kg, 0.5 mg daily for those &lt;70 kg) and continue therapy for a 30-day course. (See

          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – The prognosis of the post-cardiac injury syndrome is relatively good for most patients, although 10 to 15 percent of patients will experience a recurrence. Patients require close office-based follow-up until they are asymptomatic with normalized inflammatory markers. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prognosis and follow-up'
