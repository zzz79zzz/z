PTSD is seen in some children after exposure to traumatic experiences involving actual or threatened injury to themselves or others. Traumatic experiences leading to PTSD can include interpersonal violence, accidents, natural disasters, and injuries.</p><p>PTSD is characterized by intrusive thoughts and reminders of the traumatic experience(s), avoidance of trauma reminders, negative mood and cognitions related to the traumatic experience(s), and physiological hyperarousal that lead to significant social, school, and interpersonal problems [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. PTSD can occur in toddlers as young as one to two years. The consequences of PTSD include elevated risk for other mental disorders and suicide, substantial impairment in role functioning, reduced social and economic opportunity, and earlier onset of chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular disease [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>This topic addresses the psychosocial treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of PTSD in children as well pharmacotherapy for PTSD in this population are addressed separately. Topics related to acute stress disorder and PTSD in adults are also addressed separately. An algorithm addresses the approach to selecting treatments for PTSD in children and adolescents  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141792" href="/d/graphic/141792.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/104096.html" rel="external">"Posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment overview"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14345.html" rel="external">"Posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/500.html" rel="external">"Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14616.html" rel="external">"Acute stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14699.html" rel="external">"Dissociative aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H747301735"><span class="h1">TRAUMA-FOCUSED PSYCHOTHERAPY AS PREFERRED TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most children and adolescents with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or prominent symptoms of PTSD, we suggest first-line treatment with trauma-focused psychotherapy (eg, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy [TF-CBT]) rather than other psychosocial or medication treatments. However, for individuals with severe symptoms requiring immediate stabilization (eg, suicidality, psychosis) we use pharmacologic management preferentially. Additionally for individuals with co-occurring anxiety or depression we often use combined treatment with TF-CBT and pharmacologic management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/104096.html" rel="external">"Posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment overview", section on 'Pharmacologic management: For severe symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1021210742"><span class="h2">Goal of trauma-focused psychotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of trauma-focused psychotherapy is to help individuals correct exaggerated or irrational thought patterns (ie, cognitive distortions) and minimize symptoms of PTSD (eg, intrusive thoughts, avoidance) through exposure to reminders of the traumatic event. Individuals with PTSD associate stimuli (eg, people, places, smells, feelings) present at the time of a traumatic event (eg, “trauma reminders”) with the highly negative emotional responses resulting from it. Maladaptive cognitive and behavioral avoidance strategies are hypothesized to develop in an attempt to avoid distressing reminders of the event [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. By exposing individuals to reminders of the trauma, cognitive distortions and maladaptive behaviors are addressed and through the therapeutic process, more adaptive skills can be learned.</p><p>Furthermore, trauma or witness to trauma may disrupt the child’s safety and trust in their parent/caregiver. Effective trauma treatment for young children must rebuild the trust that the parent/caregiver is able to keep the child safe. This is accomplished through therapies that focus primarily on the child-parent relationship by enhancing child-parent resiliency skills, communication, positive parenting, and the parent/caregiver’s ability to promote safety. (See <a class="local">'Administering TF-CBT'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3491493717"><span class="h2">Modality and setting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The choice between individual and group modalities is influenced by availability, patient preference, clinical presentation, and specific population needs. Trauma-focused psychotherapies include individual and group models as well as models tailored to meet the needs of specific subgroups (age of child, type of trauma). Any of these can be delivered in the practitioner’s office, school, or other congregant settings (eg, group home). (See <a class="local">'Individual trauma-focused psychotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Trauma-focused group treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H177393873"><span class="h1">INDIVIDUAL TRAUMA-FOCUSED PSYCHOTHERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our preference from among the trauma-focused psychotherapies varies primarily by patient age, clinical presentation, and availability. This is based on clinical trials comparing individual therapies with inactive controls, secondary data analysis, and our clinical experience.</p><p>We typically favor individual therapy for more severe cases, when patients have significant comorbidities, when symptom severity limits working in groups, or when parent/caregiver involvement is deemed important to recovery (group treatment often does not include parents/caregivers to as great a degree as individual models). When groups are conducted in schools, individual therapy is generally preferred for patients whose primary trauma involves child abuse or domestic violence (due to the complexity of systems and legal issues). (See <a class="local">'Co-occurring depression'</a> below and <a class="local">'Trauma-focused group treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4053856763"><span class="h2">Age seven years and older</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For children and adolescents age seven years and older, we treat with individual trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). TF-CBT is the intervention most strongly supported by evidence from clinical trials  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141792" href="/d/graphic/141792.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H959537706"><span class="h3">Administering TF-CBT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TF-CBT for children and adolescents with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a parallel child and parent/caregiver treatment model that incorporates cognitive-behavioral, developmental, neurobiological, attachment, family, and empowerment principles.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Frequency of sessions</strong> – TF-CBT is typically provided to individual children once weekly during hourly sessions for a duration of 12 to 25 sessions. The duration of treatment and the time spent in any of the components are influenced by the child’s clinical presentation. Children who have less complex PTSD receiving a shorter duration (12 to 16 sessions), and children who have more complex PTSD receiving a longer duration (16 to 25 sessions) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Phases and components </strong>–<strong> </strong>TF-CBT is comprised of three phases, each comprised of several components. Within each treatment session, therapy is provided individually to the child and to the parent/caregiver. Towards the end of treatment, two to three conjoint sessions are also provided, during which the child and parent are seen together as described below.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Stabilization phase</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Psychoeducation – We provide information about the connection between the child’s past (or ongoing) trauma experiences, trauma reminders, and the child’s presenting trauma symptoms. We discuss the common expression of these responses following trauma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Parenting/caregiver skills – We provide and practice effective parenting strategies with the parent/caregiver. These include skills such as praise and selective attention. Additionally, we help parents/caregivers to understand the effect and consequences of trauma on behavior and work together to change them to more adaptive behaviors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Relaxation skills – We individualize and practice relaxation strategies (eg, focused breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, exercise, visualization) to reverse the physiological effects of the trauma and trauma reminders.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Affect modulation skills – We individualize and practice skills such as verbal expression of negative feelings, seeking social support, positive distraction strategies, and problem solving.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Cognitive processing skills – We help to identify relationships among general negative thought patterns, feelings, and behaviors to generate more accurate thoughts. By gaining mastery over negative feelings and behaviors the individual may be better prepared for more specific trauma-related cognitive processing in the next phase.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Trauma narration and processing stage</strong> – We help the child to develop a detailed narrative of their personal trauma experience and to cognitively process these experiences by leveraging the skills learned above. This component is an interactive, therapeutic process that occurs between the therapist and child (and between the therapist and parent/caregiver as the therapist shares the content of the child’s narrative with the parent/caregiver).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Integration and consolidation phase</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>In-vivo mastery of trauma reminders – We have children expose themselves to trauma reminders (eg, going to a bedroom or bathroom where past trauma occurred) while employing the techniques learned in the prior phases. This can help to overcome the overgeneralized fears of trauma reminders and reduce maladaptive avoidance behaviors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Conjoint sessions – We use one or more conjoint child-parent sessions to enhance direct child-parent communication about trauma (eg, sharing the child’s trauma narrative directly with the parent/caregiver, safety planning, and other individualized issues).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Enhancing safety – With the child and their parent/caregiver, we discuss, provide, and practice safety skills appropriate to the child’s developmental level and living circumstances. Trauma entails disruption of safety; reconstituting the child’s actual and sense of safety is critical for recovery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Monitoring response</strong> – We typically monitor children’s responses to treatment through child self-reported ratings such as the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aacap.org%2FApp_Themes%2FAACAP%2Fdocs%2Fresource_centers%2Fresources%2Fmisc%2Fchild_ptsd_symptom_scale.pdf&amp;token=s2GT9b2%2FNT2ze8kgzp4AxaQzaalrkEEp7S%2BDIDComByY5Nf%2Fk%2BTKFtB4ZLTYaMIJPLxyTWEbwJUKAVHVWBmdYQm%2Ba0dGp7tF1OCqtyXrGYDqqrJkOQ1nUyzQW7eGLn7G&amp;TOPIC_ID=89790" target="_blank">Child PTSD Symptom Scale</a> or the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen-2 (for children age 7 to 17 years.)

We administer these at baseline, and after each treatment phase. Some clinicians may also administer these at additional points in treatment if clinically indicated.

Trials have shown efficacy for children exposed to sexual abuse, domestic violence, war, or multiple or complex PTSD [<a href="#rid12">12,13,15-19</a>]. Few trials have directly compared the TF-CBT with other trauma-focused psychotherapies and these have not consistently shown differences between PTSD outcomes but have shown benefits of TF-CBT for comorbid problems such as depression or ADHD [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a large multisite trial, 220 children (age 8 to 14 years) with a history of multiple traumas (mean = 3.4) including an index trauma of validated sexual abuse and a diagnosis of PTSD, were randomly assigned to receive 12 weekly sessions of TF-CBT or child-centered therapy (CCT; a treatment model that focuses on establishing trust between child and parent/caregiver) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. At the end of treatment, the TF-CBT group experienced greater reductions in measures of PTSD symptoms, depression and behavior problems as compared with the CCT group. Additionally fewer individuals in the TF-CBT group continued to meet full criteria for PTSD at posttreatment evaluation than those in the CCT group (21 versus 46 percent, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a meta-analysis of three trials including 98 youth with PTSD, treatment with TF-CBT led to reduced PTSD symptoms one month after treatment compared with controls (standard mean difference -1.34, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.89) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Other trials have supported the efficacy of TF-CBT [<a href="#rid23">23</a>], including trials showing efficacy for 18 months [<a href="#rid24">24</a>], and efficacy in treatment of the International Classification of Diseases, 11<sup>th</sup> Version (ICD-11) complex PTSD [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Teens with complex PTSD'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2223932837"><span class="h2">Children three to six years</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We treat children with PTSD in this age range with either child-parent psychotherapy (CPP) or TF-CBT for preschoolers. Our choice is based on availability of treatment and family preference. Additionally, our choice of treatment is influenced by the presence of sexualized, high internalizing behaviors (eg, social withdrawal) or externalizing behaviors (physical assault, lying), or when the child is manifesting symptoms of an attachment difficulty or developmental delay  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141792" href="/d/graphic/141792.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H731961350"><span class="h3">Sexualized or high internalizing/externalizing behaviors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For children with sexualized behavior problems or high levels of internalizing (eg, depressed affect, social withdrawal) or externalizing behaviors (eg, aggression, delinquent behavior, substance misuse) we prefer TF-CBT for preschoolers [<a href="#rid6">6,16</a>].</p><p>TF-CBT utilizes structured play strategies to implement the CBT components with preschoolers. Clinical trials have supported the use of TF-CBT for preschoolers. As examples: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a trial comparing variations in TF-CBT administration, 210 children (age 4 to 11) with PTSD related to sexual abuse were randomly assigned to one of four different treatment conditions: 8 or 16 sessions of TF-CBT with or without the trauma narrative phase (see <a class="local">'Administering TF-CBT'</a> above) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. At treatment end, TF-CBT, regardless of the number of sessions or the inclusion of the trauma narrative component was effective in improving participant symptomatology, parenting skills, and children’s personal safety skills. Improvement in internalizing symptoms (eg, fear, anxiety), externalizing symptoms (eg, aggression) and changes in parenting practices varied by TF-CBT type. Results among participants age four to six were similar to older participants.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a trial, 86 children age three to six with at least five symptoms of PTSD following an index trauma of sexual abuse were randomly assigned to either TF-CBT or nondirective supportive therapy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Children receiving TF-CBT experienced greater improvement on parental measures of behavior and adjustment problems, including internalizing and sexualized behaviors.</p><p></p><p>A stepped care model of TF-CBT for preschool children has been developed allowing parents/caregivers to provide much of the intervention at home. This model has demonstrated similar impact to standard TF-CBT at lower cost [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Other treatments with limited support'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1348366162"><span class="h3">Attachment difficulty or developmental delay</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For children age three to six, with attachment difficulty or developmental delay, our first choice of treatment is CPP.</p><p>CPP is a dyadic attachment-based psychotherapy that has elements of CBT but is primarily based on attachment and psychodynamic theory. CPP focuses on supporting and strengthening the parent-child relationship as a way to heal the negative impacts of interpersonal trauma. CPP is particularly valuable for very young children (birth to three years) and other young children (eg, those with developmental delays) who cannot express their emotions verbally but do so through play; the CPP therapist helps the parent/caregiver to understand and make more benign meaning of the child’s play, behaviors, and interactions with the parent/caregiver.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Training and administration </strong>– CPP is provided in 40 to 50 weekly dyadic child-parent sessions with additional parent/caregiver sessions provided as needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">CPP provides more sustained interventions to the child and parent/caregiver than TF-CBT, and thus may be particularly helpful for parents/caregivers who are highly dysregulated due to personal experiences of domestic violence.
