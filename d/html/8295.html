         Monkeypox virus is an orthopoxvirus that is in the same genus as variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) and vaccinia virus (the virus used in

         ). Patients with mpox (previously referred to as monkeypox) typically develop a rash that is similar in appearance to smallpox; however, the mortality from mpox is significantly less than for smallpox. The rash of mpox can also be similar in appearance to more common infectious rashes, such as those observed in secondary syphilis, herpes simplex infection, and varicella-zoster virus infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to 2022, most cases of mpox occurred in Central and West Africa. However, an ongoing outbreak associated with person-to-person transmission, which was first reported in May 2022, has involved thousands of individuals in dozens of nonendemic

         In November 2022, the World Health Organization, who is responsible for naming and renaming of diseases under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), changed the name of the disease referred to as "monkeypox" to "mpox" [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. This change was made to follow current best practices of not naming diseases after animals or geographic locations and to reduce any stigma that could be associated with the original name.
        </p>
        <p>
         The virus that causes mpox will continue to be referred to as monkeypox virus until the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) officially decides what the name of the virus should be. However, the former Congo Basin (Central African) clade was renamed as Clade one (I) and the former West African clade was renamed as Clade two (II). Clade II consists of two subclades, IIa and IIb. (See

         Management of patients with mpox involves supportive care as well as antiviral therapy for select patients. Additional considerations for managing pregnant persons, children, and those with immunocompromising conditions, such as advanced HIV, are discussed below. (See

         However, some patients may require pain relief medication (eg, for pain related to proctitis or tonsillitis). In addition, for conditions like proctitis, stool softeners, topical

         Supportive care requiring hospitalization may be warranted for those who have or are at risk for dehydration (eg, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, sever tonsillitis), those who require more intensive pain management, and those experiencing severe disease or complications.

         There are no published data on timing of treatment in humans, but therapy is likely to be most effective when started early in the clinical course, especially in immunocompromised patients. When there is a high likelihood that the patient has mpox (eg, clinical presentation consistent with mpox after a known high-risk exposure), treatment can be started before the results of testing are available. Updated information regarding indications for treatment of mpox during an outbreak can be found at the

         Immunocompromised patients should receive antiviral therapy with

        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to start therapy early in the course of disease. In some immunocompromised patients, a longer duration of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="118450" href="/z/d/drug information/118450.html" rel="external">
          tecovirimat

         (ie, &gt;14 days) may be needed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring response to therapy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In highly immunocompromised patients, combination therapy should be considered (eg, adding
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9264" href="/z/d/drug information/9264.html" rel="external">
          cidofovir

          tecovirimat

         ) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. As an example, case reports have shown that persons with HIV who have very low CD4 counts (eg, &lt;50 cells/microL) and uncontrolled HIV loads can have a prolonged course of disease, and most mpox deaths are seen in this patient population [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21-24
         </a>
         ]. However, the decision to use combination therapy must take into account the potential benefits of treatment in those with severe disease as well as the increased risk of adverse events (eg, nephrotoxicity) with an additional agent. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Specific agents'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         When initiating treatment, clinicians should assess for drug interactions between
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="118450" href="/z/d/drug information/118450.html" rel="external">
          tecovirimat
         </a>
         and immunosuppressive agents. As an example, tecovirimat may reduce serum concentrations of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9971" href="/z/d/drug information/9971.html" rel="external">
          tacrolimus

         and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10329" href="/z/d/drug information/10329.html" rel="external">
          sirolimus
         </a>
         , so it is important to monitor the levels of these agents [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, there are interactions with certain drugs used to treat HIV. Detailed information on drug interactions with HIV antiretroviral agents is found below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Persons with HIV'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to using antiviral medications, efforts should be made to improve the patient's immune function. The best chance of curing monkeypox virus infection is with a functional immune system [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. This includes limiting the use of immunosuppressive medications when possible and initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) for those with HIV. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Persons with HIV'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         After treatment is initiated, patients should be followed closely to ensure medications are taken properly and to monitor the response to therapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring response to therapy'

          tecovirimat

         depends upon the patient's weight; as an example, for those ≥40 kg to &lt;120 kg, the dose is 600 mg (three capsules) every 12 hours. When the oral formulation is used, it should be given after a fatty meal to reach optimal absorption and bioavailability. Detailed dosing information, including dosing in children, is described in the Lexicomp drug information monograph on tecovirimat included within UpToDate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Oral and intravenous (IV) preparations are available. The IV formulation can be considered in those who are unable to consume a fatty meal but should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] &lt;30mL/min). In addition, it should be used with caution in those with moderate or mild kidney disease as well as those &lt;2 years of age, due to accumulation of an ingredient in the IV formulation (hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         The duration of treatment is typically 14 days. However, immunocompromised patients may require a longer course of therapy. (See

         Secondary bacterial infections can occur in patients with mpox. Patients should be counseled to contact their health care provider if they observe increased erythema, warmth, or purulence surrounding any lesions, which could suggest secondary bacterial skin infection. Should a bacterial infection be suspected at the time of the initial evaluation or during follow-up visits, the patient should receive appropriate antibiotic coverage in addition to antiviral therapy; regimens should generally include agents that are used to treat soft tissue infections (eg, those that cover both staphylococcal and streptococcal species).

         The risk of transmitting monkeypox virus to others in community and health care settings can be mitigated through implementation of infection prevention and control measures. This section summarizes our approach to infection prevention and control. Additional recommendations can be found on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fpoxvirus%2Fmpox%2Fclinicians%2Finfection-control.html&amp;token=gDFdguHGBSnT9pWh5diDwBomRAFiYzp%2FmYm08rju0q7nrgi2LEdHwRsZnI%2BIHPUdEjMrahwXCjTvA2qSQGkZIyWH8F6XGo%2FiPk3mWlfG00k%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=8295" target="_blank">

         The identify, isolate, inform framework is critical to reducing the risk of transmission in health care settings and has been applied broadly to high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs), including Ebola virus disease [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,41
         </a>
         ] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ] as well as non-HCIDs, such as measles [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. The identify component seeks to ensure that clinicians have the information they need to consider a particular diagnosis at the earliest interactions with the health care system. This requires knowledge of clinical signs and symptoms as well as relevant epidemiology, which may include travel and specific exposures.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once identified, clinicians need to ensure the patient with the suspected infection of interest is appropriately isolated. Once isolated, the next step is to inform, which requires that the clinicians contact the appropriate individual within their facility for additional guidance. This is often the infection prevention and control team, who serve as liaisons with public health authorities as required.

          44

          45,46

         <strong>
          Patient placement (room selection)
         </strong>
         – A patient with suspected or confirmed mpox should be triaged promptly to a single-person (private) room with dedicated toileting facilities. If a patient is in a semi-private room at the time that mpox is suspected, the patient with suspected mpox should be moved to a private room as soon as possible. Pending that transfer, both patients should be masked, the curtain between the beds should be closed, and each patient should be provided with a commode to use. Patients should not share the bathroom. If the patient is eventually diagnosed with mpox, any patients who shared the room should be evaluated to determine the exposure risk. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Post-exposure management'
         </a>
         below.)

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Special air handling is generally not required. However, an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR; "negative pressure") should be used for any procedures that are likely to aerosolize oral secretions. An AIIR should also be used pending the initial diagnostic work-up when diseases that require an AIIR, such as varicella (chickenpox), are being considered (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139254.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of mpox (monkeypox)", section on 'Differential diagnosis'
         </a>
         ). If an AIIR is not available in these circumstances, the patient should be placed in a private, standard room with the door closed when it is safe to do so. Patients should don a facemask when any individual enters the room or when the patient needs to travel outside the room.

         <strong>
          Personal protective equipment
         </strong>
         – Personal protection equipment (PPE) is required for all health care personnel (HCP) interacting with a patient with suspected or confirmed mpox or interacting with the patient's environment (eg, environmental services HCP).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         All HCP should use a gown, gloves, eye protection (goggles or face shield), and a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 filtering facepiece or equivalent or higher-level respirator. This combination of PPE reflects contact precautions (gown and gloves), droplet precautions (eye protection), and airborne precautions (respiratory protection). While there is no epidemiologic evidence to date that monkeypox virus is spread by the airborne route, at this time the CDC recommends respiratory protection be used [
         <a href="#rid46">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Careful attention must be paid to doffing (removal) of PPE in the correct order and in a manner that reduces the risk of self- and cross-contamination. Hand hygiene must immediately follow doffing of PPE.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         All HCP determined to have had an exposure to mpox should be monitored for symptoms for 21 days from the day of last interaction  (

         ). The approach to monitoring (active or passive) and the need for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) depend upon the type of exposure, use of PPE, and local regulations. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

During transport, there must be an HCP with clean, nongloved hands who is able to open doors and push elevator buttons as needed. The receiving department should be notified in advance of the required precautions.

         Most patients with mpox will have mild disease and can be cared for at home. Such patients should not leave home except for follow-up medical care; when leaving home, public transportation should be avoided. Persons who do not have an essential need to be in the home should not visit while the individual remains infectious. (See

         Household members providing care to patients with mpox should use disposable gloves for direct contact with lesions. The gloves should be disposed of after use, followed by hand hygiene with an alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, with soap and water. Disposal of contaminated waste (such as dressings and bandages) should be determined in consultation with state or local health officials.

         All individuals with an exposure to mpox should monitor for symptoms. The need for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with vaccine depends upon the risk of the exposure  (

         The indications for PEP are typically dictated by public health authorities and depend upon the exposure risk, as described above  (

        <p>
         In general, PEP is not needed for individuals who were diagnosed with mpox during the outbreak that started in May of 2022, since mpox likely confers immune protection. For those who received two doses of MVA vaccine, the need for a booster dose after an exposure has not been established, but at present it is not routinely recommended.

        <p>
         For others, our approach is as follows and is consistent with guidelines from the CDC [

         If the MVA vaccine is not available, ACAM2000 may be considered in select immunocompetent patients on a case-by-case basis. However, this vaccine is associated with more side effects and contraindications than the MVA vaccine, and most clinicians would avoid using ACAM2000 to prevent mpox during the current outbreak since the risks associated with vaccination may be greater than those associated with infection with the circulating strain of monkeypox virus. If ACAM2000 is being considered in the United States, it requires approval through an expanded-access program by the CDC. (See

         Persons who are eligible for PEP should be vaccinated within four days of exposure whenever possible, although vaccination can be considered for up to 14 days of an exposure. Recommendations for vaccination from different public health agencies (eg, CDC, WHO, UKHSA) may vary [

        <p>
         Peak immunity is expected approximately 14 days after the second dose of vaccine. Thus, it is important that persons who are vaccinated continue to monitor for signs and symptoms of mpox even after vaccination. In addition, persons should continue to reduce their risk of exposure since duration of immunity has not been established. (See

        <p>
         Although the number of mpox cases related to the 2022 outbreak has continued to decline since they peaked in the summer of 2022, it is important that pre-exposure vaccination continue to be offered to persons at high risk. In the United States, only 23 percent of at-risk populations were fully vaccinated [

          78

         </span>
         Data emerging from the 2022 outbreak support the efficacy of vaccination in reducing the risk of developing mpox. The vaccine is more effective in those who complete the full two-dose vaccine schedule rather than a single dose. In a study evaluating 9544 cases of mpox that developed between July 31 and October 1, 2022 in the United States, 87 percent occurred in those who were unvaccinated [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of mpox in at-risk unvaccinated persons was 7.4 times greater than those who received one dose of the MVA vaccine ≥14 days earlier and 9.6 times greater than those who received two doses of the MVA vaccine ≥14 days earlier. There was no apparent difference in protection between subcutaneous and intradermal administration. These findings have been supported in subsequent case-control studies [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80,81
         </a>
         ]. In a report that included 917 participants, the adjusted vaccine efficacy against mpox was 75.2 and 85.9 percent for partial (ie, one dose) and full vaccination, respectively [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Earlier studies also support the benefit of prior vaccination with replication-competent vaccinia virus vaccines in preventing mpox. In a study of human-to-human transmission of monkeypox virus in Africa, secondary attack rates varied greatly among 2278 household contacts depending on their prior smallpox vaccination status (7.5 compared with 1.3 percent in vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. In another study that showed an increasing incidence of human mpox cases in Africa [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82
         </a>
         ], vaccinated people had a fivefold lower risk of mpox as compared with unvaccinated persons (0.78 versus 4.05 per 10,000); vaccine efficacy was estimated to be approximately 81 percent in those with a distant history of smallpox vaccination. In the 2003 United States outbreak, an investigation using experimental techniques identified three asymptomatic mpox infections in individuals who had received smallpox vaccination 13, 29, and 48 years prior to their exposure to mpox [
         <a href="#rid83">
          83
         </a>
         ]. These individuals were unaware that they had been infected because they did not have any recognizable disease symptoms, and no transmission was documented.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although these findings suggest that vaccination with MVA or replication-competent vaccinia virus vaccines reduce the risk of developing mpox, symptomatic mpox infections have been seen in people who have been previously vaccinated [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84-87
         </a>
         ]. This includes 9 of 13 cases that occurred during a resurgence of mpox identified in Chicago in April and May of 2023, although cases were mild [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75

          Reducing transmission risk

The infected parent should additionally be restricted from interactions with their uninfected newborn until they are determined to no longer be infectious, given the risk of severe illness were the newborn to develop mpox. Exceptions to restricting interactions between mother and newborn, if considered, should involve input from local infection prevention and control specialists to assess the risks of transmission.

The fourth patient had mild disease at 14 weeks and gave birth to a healthy newborn at term. In another report of a probable (nonlaboratory confirmed) case of mpox in a pregnant patient infected at about 24 weeks of gestation, preterm birth occurred at about 30 weeks, and the newborn had a generalized skin rash consistent with mpox and died of malnutrition a few weeks later [

Animal studies of the MVA vaccine in pregnant rats have not demonstrated adverse fetal effects. In addition, available human data from European and United States registries of inadvertently vaccinated pregnant persons (eg, during studies and vaccination campaigns) are reassuring and do not demonstrate increased risk of miscarriage, birth defects, preterm birth, or fetal vaccinia [

         The ACAM2000 vaccine is generally contraindicated in persons with uncontrolled HIV since it is a live, replication-competent vaccine, and the risks generally outweigh the benefits in the setting of the current mpox outbreak [
         <a href="#rid115">
          115
         </a>
         ]. However, while it has not been widely used during the current outbreak, if only ACAM2000 is available for PEP, it can be considered on a case-by-case basis for those with a CD4 count of &gt;500 copies/microL and no other contraindications.

          Grade 2C

         <strong>
          Additional considerations
         </strong>
         – For immunocompromised patients, efforts should be made to restore immune function, in addition to antiviral therapy. For some patients, this may involve reducing the dose of immunosuppressive therapy, if possible. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Considerations in immunocompromised patients'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For persons with HIV, we suggest ART be initiated as soon as possible (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Although cases of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) have been seen in persons with mpox who initiate ART, the benefit of immune recovery appears to outweigh the risks of IRIS. (See

         <strong>
          Infection prevention and control
         </strong>
         – If the diagnosis of mpox is being considered, infection prevention precautions should be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Infection prevention and control'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         All health care personnel (HCP) involved in the care of a patient with mpox should use a gown, gloves, eye protection (goggles or face shield), and a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 filtering facepiece or equivalent or higher-level respirator. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients should be placed in a single-person (private) room; special air handling is generally not required, however, an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) should be used if the diagnosis is unclear (eg, those with suspected varicella) and/or if procedures that are likely to spread oral secretions (eg, intubation) are anticipated to be performed.

         ) should monitor for symptoms for 21 days. Contacts who remain asymptomatic can continue routine daily activities. If symptoms develop, they should immediately self-isolate and contact the health department or other designated point of contact (eg, occupational health for HCP) for further guidance. (See

         <strong>
          Vaccination
         </strong>
         – Decisions regarding post-exposure vaccination depend primarily upon the type of exposure. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines exposure risk as higher, intermediate, or lower  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139449" href="/z/d/graphic/139449.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         <strong>
          Known or suspected higher-risk exposure
         </strong>
         – For most individuals with a known higher-risk exposure, we suggest post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with the
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="122670" href="/z/d/drug information/122670.html" rel="external">
          modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine
         </a>
         in addition to monitoring (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Vaccination should also be offered to individuals who had a likely exposure to mpox (eg, based on sexual risk). The MVA vaccine is made from a highly attenuated, nonreplicating vaccinia virus and has an excellent safety profile, even in immunocompromised people and those with skin disorders. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications after a known or suspected exposure'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         However, PEP is generally not needed for individuals who were diagnosed with mpox during the outbreak that started in May of 2022, since mpox likely confers immune protection. For those who received two doses of MVA vaccine, the need for a booster dose after an exposure has not been established, but at present is not routinely recommended.

         <strong>
          Other exposures
         </strong>
         – PEP should be considered for individuals after specific intermediate-risk exposures on a case-by-case basis. By contrast, vaccination is not indicated for those with lower-risk exposures. (See

          Pre-exposure prophylaxis
