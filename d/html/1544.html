Proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) lesions often supply a high percentage of the left ventricular myocardium, compared to proximal lesions in the circumflex or right coronary arteries. A study reported that the prevalence of significant proximal LAD disease in stable patients undergoing diagnostic coronary catheterization was 7.2 percent in New York State and 13.4 percent in Ontario, Canada [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss both the choice between medical therapy and revascularization for treatment of proximal LAD disease in stable patients as well as the choice between coronary artery bypass graft surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention in those patients in whom revascularization is chosen. This discussion will focus on the outcomes of survival, myocardial infarction, and revascularization rates. Revascularization to improve angina refractory to medical therapy in patients for whom survival will not be improved is discussed separately.

However, a survival benefit from revascularization has not been demonstrated in stable patients with significant proximal LAD disease, as discussed below. Despite this, many of our contributors have unease about relying on medical therapy alone and recommend revascularization to their patients who have significant proximal LAD, documented ischemia, and stable and tolerable angina. This approach is based on clinical experience during which the following has been observed:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some patients' symptoms ultimately progress to unacceptable angina. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Large myocardial infarctions may occur in these patients who are not revascularized.</p><p></p><p>Two randomized trials that enrolled patients with significant disease of the proximal left coronary artery did not demonstrate that survival is improved with revascularization. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The 2020 ISCHEMIA trial randomly assigned 5179 patients with chronic coronary syndrome and moderate to severe ischemia on testing to an initial invasive strategy of cardiac catheterization and revascularization in addition to optimal medical therapy or an initial strategy of optimal medical therapy with revascularization reserved for failure of medical therapy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In ISCHEMIA, 47 percent of patients had disease involving the proximal segment of the LAD. Revascularization did not reduce the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest; hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure; or the single endpoint of cardiac death at five years. ISCHEMIA is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1557.html" rel="external">"Chronic coronary syndrome: Indications for revascularization", section on 'Patients with high-risk anatomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is important to recognize that the findings of ISCHEMIA do not apply to patients who are symptomatic despite the use of medical therapy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The COURAGE trial, which also compared PCI with medical therapy, included a group of patients with isolated proximal LAD disease [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In COURAGE, which excluded patients with severe angina, a markedly positive treadmill test (eg, significant ST-segment depressions and/or a hypotensive blood pressure response during stage I of the Bruce protocol), and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30 percent, there was no significant difference between aggressive medical therapy or aggressive medical therapy plus PCI using bare metal stents with regard to survival. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1557.html" rel="external">"Chronic coronary syndrome: Indications for revascularization", section on 'Patients with high-risk anatomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H85278848"><span class="h2">Patients with prior CABG</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For symptomatic patients who previously underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) without prior placement of a left internal thoracic artery and have ischemia in multiple territories, CABG is preferred to PCI. </p><p>Patients with ischemia in other locations and those with a patent left internal mammary artery to the LAD artery are unlikely to experience a survival benefit from repeat revascularization, and the decision to revascularize should be made primarily for the goal of reducing anginal symptoms [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1557.html" rel="external">"Chronic coronary syndrome: Indications for revascularization", section on 'Relief of angina'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with a diseased saphenous vein graft to the LAD who undergo PCI, intervention of the native vessel is generally preferred over treatment of the diseased saphenous vein graft [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">PCI VERSUS CABG</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During the past 30 years, several trials and meta-analyses comparing the efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with CABG for patients with proximal LAD disease have been conducted, and none has shown a survival advantage for either form of revascularization [<a href="#rid7">7-14</a>].</p><p>Accordingly, the 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI coronary revascularization guideline does not mention a general preference for one form of revascularization over the other [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>For those patients in whom revascularization is chosen, however, the choice between PCI and CABG depends on clinical parameters as well as the patient's preference for the potential burdens associated with each form of revascularization. Specifically scenarios are described as follows: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We prefer PCI with stenting in many patients with less complex coronary artery disease and relatively well preserved left ventricular systolic function. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CABG might be preferred to PCI in patients with complex, proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) disease with other unfavorable lesions (eg, chronic total occlusion in another vessel). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other patient and angiographic characteristics also may affect the decision such as age, left ventricular dysfunction, the inability to take or tolerate dual antiplatelet therapy for an appropriate duration, and diabetes mellitus (in which the outcome may be better with CABG) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Whenever PCI is performed, drug-eluting stents should be used for their superior safety and efficacy compared with bare metal stents, which are now rarely used; similarly, surgical revascularization of the LAD should be performed using the internal thoracic artery as the conduit of choice. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1572.html" rel="external">"Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients", section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1581.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery revascularization in stable patients with diabetes mellitus", section on 'PCI versus CABG'</a>.)</p><p>In suitable candidates with proximal LAD disease, PCI can usually be performed with a high chance of success and low risk of complications. When faced with more complex lesions such as true ostial location, particularly with involvement of the distal left main coronary artery, adjacent circumflex ostial disease, or complex bifurcation lesions involving a large first diagonal branch, consideration of CABG should be made. Complex LAD-diagonal bifurcation lesions and ostial LAD lesions that are flush with the distal left main should only be attempted by highly experienced operators in institutions with cardiac surgical facilities.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Patients with multivessel disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with less diffuse coronary artery disease (eg, lower SYNTAX scores) have lower event rates than those with moderate or severely diffuse coronary artery disease (eg, intermediate or high scores) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1571.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous coronary intervention of specific coronary lesions", section on 'Left main and left anterior descending disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1579.html" rel="external">"Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p>In the SYNTAX trial, 1800 patients with three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to either CABG or PCI with paclitaxel-eluting stents [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. After 12 months of follow-up, the composite primary end point (death from any cause, stroke, MI, or repeat revascularization) was significantly higher in the PCI group (17.8 versus 12.4 percent), with the result driven primarily by more frequent revascularization with PCI (13.5 versus 5.9 percent). After five years, however, CABG was also associated with fewer myocardial infarctions (MIs) and the lower rate of the composite outcome of death, stroke, or MI. This trial is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1579.html" rel="external">"Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p>In a patient-level meta-analysis, which included the SYNTAX trial, patients with low SYNTAX scores had comparable outcomes after either PCI or CABG, whereas patients with higher SYNTAX score had better outcomes after CABG [<a href="#rid15">15</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1579.html" rel="external">"Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Outcomes based on lesion severity'</a>). Accordingly, for patients with a significant narrowing of the proximal LAD associated with multivessel disease, we prefer CABG over PCI. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1571.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous coronary intervention of specific coronary lesions", section on 'Left main and left anterior descending disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1579.html" rel="external">"Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H468899215"><span class="h2">Patients with single-vessel disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with significant <strong>single vessel</strong>, proximal LAD disease in whom revascularization has been recommended, we suggest PCI rather than CABG. This preference is based on the desire to avoid the potential complications of CABG (such as stroke) despite a higher rate of repeat revascularization with PCI [<a href="#rid10">10,17,18</a>]. The prevalence of significant proximal LAD disease in stable patients undergoing diagnostic coronary catheterization was found to be 7.2 percent in New York State and 13.4 percent in Ontario, Canada in a 2013 study [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>As discussed above, the finding of isolated disease in the proximal LAD is sometimes, but not always, an indication for revascularization, but clinical trials have not shown a survival benefit compared with medical therapy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Indications for revascularization'</a> above.) The main indication for intervention in this setting is for symptoms due to failure of medical therapy. However, given the safety and low procedural morbidity associated with PCI and stenting, most cardiologists favor revascularization of the proximal LAD given the large area at risk. It is not uncommon to find that patients may also have arrived at this decision themselves based on what they have been told by other physicians or from their own research</p><p>A 2008 meta-analysis of nine randomized trials, including 1210 patients, found no 5- or 10-year survival difference between CABG and PCI for management of single vessel LAD disease, although rates of repeat revascularization were higher at five years with PCI (33.5 versus 7.3 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p>Randomized trials using a lateral or anterolateral thoracotomy (MID CABG) in patients with isolated LAD stenosis have suggested that this surgical approach is associated with equivalent mortality but better symptom control and a lower rate of target vessel revascularization than PCI with <strong>bare metal stents</strong> [<a href="#rid13">13,14,19</a>].</p><p>Two studies have compared PCI with <strong>drug-eluting stents</strong> (DES) to CABG:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A randomized trial comparing first generation DES to minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery (MIDCAB) evaluated outcomes in 130 patients with isolated proximal LAD disease [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The primary clinical end point was freedom from death, MI, or the need for target vessel revascularization. At one year, PCI with DES was noninferior to MIDCAB, with an event rate of 7.7 percent in both groups. Patients who received PCI had a higher rate of revascularization (6.2 versus 0 percent), while those who received MIDCAB had a higher rate of MI (7.7 versus 1.5 percent), most of which was periprocedural. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1584.html" rel="external">"Early cardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery", section on 'Perioperative MI'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Using New York (United States) state clinical registries, CABG was compared to DES in 715 matched pairs of patients with isolated proximal LAD disease [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. There was no significant difference in the rates of three-year mortality (adjusted hazard rate [AHR] 1.14, 95% CI 0.70-1.85) or mortality, MI, and/or stroke (AHR 1.15, 95% CI 0.76-1.73). The rate of repeat revascularization was significantly lower for CABG (AHR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.81). The stents used in these patients, although not reported in the publication, were likely represented by a majority of second generation DES, which have improved results compared with first generation DES and represent the standard of care at present.</p><p></p><p>In the patient with severe single vessel disease involving only the proximal LAD, it is important for the patient to be made aware of the strengths and weakness of either approach. For patients with more complex lesions, such as ostial location, diffuse disease, or bifurcation lesions, the risks with PCI increase. Shared decision-making with the patient and a heart team approach should be strongly considered.

For these patients with multivessel disease who have a LVEF &lt;30 percent, we suggest CABG rather than PCI (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For patients without these high-risk predictors, PCI is a reasonable option. (See <a class="local">'Patients with multivessel disease'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with significant <strong>single vessel</strong>, proximal LAD disease in whom revascularization has been recommended, we suggest PCI rather than CABG (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). However, for those patients who prefer to accept the higher early morbidity (including an increased risk of stroke) with CABG in exchange for a lower rate of subsequent revascularization, CABG is an appropriate strategy. (See <a class="local">'Patients with single-vessel disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decision-making for type of revascularization </strong>– For patients in whom a decision has been made to perform revascularization, it should be kept in mind that not all proximal lesions carry the same prognosis or success rate with PCI. This information may influence decision-making between PCI and CABG, and a heart team approach may be recommended. (See <a class="local">'PCI versus CABG'</a> above.) </p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Ko DT, Tu JV, Austin PC, et al.
