         Atherosclerotic stenosis of the major intracranial arteries, also known as intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) or cerebral atherosclerosis, is an important cause of ischemic stroke. This topic focuses on the treatment and prognosis of ICAS. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of ICAS are reviewed separately. (See

         The initial treatment of acute stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to ICAS is similar to the treatment of acute ischemic stroke or TIA attributed to other mechanisms, as reviewed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1126.html" rel="external">
          "Initial assessment and management of acute stroke"

        </p>
        <p>
         Of utmost importance, timely restoration of blood flow using reperfusion therapies (intravenous thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy) is the most effective way to salvage ischemic brain tissue that is not already infarcted. There is a relatively narrow time window during which this can be accomplished, since the benefit of these interventions decreases over time. Thus, an important aspect of the hyperacute phase of acute ischemic stroke management is the rapid determination of patients who are eligible for intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115775.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke"

         Antiplatelet therapy has an important role in the both the acute and chronic phase of ischemic stroke management, as discussed below. (See

         For patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke attributed to ICAS, we employ intensive medical therapy that includes antiplatelet therapy and strict control of vascular risk factors including the use of antihypertensive agents; low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapy; and physical activity and other lifestyle modification (eg, smoking cessation, weight control, salt restriction, and a healthy diet) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

        </p>
        <p>
         Intensive medical therapy is superior to intracranial arterial stenting for patients with recent stroke or TIA attributed to severe ICAS. (See

         and other antithrombotic agents should not be given for the first 24 hours following treatment with intravenous thrombolysis. Otherwise, antiplatelet therapy should be started for most patients without an indication for anticoagulation as soon as possible after the diagnosis of TIA or ischemic stroke is confirmed, even before the evaluation for ischemic mechanism is complete. This issue is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See

         – The lower rates of recurrent stroke in SAMMPRIS patients on DAPT compared with similar patients from WASID, combined with the supportive CHANCE and CLAIR data, make a compelling argument to continue DAPT up to 90 days in patients with severe ICAS. Most importantly, the high risk of recurrent stroke from ICAS that persists beyond the first month distinguishes these patients from other stroke subtypes and argues for longer DAPT treatment.

         The multicenter SAMMPRIS trial enrolled patients with 70 to 99 percent stenosis of a major intracranial artery who had a TIA or ischemic stroke within 30 days prior to study entry; in the aggressive medical treatment arm of the trial, the short-term use of DAPT with

A subgroup analysis of THALES patients with ICAS ≥30 percent ipsilateral to the qualifying ischemic event found lower rates of ischemic stroke in those on combination ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with those on aspirin alone at 30 days (9.5 versus 15.2 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.47–0.93) [

          9
         </a>
         ]. Unlike other ICAS trials wherein the stenosis was determined by the investigator to be symptomatic for study qualification, the stenosis in this THALES analysis may have been incidental (eg, a 40 percent cavernous carotid stenosis ipsilateral to a lenticulostriate stroke). Additionally, the treatment duration was limited to 30 days, as were the reported outcomes. Given that ICAS stroke risk remains high beyond 30 days and the bleeding risk with ticagrelor and aspirin reported in THALES, additional long-term and comparative data are needed to better understand the role of this combination compared with other DAPT options.

Since antiplatelet drugs are effective in this larger group of patients with different types of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, they are likely to be effective in patients with ICAS, a subgroup that appears to be at particularly high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. However, antiplatelet drugs have not been compared with placebo or with each other in randomized controlled trials specifically for patients with stroke or TIA attributed to ICAS. (See

Aspirin treatment was associated with a significantly lower rate of death than warfarin (4.3 versus 9.7 percent, HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.90). The composite rate of ischemic stroke, brain hemorrhage, or death from vascular cause other than stroke was similar between aspirin and warfarin treatment (22.1 versus 21.8 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% CI 0.73-1.48). The rate of ischemic stroke recurrence in the territory of the stenotic intracranial artery was high for both aspirin and warfarin treatment (15.0 versus 12.1 percent, HR 1.26, 95% CI 0.81-1.97) and primarily occurred within the first year from the qualifying event, suggesting that neither aspirin alone nor warfarin was particularly effective for preventing early recurrent stroke. Of note, the WASID trial was performed before the era of intensive risk factor management that included statin therapy for aggressive LDL-lowering.

         Management of risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, and smoking is a critical component of the treatment of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including those with ischemic stroke. Post hoc analyses from the WASID trial showed that patients with ICAS and poorly controlled blood pressure or elevated cholesterol during follow-up had a significantly higher rate of stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death compared with patients with good control of these risk factors [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. In addition, post hoc analyses of patients in the aggressive medical management only arm of the SAMMPRIS trial (see
         <a class="local">
          'Stenting'
         </a>
         below) found that intensive treatment of blood pressure and LDL-C was important to prevent recurrent vascular events and that physical inactivity was the most important independent predictor of vascular events and stroke [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Given that risk factor control reduces the risk of vascular events and recurrent stroke in patients with heterogeneous causes of stroke (see

          Antihypertensive therapy
         </strong>
         – We treat all patients with hypertension using nonpharmacologic therapy (ie, salt restriction, adequate potassium intake, weight control, healthy diet, limited alcohol intake, and exercise) and pharmacologic therapy. For patients with hypertension, we suggest targeting a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &lt;140 mmHg [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. In the absence of definitive data supporting lower SBP targets in patients with ICAS, we advise caution when pursuing lower targets of SBP (eg, SBP &lt;130 or &lt;120), especially in patients with ICAS and fluctuating neurological symptoms, a recent stroke, or documented low flow on quantitative magnetic resonance angiography. More research is needed to establish an alternative blood pressure target for such patients.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The optimal target blood pressure to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with stroke due to ICAS is informed largely by post hoc analyses and data from a randomized controlled trial. The WASID and SAMMPRIS clinical trials demonstrated that in the vast majority of stable patients with stroke due to ICAS, lowering SBP to &lt;140 mmHg was safe and was associated with a reduced risk of recurrent stroke [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-20
         </a>
         ]. However, targets below 140 mmHg were not studied in those analyses, and emerging data suggests caution should be advised with lower targets. As an example, a randomized controlled trial from Korea of 132 patients with recent subacute stroke due to ICAS found the group assigned to aggressive blood pressure control (mean SBP 124.6 mmHg) had a tendency toward larger infarct volume and more fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at follow-up compared with the group assigned to standard blood pressure control (mean SBP 132 mmHg) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. In the MYRIAD observational study of patients with symptomatic ICAS, a change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to six- to eight-week follow-up was an independent predictor of early recurrent stroke [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Another study found that patients with ICAS who had a low translesional pressure gradient (measured using computational fluid dynamics from computed tomographic angiography) and a mean SBP &lt;130 mmHg during follow-up had an increased risk of recurrent stroke in the territory compared with patients who had a SBP of 130 to 150 mmHg during follow-up [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, a post hoc analysis of the VERiTAS study of patients with posterior circulation stenosis reported that patients with both low flow on quantitative MRI and a mean SBP &lt;140 mmHg had a higher risk of stroke compared with patients lacking one or both of these factors [
         <a href="#rid20">

         Data specific to patients with ICAS has also emerged for the use of high-intensity statins and targeting LDL &lt;70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). A single-center randomized controlled trial of 120 patients from China with symptomatic MCA or basilar stenosis found a lower rate of recurrent cerebrovascular events during follow-up in those treated with high-intensity statins compared with low- and standard-intensity statins [

          Glycemic control
         </strong>
         – Tight glucose control reduces microvascular complications. Diet, exercise, oral hypoglycemic drugs, and insulin are proven methods to achieve glycemic control. A reasonable goal of therapy for most patients with diabetes is a hemoglobin A1C value of ≤7 percent. However, the available evidence has not demonstrated a consistent beneficial effect of intensive glucose-lowering therapy or lifestyle modification for reducing macrovascular outcomes (eg, stroke and death) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

         Although unproven, therapies of last resort for patients who have recurrent ischemic stroke due to ICAS despite maximal medical therapy include endovascular stenting (see
         <a class="local">
          'Stenting'

          'Submaximal angioplasty'
         </a>
         below) as reviewed in the sections below. However, there are no comparative data from randomized trials demonstrating benefit of these treatments over medical therapy that can be used to guide management for patients with recurrent stroke in this setting.

         Intracranial arterial stenting and other interventional procedures are

          1-3

         Intracranial angioplasty without stenting has been studied only in small observational studies [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. There are numerous drawbacks to intracranial angioplasty, including immediate elastic recoil of the artery, intimal damage, dissection, acute vessel closure, residual stenosis &gt;50 percent following the procedure, and high restenosis rates [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-32
         </a>
         ]. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis of balloon angioplasty for ICAS including 25 studies and 674 patients showed a 30-day stroke and death rate of 16.3 percent in patients with severe stenosis [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, angioplasty alone has largely been replaced with submaximal angioplasty to minimize periprocedural complications.

         Extracranial-intracranial bypass, or direct bypass, was mostly abandoned for the treatment of ICAS after the extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass trial results were reported in 1985 [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. In that study, 1377 patients with symptomatic extracranial carotid occlusion, distal carotid occlusive disease, or MCA stenosis were randomly assigned to either medical therapy alone (usually

          aspirin
         </a>
         ) or to extracranial-intracranial anastomosis surgery (joining the superficial temporal artery and the middle cerebral artery) combined with medical therapy. The mean follow-up was 56 months. The results demonstrated that EC-IC bypass was ineffective for preventing stroke in these patients [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Subgroup analyses showed that EC-IC bypass was ineffective in patients with distal carotid stenosis, and was actually hazardous in patients with MCA stenosis [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,35
         </a>
         ]. In 109 patients with ≥70 percent MCA stenosis, stroke frequency was significantly higher for patients who had EC-IC compared with medically treated patients (44 versus 24 percent). Subsequent trials have also failed to show benefit of EC-IC bypass for stroke prevention in patients with symptomatic ICA or MCA stenosis or occlusion [

         Indirect bypass, also known as encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS), is an investigational surgical procedure that showed some early promising results for stroke prevention in ICAS in a two-center prospective uncontrolled study [

          42

Endovascular therapy plus medical treatment led to higher rate of death or stroke at 30 days (12 percent, versus 4 percent for medical therapy alone, absolute risk increase 8 percent, risk ratio [RR] 2.93, 95% CI 1.81-4.75) and at one year (20 versus 13 percent, absolute risk increase 7 percent, RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12-1.99) [

         Trial enrollment in SAMMPRIS was halted prematurely after recruitment of 451 of the planned 764 patients because the 30-day rate of stroke or death was higher for patients treated with angioplasty and stenting compared with those treated with medical therapy alone (14.7 versus 5.8 percent) [

By contrast, there were 12 early strokes in the medical management group, and none were hemorrhagic. In the stenting group, the main cause of the early ischemic strokes was occlusion of perforating vessels. Of the early hemorrhagic strokes, approximately one-half involved predominantly subarachnoid bleeding that was evident immediately after the procedure, while the rest were intraparenchymal hemorrhages that were attributed to reperfusion.

          CASSISS trial
         </strong>
         – The CASSISS trial, conducted at eight sites in China, was an open-label, randomized trial of 358 patients with symptomatic ICAS enrolled at least three weeks after the index stroke that compared angioplasty and stenting with the Wingspan stenting system with medical therapy [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,44
         </a>
         ]. In contrast to SAMMPRIS and VISSIT, CASSISS excluded patients with perforator ischemic events in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem and patients with MRI evidence of recent stroke by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at the time of randomization in order to reduce the risk of periprocedural complications and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage that was seen in earlier trials [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. CASSISS reported a lower primary endpoint rate (a composite of any stroke or death within 30 days or stroke in territory within one year) than prior trials in both the stenting and medical groups (8 versus 7.2 percent, respectively), likely because of the lower-risk population enrolled and differences in event ascertainment during follow-up [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, the CASSISS trial found no benefit over medical therapy from angioplasty and stenting with the Wingspan stenting system for any of the primary or secondary outcome measures. Periprocedural brain hemorrhage affected four patients in the stenting group (two of which were fatal) versus none in the medical group. There was a trend toward higher three-year mortality in the stenting arm (4.4 versus 1.3 percent, 95% CI 0.77-18.13).

         Although stenting for stroke prevention in patients with ICAS has been shown to be harmful in these randomized trials [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ], some physicians treat with stenting as a last resort for patients with high-grade intracranial large artery stenosis who have multiple symptomatic ischemic events. Results from the WEAVE study, an open-label, single-arm postmarket surveillance study of the WINGSPAN stent, suggested that stenting appeared safe with a relatively low risk of recurrent stroke in highly-selected patients with symptomatic ICAS who are at least seven days from their most recent ischemic event and have had two or more recurrent ischemic events in the vascular territory of the stenotic intracranial large artery despite optimal medical management [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. However, patients were only required to be followed for 72 hours or until discharge, and in some cases, assessments were done by phone if the patient was already discharged. Additionally, the stroke and death rate in WEAVE for patients with ICAS who did not meet strict US Food and Drug Administration criteria (eg, did not fail medical therapy, were less than seven days since last stroke, or more than two strokes) was approximately 24 percent [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46,47
         </a>
         ]. Along those lines, another ICAS registry of patients treated with stenting or angioplasty who failed medical therapy or had progressive stroke symptoms reported a 90-day ischemic stroke rate of 6.7 percent and 90-day mortality of 11.2 percent [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Given the high complication rates and low-quality evidence supporting safety in these uncontrolled studies, randomized controlled trials are needed before stenting is adopted as a rescue therapy even in those who have failed medical therapy. Analyses of the SAMMPRIS trial found no benefit for stenting for any subgroup of patients, including those patients with a prior ischemic stroke in the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery and those who had their qualifying ischemic event on antithrombotic therapy [

         Submaximal angioplasty involves angioplasty alone with slow expansion of a balloon undersized to 50 to 70 percent of nominal vessel diameter to limit periprocedural complications. A 2020 meta-analysis identified nine studies (eight retrospective) with 395 patients who had 408 procedures with submaximal angioplasty [

          51
         </a>
         ]. The pooled periprocedural complication rate for stroke or death was approximately 5 percent, while the pooled rate beyond 30 days was approximately 4 percent. Technical success reported in six studies was achieved in approximately 96 percent of procedures. These results compare favorably with periprocedural event rates observed in the stenting and medical treatment arms of the SAMMPRIS and VISSIT trials described above. (See

         in 569 patients with symptomatic stenosis (50 to 99 percent) of a major intracranial found that the ischemic stroke rate in the territory of the stenotic artery at one year was 11 to 12 percent in both treatment groups [

          15
         </a>
         ]. The risk of recurrent stroke is likely lower in the modern era with the advent of intensive medical therapy (ie, dual antiplatelet therapy for three months followed by long-term antiplatelet therapy, antihypertensive, and high-intensity LDL-C lowering treatment), as suggested by stroke rates among medically treated patients in the SAMMPRIS and VISSIT trials. Patients in the medical arm of SAMMPRIS treated with dual-antiplatelet therapy and intensive risk factor control had a lower primary endpoint rate at six months compared with similar patients from WASID with severe stenosis treated with aspirin alone (approximately 9 versus 18 percent, respectively) [

         Intracranial stenosis considered "hemodynamically significant" purely on clinical grounds emerged as another potential risk factor for recurrent ischemic stroke in the GESICA study, a prospective observational report that enrolled 102 patients with ≥50 percent symptomatic intracranial large artery atherosclerotic stenosis [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. Intracranial stenosis was classified as hemodynamic in GESICA if symptoms related to the stenosis occurred during a change in body position from supine to prone, during effort/exertion, or with the introduction or increase of antihypertensive medication. Patients with a hemodynamic stenosis had a higher frequency of recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA in the territory of the stenotic artery than those without a hemodynamic stenosis (61 versus 32 percent). By contrast, among patients in the SAMMPRIS trial with a 70 to 99 percent stenosis who had qualifying symptoms suggestive of hypoperfusion (same definition as above) and were assigned to the aggressive medical management group (n = 31), the two-year probability of an outcome event (ie, 30-day stroke and death and later strokes in the territory of the qualifying artery) was only 7 percent (95% CI 1.8-25.3) [

         The observational VERITAS study analyzed hemodynamics for 72 patients with recent posterior circulation TIA or stroke and &gt;50 percent atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the vertebral and/or basilar arteries [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ]. Low blood flow in these arteries, as determined by quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (QMRA), was associated with an increased risk for subsequent vertebrobasilar stroke (adjusted HR 11.55, 95% CI 1.88-71.00). By contrast, the MyRIAD observational cohort of 105 patients with 50 to 99 percent intracranial stenosis in either the anterior or posterior circulation did not show an association between low flow (as measured by QMRA and perfusion MRI) and recurrent infarcts [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. Given that measures of hemodynamic stability (eg, clinical symptoms, perfusion or flow imaging) inconsistently predict ischemic risk, further research is needed to identify a more accurate biomarker that may be used to select patients at high risk due to hypoperfusion.

         The initial treatment of acute stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to intracranial large artery atherosclerosis (ICAS) is similar to the treatment of acute ischemic stroke or TIA attributed to other mechanisms. An important aspect of the hyperacute phase of acute ischemic stroke management is the rapid determination of patients who are eligible for intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. (See

         For patients with recent (within 30 days) stroke or TIA attributed to intracranial large artery stenosis of 70 to 99 percent, we recommend
         <strong>
          against
         </strong>
         intracranial stenting because there is evidence of harm with higher rates of stroke or death compared with medical therapy alone (

         Although unproven, therapies of last resort for patients who have recurrent ischemic stroke due to ICAS despite maximal medical therapy include indirect bypass, endovascular stenting, or submaximal angioplasty. However, there are no comparative data from randomized trials to suggest these treatments provide benefit over medical therapy. (See
         <a class="local">

         ICAS is associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke. Subgroups that may be at particularly high risk of stroke in the territory of the affected vessel include patients with clinically significant hemodynamic intracranial stenosis, patients with borderzone infarct pattern and impaired collateral flow, patients with severe (≥70 percent) intracranial stenosis, patients with recent ischemic symptoms, and women.
