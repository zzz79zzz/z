         This topic will focus on the treatment of SMVT in patients with structural heart disease. The diagnostic approach to SMVT and the treatment of SMVT during an acute myocardial infarction, as well as the management of nonsustained VT, are discussed separately. The approach to patients with idiopathic VT is also discussed separately. (See

         The initial management of a patient with SMVT depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108831" href="/z/d/graphic/108831.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Emergency management is required in unstable patients, while additional time may be spent determining the etiology and treating any underlying precipitating factors in patients who are hemodynamically stable (although treatment for such patients should usually be promptly administered). Following initial management and stabilization of the patient, subsequent management of the patient will be guided by the initial presentation (ie, hemodynamically stable or unstable) and the initial approach to treatment.

         All patients with SMVT should have a brief immediate assessment of the symptoms, vital signs, and level of consciousness to determine if they are hemodynamic stable or unstable  (

         Differentiation between a hemodynamically stable versus unstable patient is as follows; hemodynamic stability does not necessarily imply SVT with aberrancy, and hemodynamic instability does not always imply VT (see

         An unstable patient will have evidence of hemodynamic compromise (eg, hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, or heart failure [HF]) and may remain awake with a discernible pulse, but may also be unresponsive and pulseless. Patients who become unresponsive or pulseless are considered to have a cardiac arrest and are treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms  (

         A stable patient shows no evidence of hemodynamic compromise despite a sustained rapid heart rate, but should have continuous monitoring and frequent reevaluations due to the potential for rapid deterioration as long as the SMVT persists. (See

         Patients with SMVT who are initially stable may rapidly become unstable, particularly in the setting of extremely rapid heart rates (greater than 200 beats per minute) or significant underlying cardiac comorbidities.

         Patients with SMVT who are hemodynamically unstable and pulseless, or who become pulseless during the course of evaluation and treatment, should be managed according to standard advance cardiac life support (ACLS) resuscitation algorithms, with immediate high-energy countershock and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  (

         ). Patients should initially be treated with a synchronized shock at maximal energy (ie, 200 joule shock from a biphasic defibrillator or a 360 joule shock from a monophasic defibrillator) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Subsequent shocks, if required, should be at the highest output available on the defibrillator. (See

         Patients with SMVT who are
         <strong>
          hemodynamically stable on presentation
         </strong>
         may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. As such, therapy should be promptly provided to most patients. The choice of initial treatments for hemodynamically stable SMVT includes electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108831" href="/z/d/graphic/108831.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). We generally prefer to begin with an intravenous antiarrhythmic agent and reserve electrical cardioversion for refractory patients or for those who become unstable. If SMVT is not terminated with the initial antiarrhythmic drug, external cardioversion may be performed or additional antiarrhythmic therapy may be administered (eg, second bolus of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/z/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">

         There is no consensus on the choice of initial antiarrhythmic medication for patients with stable monomorphic VT. Some of our experts give

          lidocaine

         first, given its ease of rapid administration and because it does not cause hypotension. Other experts choose to give

         as the first antiarrhythmic drug for stable monomorphic VT, even though the time to administer is longer than lidocaine. Lidocaine does not usually cause hypotension, while amiodarone and procainamide often reduce the blood pressure, which may hasten the need for electrical cardioversion.

For patients in whom VT terminates during drug infusion, the intravenous drug can usually be discontinued at that point, unless the patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes. For patients with frequent recurrent episodes, the infusion should be continued, and consideration should be given to initiating oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy or referring for catheter ablation. Regardless of the choice of antiarrhythmic drug, the patient should be reevaluated daily (or more frequently if unstable) to determine the optimal approach to antiarrhythmic therapy.

          Electrical cardioversion —
         </strong>
         If electrical cardioversion with appropriate procedural sedation is the chosen approach, intravenous analgesics or sedatives should be cautiously administered if the blood pressure will tolerate their use. If the QRS complex and T wave can be distinguished, an attempt at synchronized cardioversion can be performed with a synchronized shock of at least 100 joules using either a biphasic or monophasic defibrillator. If the QRS complex and T wave cannot be distinguished accurately, and a synchronized shock is not possible, we administer an unsynchronized 120 to 200 joule shock from a biphasic defibrillator or a 360 joule shock from a monophasic defibrillator. If the initial shock is unsuccessful, subsequent shocks should be delivered at escalating energy levels.

         Treatment of underlying conditions associated with VT, such as myocardial ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, drug proarrhythmia, and HF, as well as decreasing the sympathetic facilitation of SMVT, are important components of the acute management of VT. However, most episodes of SMVT do not have identifiable precipitating factors, and SMVT is rarely precipitated by acute myocardial ischemia or electrolyte imbalance, although it most commonly occurs in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI). The presence of hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should prompt correction of these electrolyte disturbances, but electrolyte abnormalities alone should not be accepted as the cause for SMVT. Some of the standard pharmacologic therapies for cardiomyopathy/HF have been shown to improve survival, in some cases by reducing the incidence of SCD, but have not necessarily been proven to prevent recurrent VT in patients previously manifesting ventricular arrhythmias.

         Chronic therapy of patients with SMVT usually requires utilization of multiple therapeutic modalities, including the ICD, antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation, and/or arrhythmia surgery. In the absence of a clearly identifiable and reversible cause for SMVT occurring in the setting of cardiomyopathy (ischemic or nonischemic), nearly all patients with a history of SMVT will be candidates for ICD insertion to treat recurrent VT, as well as to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), unless the patient refuses or the risks of ICD insertion are felt to outweigh the potential benefits. Patients with multiple recurrent episodes of SMVT resulting in painful ICD shocks should be evaluated for antiarrhythmic drugs or an ablation strategy (either via catheter-based or surgical approaches) to reduce or eliminate the likelihood of additional shocks.

         Patients who survive an episode of SMVT in the setting of structural heart disease (post-MI or nonischemic cardiomyopathy) are typically candidates for implantation of an ICD to treat recurrent VT as well as to reduce the risk of SCD. Although some patients are treated with other therapies, such as antiarrhythmic drugs, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or surgery, an ICD is the most common initial treatment for SMVT, although survival benefit and superiority of the ICD over other therapies have not been established for any particular therapy since these patients were excluded from ICD trials. These other therapies are used either as an adjunct to an ICD or as an alternative in patients who are not candidates for or who refuse ICD therapy.

         Three large, prospective randomized clinical trials (AVID, CASH, and CIDS) and several subsequent meta-analyses have evaluated ICD therapy compared with

         There remains some debate regarding the optimal management of sustained, hemodynamically stable VT in persons with a prior MI but normal or near normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, in whom there is increasing consensus that VT ablation should be considered for primary or initial therapy [

         No antiarrhythmic medication has been demonstrated to reduce the mortality of patients with SMVT, except beta-adrenergic blocking agents. With that in mind, the use of antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with SMVT is typically limited to two settings:

         As an adjunct to an ICD in patients with frequent arrhythmia recurrences and ICD shocks. In a 2016 systematic review that included 2268 patients from eight trials, patients taking an antiarrhythmic drug had significantly lower likelihood of appropriate ICD interventions (odds ratio [OR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-0.97) [

         Antiarrhythmic drugs may also be used to improve quality of life in patients with frequent SMVT leading to ICD shocks, or in those patients who are not candidates for or who decline ICD implantation. In the presence of HF and/or structural heart disease, antiarrhythmic drug therapy is limited to a small number of choices (primarily

         chronically for SMVT (and other indications) should have baseline evaluations and regular follow-up of lung, liver, thyroid, skin and eyes. While historically 400 mg per day was considered an appropriate dose for VT and 200 mg per day an appropriate dose for atrial fibrillation, we strive to find the lowest effective dose to reduce the risk of adverse effects and toxicity. In contemporary practice, amiodarone is rarely used at a dose of 400 mg/day. Patients stable on 400 mg/day initially are generally reduced to 200 mg/day. If a patient is stable on 200 mg daily, we generally propose 200 mg alternating with 100 mg daily, and then eventually 100 mg daily. The risk of recurrent VT on a lower dose, with the possibility of an ICD shock, must be balanced against the desire to reduce the risk of adverse effects in follow-up, which often require discontinuation of the drug.

         In ICD patients treated with oral antiarrhythmic drugs, several issues require consideration. If SMVT recurs in the setting of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, the rate of the tachycardia is generally slower. Detection parameters should therefore be modified. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy may also render SMVT more susceptible to pace termination; increasing the number of ATP sequences may therefore be reasonable. Finally, some antiarrhythmic drugs, particularly

          amiodarone

         , can increase the defibrillation energy requirement. It may therefore be reasonable in some patients to verify the defibrillation safety margin after amiodarone is added.

         For patients with recurrent SMVT resulting in ICD shocks despite treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug, we suggest catheter-based RFA rather than the addition of a second antiarrhythmic agent. RFA is also an alternative to antiarrhythmic drugs as the initial therapy for SMVT [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,37,38

        <p>
         SMVT in patients with a prior MI is usually due to reentry in a circuit created by the heterogeneous electrical properties of residual myocardium in the region of the scar from the infarct. However, other mechanisms such as abnormal automaticity or triggered activity may occasionally occur. RFA can alter or eliminate such circuits or foci and prevent VT recurrence in selected patients.

          "Overview of catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias"

         While no technique has proven to be universally effective or clearly superior, smaller nonrandomized studies have suggested lower rates of VT recurrence following more extensive ablation [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39-43
         </a>
         ]. Subsequently, in a multicenter trial of 118 patients with hemodynamically tolerated VT and ischemic cardiomyopathy, in which patients were randomized to clinical ablation of inducible VT (60 patients) or substrate-based ablation targeting all "abnormal" electrograms seen on mapping (58 patients) and followed for 12 months, patients in the substrate-based ablation group had significantly fewer VT recurrences (16 versus 48 percent), less need for antiarrhythmic drugs (12 versus 58 percent), and fewer hospitalizations (12 versus 32 percent) compared with patients in the clinical VT ablation group [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. There was no difference in periprocedural complications between the two approaches; however, 22 patients in the substrate-based ablation group also underwent EP study and induction of VT, raising some concerns that this may have improved the efficacy of the ablation procedure in the substrate-based group. While these data are encouraging, additional data in larger numbers of patients and additional populations are required prior to recommending widespread implementation of the substrate-based ablation technique, even in patients with hemodynamically-tolerated VT. Additionally, a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized trials suggests significantly lower rates of recurrent VT following a combined endocardial/epicardial ablation compared with endocardial ablation alone, in particular among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. (See

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Ablation performed via an epicardial approach is another option for select patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Among a cohort of 444 consecutive patients with VT and prior MI who were referred for catheter ablation, 27 patients (6 percent) had successful epicardial ablation of at least one VT after endocardial ablation failed [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Some advocate epicardial in addition to endocardial ablation when performing substrate-based ablation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with contrast enhancement is also being investigated as a means of identifying critical sites for reentrant ventricular tachyarrhythmias [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. In one study of 20 patients (mixed nonischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy) with prior failed endocardial catheter ablation, CMR with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging was performed, and subsequently ablation strategies were modified based on LGE findings (nine patients underwent epicardial ablation, while 11 underwent repeat endocardial ablation) [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48

         In the VANISH trial, VT ablation was shown to lower VT storm and appropriate ICD shocks. In this a multicenter, non-blinded study, 259 patients with prior MI and a previously implanted ICD who had at least one episode of VT within the preceding six months while on antiarrhythmic drug therapy were randomly assigned to catheter ablation (132 patients) or escalated antiarrhythmic therapy. Antiarrhythmic therapy was defined as initiating or increasing the dose of

          52
         </a>
         ]. Over a mean follow-up of 28 months, patients in the ablation group had a significantly lower rate of the composite primary outcome of death, VT storm, or appropriate ICD shock (59 versus 69 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98). The difference in outcomes was driven by reductions in VT storm and ICD shocks in the ablation group, as there was no significant difference in total mortality between the two groups.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is continuing concern over evidence that ICD shocks, both "appropriate" and "inappropriate," have adverse effects on survival [

         – Among patients with cardiomyopathy (ischemic, nonischemic, or arrythmia-related), early catheter ablation performed at the time of ICD implantation significantly reduced the composite primary outcome of VT recurrence, cardiovascular hospitalization, or death [

Participants were randomly assigned to either early VT ablation plus ICD, or medical therapy plus ICD, and were followed for a composite of VT recurrence, cardiovascular hospitalization, or death. Participants assigned to early VT ablation were observed to have fewer primary adverse events compared with the control group (49.3 versus 65.5 percent, HR 0.58 95% CI 0.35-0.96). The observed difference was driven by a reduction in VT recurrence (31.7 versus 50.8 percent), ICD shocks (10 versus 24.6 percent), and antitachycardia pacing (16.2 versus 32.8 percent) in the VT ablation compared with control group. However, no differences in cardiovascular hospitalization (32 versus. 33.7) or mortality (8.9 versus 8.8 percent) were observed. Complications occurred in 8.3 percent of patients.

         ]. The study randomly assigned 47 such patients to either a VT ablation prior to ICD or standard therapy and followed them for the development of death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Over a median follow-up of 2.4 years, patients assigned to ablation were less likely to experience death or HF hospitalization (4 versus 42 percent, HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.85) compared with the control group. The trial was stopped early because it showed early benefit. The ablation group was observed to have fewer deaths (0 versus 33 percent), fewer ICD shocks (9 versus 42 percent), and statistically similar but numerically less HF hospitalizations (4 versus 17 percent).

         ]. In this study, patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction from 30 to 50 percent) and documented VT were randomly assigned ICD and preventive ablation (76 patients) at the time of enrollment or deferred ablation (83 patients) after three or more appropriate ICD shocks [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

After a mean follow-up of 13 months, there was no significant difference in the composite primary outcome of death or unplanned hospitalization for VT or HF (33 percent in the early ablation group versus 28 percent in the deferred ablation group), at which point the study was also terminated early for futility. Fewer patients in the early ablation group received appropriate ICD therapy (34 versus 47 percent) or experienced sustained VT (40 versus 48 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         BERLIN-VT may have had null findings because this study included only patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (whereas PAUSE-SCD [

         Consistent with the findings of most individual trials, earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that, compared with medical therapy alone, VT ablation generally does not improve mortality but leads to significantly fewer episodes of recurrent VT and VT storm, as well as lower likelihood of an appropriate ICD intervention [

         The potential risks and benefits of the ablation procedure include those risks associated with any invasive electrophysiology (EP) study alone  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ), although the overall incidence of complications is higher with ablation, which is a lengthier procedure typically performed in higher-risk patients. In a nationwide sample of 4653 patients who underwent ablation in the United States between 2002 and 2011 for post-MI VT, the overall in-hospital complication rate was 11 percent with in-hospital mortality of 1.6 percent [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60

         As experience with catheter-based RFA accumulates among patients with VT, rates of early mortality and procedural complications appear to be declining. In a registry of 2061 patients with structural heart disease (mean age 62 years, mean LVEF 34 percent; 53 percent ischemic cardiomyopathy) who underwent RFA for VT (including 35 percent with VT storm), procedure-related complications occurred in 127 patients (7 percent), although in-hospital procedure-related mortality occurred in only 12 patients (0.6 percent) [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. Early all-cause mortality at 31 days occurred in 100 patients (5 percent), with a greater likelihood of early mortality associated with lower LVEF, worse renal function, and pre-ablation VT storm. Among patients for whom data were available on mode of death, the cause was more frequently deemed advancing HF rather than to worsening arrhythmias (39 versus 22 percent). In a different study of 1251 patients who underwent RFA for VT between 2002 and 2013 and were enrolled in the international VT registry, LVEF &lt;30 percent, previous ablation attempt, and presentation with electrical storm were the factors most associated with higher mortality [

         Patients undergoing catheter ablation are also at risk of hemodynamic decompensation during or after the procedure. Among a single-center cohort of 193 consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation for scar-related VT, acute hemodynamic decompensation (defined as persistent hypotension in spite of vasopressors requiring mechanical support or discontinuation of the procedure) occurred in 22 patients (11 percent) [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63
         </a>
         ]. Patients with acute hemodynamic decompensation were more likely to be older, have diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have more severe HF, and more often received general anesthesia. In a separate multicenter cohort of 1365 patients (mean age 64 years, mean LVEF 30 percent) with HF undergoing VT ablation, including 111 patients with NYHA class 4 symptoms, there was no significant difference in the rate of acute complications between patients with NYHA class 2/3 symptoms (7 percent) and those with NYHA class 4 symptoms (10 percent), suggesting that VT ablation is safe for patients with the most severe HF symptoms [

         Although surgical therapies for SMVT are rarely performed today, they do remain a viable therapeutic option for selected patients with SMVT. Arrhythmia surgery is particularly useful when surgical revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) is also planned, since it offers added hemodynamic benefits, including improvement in LVEF and alleviation of symptoms of HF, especially those requiring CABG and/or LV aneurysmectomy.

         Surgical ablation using endocardial resection was the mainstay of therapy for recurrent SMVT following MI unresponsive to pharmacologic therapy until the early 1990s, when RF catheter ablation for VT became feasible. A variety of surgical approaches with inconsistent efficacy have been performed, including LV aneurysmectomy, bilateral sympathectomy, encircling endocardial ventriculotomy, and subendocardial resection. Using LV aneurysmectomy as an example, the association of VT with LV aneurysms has been noted since the early 1900s, but aneurysmectomy alone has shown to have limited success in curing VT, presumably due to the fact that VTs may arise from the border of the aneurysm which is rarely excised during conventional aneurysmectomy [

          66

         Subsequently, in a prospective nonrandomized single arm study of 19 patients (17 for VT, two for premature ventricular complex/contraction [PVC; also referred to a premature ventricular beats or premature ventricular depolarizations]) who underwent stereotactic radiation therapy, median VT (or PVC) burden was markedly reduced, and the procedure was generally safe and well-tolerated (two patients developed radiation pneumonitis, six developed pericardial effusions [five of which were asymptomatic]) [

         In another series of 10 patients who underwent stereotactic radiation therapy after failed catheter ablation and were followed for a median of 28 months, 8 of 10 patients experienced recurrent VT during follow-up, although the overall VT burden was reduced by 88 percent [

         Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) is defined as a regular, wide (≥120 milliseconds) QRS complex tachycardia with uniform and stable QRS morphology at a rate of more than 100 beats per minute that lasts for 30 seconds or longer or causes hemodynamic collapse within 30 seconds.

         All patients with SMVT should have a brief immediate assessment of the symptoms, vital signs, and level of consciousness to determine if they are hemodynamic stable or unstable. Differentiation between a hemodynamically unstable versus stable patient depends upon hemodynamic compromise, such as hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, or heart failure (HF). (See

          hemodynamically unstable and pulseless
         </strong>
         , or who become pulseless during the course of evaluation and treatment, should be managed according to standard advance cardiac life support (ACLS) resuscitation algorithms, with immediate high-energy countershock and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  (

         For patients with wide complex tachycardia (WCT) who are hemodynamically unstable, but still responsive with a discernible blood pressure and pulse, we recommend urgent cardioversion (following administration of sedation) (

         If electrical cardioversion with appropriate procedural sedation is the chosen approach, intravenous analgesics or sedatives should be cautiously administered if the blood pressure will tolerate their use. If the QRS complex and T wave can be distinguished, an attempt at synchronized cardioversion can be performed with a synchronized shock of 100 joules using either a biphasic or monophasic defibrillator.

         Treatment of underlying conditions associated with VT, such as myocardial ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, drug proarrhythmia, and HF, as well as decreasing the sympathetic facilitation of SMVT, are important components of the acute management of VT. (See

         Chronic therapy of patients with SMVT usually requires utilization of multiple therapeutic modalities, including the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), antiarrhythmic drugs, radiofrequency catheter ablation, and/or arrhythmia surgery.

         In the absence of a clearly identifiable and reversible cause for SMVT, nearly all patients with a history of SMVT will be candidates for ICD insertion for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death, unless the patient refuses or the risks of ICD insertion are felt to outweigh the potential benefits. (See
         <a class="local">

         Nearly all patients who experience SMVT have an indication for therapy with a beta blocker, including patients with a prior myocardial infarction, patients with HF and reduced LV systolic function, etc. Beta blockers provide some level of protection against recurrent SMVT, primarily by reducing myocardial oxygen demand and blocking sympathetic input to the heart. (See
         <a class="local">

         Antiarrhythmic drugs may also be used to improve quality of life in patients with frequent SMVT leading to ICD shocks, or in those patients who are not candidates for, or who decline, ICD implantation.

          Amiodarone

         has generally been the most effective antiarrhythmic drug for preventing ventricular arrhythmias (and associated ICD shocks). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Antiarrhythmic drugs'

         </span>
         For patients with recurrent SMVT resulting in ICD shocks despite treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug, we suggest radiofrequency ablation (RFA) rather than the addition of a second antiarrhythmic agent (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). RFA is also an alternative to antiarrhythmic drugs as the initial therapy for SMVT. In addition, RFA, with or without antiarrhythmic drug therapy, is an option for patients with SMVT who are not candidates for or who refuse ICD implantation. (See
         <a class="local">
