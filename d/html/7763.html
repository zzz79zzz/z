         Every patient with a chronic joint disorder should be educated regarding the principles of joint protection, as excess stress and strain on arthritic joints can add to inflammation and degeneration [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The goal of lower extremity joint protection is to avoid overloading vulnerable joints/tissues, prevent recurrent sprains and strains, reduce pain and inflammation, and thus preserve joint integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Joint protection is best achieved through patient education, behavior modification, energy conservation; in selected cases, use of orthotic devices, splints, adaptive devices; and, in the case of the lower extremities, proper footwear. Conservative care includes preventive care, and joint protection is a fundamental way to provide preventive joint care.
        </p>
        <p>
         Joint protection for the lower extremities will be reviewed here. An overview of joint protection and joint protection for the upper extremities and neck are discussed elsewhere. (See

         The principles of joint protection are derived from the simple, practical application of proper body mechanics, posture, and positioning of joints. Joint protection reduces local joint stress and preserves joint integrity. Guiding the patient to perform a task in a manner that puts less stress on joints is generally preferred to prohibiting the task [

         Pain may be interpreted as a signal for the patient to modify or avoid the activities that cause pain. In the acute phase of pain (less than 12 weeks since onset), respecting pain and minimizing activities that cause an excessive load on the joint is a useful strategy. In chronic pain states (more than 12 weeks since onset), it is important to also recognize that loss of strength, flexibility, coordination, and function create significant cognitive and psychological distress that may hinder long-term recovery. In this instance, the recovery may require gradual reconditioning with the guidance of clinicians, physical therapists, personal trainers, and pain psychologists. In this latter state of chronic pain, the patient needs to make regular movement part of the daily regimen, not contingent on whether or not there is pain ongoing.

         Patients should warm up before doing exercises or vigorous activity and cool down afterwards. A warm up should consist of 5 to 10 minutes of gentle joint range-of-motion exercises or any gentle activity that increases the heart rate. A cool down should involve gently slowing down the activity/exercise to help gradually decrease the heart rate followed by gentle stretches and/or range-of-motion exercises for approximately 10 minutes.

         We advise that patients should choose footwear with comfort, support, and utility in mind, and that patients should not wear shoes that cause pain or fatigue. Individualized assessment is an important component of a joint protection intervention. If a shoe hurts, it is likely placing excessive stress on the joints and soft tissues, which could contribute to injury and long-term problems, especially in arthritic joints.

         The history of past shoe wear may be important for women with current foot pain. Women who wore "good shoes," compared with women who wore "average shoes," in the past were 67 percent less likely to report hindfoot pain [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. This study, using data from the Framingham (MA) study, defined "good shoes" as low-risk shoes, including athletic and casual sneakers with rigid heel counters, fixation, or firm, non-flexible soles. "Average shoes" included those with hard or rubber soles, special shoes, and work boots. "Poor shoes" included those that lack support and sound structure, including high-heeled shoes, sandals, and slippers.

         Appropriate shoes should provide support and comfort for the weightbearing foot, with room for the toes to extend fully and to broaden out during weightbearing. A certified pedorthist can construct custom shoes, with a doctor's prescription, for patients with structural foot deformities. In addition, orthotics may be obtained from a medical equipment company with the advice and assistance of a treating physical therapist or podiatrist. If a patient has a structural deformity that may require custom-made orthotics, then it is advised that the patient pursue a podiatry consultation.

         Running shoes, walking shoes, or aerobics shoes are more supportive and comfortable to the flexible or arthritic foot. Good running shoes and arch supports are important. It is important to remember to replace running or walking shoes regularly. Running and walking shoes should be replaced every 300 to 500 miles.

         A metatarsal pad or bar can be used to relieve pressure or pain at the forefoot. A certified orthotist can make a custom fit orthotic with a metatarsal pad. A metatarsal pad helps unload the metatarsal heads, which can decrease pain at the forefoot. Metatarsal pads can be purchased over the counter or online; however, patients with special footcare needs or foot deformities may need to have a custom fit metatarsal pad made by an orthotist.

         Orthoses can provide needed support and positioning assistance. We suggest consultation with an experienced professional regarding the choice of an orthosis, whether having it custom-made or obtaining it over-the-counter. For patients with structural foot deformities, custom orthoses can be fit and made by a certified orthotist, physical therapist, podiatrist, or a certified pedorthist, with the appropriate prescription from a podiatrist (or physical therapist). Orthoses should then be used in both sports shoes and everyday shoes.

         There is no consensus on the choice of foot orthoses used for managing pathology in the rheumatoid foot, although there is strong evidence that foot orthoses do reduce pain and improve functional ability.

         Assistive devices such as a cane or a walker should be considered if joint pain, swelling, and/or inflammation alter gait mechanics or lead to joint instability. A physical therapist can be consulted to determine the most appropriate device and fit. A physical therapist will also instruct a patient on how to properly and safely use the appropriate assistive device. For example, canes are frequently misused and placed in the same hand as the affected limb. A cane should be used in the hand opposite the affected joint/limb to effectively reduce the load on the affected joint/limb, which helps normalize gait mechanics. It is important to avoid using a cane in the same hand as the affected limb as this will not effectively reduce loading on the affected joint/limb or help to correct existing gait abnormalities. For example, if the left knee is swollen and painful then the cane should be used in the right hand to effectively reduce the load on the left knee. (See

         Knee joint protection: Knee joint loading is an important factor in the progression of OA. Excessive medial joint loading of the knee occurs with a high adduction moment, which increases as the knee becomes more varus. Patients with a varus alignment demonstrate a higher incidence of medial compartment OA. Therefore, varus alignment is widely accepted as an indicator of the extent of medial compartment loading. A 1 percent increase in adduction moment increases the risk of OA progression by 6.46 times and is a useful research measure for evaluating treatment strategies designed to slow disease [

         Support for the benefits of exercise were shown in a trial to examine the effects of diet and exercise on pain and function in overweight patients with knee pain, in which 389 such patients were randomly assigned to a home-based program with one of four conditions: dietary intervention plus quadriceps strengthening, dietary intervention alone, quadriceps strengthening alone, and advice leaflet only [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. At 24 months, those in exercise interventions had a significantly greater frequency of achieving a moderate reduction in knee pain and improved knee function compared with those in the other groups. While moderate sustained weight loss was achieved with dietary intervention and was associated with decreased depression, there was no apparent impact on pain or function.

         It is important to note that people having an active RA flare can engage in an exercise program, as tolerated. One study found that moderate- or high-intensity weightbearing exercises are safe with respect to disease activity and radiologic damage of hands and feet; however, caution should be taken when prescribing long-term, high-intensity weightbearing exercises to patients who have significant radiologic damage to larger joints [

         Both upright stationary cycling and recumbent cycling are useful for maintaining fitness and are good alternatives to walking, especially when walking may be too painful or difficult. When selecting a specific cycling modality, it is important to ensure that the exercise does not increase pain and that the person using a recumbent or upright bike can get on and off safely. The choice of modality depends upon several factors:

         For people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, upright cycling at both high and low intensity levels is usually safe and effective; it can help improve function, gait, and aerobic capacity, and reduce pain [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ].

         In individuals with functional deficits in performing sit to stand and step-ups, and those who have mobility limitations, a recumbent bike should be considered. Additionally, a recumbent bike is preferred following repair of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and for those with anterior or posterior knee instability.
        </p>
        <p>

         </span>
         In people with generalized or low back pain, the recumbent bike may be a better alternative because it provides much more support to the back and may be more comfortable. The recumbent bike is also considered a safer alternative to the upright bike during rehabilitation, due to ease of access because of the larger and lower seat, back support, and side rails [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39,40

        <p>

        <p>
         Cycling minimizes stress to the knee, as forces generated at the knee are no greater for cycling than for walking [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41,42
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, cycling results in lower tibiofemoral compressive forces compared with walking (forces comparable to bodyweight with cycling and 2.8 to 3.5 times bodyweight when walking at about 5 km [about 3 miles] per hour), while still improving general health [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43,44
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study, findings suggested that riding the recumbent bike had a reduced knee extensor moment and may promote the use of the hip extensors, as the hip-extension moment was higher when compared with the upright bike [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. This finding could translate to improvements in functional movements such as sit to stand and step-up. Another study determined that recumbent cycling was an effective specific training modality for the sit to stand and step up movements, particularly when used in the early rehabilitation process, when a person does not have the strength to perform the task [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the higher hip extensor moment and reduced knee extensor moment is an important consideration when rehabilitating the postop ACL patient or persons post-ACL or -posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury, as the upright cycling position was found to have higher anterior and posterior shear forces [

         Patients with chronic joint disorders should be educated regarding the principles of joint protection, as excess strain on arthritis joints can worsen inflammation and joint injury. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>
         above.)

         The principles of joint protection are derived from the simple, practical application of proper body mechanics, posture, and positioning of joints. Guiding the patient to perform a task in a manner that puts less stress on joints is generally preferred to prohibiting the task. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Principles of joint protection'
         </a>
         above.)

         It is important for patients with any arthritic condition to understand that pain is usually an indicator that a particular activity is placing an excessive load on the joint; pain may thus be interpreted as a signal for the patient to modify or avoid the activity. Patients should warm up before doing exercises or vigorous activity and perform a cool down after the activity/exercise. We advise that patients should choose footwear with comfort, support, and utility in mind, and that patients should not wear shoes that cause pain or fatigue. Individualized assessment is an important component of a joint protection intervention. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Respect pain'
         </a>
         above.)

         We advise that patients maintain an appropriate weight to reduce stress on the knees, feet, and ankles. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Reduce excess body weight'
         </a>
         above.)

         We advise that patients use good posture and proper body mechanics. These points should be reviewed with patients and should be individualized depending upon their particular activities or symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Posture and body mechanics'
         </a>
         above.)

         Patient should be advised to use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job. This not only protects the joints but also plays a role in energy conservation. Specific strategies should be individualized to the patients' activities and needs. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Minimum force'
         </a>
         above.)

         Regular exercise is recommended to help maintain function, joint range of motion, strength, and balance. Patients requiring lower-limb joint protection may benefit from exercises such as stationary biking, walking, or aquatic exercise, and should participate in exercise activities on a regular rather than occasional basis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Regular exercise'
         </a>
         above.)

         Multiple resources are available to assist both patients and clinicians in strategies for joint protection. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Resources for task-related pain (occupational injuries)'
