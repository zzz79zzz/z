To these ends, all patients should receive optimal medical therapy, which is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1483.html" rel="external">"Chronic coronary syndrome: Overview of care"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the evidence comparing optimal medical therapy with revascularization plus optimal medical therapy in patients with chronic coronary syndrome.

Stress testing is indicated soon after the diagnosis is made or if there is a major change in symptoms status. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test", section on 'Indications for stress testing'</a>.)</p><p>Diagnostic coronary angiography should be performed if the information obtained might lead to a decision to perform revascularization.

These include patients with:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Left main coronary artery stenosis or left main equivalent disease.

However, many of our experts prefer revascularization of proximal LAD stenosis in patients with confirmed ischemia. This issue is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1544.html" rel="external">"Management of significant proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease"</a>.) </p><p>The evidence of survival benefit with revascularization comes principally from older studies of patients undergoing CABG. Since most of the evidence favoring CABG was obtained before contemporary PCI and standard use of optimal medical therapy, these options are also evolving and require individualized decision-making based on anatomy, clinical setting, and procedural risk. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1579.html" rel="external">"Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H720333"><span class="h2">Relief of angina</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For many patients who have not had adequate control of anginal symptoms with optimal medical therapy, revascularization may improve symptom status [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. </p><p>The 2020 ISCHEMIA trial randomized patients with chronic coronary disease to revascularization (PCI or CABG) plus medical therapy and lifestyle changes or to an initial strategy of medical therapy and lifestyle change. Although this trial did not show a reduction in death or myocardial infarction, ISCHEMIA confirmed that an early invasive strategy resulted in better symptom relief and angina-related quality of life [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Among those with daily or weekly angina at the start of the study, 45 percent of those who were randomized to revascularization and medical therapy were angina-free after a year, compared with 15 percent of those treated with medical therapy alone. Improvements in angina-related quality of life persisted for four years in ISCHEMIA, among those who had at least weekly angina at baseline. </p><p>However, the 2017 ORBITA trial did not find that angina was reduced by revascularization. This trial randomly assigned 230 patients with angina and severe (≥70 percent) single-vessel stenosis to PCI with a current-generation DES or a placebo procedure after six weeks of medical therapy optimization [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Evaluation with exercise testing, symptom questionnaires, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9380" href="/z/d/drug information/9380.html" rel="external">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography was performed before randomization and at six-week follow-up. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the primary endpoint of exercise time increment (28.4 versus 11.8 seconds, respectively; difference in increment between groups 16.6 seconds, 95% CI -8.9 to 42 seconds; p = 0.200). Similarly, there were no differences in the rates of other exercise variables or patient-reported anginal symptoms. Prior studies have suggested that interventions that improve exercise time by more than 30 seconds are clinically relevant. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H200525618"><span class="h1">PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION VERSUS CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT SURGERY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A detailed discussion of when to choose percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1579.html" rel="external">"Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a> and <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h1">PATIENTS WITHOUT CLEAR INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In some patients with stable coronary artery disease, the choice between revascularization and optimal medical therapy is not clear. This section will provide some guidance. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3023031756"><span class="h2">Uncertain efficacy of revascularization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies that have evaluated a potential benefit of revascularization have included patients with a broad spectrum of disease severity; more recent studies have focused on those without high-risk anatomy such as left main disease.</p><p>A 2021 meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in cardiac deaths and new acute myocardial infarctions with revascularization [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This study included 25 clinical trials (n = 19,806 patients) of revascularization (with either CABG or PCI) plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone. Individuals randomized to elective coronary revascularization had reduced cardiac mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67-0.93). The survival benefit after revascularization improved with longer follow-up times and was also associated with fewer spontaneous myocardial infarctions (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64-0.86). Other clinical trials and meta-analyses comparing optimal medical therapy with PCI have suggested a possible benefit in reduced spontaneous MI and urgent revascularization from PCI [<a href="#rid11">11-16</a>].</p><p>These findings contrast with those of individual studies that found only a limited and uncertain benefit for PCI. In the 2007 COURAGE trial, no significant difference in survival was found between patients assigned to either optimal medical therapy alone versus aggressive medical therapy plus PCI with bare-metal stents [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. In the 2020 ISCHEMIA trial, 5179 patients with chronic coronary syndrome were treated with an early invasive strategy with revascularization (PCI or CABG) plus medical therapy and lifestyle changes or with an initial strategy of medical therapy and lifestyle change [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Revascularization was reserved for treatment failure. At five years, cardiac events and mortality were similar in the two treatment groups. In ISCHEMIA, rates of spontaneous myocardial infarctions were reduced with PCI, although rates of procedural myocardial infarctions were higher in the group that received PCI. Individuals in the revascularization arm had less angina. (See <a class="local">'Relief of angina'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h2">Patient preference</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After a thorough discussion of the potential benefits and risks of revascularization, patient preference becomes important for those who are not found to have anatomy that mandates revascularization based on a survival benefit. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p>This discussion should take place before diagnostic coronary angiography, since percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often performed immediately after in part so that the patient does not have to undergo two invasive procedures. The discussion should emphasize both the <strong>benefits</strong> of PCI (eg, less angina and a lower likelihood of requiring an intervention in the first few years) and the <strong>drawbacks</strong> of PCI, including the inherent risks of the procedure and the potential problems of long-term <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1582.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1562.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.) </p><p>In some cases, the indication for revascularization or the decision between PCI and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) are less clear. It is important to have additional discussions with the patient after diagnostic angiography and before proceeding with PCI. In those cases that may be considered for PCI or CABG, we agree with the concept of the "heart team" to fully discuss the risks and benefits of both PCI and CABG, as well as optimal medical therapy. We support the "heart team" approach to decision-making, in which an interventional cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, and other health care professionals discuss revascularization options with the patient in advance of the procedure [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H720449"><span class="h2">Severity of coronary artery disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients with chronic coronary syndrome who have unclear indications for PCI (eg, intermediate coronary artery narrowing of 50 to 70 percent diameter by visual estimate), the severity and extent of atherosclerotic narrowing in a coronary artery can be assessed with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and using coronary flow pressure measurement. IVUS provides intracoronary imaging and can assess plaque anatomic characteristics, whereas coronary pressure artery pressure flow is a physiology-based assessment that allows calculation of the fractional flow reserve (FFR); the FFR is calculated from catheter-based pressure measurements taken proximal and distal to the coronary artery obstruction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1514.html" rel="external">"Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16536.html" rel="external">"Intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and angioscopy of coronary circulation", section on 'IVUS clinical applications'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>FFR </strong>– There is some evidence that in patients with more severe coronary artery disease, but who do not meet criteria for CABG, outcomes are better with PCI than optimal medical therapy. In the FAME 2 randomized trial, patients with stable coronary artery disease who were being considered for PCI underwent diagnostic coronary angiography and subsequent evaluation of all stenoses that were thought to be angiographically significant with FFR measurement [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1514.html" rel="external">"Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements", section on 'Multivessel disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with at least one stenosis in a major coronary artery with an FFR of 0.80 or less were randomly assigned to FFR-guided PCI (all stenoses with FFR ≤0.80 were treated with a drug-eluting stent) plus best medical therapy or best medical therapy alone. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or unplanned hospitalization leading to urgent revascularization at 24 months. The study was stopped early (after randomization of 888 of the projected 1632 patients) by the data and safety monitoring board. After a mean duration of follow-up of 213 days, the primary endpoint occurred less often in patients who underwent PCI (4.3 versus 12.7 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.32, 95% CI 0.19-0.53). At two-year follow-up, the rate of the primary endpoint was lower in the PCI group (8.1 versus 19.5 percent; HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26-0.57) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. This result was driven by a lower rate of urgent revascularization in the PCI group (4 versus 16.3 percent; HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.14-0.38). The results were similar at five years [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Important limitations of FAME 2 include the absence of noninvasive documentation of ischemia prior to diagnostic coronary angiography, the possibility (in the absence of blinding) that the threshold for referring patients for PCI was lower in the medical therapy group, and the fact that it was stopped early [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Despite these limitations, we believe FAME 2 supports the use of PCI in patients with documented ischemia involving at least a moderate myocardial territory. We prefer to limit the use of FFR in this setting to intermediate lesions (50 to 70 percent diameter stenosis by visual estimate) or cases where the documentation of at least moderate ischemia is equivocal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>FFR versus IVUS </strong>– We use FFR to guide PCI in patients with intermediate-risk coronary disease and reserve IVUS as a complementary modality to assess plaque anatomy. One randomized trial supports this approach [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. In the FLAVOUR Trial of 1682 patients with chronic coronary syndrome and intermediate stenosis who were being evaluated for PCI, patients who were assigned guidance by FFR compared with IVUS had a similar risk of death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization at 24-month follow up (absolute difference, -0.4 percentage points) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The study also reported the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intermediate stenosis was 40 to 70 percent visual occlusion on coronary angiography.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients underwent PCI if FFR was ≤0.8, or if upon IVUS, the minimal lumen area measured ≤3 mm<sup>2</sup> or 3 to 4 mm<sup>2</sup> with a plaque burden or &gt;70 percent.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Less patients in the FFR group were guided to PCI compared with the IVUS group (44.4 versus 65.3 percent).</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patient-reported angina as reported on the Seattle Angina Questionnaire was similar in the two groups.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h2">Reduced left ventricular systolic function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For the most part, patients enrolled in the randomized trials discussed above have had normal or near normal left ventricular systolic function.

In the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial, 777 patients with advanced kidney disease and moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing were randomized to initial invasive strategy of coronary angiography and revascularization added to medical therapy versus conservative medical therapy alone [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. At a median follow-up of 2.2 years, a primary outcome event (composite of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) had occurred in 123 patients in the invasive group and in 129 patients in the conservative group (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.79-1.29). There was also no difference in angina-related quality of life assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire summary score. The invasive strategy was associated more strokes (22 versus 6 participants [HR 3.76, 95% CI 1.52-9.32]) and with more death or initiation of dialysis (75 versus 66 participants [HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.04-2.11]). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H183409538"><span class="h1">RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We generally agree with recommendations made by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology [<a href="#rid27">27-29</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4281666119"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
