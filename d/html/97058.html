         The evaluation of illness in returned travelers should focus on the possible infections given the patient's clinical findings, travel geography, administration (if any) of vaccinations and malaria chemoprophylaxis, the nature and timeframe of potential exposure(s), and the incubation period(s) of the relevant possible infections  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75701" href="/z/d/graphic/75701.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Good resources that provide current information about the infections that occur in various geographic areas are essential [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website includes an online version of Health Information for International Travel under Travelers' Health and updates on travel-related infections [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. The World Health Organization (WHO) website also has regularly updated information about outbreaks.

         The approach to evaluation of illness associated with travel to West Africa will be reviewed here.

         The initial laboratory evaluation for travelers with fever should include complete blood count and differential, liver enzymes, blood cultures and blood smears and rapid diagnostic test for malaria (if there was exposure to an area with malaria transmission), and/or rapid diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses. Additional studies depend upon exposures and other factors  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with exposure to an area with malaria transmission should have diagnostic tests performed promptly (on the day of the encounter). Because parasites may be sequestered in the deep vasculature in patients with falciparum malaria, few parasites may be visible on a peripheral smear even in severe infection. Therefore, if the initial smear is negative, additional smears should be evaluated over the subsequent 24 to 72 hours. Rapid diagnostic tests should be used if available. (See

         Malaria is characterized by fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and myalgia. Any patient with fever who has spent time in a region where malaria is endemic should be evaluated for malaria, even if afebrile at the time of evaluation  (

         Malaria is transmitted by

          Anopheles

         mosquitoes. The incubation period of malaria is usually 7 to 30 days (but may be longer). The diagnosis of malaria is established by visualization of parasites on peripheral smear. (See

         The efficacy of various malaria chemoprophylactic regimens varies by geographic region; even in areas where no resistance has been reported, malaria chemoprophylaxis is not 100 percent effective. Use of chemoprophylaxis may delay the malaria symptom onset [

Classic manifestations include relative bradycardia, pulse-temperature dissociation, and "rose spots" (faint salmon-colored macules on the trunk and abdomen). Hepatosplenomegaly, intestinal bleeding, and perforation may occur, leading to secondary bacteremia and peritonitis. The disease occurs worldwide; regions of highest incidence include South Asia, Southeast Asia, and southern Africa. Transmission is fecal-oral; the incubation period is 6 to 30 days.

The incubation period is typically 6 to 12 days but can range from 2 to 21 days. The 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the largest recorded, with widespread transmission occurring in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Clinical manifestations include abrupt onset of nonspecific symptoms and signs such as fever, malaise, headache, and myalgias; as the illness progresses, vomiting and diarrhea may develop. Patients with worsening disease develop hypotension and multiorgan failure, sometimes accompanied by hemorrhage. The diagnosis is established by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood or other body fluids ≥3 days after symptom onset. (See

          Anthrax
         </strong>
         (rare) – Cutaneous anthrax is characterized by a painless papule that enlarges, develops a central vesicle, and subsequently erodes, leaving a necrotic ulcer with a black depressed eschar. Extensive surrounding edema, regional lymphadenopathy, and fever may be present. Anthrax is transmitted by contact with animals or animal materials (eg, skin) contaminated with anthrax spores; it occurs in agricultural regions in Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Central and Southwestern Asia, and Southern and Eastern Europe. The incubation period is one to seven days; the diagnosis is established via culture or by two supportive nonculture methods. (See

Humans can acquire the infection by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs infected with the parasite. Clinical manifestations include headache, neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, and fever. The incubation period of
         <em>

         averages one to three weeks. The diagnosis is based upon the clinical presentation, presence of eosinophilic cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and epidemiologic history of exposure to infective larvae. (See

          Cysticercosis
         </strong>
         – Cysticercosis is characterized by seizures (in the setting of parenchymal involvement); extraparenchymal cysts are associated with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure (eg, headache, nausea, and vomiting). The disease is transmitted by ingestion of
         <em>
          Taenia solium
         </em>
         eggs shed in the stool of a human tapeworm carrier; humans become tapeworm carriers by ingesting undercooked pork containing cysticerci in muscle tissue. Cysticercosis is endemic in many regions of Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia. The median incubation period for cysticercosis is about 3.5 years. The diagnosis is established via radiography and serology. (See

It is transmitted by mosquitoes and occurs in Africa, the Middle East, parts of Europe and the former Soviet Union, South and Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Americas. The incubation period is 2 to 14 days. The diagnosis is established via serologic testing in serum and spinal fluid. (See
