Management of this condition has similarities to the treatment of other forms of spondyloarthritis; it is complicated by the need to coordinate treatment interventions with those needed for concurrent inflammation of the gut due to the Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis that is also present. Other illnesses also have a propensity for causing inflammation of joints and the gut.</p><p>The treatment of arthritis associated with IBD is presented here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of IBD-associated arthritis; and the pathogenesis, other clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7787.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease and other gastrointestinal diseases"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7787.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease and other gastrointestinal diseases", section on 'Other diseases with bowel and joint involvement'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4077.html" rel="external">"Immune and microbial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4070.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4067.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4068.html" rel="external">"Management of the hospitalized adult patient with severe ulcerative colitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4069.html" rel="external">"Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2138450631"><span class="h1">TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to the treatment of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115015" href="/z/d/graphic/115015.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) is very similar to and derived from the treatment of other forms of spondyloarthritis (SpA). Thus, it includes the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for initial therapy for peripheral and axial disease; selected conventional nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for peripheral arthritis resistant to initial therapy, if biologics are not already required for axial or gastrointestinal disease manifestations; and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for peripheral arthritis resistant to conventional nonbiologic DMARDs and for axial disease resistant to NSAIDs. (See <a class="local">'Management of peripheral arthritis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Management of spondylitis and sacroiliitis'</a> below.)</p><p>There is relatively limited direct evidence to support the efficacy of these or other treatment options for IBD-related arthritis. Support for this approach is largely indirect, derived from trials and observational studies involving patients with peripheral and axial SpA who have been diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and other forms of SpA. Our approach is also generally consistent with expert opinion on the management of patients with coexisting SpA and IBD, as expressed by a multidisciplinary panel of specialists [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7790.html" rel="external">"Treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105691.html" rel="external">"Treatment of peripheral spondyloarthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7793.html" rel="external">"Treatment of psoriatic arthritis"</a>.)</p><p>Effective treatment of the underlying IBD is often helpful in controlling the peripheral arthritis; in addition, it is not uncommon for the gastroenterologist to initiate glucocorticoids or TNF inhibitor therapy primarily for the IBD, which then also reduces the activity of the musculoskeletal symptoms concurrently. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4069.html" rel="external">"Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16224.html" rel="external">"Medical management of moderate to severe Crohn disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4051.html" rel="external">"Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4068.html" rel="external">"Management of the hospitalized adult patient with severe ulcerative colitis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1671602929"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF PERIPHERAL ARTHRITIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of peripheral arthritis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related arthritis is usually initiated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), and patients are treated with a conventional nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9963" href="/z/d/drug information/9963.html" rel="external">sulfasalazine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> (MTX), if NSAID therapy and local glucocorticoid injections are inadequate to provide relief of signs and symptoms of the inflammatory arthritis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115015" href="/z/d/graphic/115015.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Initial peripheral arthritis therapy/NSAIDs'</a> below and <a class="local">'Inadequate response to NSAIDs'</a> below and <a class="local">'Role of glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p>Control of the underlying IBD should also be optimized in patients with arthritis in collaboration with the patient's gastroenterologist, and patients with new-onset or persistent IBD-associated arthritis but quiescent gastrointestinal symptoms should be evaluated by their gastroenterologist to exclude asymptomatic gastrointestinal inflammation that may require treatment.</p><p>Patients with an inadequate response to NSAIDs and conventional nonbiologic DMARDs are generally treated with a TNF inhibitor, as are patients who have another indication for these biologic agents, such as axial disease unresponsive to NSAIDs or severe or resistant gastrointestinal disease activity. (See <a class="local">'Use of TNF inhibitors in patients resistant to conventional DMARDs'</a> below.)</p><p>There is only limited information from randomized trials to guide treatment decisions for arthritis associated with IBD; most of the available information is from small case series. Some agents, notably <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9963" href="/z/d/drug information/9963.html" rel="external">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9026" href="/z/d/drug information/9026.html" rel="external">azathioprine</a> (AZA), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9612" href="/z/d/drug information/9612.html" rel="external">6-mercaptopurine</a> (6-MP), MTX, glucocorticoids, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, may be helpful for both bowel and joint inflammation [<a href="#rid2">2-8</a>]. Our recommendations are based upon the available limited direct evidence; inferences from studies of other forms of arthritis, including SpA and reactive arthritis; and our clinical experience.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4200791919"><span class="h2">Initial peripheral arthritis therapy/NSAIDs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with mild or recurring transient peripheral arthritis, we suggest initial therapy with an NSAID in antiinflammatory doses (eg, the nonselective NSAID, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/z/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">naproxen</a>, 375 to 500 mg twice daily or the COX-2 selective NSAID, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8847" href="/z/d/drug information/8847.html" rel="external">celecoxib</a>, 100 mg twice daily), but antiinflammatory doses of any NSAID or COX-2 selective agent may be effective. Naproxen or other nonselective NSAIDs should be administered together with a proton pump inhibitor (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9718" href="/z/d/drug information/9718.html" rel="external">omeprazole</a> 20 mg daily) for gastroprotection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/35.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity", section on 'Proton pump inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>NSAID therapy should be initiated collaboratively in consultation with the patient's gastroenterologist, because of their potential for causing gastrointestinal side effects, including worsening of bowel inflammation. Despite such concern, we have used agents from both NSAID classes successfully in patients with IBD, with therapeutic benefit and good tolerance clinically. In patients in whom symptoms or signs of IBD develop or worsen during use of either nonselective or COX-2 selective NSAIDs, the drug should be temporarily or permanently discontinued; this problem should be jointly managed by the rheumatologist and the gastroenterologist.</p><p>In patients in whom a first NSAID does not control symptoms (a substantial reduction in inflammatory joint pain and stiffness over two weeks of therapy) or is poorly tolerated, a second NSAID should generally be tried before initiating therapy with a conventional nonbiologic DMARD such as SSZ. However, we usually avoid a second NSAID in patients in whom NSAID use has been associated with new or worsening symptoms or signs of active IBD. (See <a class="local">'Inadequate response to NSAIDs'</a> below.)</p><p>Local joint injection is also a therapeutic option in patients with a small number of affected joints (see <a class="local">'Role of glucocorticoids'</a> below). Septic arthritis should be excluded in patients with a possible joint infection before treatment for presumed IBD-associated arthritis with systemic or intraarticular therapies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7666.html" rel="external">"Septic arthritis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Although careful epidemiologic studies investigating the possible link between NSAIDs and the development of IBD have not been performed, a number of reports in patients receiving both nonselective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs suggest that these agents increase the risk for the development of IBD and may exacerbate underlying IBD [<a href="#rid3">3,9-12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2570.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs: Adverse effects on the distal small bowel and colon"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4066.html" rel="external">"Definitions, epidemiology, and risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease"</a>.)</p><p>Possible exacerbation of IBD symptoms by NSAIDs are difficult to assess. Agents effective for treatment of idiopathic IBD may improve bowel inflammation due to NSAIDs [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Similarly, radiographic studies and even endoscopic findings and biopsies may not differentiate between these causes [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Thus, improvement in symptoms and the mucosal appearance following withdrawal of the potentially offending NSAID may provide the best support for NSAIDs being the cause in an individual patient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2570.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs: Adverse effects on the distal small bowel and colon", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>Because COX-2 activity promotes epithelial proliferation and wound healing, COX-2 inhibition could theoretically have deleterious effects in patients with IBD [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, there is also evidence that COX-2 selective inhibitors can ameliorate the severity of experimental colitis [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], and two trials have suggested that the COX-2 selective inhibitors <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8847" href="/z/d/drug information/8847.html" rel="external">celecoxib</a> and etoricoxib might not exacerbate IBD symptoms [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. Both had small sample sizes. In the celecoxib trial, there was no significant difference in the rate of relapse of IBD after two weeks [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Similar results were found in a three-month randomized trial comparing etoricoxib with placebo in patients with IBD treated for rheumatologic symptoms [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>One of the largest trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID included 45 patients with IBD and arthralgias who were treated for three days to three months with rofecoxib, which is no longer available [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Arthralgia relief was reported by 71 percent of patients (complete relief in 18 percent and partial relief in 53 percent). However, nine patients (20 percent) required discontinuation of therapy due to the development of gastrointestinal symptoms, which subsided after treatment was stopped. This was a higher rate of discontinuation than was observed in a control group of 30 patients with dyspepsia (3 percent). The percentage of patients who required discontinuation was similar for those with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Whether this experience is generalizable to other COX-2 inhibitors remains unresolved.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2313665633"><span class="h2">Inadequate response to NSAIDs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with peripheral arthritis who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of NSAIDs, we use a conventional nonbiologic DMARD; the first-line drug in this setting is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9963" href="/z/d/drug information/9963.html" rel="external">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ), which can also benefit IBD (see <a class="local">'Sulfasalazine'</a> below). However, if SSZ is inadequate or poorly tolerated, other options include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> (MTX) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9026" href="/z/d/drug information/9026.html" rel="external">azathioprine</a> (AZA) (see <a class="local">'Alternatives to SSZ'</a> below). The AZA metabolite, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9612" href="/z/d/drug information/9612.html" rel="external">6-mercaptopurine</a> (6-MP) is sometimes used for the treatment of IBD and, like AZA, may be effective for arthritis.</p><p>Local glucocorticoid injection may be of benefit in patients with a small number of affected joints, or a short course of oral glucocorticoids or an intramuscular injection may be effective as bridging therapy in patients with severe symptoms or functional impairment requiring more rapid relief until the DMARD takes effect. (See <a class="local">'Role of glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142783707"><span class="h3">Sulfasalazine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with peripheral arthritis in whom nonselective or COX-2 selective NSAIDs do not result in acceptable symptomatic relief, and who lack axial disease that is not controlled by NSAIDs, we suggest the addition of SSZ, rather than another nonbiologic or biologic DMARD. The initial dose of SSZ is 500 mg twice daily with an increase in daily dose of 1000 mg every two weeks until arthritis symptoms improve or a maximum dose of 1000 mg three times daily is reached. A trial of at least 12 weeks is required to adequately assess efficacy.</p><p>The use of SSZ in these patients is based upon evidence of efficacy in other forms of peripheral SpA, as well as in patients with IBD, by expert opinion [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], and by our clinical experience. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7790.html" rel="external">"Treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105691.html" rel="external">"Treatment of peripheral spondyloarthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7793.html" rel="external">"Treatment of psoriatic arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4069.html" rel="external">"Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4051.html" rel="external">"Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis"</a>.)</p><p>SSZ is an azo-bonded combination of 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. SSZ is poorly absorbed in the small intestine. In the colon, SSZ is split by bacteria into its constituent moieties. The 5-amino compound lowers colonic prostaglandin E and alters gut flora. The sulfapyridine appears to be antiarthritic [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. However, aminosalicylates (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9614" href="/z/d/drug information/9614.html" rel="external">mesalamine</a>), which are useful for controlling intestinal inflammation, appear to have no direct antiinflammatory effect on the synovium [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4065.html" rel="external">"Sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylates in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H378676489"><span class="h3">Alternatives to SSZ</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">Methotrexate</a> – A trial of MTX is an option in patients in whom SSZ is not effective or poorly tolerated, using the same approach to MTX dosing and administration as in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The usual initial dose is 10 mg once weekly, increased in 2.5 to 5 mg increments, at approximately weekly intervals, until joint inflammation is controlled or a dose of 25 mg per week is reached. Orally administered MTX is adequately absorbed, even in patients with active IBD [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]; however, subcutaneous injection of MTX is a treatment option that provides higher bioavailability of the drug, especially at doses greater than 15 mg. If dose-limiting gastrointestinal side effects from MTX develop during oral therapy, switching to subcutaneous administration is recommended.
