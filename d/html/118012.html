(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128323.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical features", section on 'Acute course and complications'</a>.) </p><p></p><p>CRS occurs most often following targeted cellular immunotherapy for B cell ALL/LBL, NHL, CLL, and MM.

The systemic reaction is associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and activation of T lymphocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. However, the contributions of the individual cellular components and cytokines to the cause and severity of CRS are not well defined.</p><p>CRS severity has been associated with the disease burden (antigen load) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma in patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy [<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>]. The dose of CAR-T cells may also affect the severity of CRS, but a dose-toxicity relationship is not well defined within the dose ranges that are currently used; this may be because the infusion dose does not accurately predict the final expansion and persistence of the CAR-T lymphocytes [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Other contributing factors include the molecular design of the CAR (eg, CD28 versus 4-1BB as the costimulatory domain), the nature and intensity of lymphodepletion prior to cell infusion, and the degree of T cell activation and overall condition ("fitness") of the cellular product [<a href="#rid16">16,24-26</a>]. CRS can develop in the absence of tumor if the target antigen is expressed on normal cells, as in the severe CRS that occurred in healthy volunteers after treatment with a CD28 superagonist (TGN1412) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. For haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation, the source of the graft (ie, peripheral blood versus bone marrow) may influence the risk of CRS, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96032.html" rel="external">"HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Selection of graft type'</a>.)</p><p>Cytokines contribute importantly to the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of CRS [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. In the setting of T cell-engaging immunotherapies, CRS is triggered by release of interferon gamma (IFN-g) by activated T cells or tumor cells. IFN-g activates macrophages, which produce excessive interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), and IL-10. IL-6 binds to the soluble form of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) that has been cleaved from the cell surface by metalloproteinases, and the IL-6/IL-6R complex binds to gp130 and activates cell types that ordinarily do not express membrane-bound IL-6R. IL-1, IL-5, IL-8, IL-10, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are also consistently elevated in CRS and may also contribute to the pathophysiology of CRS.</p><p>Cytokines are thought to contribute to many of the clinical manifestations of CRS [<a href="#rid24">24,29-31</a>]. Examples include IL-6, which is associated with vascular leakage, activation of the complement and coagulation cascades, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and cardiomyopathy; IFN-g, which is associated with fever, chills, headache, dizziness, and fatigue; and TNF-a, which can cause flu-like symptoms with fever, malaise, watery diarrhea, vascular leakage, cardiomyopathy, lung injury, and production of acute phase proteins. The pathophysiologic centrality of IL-6 to CRS is indicated by the often rapid abrogation of the syndrome by interruption of IL-6 signaling with the IL-6R antagonist, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10208" href="/z/d/drug information/10208.html" rel="external">tocilizumab</a>. (See <a class="local">'CAR-T cell-associated CRS'</a> below.)</p><p>Various cell types contribute to CRS. T cell activation is an essential component of CRS, monocyte/macrophages amplify and expand the repertoire of cytokines and the inflammatory response, and endothelial cells contribute to capillary leakage, hypertension, and coagulopathy [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4250124825"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1898251074"><span class="h2">Time course</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The onset and duration of CRS is variable, but it can progress very rapidly.</p><p>CRS typically begins within 1 to 14 days (median, 2 to 3 days) after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, within 1 to 3 days after haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and may occur within minutes to hours after infusion of conventional therapeutic or bispecific antibodies [<a href="#rid4">4,6,7,24,30,34,35</a>]. More severe manifestations typically present earlier; factors that influence the severity of CRS are described above. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The duration of CRS is variable, but it typically resolves within a few days to two to three weeks after CAR-T infusion and within days after other causes [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2462681354"><span class="h2">Clinical manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical manifestations of CRS can range from mild, flu-like symptoms to a severe life-threatening systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p>By definition, fever (≥38.0°C) must be present at the onset of CRS. With mild CRS, fever may be accompanied by fatigue, headache, rash, diarrhea, arthralgia, and myalgia. The syndrome may progress with fever to 40.5°C (105°F) or higher [<a href="#rid32">32,36</a>]. In more severe CRS, patients may have hypotension and uncontrolled SIRS with circulatory collapse, vascular leakage, peripheral and/or pulmonary edema, renal failure, cardiac dysfunction, and multiorgan system failure. </p><p>Grading of the severity of CRS is described below. (See <a class="local">'Grading'</a> below.)</p><p>Neuropsychiatric findings may develop, including aphasia, altered level of consciousness, impaired cognitive skills, motor weakness, seizures, and cerebral edema [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. In most cases, neurologic toxicity occurs two to four days after the onset of severe CRS, may be progressive, and can occur after the resolution of CRS symptoms. Neurologic toxicity associated with immunotherapy is referred to as immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) or cytokine release encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). (See <a class="local">'ICANS (neurologic syndrome)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H632758287"><span class="h2">Laboratory</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laboratory findings reflect the systemic inflammatory response, but the abnormalities are highly variable and are influenced by the type of immune therapy, status of the underlying malignancy, and aspects of management.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hematology – Leukocytosis may be present as a response to the systemic inflammatory response or treatment with glucocorticoids. In addition, activated or abnormal lymphocytes may appear in peripheral blood after CAR-T cell therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef130660" href="/z/d/graphic/130660.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>); it is important to distinguish this expansion of CAR-T cells from progressive leukemia. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Conversely, there may be leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia as a result of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, the underlying malignancy, and/or subsequent treatment. Abnormalities of renal or liver function tests are common.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chemistries – Electrolyte abnormalities are common in CRS. In a study of 78 patients who received CAR-T therapy, CRS occurred in 85 percent and the following electrolyte abnormalities were reported: hypophosphatemia (75 percent), hypokalemia (56 percent), and hyponatremia (51 percent) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Other aspects of renal toxicity associated with CAR-T therapy is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114914.html" rel="external">"Nephrotoxicity of molecularly targeted agents and immunotherapy"</a>.)  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Laboratory abnormalities may also reflect manifestations of tumor lysis syndrome (eg, hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia) and/or macrophage activation syndrome, which are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1154.html" rel="external">"Tumor lysis syndrome: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, definition, etiology and risk factors", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87499.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Markers of inflammation – Nonspecific markers of inflammation (eg, C-reactive protein [CRP], ferritin) are universally elevated in CRS; inflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon gamma, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, soluble IL-2R alpha) are also elevated, but testing is limited to specialized laboratories [<a href="#rid24">24,25,27,29,34,38</a>]. In general, the degree of elevation of cytokines and markers of inflammation correlate with the severity of the clinical syndrome. Dramatic elevation of IL-6 is a supportive finding for the diagnosis of CRS. Importantly, CRP is not specific for CRS and changes in CRP may lag behind clinical changes by ≥12 hours [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. CRP generally falls quickly after administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10208" href="/z/d/drug information/10208.html" rel="external">tocilizumab</a> and is not a reliable biomarker in that setting.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H937410580"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation should promptly establish the presence and severity of CRS and identify other conditions that may contribute to the clinical presentation.

The underlying malignancy, disease status (eg, remission, relapse, treatment-refractory), and disease burden should be noted. The type, dose, and schedule of immunotherapy and use of any preventive measures (eg, glucocorticoids) must be documented. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical examination – The physical examination should document blood pressure, temperature, and examination of the skin, heart, and lungs to assess manifestations of the systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome. A neurologic examination should document anxiety, tremor, aphasia, delirium, or other findings that may be related to an associated immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) or can be manifestations of the systemic inflammatory response. (See <a class="local">'ICANS (neurologic syndrome)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>It is critically important to exclude potential infections during the initial evaluation, because patients are typically immunosuppressed or neutropenic from lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Neutropenic patients should be empirically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage while cultures are pending, as described separately.
