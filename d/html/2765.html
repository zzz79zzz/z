Sexual assault is defined as any deliberate sexual act performed by one person on another without explicit consent. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) defines sexual assault as “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim” [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. It may result from the use of force, the threat of force, or from the victim's inability to give consent. Sexual assault is an act of conquest and control. Sexual assault is never the victim’s fault. Sexual assault victims are at increased risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) along with chronic medical conditions.</p><p>The emergency department evaluation and treatment of adult and older adolescent victims of sexual assault are discussed here. The discussion is based on practice in the United States, but the general principles are applicable worldwide. Caring for child victims of sexual assault, the outpatient evaluation and management of date rape, screening and intervention for intimate partner violence, and general trauma evaluation and management are all reviewed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6607.html" rel="external">"Management and sequelae of sexual abuse in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6605.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14314.html" rel="external">"Date rape: Identification and management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14315.html" rel="external">"Date rape: Risk factors and prevention"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121477.html" rel="external">"Adolescent relationship abuse including physical and sexual teen dating violence"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15294.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15306.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Intervention and patient management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">"Initial management of trauma in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H95143399"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey administered in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2016/2017 found that 27 percent of females and 2 percent of males reported completed or attempted rape victimization at some point in their lifetime. Over the 12 months preceding the survey, 2 percent of females and less than 1 percent of males reported victimization [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. LGBTQI+ people, females, ethnic and racial minorities, and those with disabilities are disproportionally affected by acts of sexual violence. More than 80 percent of sexual assault victims report having been raped prior to 25 years of age, and more than 50 percent of victims report that the perpetrator was an acquaintance. Sexual violence against females is common throughout the world [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Many cases of sexual assault involve ethanol or illicit agents [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. In one series, almost 30 percent of female undergraduates reported a drug-related assault, with ethanol as the most common substance involved [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Two-thirds of older females are assaulted in their own homes or in care facilities [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In males, the prevalence of assault appears to be higher among those who are gay, bisexual, veterans, prison inmates, and those seeking mental health services [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Rape is under-reported [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Reported sexual assaults represent only a fraction of those committed. Only 10 to 15 percent of all sexual assaults are reported to police, and females who know their assailant are less likely to report the assault [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Immigrants and undocumented people may be particularly vulnerable to sexual assault and face added barriers to obtaining care. They often have language barriers, are not familiar with legal and medical resources, do not have access to medical providers, may fear the legal system, and may have memories of prior victimization [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Epidemiology of LGBTQI+ people is covered separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5426.html" rel="external">"Sexual and gender minority women (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, plus): Medical and reproductive care", section on 'Impact of sexual orientation on social determinants of health'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7577.html" rel="external">"Primary care of gay men and men who have sex with men", section on 'Intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and hate crimes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1238281553"><span class="h1">PROVIDER PREPAREDNESS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A national protocol for sexual assault medical forensic evaluations of adults and adolescents is available online through the United States Department of Justice, Office of Violence Against Women [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Providers should learn about local and hospital resources for sexual assault victims before they are asked to care for a sexual assault victim. The following issues should be researched:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Who are the available sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) or other trained providers in the community? How can they be contacted? Does the hospital contract with a SANE provider, or will the emergency clinician perform the evidence collection themselves? Can the patient be transferred to a hospital with trained forensic providers?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are there cultural issues for members of the community that might require special adaptation for the evaluation of sexual assault? Are interpreters available?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What are the local requirements for collection of evidence and for documentation? Evidence collection kits and forensic documentation forms should be available immediately when a patient presents needing evaluation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there an ultraviolet light source?

(See <a class="local">'Forensic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Complete evaluations are time intensive and may require three to six hours. Proper evaluation requires maintenance of the chain of custody of evidentiary material. Examiners should anticipate that they may be called to testify in court if a case is prosecuted. Patients must be counseled about each component of the evaluation and documentation. They may choose to decline individual components but must first be counseled on the purpose of those components and the possible impact of their choices on health and prosecution outcomes.</p><p>Requirements for the forensic evaluation will vary by jurisdiction, and it is important for the provider performing the evaluation to know local requirements.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Trained providers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many institutions in the United States have established SANE models or related programs for acute care [<a href="#rid12">12,16,17</a>]. The International Association of Forensic Nurses (IAFN) is a source of information on programs in other countries [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Some programs train a broader range of clinicians including physicians, physician assistants, and advanced practice providers who might then be referred to as SAFE.</p><p>SANE programs are supported at the federal level in the United States by the Department of Justice, Office of Victims of Crime. The United States Department of Justice has established training standards [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. State-specific information is available at <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fcenters.rainn.org%2F&amp;token=L9QjRcGm1eImC%2B5JauFajxQyp4oviK%2FYlJBkrcMvavSd88pfEtoYG9oAfctoDzOD&amp;TOPIC_ID=2765" target="_blank">centers.rainn.org</a>.</p><p>These trained providers:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Expedite evaluation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improve the consistency and quality of collected forensic evidence and ensure adherence to specific protocols regarding evidence collection and maintenance of the legal "chain of evidence" (see the National Institute of Justice <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnij.ojp.gov%2Ftopics%2Farticles%2Fresponses-sexual-violence-effectiveness-sanesart-programs&amp;token=7jxE%2B%2Fr8QRF9qgMEFERrlpQmzx%2B2E%2Bf4n%2FPNxRNAS3WY%2FaPHw7lbfkYEY3mUIgrUEL5h0oAJNfgtbUBVY8OfL%2FPfNxjxJqsY8mZuqSlwL4lUgLpAzU9su%2BHIWsWSRiLV&amp;TOPIC_ID=2765" target="_blank">website</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coordinate state crime lab testing, if appropriate, including assessment for common "date rape" drugs (eg, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9369" href="/z/d/drug information/9369.html" rel="external">diphenhydramine</a>, flunitrazepam [Rohypnol], gamma hydroxybutyrate [GHB]) when appropriate</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increase success of criminal prosecution and provide a bridge between the medical and criminal justice systems</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Link the victim with community services (including Rape Crisis Centers)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improve sensitivity to the psychological trauma experienced by sexual assault victims</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluate the patient after the clinician provides "medical clearance" (ie, medical issues and injuries have been addressed and stabilized)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Potentially enhance communication with clinicians regarding patient questions or concerns</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">History and documentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A trauma-informed care approach should be utilized in all cases with an understanding of the impact and symptoms of trauma  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126641" href="/z/d/graphic/126641.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Histories must be obtained in a sensitive and supportive manner, and care should be taken to avoid asking questions in a leading manner. Providers should not force evaluation or treatment and should allow the victim control in the evaluation process. A chaperone or advocate should be present during the evaluation. Advocates present during the exam can support patients and help them articulate their needs and questions during the history, but advocates should not respond to questions [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>In a patient who is medically cleared and will undergo SANE or SAFE evaluation, the clinician should obtain the history and document in the medical chart the reported events that relate to injuries being evaluated. This history guides trauma assessment and assesses risk of pregnancy and STIs. The clinician does not need to elaborate on a detailed forensic history (unless it pertains to the medical evaluation) since this will be recorded on a separate form by the SANE or SAFE. The clinician providing medical clearance does not need to obtain a full forensic history, if at all feasible, as it may re-traumatize the patient.</p><p>Some states require specific forms for documenting history and examination. Keeping the sexual assault report separate from the medical record is customary and has a precedent in psychiatric records. A “break the glass” requirement is often utilized for computerized records to prevent unwarranted views. Patients may request records, but SANE or SAFE is usually involved in release for counseling and support purposes.</p><p>Terms that are suitable for the medical chart, final diagnosis, and discharge instructions include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perpetrator evaluation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sexual assault</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation following sexual assault</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assault</p><p></p><p>Term to avoid include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alleged sexual assault</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rule out sexual assault</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reported sexual assault</p><p></p><p>Other identified injuries (eg, fractures, closed head injury, contusions) and diagnoses should also be listed.</p><p>If SANE/SAFE are unavailable at the hospital, the clinician is responsible for documenting the detailed forensic history on the evidentiary form. This history focuses on a detailed and precise account of the sexual assault in the event of prosecution. The following should be obtained as part of the forensic history:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Circumstances of the assault (including date, time, location, and use of weapons, force, restraints, or threats).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whether or not the victim experienced loss of consciousness or memory loss.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The assailant's physical description along with the assailant's use of drugs or alcohol.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Specifics regarding kissing, licking, and oral, vaginal, or anorectal contact or penetration with presence or absence of ejaculation and/or condom use.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Areas of trauma should be ascertained focusing especially upon the victim's mouth, breasts, vagina, and rectum.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bleeding of either assailant or victim may be relevant in assessing the risk of hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. The source of genital bleeding should be ascertained, especially since some injuries can cause life-threatening large-volume bleeding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recent consensual sexual activity before or after the assault including details about site of contact (oral, genital, anorectal) and condom use.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After the assault, any wiping, showering, bathing, changing clothes, eating, using toothpaste or mouthwash, using enemas, or changing/removing a tampon, sanitary pad, or barrier contraceptive device can lower the yield of forensic specimen collection. However, patients should not be reprimanded for taking any of these actions.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The physical examination should focus on identifying and documenting evidence of trauma. Suggested terminology for describing examination findings includes the TEARS mnemonic: <strong>t</strong>ears (defined as any break in tissue, including fissures and lacerations), <strong>e</strong>cchymoses, <strong>a</strong>brasions, <strong>r</strong>edness, and <strong>s</strong>welling [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The physical examination should also describe the patient's mental status. Physical examination evidence of trauma is more likely to be present within 72 hours of assault and when assaults occurred outdoors or were perpetrated by strangers [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Examine the patient in a forensic suite or dedicated room where the patient feels safe and there is adequate privacy without interruptions. Use gloves during the examination and evidence collection to avoid cross-contamination of evidence and change gloves in between each step of evidence collection.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient should undress for the examination with a sheet beneath them to capture any falling debris for medical evidence. The patient should then be given a gown, socks, and warm blankets for comfort.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Life-threatening genital injury (eg, vaginal hemorrhage) needs to be urgently evaluated and addressed by the clinician. The examination and care should not be delayed for the forensic evaluation (ie, SANE).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If possible and the patient provides consent, photographs of injuries should be taken with hospital-certified equipment (eg, digital camera, colposcopy camera). A ruler or an easily identified object is helpful for indicating the size of objects in photographs. Photographs should be taken at 90 degrees to the finding and include full view of the person with the finding followed by closer views. All photographs should be saved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extragenital trauma is often more common than anogenital trauma (70 versus 27 percent), with bruises, abrasions, or erythema on the thigh, upper arm, face, or neck particularly common [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In females, the breasts, external genitalia, vagina, perineum, anus, and rectum should be carefully examined. Common sites of genital injury include the posterior fourchette and the labia minora. As compared with females who have had consensual sex, females who have been assaulted are more likely to have genital injury at sites other than the posterior fourchette and are more likely to have multiple injured areas [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Genital trauma occurs more commonly in postmenopausal and adolescent females [<a href="#rid10">10,24</a>], and detectable trauma is more likely in females reporting vaginal or anal penetration along with those who have not previously been sexually active [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Colposcopic examination can enhance detection of areas of subtle genital trauma and is now performed by most SANE programs [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. A Wood's lamp or alternative ultraviolet light source may help identify foreign debris and semen on the skin; however, these light sources are not very specific, and false positive results may occur from common creams, detergents, and other products. Evidence of anogenital trauma is enhanced with colposcopy or use of toluidine blue dye, which adheres to injured nuclei in damaged epithelial cells, but can be difficult to use, challenging to recognize on darker skin, and not endorsed in all United States jurisdictions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In male victims, closely examine the thighs, penis, glans, urethral meatus, scrotum, and perineum, evaluating for erythema, scars, ecchymosis, excoriation, or laceration [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Penile examination should focus particularly on the glans and frenulum and should assess for urethral discharge. Rectal examination should be considered and performed if there was anal penetration. Anal injury was documented in 14 percent of those consenting to examination in an Australian center [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Forensic evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Forensic evaluation should be offered to victims but is not mandatory. Forensic evaluation involves collection of numerous specimens in a meticulous fashion. In the United States, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) ensures patients are not required to pay for the forensic services. (See <a class="local">'Legal issues'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Informed consent</strong> – Forensic evaluation requires informed consent from the patient. Specific forensic consent forms should be included in evidence collection kits. Patients will need to consent to the examination, collection of evidence, and forensic photography and decide if they want to report to law enforcement or not. The forensic examiner should only proceed if the patient has a thorough understanding of the exam. The patient has the right to refuse any part of the exam at any time while allowing other parts to proceed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Option for delayed law enforcement involvement</strong> – Many jurisdictions have policies that allow the patient to have evidence collected and stored, leaving the patient the option to report to law enforcement at a later date. The VAWA program creates and supports comprehensive, cost-effective responses to sexual assault by allowing for the sexual assault examination to occur without requiring law enforcement involvement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients who cannot provide consent</strong> – Performing a forensic evaluation in a suspected sexual assault victim who is unable to provide consent is controversial. A previously identified guardian would be authorized to provide consent. In the absence of a guardian or surrogate decision-maker, portions of the examination might be done if routine examination already requires examination of those areas, would not induce additional discomfort, and/or if a medical procedure is to be done that would destroy evidence [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. It is important to involve a hospital ethics and legal team if needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Components of the examination that require sedation should<strong> not</strong> be done, and photographs of intimate areas should not be taken without consent. Materials obtained prior to consent would only be released to law enforcement when consent is obtained at a later time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evidence collection kits</strong> – Evidence is collected using jurisdictionally specific sexual assault evidence kits or physical evidence recovery kits, which are sometimes referred to as “rape kits.” These kits contain all the necessary supplies to collect and store evidence and can be obtained through state distribution programs or directly from kit manufacturers. There are a variety of commercial collection kits available, but states often require specific kits. Check the kit’s expiration of use date prior to initiating the collection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Kits contain specific collection materials that are distinct to each specimen obtained and precise collection instructions. It is important to carefully follow collection guidelines to avoid contamination. Gloves should be changed in between each step of the evidence collection. Swabbed specimens may need to be dried; some jurisdictions mandate specific drying techniques. If a piece of evidence is wet when collected, the package should be labeled as such, and the police or crime laboratory be made aware so that they can dry and repackage the evidence. When completed, kits must be sealed, labeled, and stored using kit-specific directions to maintain an unbroken chain of evidence. Collected samples include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The victim's clothing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the patient is brought by ambulance from the site of the assault, any sheets used to transport the patient and any debris on them should be kept [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Swabs and smears from the buccal mucosa, vagina, and rectum and from other areas (that were licked, kissed, touched, or bitten) highlighted by ultraviolet light.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Combed specimens from the scalp and pubic hair. Given the painful and invasive nature of plucking hairs, many jurisdictions no longer require hair samples. We recommend avoiding this painful step. If it is performed, obtain control samples of the victim's scalp and pubic hair (20 to 25 pulled hairs per site).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fingernail scrapings and clippings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Whole blood sample.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Saliva sample.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing of evidence collection</strong> – The yield of evidentiary examinations generally declines with time and with specific behaviors like changing clothes, showering, and brushing teeth. In general, there may be only one opportunity to collect evidence, so when in doubt, it is best to obtain it.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Individual jurisdictions determine the maximal time interval during which certain evidence may be collected; intervals vary depending upon patient history, hygiene, and the specimen being obtained. Many jurisdictions use a five- or seven-day evidentiary cutoff [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. Historically, jurisdictions limited evidence collection to the first 72 hours after assault. However, there is no absolute interval during which evidence must be obtained, and as DNA technologies develop, the time available for evidence collection may expand [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As examples, swabs from external skin would not be useful in a victim who presents over 24 hours after an assault and has showered in the interim, but cervical and vaginal swabs, and possibly fingernail scrapings, would still be valuable. In cases of oral and anal assault, evidence is usually not collected beyond 24 hours after the assault. In cases of vaginal assault, DNA may be collected up to five days after the assault. Sperm has been detected in vaginal samples up to 72 hours after assault and in anal samples up to 24 hours after assault; sperm are not generally detectable in oral samples [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H636535101"><span class="h2">Perpetrator evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians may occasionally be asked to perform a forensic evaluation of an assault perpetrator [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. This exam is often critical for the forensic investigation, and the same meticulous approach to patient evaluation should be utilized. Principles for evidentiary examinations are similar to those for victims and require evidence collection kits and maintaining the chain of evidence. All historical information that the suspect offers should be recorded, but the suspect has the right to not provide any incriminating history. Swabs, hair combing, and fingernail sampling are obtained. Finger swabs would be done in cases of digital penetration of a victim [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. In males, penile swabs should be collected from the shaft, glans, and area under the foreskin. Bruises, scratches, and bite marks are identified, with swabbing of bites and scratches to identify victim DNA. Blood samples for HIV and hepatitis B can be drawn and held; in many jurisdictions, victims can ask the court to have the suspect tested.</p><p>Physical examination evidence of trauma is most common on the hands, forearms, face, and neck [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Permanent physical attributes, such as tattoos, are described. If victim and assailant are in the same facility, they should be evaluated in physically separate settings by different personnel to avoid any accusation of cross-contamination of specimens.</p><p>The perpetrator will often comply with the examination, but if the perpetrator refuses the evaluation or parts of the evaluation, the clinician cannot force it upon them unless law enforcement has a valid search warrant/court order or incident to an arrest to preserve evidence. If a clinician is uncomfortable examining a perpetrator who refuses, we suggest speaking to their hospital legal team for guidance [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laboratory evaluation is focused on testing for STIs and pregnancy. Radiographic imaging is guided by the history and physical examination along with a focused trauma assessment, which should be performed prior to providing clearance for the forensic evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">"Initial management of trauma in adults", section on 'Diagnostic studies'</a>.)</p><p>Testing for STIs has been considered elective, as guidelines recommend empiric treatment for possibly acquired STIs, and testing does not provide clear evidence of infection acquired at the time of assault. Victims may forego testing if they plan to take prophylactic treatment for STIs, which will also treat any pre-existing STI [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p>Historically, there has been concern that a positive STI test might be used by the defense as evidence of promiscuity to discredit the victim since any identified STI is likely to be pre-existing. However, many states limit the evidentiary use of a victim's prior sexual history [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Although this rarely occurs, evidence of a STI obtained at the time of the evaluation for assault could be accessed later, and some patients or clinicians may choose to defer testing for this reason despite these "rape shield" laws.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We perform gonorrhea and chlamydia nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in an adult patient who complains of signs or symptoms of an STI, specifically requests testing, or initially declines prophylaxis (to ensure appropriate therapy is eventually provided) and in a child (since the presence of an STI can be conclusive proof of a sexual assault).

Although there are reports of sexual transmission of hepatitis C, there are no known reports of transmission associated with sexual assault, and testing for hepatitis C is not addressed in current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. Given the relatively low risk and the absence of protocols for prophylaxis against hepatitis C, most programs have not incorporated hepatitis C testing into the evaluation of sexual assault, and we believe this is reasonable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3736.html" rel="external">"Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3680.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7588.html" rel="external">"Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Wet preps may show motile sperm; jurisdictions vary as to whether the examiner or the forensic laboratory is to make that evaluation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnancy testing should be performed in females of childbearing age.

Forensic drug testing may be warranted if the victim has amnesia for any time surrounding the event, manifests suggestive signs or symptoms (eg, sedation), or suspects that they were drugged. Alcohol may be the most common date rape drug; benzodiazepines and other sedatives may also be implicated [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Patients should understand that drug testing may also reveal voluntary drug or alcohol use that potentially can be used by the defense to discredit victims [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

For example, forensic testing for flunitrazepam (ie, Rohypnol, the "date rape drug") and GHB is not offered by most hospital laboratories and has a long turnaround time, so this is typically unhelpful in clinical management. Clinically available hospital drug of abuse screens are immunoassays that test for exposure and not intoxication and have poor sensitivity and specificity for most intoxicants; therefore, they must be interpreted with these limitations.

VAWA also allows for sexual assault examination without requiring law enforcement involvement. Many jurisdictions have policies that allow the patient to have evidence collected and stored for a given amount of time, leaving the patient the option to report to the police at a later date.

At the follow-up visit, additional photographs of injuries can be taken to assess healing and document the injury timeframe.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Improving compliance with follow-up</strong> – Compliance with follow-up medical care is often low among assault victims. Describing the short duration of the follow-up examination and the reasons for the visit at the initial evaluation and enlisting support from victim advocates are important ways to improve compliance.
