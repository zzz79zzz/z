         Bacterial meningitis continues to result in substantial morbidity and mortality despite the availability of effective antimicrobial therapy. The risk of dying or of developing complications is related to the age and general health of the patient, the causative pathogen, the severity and duration of illness at the time of presentation, and, occasionally, delays in the initiation of antibiotic therapy.

         Complications due to bacterial meningitis can be divided into systemic and neurologic. Systemic complications such as septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and septic or reactive arthritis are usually the consequence of the bacteremia that frequently accompanies meningitis [

         These complications may be sudden or gradual in onset and can appear at any time after the onset of symptoms, including after the completion of therapy. Although many neurologic complications are severe, others such as hearing loss may be subtle or inapparent during the early phases of infection. (See

         ) has been evaluated as adjuvant therapy in an attempt to diminish the rate of hearing loss and other neurologic complications as well as mortality in selected patients with bacterial meningitis. The rationale for this approach is provided by animal studies showing that hearing loss is temporally associated with the severe inflammatory changes induced by bacterial meningitis [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ] and that dexamethasone reduces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha and interleukin [IL]-1), CSF inflammation, and cerebral edema [

         ]. The median duration of symptoms prior to treatment was 24 hours. All patients had suspected meningitis in combination with one or more of the following findings on CSF analysis: cloudy fluid, a positive Gram stain for bacteria (seen in 74 percent), and/or a CSF white blood cell count above 1000/microL. CSF culture revealed
         <em>

The primary endpoint was all unfavorable outcomes (death or neurologic disability) at eight weeks. Secondary outcomes were focal neurologic deficits, hearing loss, and side effects of dexamethasone therapy, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, fungal infection, herpes zoster, and hyperglycemia.

         Among the patients with pneumococcal meningitis, significant benefit was seen only in those with an intermediate neurologic deficit on admission, defined as a Glasgow coma scale of 8 to 11  (

          dexamethasone

         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. There was no difference between the treatment groups with regard to persistent cognitive dysfunction, hearing loss, or focal neurologic deficits. It is possible that the trial was underpowered to detect benefits of this magnitude. In addition, these neurologic sequelae primarily occurred in the most severely ill patients; the proportion of patients who survived to be tested was significantly greater in the dexamethasone group.
        </p>
        <p>
         An additional finding was that patients with pneumococcal meningitis had a significantly higher rate of persistent cognitive dysfunction compared with other patients (21 versus 6 percent) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. This observation is consistent with the worse outcomes at eight weeks cited above in the patients with pneumococcal meningitis [
         <a href="#rid8">

         ].

        <p>
         A separate follow-up study with median follow-up of 13 years evaluated long-term survival in 228 of 246 evaluable patients [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Overall, 31 of 144 patients (22 percent) in the
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">
          dexamethasone
         </a>
         group died, compared with 44 of 134 patients (33 percent) in the placebo group. After the primary outcome measurement at eight weeks, an additional 20 patients in the dexamethasone group and 23 patients in the placebo group died, and age was the sole predictor of death. These results suggest that the survival benefit of dexamethasone is obtained during the acute phase of the disease and that there are no differences at later time points.

         ]. Dexamethasone was initiated with or before the first dose of antibiotics in 84 percent of 357 patients with pneumococcal meningitis in 2006 to 2009 but in only 3 percent of 352 patients in 1998 to 2002. At hospital discharge, an unfavorable outcome (defined as Glasgow outcome scale score of 1 to 4 points) was present in 39 percent of patients in the 2006 to 2009 cohort compared with 50 percent of patients in the 1998 to 2002 cohort (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.86). Rates of death (20 versus 30 percent) and hearing loss (12 versus 22 percent) were significantly lower in the 2006 to 2009 cohort.

         in adults with meningococcal meningitis from two prospective cohort studies of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands; the first study enrolled 258 patients between 1998 and 2002, before routine dexamethasone therapy was introduced, and the second study enrolled 100 patients between 2006 and 2011, after guidelines recommended dexamethasone [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         ]. Dexamethasone was administered to 17 percent of patients in the 1998 to 2002 cohort and 90 percent of patients in the 2006 to 2011 cohort and was continued in the majority of patients after
         <em>
          N. meningitidis

         was identified by culture. In the later (dexamethasone) cohort compared with the earlier cohort, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in hearing loss (3 versus 8 percent) and death (4 versus 11 percent). Similar Glasgow outcome scores were observed in the two cohorts. The rate of arthritis was significantly lower in the later cohort compared with the earlier cohort (32 of 258 patients [12 percent] versus 5 of 96 [5 percent]). These results suggest that the use of dexamethasone in patients with meningococcal meningitis is not associated with harm and that there may be small yet unproven benefits.

         A population-based observational study using data from the Healthcare Cost Utilization Project database found that both the incidence and mortality rates of pneumococcal meningitis declined among American patients between 1997 and 2010 [

Rates of death from pneumococcal meningitis also declined from 0.073 people per 100,000 from 2002 to 2004 to 0.049 per 100,000 people from 2005 to 2008. The authors attributed the decline in mortality to the introduction of guidelines promoting the use of adjunctive

There was also no difference in mortality when the analysis was restricted to patients with pneumococcal meningitis (53 versus 50 percent, OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.68-1.77), and there were no significant differences between the two groups in the outcomes of disability and death combined, hearing loss, and adverse events.

        <p>
         There are several issues that must be considered in the interpretation of these results. In Malawi, the outcomes of bacterial meningitis are poor and the life expectancy is low. Contributing factors to worse outcomes in these patients include poor nutrition, delays in presentation that may have contributed to neurologic compromise prior to treatment, and chronic diseases such as HIV.

However, when the analysis was limited to the 300 patients (69 percent) with confirmed bacterial meningitis (ie, those with organisms cultured from CSF or blood or detected in CSF), there was a significant reduction in the risk of death at one month (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.20-0.94) and in the risk of death or disability at six months (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32-0.98). The major causes of confirmed bacterial meningitis were

         for probable bacterial meningitis (defined as the presence of a typical clinical picture and lack of an alternative diagnosis in the absence of identification of bacteria in CSF or blood) had an increased risk of death at one month. The authors proposed that this finding could be explained by the inadvertent inclusion of cases of tuberculous meningitis. Eleven individuals in the study (eight in the dexamethasone group and three in the placebo group) were subsequently treated for tuberculous meningitis on clinical grounds. Six of these patients died, all of whom had received dexamethasone. Similar adverse effects of dexamethasone were seen in Ethiopian patients who were treated for presumed bacterial meningitis [

         <strong>
          all
         </strong>
         adults with suspected or proven pneumococcal meningitis, regardless of the Glasgow coma scale, because assessment of the Glasgow coma scale score may delay the initiation of appropriate therapy [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. We agree with the guidelines; however, since the etiology of bacterial meningitis is not usually known at the time of treatment initiation, and
         <em>
          S. pneumoniae
         </em>
         is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults in developed regions, we extend the recommendation to the larger population of patients with suspected bacterial meningitis.

         ]. Dexamethasone should be initiated shortly before or at the same time as the first dose of antibiotics. In a review that included 118 episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults in which dexamethasone was given, the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome was much higher in the 94 patients in whom dexamethasone was given after antibiotics (51 versus 12 percent if given before antibiotics) [

          28

          16,29

Thus, empirically administering adjunctive dexamethasone is reasonable in patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion for acute bacterial meningitis until microbiologic results are available.
