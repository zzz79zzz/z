         </span>
         Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy and the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States. Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the most common histologic type of ovarian cancer and is closely related to fallopian tube and peritoneal carcinomas. These will be referred to as a single entity here, as epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC).
        </p>
        <p>
         Five-year survival rates for stage III or IV EOC are approximately 40 and 20 percent, respectively  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134243" href="/z/d/graphic/134243.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). However, in 2022 there were almost 247,000 EOC survivors in the United States and there are some long-term survivors of EOC [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Issues pertaining to survivorship in EOC are not well-studied. This may be due to the overall poor prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer and smaller populations of affected individuals compared with patients with other cancers (eg, endometrial or breast cancer). Additionally, there are many studies of ovarian cancer survivors and their difficulties, but there are few data to guide management. Nevertheless, survivorship-related issues are important to address in this growing population of patients.
        </p>

         The approach to survivors of EOC will be reviewed here. Related topics are discussed in detail separately, including:

         EOC is surgically staged  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ). Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, and infracolic or infragastric omentectomy is the standard staging procedure. Bowel resection and/or radical pelvic and upper abdominal surgery may be required.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to treatment depends upon the stage and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Nearly 80 percent of patients with EOC enter remission following primary treatment. The recurrence rates are 25 and 80 percent for patients with early-stage and advanced disease, respectively [

         Patients treated for EOC are at a high risk of recurrence, and most EOC survivors will not be cured. The approach to patients who relapse and require further treatment is discussed separately. (See

         We agree with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for monitoring patients who have completed treatment for EOC [

         Office visits (including history, general physical, and pelvic examinations) every two to four months for two years, then every three to six months for three years, then annually after five years. For patients with advanced-stage disease at presentation who achieve and maintain a complete response, we continue following for life. For those with early-stage disease with no evidence of recurrence at five years, it is reasonable to return care to the primary care physician or gynecologist.

          Role of CA 125 surveillance

         </span>
         The role of cancer antigen (CA) 125 in surveillance of EOC remains controversial. In our practice, we check CA 125 levels at every visit, if these markers were elevated at the initial presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
         An SGO white paper, after reviewing all the relevant data, suggests CA 125 be considered "optional" in the surveillance of patients with EOC [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. However, in the United States, where care is often driven by shared decision-making between the clinician and patient, CA 125 surveillance remains routine practice [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While routine CA 125 surveillance may result in earlier disease recurrence detection (two to five months earlier, in one study [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]), it may not improve overall survival (OS). This lack of impact on OS was shown in the Medical Research Council 05 trial in which 1442 patients had their CA 125 levels checked every three months, with both patients and investigators blinded to the results [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Patients who remained asymptomatic but whose CA 125 levels exceeded twice the upper limit of normal (527 patients) were randomly assigned to immediate treatment or to continued blinding of the CA 125 results with treatment delayed until the time of a clinical or symptomatic recurrence. Patients who developed symptoms or signs of a recurrence were removed from the study. The main results of this study were as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Second-line chemotherapy was started a median of five months earlier in the immediate treatment arm.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         At a median follow-up of 57 months from randomization, there was no improvement in OS with immediate compared with delayed treatment (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0.98, 95% CI 0.80-1.20).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Immediate treatment was not associated with a longer remission duration following the detection of recurrence. However, it resulted in an adverse impact on quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, while an early rise in CA 125 may allow a patient to be identified for surgery earlier in the recurrent disease course, and thus be more likely to achieve an optimal secondary cytoreduction, secondary cytoreduction may be associated with worse outcomes. In a study of 74 patients with recurrent EOC who underwent secondary cytoreduction, patients who had an optimal cytoreduction had a shorter time interval between their initial rise in CA 125 compared with those who had a suboptimal cytoreduction (5 versus 16 weeks; HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06), suggesting that acting expeditiously upon a rising CA 125 level may improve surgical outcomes [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. However, the randomized trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT00565851&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX%2F%2FH%2FlCKGrzlGu03gYcMJXuTK3xOgZRWSxi6SLWdl%2BnUNoX%2FW2n%2F9sQYvQsnkv25JIMgj73hZjrEw%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=17007" target="_blank">
          GOG 213
         </a>
         ) demonstrated no survival benefit to secondary cytoreduction; in fact, those patients who underwent surgery had a worse survival outcome compared with those who were randomized to the no surgery group.

         Standard imaging techniques, including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), have limited sensitivity to detect recurrent EOC [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         ]. There are some data to support the use of PET/CT to detect early recurrent disease, but in the absence of data to suggest this improves survival, we do not perform imaging studies in otherwise asymptomatic patients as part of surveillance.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, the role of PET/CT imaging was evaluated in a 2013 meta-analysis that included 29 trials (n = 1651) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. PET/CT had a sensitivity and specificity of 89 and 90 percent, respectively, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.1 (95% CI 3.9-9.5) and 0.12 (95% CI 0.08-0.19), respectively. However, all studies were observational and the recurrent disease was not uniformly confirmed histologically; the analysis included studies in which recurrence was based solely on repeat imaging at six months. Whether earlier detection of recurrent EOC by PET/CT expanded treatment options or improved survival was not reported.
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, PET/CT should not be used as part of routine surveillance for patients treated for EOC. On the other hand, PET/CT may be useful in the evaluation of a rising CA 125 to assess for extent of disease, anticipating further discussion regarding the role of surgery and timing of treatment, pending the results.

         A separate registry-based study of ovarian cancer survivors (who were diagnosed with stage I through IV disease) suggested that neuropathy, specifically tingling in the hands/feet and numbness in fingers/toes, was experienced by 51 percent of patients with ovarian cancer who received chemotherapy even up to 12 years after the end of treatment. Neuropathy was also associated with lower levels of overall functioning and QOL [

         Patients treated for EOC may have long-term issues with their gastrointestinal (GI) system as a result of the previous disease, surgical treatment, and medical therapy. Most patients with EOC experienced GI symptoms with their initial presentation; in many cases, these symptoms were present for months before the correct diagnosis was made. For this reason, many patients worry that subsequent GI symptoms indicate disease recurrence.

         A survey study of patients with all stages of ovarian cancer from the Netherlands noted that 25 percent of patients reported high-level GI symptoms; regression analysis showed that the presence of high-level GI symptoms during survivorship was associated with lower functioning in almost all health care QOL domains, more symptoms, and higher levels of distress [

         The average age at diagnosis of EOC is 63 years, and most patients are postmenopausal. However, EOC survivors that are premenopausal or perimenopausal are candidates for hormone therapy (HT). Treatment of EOC includes hysterectomy for most patients, and thus systemic HT is usually estrogen alone. Patients with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy) are candidates for vaginal estrogen therapy. Patients who prefer to avoid hormones may be managed expectantly or with nonhormonal therapies [

          60,61

         HT is used to treat bothersome symptoms in patients who are within 10 years of menopause or younger than age 60 and who do not have contraindications to HT (such as a history of breast cancer, coronary heart disease [CHD], a previous venous thromboembolic event or stroke, or active liver disease). In our practice, we also apply this approach to patients over the age of 60, recognizing the limitations in available data.

         Concerns have been raised about estrogen receptor (ER) expression in EOC, but we do not view this as a contraindication to treatment with HT. While this expression has been associated with an improved response to

          62,63

         <strong>
          endometrioid subtype
         </strong>
         . While one study found that estrogen-only HT increased the risk of developing endometrioid ovarian cancer over other histologies, there are no data to suggest that HT after an ovarian cancer diagnosis increases the risk of cancer recurrence in this particular histologic subtype [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64

In addition, there is no role for hormone receptor testing in EOC, either prior to treating with tamoxifen or an AI or for using HT following diagnosis. ER-positive testing does not influence the use of HT if the patient has bothersome menopausal symptoms and HT is the best treatment option [

Long-term OS was superior in the HT group (risk of death at 20 years: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.44-0.90). Recurrence-free survival was also superior in the HT group (risk of recurrence at 20 years: HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.97).

          Clinical significance
         </strong>
         – Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy and the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States. Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is closely related to fallopian tube and peritoneal carcinomas. Five-year survival rates for stage III or IV EOC are approximately 40 percent and 20 percent, respectively  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134243" href="/z/d/graphic/134243.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ); however, in 2022 there were almost 247,000 EOC survivors in the United States. (See

          Overview of treatment
         </strong>
         – Ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinoma are surgically staged, including total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, and omentectomy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545" href="/z/d/graphic/113545.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Most patients are diagnosed with stage III or IV disease and will undergo surgical staging followed by combination chemotherapy consisting of a platinum salt (

          Post-treatment surveillance
         </strong>
         – Follow-up office visits (including history, general physical, and pelvic examinations) should occur every two to four months for two years, then every three to six months for three years, then annually after five years. The role of cancer antigen (CA) 125 (or other tumor markers) in surveillance is controversial; in our practice, we check CA 125 levels at every visit, if these markers were elevated at the initial presentation. Other testing (ie, chemistry profile or complete blood count, or imaging) should be pursued only if clinically indicated (eg, for a rise in CA 125 or new or worsening symptom). (See

          Neuropathy
         </strong>
         – Persistent neurotoxicity is an important quality of life (QOL) issue for long-term survivors and is most commonly due to the adverse effects of chemotherapy [

          Fatigue
         </strong>
         – Fatigue is an obstacle to daily functioning and a contributor to decreased QOL. In patients with EOC, fatigue may persist after completion of chemotherapy and can be moderately distressing and difficult to control. (See

         <strong>
          GI symptoms
         </strong>
         – Ovarian cancer survivors often suffer from significant bowel function disorders, including constipation and diarrhea, both during and after primary therapy. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms correlate with poorer QOL in EOC survivors. Patients with EOC who experience new GI symptoms should be evaluated for disease recurrence, using history, physical exam, and imaging studies (eg, abdominal/pelvic computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], positron emission tomography [PET]/CT, or PET).

         <strong>
          Sexual dysfunction
         </strong>
         – Sexual function issues are common among EOC survivors. Sexual problems may be secondary to effects of surgery, chemotherapy, or menopause, or may be due to a partner’s sexual issues or relationship problems. Patients may complain of dyspareunia, loss of desire, or other sexual dysfunction. (See

         <strong>
          Menopausal symptoms
         </strong>
         – For patients with EOC who have bothersome menopausal symptoms, we offer nonhormonal options as a first-line measure. However, for those who have failed or declined nonhormonal treatments, we suggest hormone therapy rather than no treatment or further lines of nonhormonal therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). In general, while studies have typically included patients who are within 10 years of menopause or under 60 years of age, we also apply this approach to ovarian cancer survivors over the age of 60, recognizing the limitations in available data. (See
         <a class="local">

          Psychosocial issues
         </strong>
         – Most patients with EOC experience some level of ongoing psychological distress. These emotional challenges may persist for years after diagnosis. Depression and anxiety are common in ovarian cancer survivors. (See
