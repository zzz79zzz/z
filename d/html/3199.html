         Epithelial cancers of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal origin exhibit similar clinical characteristics and behavior. As such, these are often combined and define epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in clinical trials and clinical practice. This topic will consider all three tumor origins under the heading EOC.
        </p>
        <p>
         EOC is the most common cause of death among women with gynecologic malignancies and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Only approximately 25 percent of women will be diagnosed with early-stage ovarian cancer, either confined to the ovary (stage I) or confined to the pelvis (stage II). For women with EOC confined to the ovary (IA or IB) and/or well-differentiated (grade 1) tumors, prognosis is excellent with survival of at least 90 percent following surgery alone [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. For all others, adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
         This section will review adjuvant therapy for early-stage EOC. Initial surgical management, adjuvant therapy for women with advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer, and chemotherapy for women with recurrent disease are discussed separately.

         A subset of women with early-stage disease are at increased risk of relapse and can be identified based on the presence of high-risk features including:

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These high-risk features are used as criteria to determine eligibility for adjuvant therapy in clinical trials of women with early-stage disease and for the use of adjuvant therapy outside of clinical trials [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. For women with these features, five-year disease-free survival rates range from 40 to 80 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4,5
         </a>
         ]. This compares with a five year survival rate of at least 90 percent among women with well-differentiated (grade 1) tumors confined to the ovary (stage IA or IB) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. It is controversial whether women with grade 2 ovarian cancer should be considered as having high-risk disease and offered adjuvant therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage EOC has been further shown in two meta-analyses:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In the first, 13 trials conducted between 1965 and 2004 were included, although only eight of these studies were performed exclusively in stage I ovarian cancer [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         The pooled results for chemotherapy for women with stage I ovarian cancer showed a benefit for adjuvant treatment in terms of recurrence-free survival (relative risk [RR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.58-0.86) and overall survival (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.94).
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Five-year overall survival was improved with the use of adjuvant platinum-based therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.90).
        </p>

         In the second, five randomized trials conducted between 1990 and 2003 involving 1277 women were included in the analysis [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Again, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with benefit in terms of both progression-free survival (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52-0.84) and overall survival (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.93).

         </span>
         For women who had no gross residual following surgery, chemotherapy did not appear to improve overall survival when compared with observation (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.63-2.37). In comparison, for women who had incompletely resected disease, chemotherapy resulted in superior survival when compared with observation (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.85).

         Women with high-risk tumors had a survival advantage with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy over observation (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.72). Those with low-risk tumors did not derive a benefit from chemotherapy (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.54-1.66).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         A subsequent publication of the Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Ovarian Neoplasms (ACTION) trial has questioned the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage disease following complete surgical staging [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. The ACTION study enrolled 448 women with early EOC and high-risk features and randomly assigned post-surgical care to adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy versus observation [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. While surgical treatment was not protocol mandated, the study incorporated strict definitions of optimal versus non-optimal staging. After a median follow-up of ten years, adjuvant chemotherapy resulted in the following outcomes when compared with observation [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]:

         A significant improvement in recurrence-free survival (RFS, 70 versus 62 percent, HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46-0.89) and a trend towards an improvement in cancer-specific survival (CSS, 82 versus 76 percent, HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.48-1.13).
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For women who underwent complete surgical staging, there was no significant improvement in either RFS (78 versus 72 percent, HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38-1.42) or CSS (85 versus 89 percent, HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61-4.08). However, for women who had incomplete surgical staging, there was a significant improvement in both RFS (65 versus 56 percent, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.87) and CSS (80 versus 69 percent, HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.95).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Overall, the available evidence supports the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage ovarian cancer with high-risk features. By contrast, patients with no risk factors do not appear to benefit from chemotherapy. Further prospective clinical trials are needed to determine whether patients with one or more of these high-risk features who have undergone optimal surgical staging may omit adjuvant chemotherapy, although strong evidence of lack of benefit for chemotherapy would be needed to omit treatment, given that the goal of treatment in this population is cure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach is consistent with that of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. For women with resected and fully staged grade 1, stage IA or IB disease, we recommend observation alone rather than the use of adjuvant therapy. For women with high-risk disease (defined as stage IC or II, high-grade or clear cell cancers of any stage), we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy. We also suggest the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for women with grade 2 tumors but acknowledge that observation, in the absence of other risk factors, may be an acceptable alternative for this subgroup of patients.

         As described above, adjuvant therapy is offered to women with early-stage EOC with high-risk features, typically between 21 and 35 days from primary debulking surgery, given some evidence of worsened survival with delay beyond 35 days [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. For such women, adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy is the preferred modality. While the optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimen is unknown, most clinicians offer treatment with a platinum-based doublet, such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">
          paclitaxel

          carboplatin
         </a>
         , largely because of its demonstrated efficacy in the adjuvant therapy of women with advanced-stage EOC  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65626" href="/z/d/graphic/65626.html" rel="external">
          table 1

          "First-line chemotherapy for advanced (stage III or IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Both intravenous platinum-based chemotherapy and intraperitoneal P 32 have been evaluated as the adjuvant treatment in this population. Several trials have compared platinum-based chemotherapy (either

         <a href="#rid4">
          4,12,13
         </a>
         ]. In each of these, P 32 therapy was associated with increased toxicity without improved efficacy. In particular, P 32 therapy was complicated by problems with adequate distribution and bowel toxicity (eg, perforation). Given the effectiveness of chemotherapy, intraperitoneal P 32 has been abandoned and is no longer used in the treatment of early-stage ovarian cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a lack of consensus regarding the optimal adjuvant regimen in this setting. We prefer a platinum-based doublet (ie,

          14,15
         </a>
         ]; however, data are insufficient to support single-agent platinum as the optimal chemotherapy regimen in this patient population over a platinum/taxane combination.

         for six cycles. We recognize that the benefit of six cycles may be limited to women with serous cancers or women with stage II disease. It is reasonable to individualize the number of cycles based upon patient risk factors and the tolerance of therapy, with a planned minimum of three cycles.

         In a subsequent ad hoc analysis of the same trial, a significantly lower risk of recurrence was seen for six rather than three cycles of chemotherapy in patients with serous tumors (hazard ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.77) but not other histologic types [
         <a href="#rid17">

         ]. Comparing six versus three cycles, five-year overall survival was not significantly different among women with serous cancers (86 versus 73 percent). Similarly, for women with other tumor types there was no difference in overall survival with three or six cycles. Therefore, our approach for serous tumors is aim to treat for six cycles but consider tolerance of therapy. For nonserous cancers, we treat with at least three cycles and assess the patient for tolerance to the treatment. If there is minimal toxicity, subsequent cycles to a maximum of six can be administered with reassessment at each cycle.

         The finding of early-stage EOC is occasionally made during surgery for an emergent (eg, torsion) or benign (ie, ovarian cystectomy) indication. In these cases, women will not have undergone surgical staging and technically speaking would be considered to have apparent early but unstaged ovarian cancer. For women with unstaged apparent early EOC, we suggest staging because both prognosis and adjuvant treatment options are tied to disease stage. Often this surgery can be performed through a minimally invasive approach. Alternatively, some evidence suggests that surgery may not be required if adjuvant chemotherapy is administered:

        <p>
         While these underpowered studies suggest that it might be safe to omit formal surgical staging after a woman has been diagnosed with apparent EOC, prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding before incorporating this into standard practice. For women who choose not to undergo formal surgical staging, we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy. With grade 3 or clear cell tumors, where chemotherapy will be administered regardless of staging outcome, there may be less impetus for a secondary procedure.

Results from GOG252, enrolling women with optimally cytoreduced stage II to III ovarian cancer, suggest similar PFS results between dose-dense IV therapy and IV/IP therapy, and are discussed elsewhere.

          Introduction
         </strong>
         – Epithelial cancers of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal origin exhibit similar clinical characteristics and behavior and are collectively referred to as epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). EOC is the most common cause of death among women with gynecologic malignancies and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Approximately 25 percent of cases are early-stage ovarian cancer, either confined to the ovary (stage I) or confined to the pelvis (stage II). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         <strong>
          Selection of patients
         </strong>
         – Not all patients with early-stage EOC require adjuvant chemotherapy, but chemotherapy should not be omitted unless the patient has been appropriately surgically staged. A decision to administer chemotherapy is largely based upon the stage of disease and tumor characteristics (see
         <a class="local">
          'Selection of patients'
         </a>
         above):

         For women with completely resected grade 1, stage IA or IB EOC, we suggest observation alone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C

         </span>
         For women with high-risk EOC (defined as stage IC or II, high-grade or clear cell cancers of any stage), we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         We also suggest adjuvant chemotherapy for grade 2 stage I or II EOC (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Observation is an acceptable alternative for stage I EOC provided there are no high-risk factors.

         <strong>
          Choice of adjuvant treatment
         </strong>
         – When adjuvant chemotherapy is used, we suggest a platinum-based two-drug combination chemotherapy regimen rather than single-agent therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). We administer
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">
          paclitaxel
         </a>
         plus
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">
          carboplatin
         </a>
         for six cycles. We recognize that the benefit of six cycles may be limited to women with serous cancers or women with stage II disease. It is reasonable to individualize the number of cycles based upon patient risk factors and the tolerance of therapy. In this case, we prefer a minimum of three cycles be administered. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Duration'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Following adjuvant chemotherapy, we suggest observation rather than maintenance chemotherapy given the lack of an overall survival benefit associated with maintenance therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Is there a role for intraperitoneal chemotherapy
         </strong>
         – Combination intraperitoneal and intravenous chemotherapy is experimental for women with early-stage ovarian cancer and should be reserved for clinical trials. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intraperitoneal chemotherapy'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Unstaged patients
         </strong>
         – The finding of early-stage EOC is occasionally made during surgery for an emergent (eg, torsion) or a benign (ie, ovarian cystectomy) indication. For these women with unstaged apparent early EOC, we suggest surgical staging because both prognosis and adjuvant treatment options are intimately tied to disease stage (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_4" rel="external">
          Grade 2A
         </a>
         ). Any patient who elects not to undergo staging should receive adjuvant chemotherapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Unstaged patients'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Post-treatment surveillance
         </strong>
         – We agree with the post-treatment surveillance recommendations from expert panels, such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83397.html" rel="external">
