         The diagnosis of hypothyroidism relies heavily upon laboratory tests because of the lack of specificity of the typical clinical manifestations. Primary hypothyroidism is characterized by a high serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration and a low serum free thyroxine (T4) concentration, whereas subclinical hypothyroidism is defined biochemically as a normal free T4 concentration in the presence of an elevated TSH concentration. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by a low serum T4 concentration and a serum TSH concentration that is not appropriately elevated.

         In community surveys, the prevalence of overt hypothyroidism varies from 0.1 to 2 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,6,7
         </a>
         ]. However, there is an age-related shift towards higher TSH concentrations in older patients, and therefore, if age-adjusted normal ranges are used, the prevalence may not increase with old age. (See

         Hypothyroidism is five to eight times more common in women than men, and more common in women with small body size at birth and during childhood [

        <p>
         In the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, 13,344 people without known thyroid disease or a family history of thyroid disease had measurements of serum TSH, T4, thyroglobulin antibodies, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies with the following results [

         Thus, a significant proportion of the United States population has laboratory evidence of thyroid disease, suggesting that routine screening could be useful. (See

         The clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism are highly variable, depending upon the age at onset and the duration and severity of thyroid hormone deficiency. Common symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency include fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, myalgia, and menstrual irregularities  (

         ). Physical examination findings may include goiter (particularly in patients with iodine deficiency or goitrous chronic autoimmune thyroiditis [Hashimoto's thyroiditis]), bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, and a delayed relaxation phase of the deep tendon reflexes. In the majority of patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies are elevated. A variety of metabolic abnormalities may be present including hypercholesterolemia, macrocytic anemia, elevated creatine kinase, and hyponatremia [

         Primary hypothyroidism is characterized by a high serum TSH concentration and a low serum free T4 concentration. Patients with a high serum TSH concentration and a normal serum free T4 concentration may have subclinical hypothyroidism. (See

         Central hypothyroidism is characterized by a low serum T4 concentration and a serum TSH concentration that is not appropriately elevated. In this setting, differentiation must be made between pituitary (secondary hypothyroidism) and hypothalamic (tertiary hypothyroidism) disorders. (See

         ), the serum TSH should be the initial test. If the serum TSH concentration is elevated, the TSH measurement should be repeated along with a serum free T4 to make the diagnosis of hypothyroidism  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67935" data-inline-graphics="67935" href="/z/d/graphic/67935.html" rel="external">

         If the repeat serum TSH value is still high and the serum free T4 is low, consistent with primary hypothyroidism, replacement therapy with T4 should be initiated. (See

         If the repeat serum TSH value is still high but the serum free T4 value is within the normal range, indicating subclinical hypothyroidism, the decision about T4 replacement is made on a case-by-case basis and depends partly upon the degree of TSH elevation. (See

         If the TSH is normal but the patient has convincing symptoms of hypothyroidism, we measure a repeat serum TSH and a free T4 to assess for central hypothyroidism. (See

         We define an elevated serum TSH as a TSH concentration above the upper limit of the normal TSH reference range, which is typically 4 to 5 mU/L in most laboratories. Presently there is considerable controversy over the appropriate upper limit of normal for serum TSH. Some experts have suggested that the true upper limit is only 2.5 or 3 mU/L in healthy individuals without thyroid disease, while others argue that the serum TSH distribution shifts towards higher values with age, independent of the presence of antithyroid antibodies [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and TSH are required for normal thyroid hormone secretion. Central hypothyroidism is due to insufficient stimulation of the thyroid gland by TSH, and it is caused by either hypothalamic (tertiary hypothyroidism) or pituitary (secondary hypothyroidism) disease [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13

         Secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism should be suspected in the following circumstances:

        <p>
         In hypothyroidism caused by hypothalamic or pituitary disease, TSH secretion does not increase appropriately as T4 secretion falls. As a result, the symptoms and the serum free T4 value must be used to make the diagnosis. Thus, we measure both serum TSH and free T4 if pituitary or hypothalamic disease is suspected (eg, a young woman with amenorrhea and fatigue). We also measure free T4 if the patient has convincing symptoms of hypothyroidism despite a normal TSH result. In patients with central hypothyroidism, the serum free T4 value is low-normal to low and serum TSH may be frankly low, inappropriately normal (for the low T4), or slightly high (7 to 15 mU/L) due to secretion of biologically inactive TSH  (

         The differential diagnosis of an elevated serum TSH level includes resistance to TSH or thyroid hormone, recovery from nonthyroidal illness, and TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas  (

         An elevated TSH concentration may rarely be due to resistance to TSH secondary to alterations in the TSH receptor [

Serum free T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations are typically normal or low. The thyroid gland is not enlarged. It may be difficult to distinguish subclinical hypothyroidism (common) from resistance to TSH (rare). The presence of other family members expressing the same phenotype and ultimately a defect in the TSH receptor confirms the diagnosis of resistance to TSH. (See

         Euthyroid patients with nonthyroidal illness may have transient elevations in serum TSH concentrations (up to 20 mU/L) during recovery from nonthyroidal illness. In patients with a recent illness, TSH and free T4 should be repeated four to six weeks after recovery. Few of these patients prove to have hypothyroidism when reevaluated after recovery from their illness. (See

         Chronic autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine sufficient areas of the world. The two major forms of the disorder are goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis and atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis, with the common pathologic feature being lymphocytic infiltration and the common serological feature being the presence of high serum concentrations of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin. Serum concentrations of TPO autoantibodies are elevated in more than 90 percent of patients [

         "Screening" refers to the measurement of thyroid function tests in asymptomatic patients at risk of having thyroid disease who are presently not known to have thyroid disease. The primary benefit of screening for hypothyroidism is the detection of hypothyroidism before the occurrence of symptoms. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common in the adult population [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. However, there is no evidence that early detection and treatment with T4 improves clinically important outcomes in individuals with hypothyroidism detected by screening. Although T4 replacement therapy has few side effects when properly dosed, overtreatment with thyroid hormone is common and may be associated with adverse skeletal and cardiovascular effects, particularly in older patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7881.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         There are two strategies for screening asymptomatic individuals: screening all individuals over a certain age (when risk of hypothyroidism increases), or screening only those individuals with clinical risk factors for hypothyroidism. In the absence of data supporting any screening strategy, we suggest screening patients at increased risk for hypothyroidism, including but not limited to patients with goiter, history of autoimmune disease, previous radioactive iodine therapy, and/or head and neck irradiation, family history of thyroid disease, and use of medications that may impair thyroid function  (

         There are no clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of screening for hypothyroidism. A computer decision model that evaluated a hypothetical cohort of individuals screened every five years beginning at age 35 years showed that screening for hypothyroidism was similarly cost effective as other accepted preventive practices (eg, breast cancer or hypertension screening) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Benefit accrued mainly from the avoidance of symptoms of hypothyroidism when diagnosed and treated early and from the decrease in adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with the lower serum cholesterol concentrations in treated hypothyroid patients. The cost effectiveness of screening was most favorable in older women.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although hypothyroidism is common in older adults (eg, 5 to 15 percent in women over the age of 65 years), there is no evidence that it is associated with adverse outcomes in the oldest individuals when detected by screening alone. This was illustrated in a population-based, prospective study of 558 individuals in the Netherlands who were screened for hypothyroidism during the month of their 85

         Twelve percent had hypothyroidism at baseline (7 percent overt and 5 percent subclinical). Those with overt hypothyroidism were referred to their primary care clinician for further evaluation (although none were started on

         All of the above measures of performance declined over time, but the decline was not accelerated in those with either subclinical or overt hypothyroidism. In fact, increasing serum TSH at baseline was associated with a slower decline in ability to perform "instrumental" ADLs (such as preparing one's own meals, shopping for groceries and personal items, managing one's money, using the telephone, and doing housework).

Although the normal range for serum free T4 concentrations is wide (approximately 0.8 to 1.8 ng/dL [10 to 36 pmol/L]), each person has an endogenous setpoint dictating the optimum concentration for that individual. TSH secretion increases when the serum free T4 concentration falls below that level. (See

          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – The clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism are highly variable, depending upon the age at onset and the duration and severity of thyroid hormone deficiency. Common symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency include fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, myalgia, and menstrual irregularities  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62676" href="/z/d/graphic/62676.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Physical examination findings may include goiter (particularly in patients with iodine deficiency or goitrous chronic autoimmune thyroiditis [Hashimoto's thyroiditis]), bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, and a delayed relaxation phase of the deep tendon reflexes. Serum concentrations of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) autoantibodies are elevated in more than 90 percent of patients with hypothyroidism due to chronic autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's thyroiditis).

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is based primarily upon laboratory testing. In most patients with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be the initial test. If the serum TSH concentration is elevated, the TSH measurement should be repeated along with a serum free thyroxine (T4) to make the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. If central hypothyroidism is suspected (eg, presence of pituitary or hypothalamic disease), or if the patient has convincing symptoms of hypothyroidism despite a normal TSH result, we measure serum TSH and free T4  (

          Overt primary hypothyroidism
         </strong>
         – If the repeat serum TSH value is still high and the serum free T4 is low, suggesting primary hypothyroidism, replacement therapy with T4 should be initiated. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'

          Subclinical hypothyroidism

          Central hypothyroidism
         </strong>
         – In patients with central hypothyroidism, the serum free T4 value is low-normal or low and serum TSH may be frankly low, inappropriately normal (for the low T4), or slightly high (5 to 10 mU/L) due to secretion of biologically inactive TSH  (

         <strong>
          Identifying the cause of hypothyroidism
         </strong>
         – The clinical evaluation of a patient with primary hypothyroidism should be directed toward confirming the presence and identifying the cause of the hormone deficiency  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67769" href="/z/d/graphic/67769.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). The history, for example, may uncover past treatment of hyperthyroidism with radioiodine or thyroidectomy, the use of drugs that affect thyroid hormone synthesis, or history of iodine deficiency or excess. We do not routinely measure TPO antibodies in patients with primary overt hypothyroidism, because almost all have chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. (See

         Measurement of serum TSH (rather than free T4 or total T4) is an excellent screening test for hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients. However, TSH alone may
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be a useful tool for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism if pituitary or hypothalamic disease is known or suspected; in hospitalized patients, since there are many other factors in acutely or chronically ill euthyroid patients that influence TSH secretion; and in patients receiving drugs or with underlying diseases that affect TSH secretion  (

         The universal screening of asymptomatic pregnant women for hypothyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy is controversial. We suggest a targeted approach rather than universal screening (

          Grade 2C

         ). We favor screening pregnant women if they are from an area of moderate to severe iodine insufficiency, have symptoms of hypothyroidism, a family or personal history of thyroid disease, or a personal history of TPO antibodies, type 1 diabetes, class 3 obesity, head and neck radiation, recurrent miscarriage, or infertility.
