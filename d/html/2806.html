Pamidronate and zoledronic acid are approved in the United States, while ibandronate is approved in many European countries. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption by attaching to hydroxyapatite binding sites within bone. The bisphosphonate that is released during bone resorption impairs the ability of the osteoclasts to adhere to the bony surface and resorb bone. In addition, bisphosphonates also reduce osteoclast activity by decreasing osteoclast progenitor development and recruitment, and by promoting osteoclast apoptosis.

However, there are differences as well. As a fully human monoclonal antibody, denosumab is administered as a subcutaneous, rather than intravenous, injection, and its toxicity profile differs in several respects from that of bisphosphonates  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67326" href="/d/graphic/67326.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Knowledge about the comparative side effect profiles of denosumab and bisphosphonates is primarily derived from the three large identically designed registration trials performed in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors as well as a phase III trial conducted exclusively in patients with multiple myeloma [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1927316"><span class="h1">RISKS SHARED BY BOTH CLASSES OF DRUGS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1928329"><span class="h2">Osteonecrosis of the jaw</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), a form of avascular necrosis first described in 2002 [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], is a relatively uncommon but potentially serious side effect of treatment with either intravenous (IV) high-potency bisphosphonates  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55727" href="/d/graphic/55727.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a>.</p><p>MRONJ typically presents as pain, infection, and necrotic bone in the mandible or maxilla in a patient receiving long-term treatment with high-potency antiresorptive agents. The overall risk of this complication is &lt;2 percent in patients receiving antiresorptive agents in the first year of therapy and rises with prolonged therapy.</p><p>The incidence is slightly higher with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a> than with bisphosphonates. Dentoalveolar surgery is a major risk factor. In view of the difficulty in treating and the morbidity associated with established MRONJ, prevention is emphasized. Treatment objectives for patients with an established diagnosis of MRONJ are to eliminate pain, control infection of the soft tissue and bone, and minimize the progression or occurrence of bone necrosis. Treatment has generally shifted away from aggressive surgical interventions toward conservative therapy with limited debridement, antibiotics, and oral rinses with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="113931" href="/d/drug information/113931.html" rel="external">hydrogen peroxide</a> resulting in resolution in a high proportion of patients. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96863.html" rel="external">"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1930509"><span class="h2">Hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Low levels of vitamin D are especially common among patients requiring antiresorptive therapy. All patients receiving parenteral therapy with a bone-modifying agent for advanced cancer should have their calcium and vitamin D levels assessed at baseline, and low levels should be supplemented prior to initiating therapy. This is important both to minimize the risk of hypocalcemia, which can occur from antiresorptive agents, and to optimize the efficacy of antiresorptive therapy.</p><p>Daily supplementation with calcium and vitamin D is indicated for all patients unless otherwise contraindicated (eg, in patients with hypercalcemia or a history of recurrent renal stones). Most patients should receive a total of 1000 mg of calcium (diet plus supplement) and 800 to 1200 international units of vitamin D daily. However, vitamin D dosing should be based on serum levels, and recommendations regarding calcium supplementation should be individualized based on the patient's underlying malignancy (and the risk for developing hypercalcemia) and renal function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2022.html" rel="external">"Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment", section on 'Dosing'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2023.html" rel="external">"Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis", section on 'Optimal intake'</a>.)</p><p>Periodic monitoring of serum calcium levels (eg, every three months) is advised during therapy with either bisphosphonates or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a>. More frequent monitoring is needed in symptomatic patients and those with baseline renal insufficiency, especially shortly after initiating antiresorptive therapy.

If patients become hypercalcemic, calcium supplements and vitamin D should be discontinued and hypercalcemia treatment initiated depending on the level. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/850.html" rel="external">"Treatment of hypercalcemia"</a>.)</p><p>Calcium homeostasis is one of the major functions of bone [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Since osteoclasts resorb bone and release calcium as a result effective osteoclast inhibition can result in hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Most patients do not become hypocalcemic because of compensatory mechanisms, most importantly increased secretion of parathyroid hormone. In some cases, these compensatory mechanisms may be blocked (eg, prior parathyroidectomy, low vitamin D levels, hypomagnesemia hypoparathyroidism, and renal failure), resulting in hypocalcemia [<a href="#rid3">3,10</a>]. Patients are at higher risk of electrolyte imbalance if they have renal insufficiency or decreased compensatory mechanisms.</p><p>The incidence, severity, and time course of hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia can be illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a report of 120 patients who received a total of 546 infusions of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9902" href="/d/drug information/9902.html" rel="external">zoledronic acid</a> for multiple myeloma or another malignancy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], hypocalcemia developed following 55 infusions (10 percent) in 42 of the patients (35 percent). Symptomatic hypocalcemia requiring IV calcium supplementation occurred in 10 patients (8 percent) despite dose adjustment for creatinine clearance (CrCl) and prophylactic supplementation with oral calcium and vitamin D. Impairment of CrCl was seen more often among subjects developing hypocalcemia than in those remaining normocalcemic. Hypomagnesemia was found in all patients who developed hypocalcemia who had measurement of serum magnesium.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the phase III myeloma trial comparing <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9902" href="/d/drug information/9902.html" rel="external">zoledronic acid</a> versus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a>, all patients were supplemented with calcium &gt;500 mg and vitamin D 400 international units daily, and all had a CrCl of at least 30 mL/min [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In the zoledronic acid group, hypocalcemia of any grade developed in 12 percent of the 852 patients, with only 2.5 percent (22 patients) having grade 3 or 4 events.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">Denosumab</a> is a more potent inhibitor of bone resorption than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9902" href="/d/drug information/9902.html" rel="external">zoledronic acid</a> as measured by changes in bone turnover markers [<a href="#rid4">4-6,12</a>]. Thus, it is not unexpected that the incidence rates of hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia were greater with denosumab than with zoledronic acid in all three registration trials and the phase III myeloma trial [<a href="#rid4">4-6,13</a>], and in other reports as well.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the latest integrated analysis of patient-level data from all three conducted solid tumor trials that differed only as to tumor type, hypocalcemia ≥grade 2  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91252" href="/d/graphic/91252.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) occurred in 12.4 percent of patients treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a> versus 5.3 percent of those treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9902" href="/d/drug information/9902.html" rel="external">zoledronic acid</a> [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The median time to first occurrence of hypocalcemia was also shorter with denosumab as compared with zoledronic acid (median 3.8 versus 6.5 months). Most patients experienced only a single hypocalcemic episode; however, 43 percent of denosumab-treated patients and 32 percent of zoledronic acid-treated patients had recurrent events. Multivariate analysis suggested a greater risk of hypocalcemia in those with prostate and small cell lung cancer, and in those with reduced CrCl and higher baseline levels of bone turnover markers. In an integrated analysis of all three solid tumor trials, the incidence of hypophosphatemia of any grade was 32 percent with denosumab versus 20 percent with zoledronic acid [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the phase III myeloma trial, hypocalcemia was observed in 17 percent of the 850 patients treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a>, and 4 percent had grade ≥3 events [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In general, with both drugs, most hypocalcemic episodes have been mild to moderate in severity, and the majority of patients remain asymptomatic.
