Although the incidence of HBV infection has declined among dialysis patients, the prevalence is still high in endemic areas.</p><p>This topic reviews the prognosis and management of HBV in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who are undergoing kidney transplantation. The serologic diagnosis of HBV infection and a general overview of HBV management are provided elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3680.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3642.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1108476662"><span class="h1">GOALS OF MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preventing de novo HBV infection</strong> – In patients without prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection who receive a kidney transplant from a donor with chronic or prior HBV infection, the primary goal of management is prevention of de novo HBV infection. The risk of de novo infection through kidney transplantation is generally low with careful selection of donors according to their HBV status. HBV does not reside in the transplanted kidney, except when the donor is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, the donor has high HBV DNA levels, and there is residual donor blood (and HBV) in the kidney.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preventing reactivation of HBV infection</strong> – In kidney transplant recipients with chronic or prior HBV, the primary goal of management is prevention of HBV reactivation and worsening of liver disease.</p><p></p><p>HBV reactivation and/or a flare of HBV can occur among those with serologic evidence of <strong>chronic HBV infection</strong> (ie, HBsAg positive and hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] positive) as well as those with <strong>prior HBV infection</strong> (ie, HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive) because HBV is present in the liver even after clearance of HBsAg.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HBV reactivation</strong> – Among HBsAg-positive patients, reactivation of HBV replication is generally defined by the appearance of HBV DNA in a patient who has had undetectable HBV DNA previously or by a &gt;1 to 2 logarithmic (10- to 100-fold) increase in HBV DNA. Among HBsAg-negative patients, reactivation is defined by the appearance of HBV DNA or the reappearance of HBsAg.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HBV flare</strong> – Some patients who experience HBV reactivation will develop a hepatitis flare characterized by elevated levels of liver-associated enzymes. A flare of HBV infection is typically defined as a rise in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that is at least three to five times the baseline value and above the reference range. Patients experiencing a flare may or may not experience clinical signs and symptoms of hepatitis.</p><p></p><p>Hepatitis associated with HBV reactivation can lead to severe, symptomatic disease and may even lead to liver failure. Although the risk of liver failure is higher in patients with cirrhosis due to the reduced liver reserve, it can occur as a result of severe reactivation even in patients without cirrhosis. However, with administration of prophylactic or preemptive antiviral therapy, the incidence of liver failure is very low. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3649.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1757084074"><span class="h1">PRETRANSPLANTATION ASSESSMENT OF HBV STATUS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The hepatitis B virus (HBV) status of both the recipient and the donor (living or deceased) should be assessed prior to transplantation to determine if the recipient is at risk for de novo HBV infection or HBV reactivation.</p><p>Other aspects of pretransplant screening, including evaluation for other viral infections (eg, HIV and hepatitis C virus [HCV]), are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7309.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Evaluation of the potential kidney transplant recipient"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7315.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Evaluation of the living kidney donor candidate"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114280.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the potential deceased organ donor (adult)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2531138175"><span class="h2">Recipients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following serologic testing should be performed: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc; total or immunoglobulin G [IgG])  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60827" href="/z/d/graphic/60827.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM) does not play a role in assessing for the risk of de novo infection or HBV reactivation, and should only be obtained in cases where acute infection is suspected. </p><p>The need for additional testing, evaluation, or vaccination depends upon the results. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anti-HBs positive (immunity)</strong> – Recipients who have an anti-HBs titer ≥10 milli-international units (mIU)/mL have immunity to HBV infection either through vaccination (anti-HBc negative) or through prior infection (anti-HBc positive).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If a recipient was vaccinated and had protective levels of anti-HBs in the past and now has an undetectable anti-HBs titer (&lt;10 mIU/mL), a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine is recommended, and a repeat level should be checked after one month. If the anti-HBs titer is increased to ≥10 mIU/mL after the booster dose, the recipient is protected. Studies have shown that most vaccinated patients whose anti-HBs level has decreased to below 10 mIU/mL develop an anamnestic response after one dose of vaccine booster, though this may not be true for immunosuppressed patients [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Vaccinated patients who are on dialysis should have annual testing to ensure that the anti-HBs titer remains ≥10 mIU/mL. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1963.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in patients with end-stage kidney disease", section on 'Hepatitis B virus vaccine'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In kidney transplant recipients with resolved hepatitis B infection, a decrease in anti-HBs to &lt;10 mIU/mL and exposure to high-dose glucocorticoids or other potent immunosuppressive medications (eg, for treatment of transplant rejection) are independent risk factors associated with HBV reactivation [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HBsAg negative, anti-HBc negative, anti-HBs negative (no prior exposure)</strong> – Individuals without prior exposure to HBV should receive vaccination as early as possible since the efficacy of vaccination decreases as chronic kidney disease (CKD) becomes more severe. Seroconversion rates below 50 percent have been reported in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Approaches to enhance the HBV vaccination response in CKD patients are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1963.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in patients with end-stage kidney disease", section on 'Hepatitis B virus vaccine'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If vaccination was not performed prior to the availability of a kidney allograft, or if the patient did not respond (ie, anti-HBs &lt;10 mIU/mL), the patient may be at risk for de novo infection. Preventing de novo infection is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Antiviral therapy to prevent de novo infection'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HBsAg positive (chronic HBV)</strong> – Patients who are HBsAg positive should receive further testing to assess the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status, the HBV DNA level, and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3642.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management", section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The presence of chronic HBV infection, including in patients with compensated cirrhosis (ie, without complications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65667" href="/z/d/graphic/65667.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and no evidence of portal hypertension), is <strong>not</strong> a contraindication to kidney transplantation. Antiviral therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of HBV reactivation associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapy, with improvements in survival approaching that of HBsAg-negative kidney transplant recipients [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3649.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy", section on 'Who should receive antiviral therapy'</a> and <a class="local">'Antiviral therapy to prevent reactivation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">By contrast, those with decompensated cirrhosis (ascites, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension may be considered for combined liver and kidney transplantation. The prognosis of patients with cirrhosis undergoing kidney transplantation is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Patients with cirrhosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Isolated anti-HBc positive</strong> – Patients who are negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs and positive for anti-HBc are considered to be isolated anti-HBc positive. In such patients, we measure a circulating HBV DNA level to better assess HBV status. In general, most patients are HBV DNA negative in serum or have viremia levels below the limit for quantitation, although HBV DNA may be present in the liver, and in these patients, it is reasonable to give a booster dose of the hepatitis B vaccine with follow-up anti-HBs titer measurement. If the recipient develops an anti-HBs titer ≥10 mIU/mL, then they most likely had prior resolved infection. If there is no response to the booster dose, the patient likely has chronic HBV with loss of HBsAg or occult HBV. Alternatively, it is possible that the patient may have failed to mount an antibody response to the booster vaccine due to the impaired immune responsiveness in CKD. Regardless, these patients had prior infection with HBV and are at risk of HBV reactivation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3680.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis in adults", section on 'Diagnostic algorithms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If HBV DNA is detected, vaccination is not warranted. Evaluation for liver cirrhosis should be guided by clinical or biochemical features since it is unlikely that patients who are isolated anti-HBc positive would have significant liver disease, even if HBV DNA is detected, unless other causes of liver disease such as hepatitis C are present.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2555652849"><span class="h2">Donors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Potential kidney donors (living and deceased) should be tested for HBsAg, anti-HBc, and HBV DNA nucleic acid testing (NAT); this approach is consistent with guidelines from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>For living donors, testing should be done within the 28 days before organ procurement; for deceased donors, testing should be performed within 96 hours before organ procurement. Frequently in deceased donors, only qualitative HBV DNA testing is performed since quantitative testing might delay donor decision-making. In countries where there are barriers to access to the HBV DNA assay, testing for HBV DNA can be reserved for donors who are positive for HBsAg or anti-HBc.</p><p>It should be noted that HBV does <strong>not</strong> reside or replicate in the kidney, so the risk of HBV transmission is via residual blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in these organs despite flushing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H662820015"><span class="h1">RECIPIENTS WITHOUT PRIOR HBV INFECTION (INCLUDING THOSE VACCINATED)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recipients without prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection include (see <a class="local">'Recipients'</a> above):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with HBV immunity due to vaccination (hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] negative, hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] positive, anti-HBs &gt;10 milli-international units [mIU]/mL)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with no evidence of prior infection or immunity (ie, hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] negative, anti-HBc negative, and anti-HBs negative)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3192869760"><span class="h2">Suitable donors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The suitability of a donor-recipient pair for kidney transplantation depends upon the HBV status of both the donor and recipient  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119670" href="/z/d/graphic/119670.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p>Recipients with HBV immunity due to vaccination <strong>and </strong>recipients without evidence of prior infection or immunity should ideally receive a kidney transplant from the following donors:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Living or deceased donors who have no evidence of prior HBV infection with or without immunity to HBV through vaccination (HBsAg negative, anti-HBc negative, anti-HBs positive).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Living or deceased donors with prior HBV infection (HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive). The risk of HBV transmission is low unless the donor is HBV DNA positive, in which case prophylactic antiviral therapy is recommended [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Antiviral therapy to prevent de novo infection'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A series from Japan reported that among 45 HBV-naïve recipients of kidneys from donors with resolved HBV infection and negative HBV DNA at the time of kidney donation, one patient (2.2 percent) seroconverted to anti-HBc positive and another patient (2.2 percent) showed transient positivity for HBV DNA without detection of HBsAg after kidney transplantation; both did not receive antiviral therapy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Sometimes, the available donor may be an individual with chronic HBV infection (HBsAg positive). Recipients with HBV immunity due to vaccination may receive a kidney transplant from donors with chronic HBV infection (HBsAg positive). The risk of de novo infection is low but not zero [<a href="#rid12">12-17</a>], which may be due in part to a decrease in anti-HBs titer over time and with immunosuppression. As an example, in one report, 3 of 26 HBsAg-negative recipients developed acute HBV infection after kidney transplantation from HBsAg-positive donors, and all three had been anti-HBs positive through previous vaccination [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Thus, prophylactic antiviral therapy, and possibly a short course of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8520" href="/z/d/drug information/8520.html" rel="external">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> (HBIG), is recommended, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Antiviral therapy to prevent de novo infection'</a> below and <a class="local">'Role of hepatitis B immune globulin'</a> below.)</p><p>By contrast, recipients without prior HBV infection or immunity should generally <strong>avoid </strong>a kidney transplant from donors with chronic HBV infection given the risk of acquisition of de novo HBV infection by the recipient. However, in the era of antiviral medications, such transplantation may be performed when transplantation is<strong> urgently needed for life-saving reasons</strong> (such as exhaustion of dialysis access). In this setting, recipients should receive antiviral therapy and possibly HBIG to prevent de novo infection, although there are no data on the efficacy of HBIG in such circumstances. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Role of hepatitis B immune globulin'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4281197125"><span class="h2">Antiviral therapy to prevent de novo infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antiviral therapy should be administered to certain recipients who are at risk for de novo HBV infection  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119670" href="/z/d/graphic/119670.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

Antiviral therapy is generally not necessary if the HBV DNA is negative, although some experts administer antiviral therapy for a year regardless of the donor HBV DNA status [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p>The choice of regimen and suggested duration of treatment is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Choice of regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>Among recipients without a history of prior HBV (regardless of vaccination status) who receive a kidney transplant from donors with chronic HBV infection (HBsAg positive), the risk of de novo HBV infection is low because hepatitis B virus does not reside in the kidney [<a href="#rid12">12-17</a>]. However, it is common practice to give the recipient prophylactic antiviral therapy to further reduce this risk. </p><p>In a retrospective study of 83 HBsAg-positive donor to HBsAg-negative recipient kidney transplants, in which 65 recipients received antiviral prophylaxis, none of the 63 recipients who were anti-HBs positive before transplantation developed de novo HBV infection over a median of 36 months [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Two HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs-negative, and anti-HBc-negative patients became HBsAg positive after transplantation, despite prophylactic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9544" href="/z/d/drug information/9544.html" rel="external">lamivudine</a> treatment for 1.5 and 2 months, respectively, starting at the time of transplantation. Although these findings support the use of prophylactic antiviral therapy in recipients without a history of prior HBV who receive a kidney from a donor with chronic HBV, short treatment durations of two months may be inadequate.</p><p>Prophylactic antiviral medication should be administered to HBV-naïve patients who receive kidneys from HBV DNA viremic donors, even if they were previously immunized. Therapy should be administered irrespective of the level of anti-HBs in the kidney recipient at the time of transplantation. A series from the United States reported the outcome of eight kidney recipients who were anti-HBc negative and anti-HBs positive with antibody titer &gt;10 mIU/mL at the time of kidney transplantation who received kidneys from donors who were HBV DNA positive (four HBsAg positive and four HBsAg negative) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Four patients were started on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8816" href="/z/d/drug information/8816.html" rel="external">entecavir</a> at the time of transplant operation.
