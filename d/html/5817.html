(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1800.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p>There are unique challenges in caring for children and adolescents with T1DM that differentiate pediatric from adult care. These include the obvious differences in the size of the patients, developmental issues such as the unpredictability of a toddler's dietary intake and activity level and inability to communicate symptoms of hypoglycemia, and medical issues such as the increased risk of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Because of these considerations, the management of a child with T1DM must take into account the age and developmental maturity of the child.</p><p>Most children with T1DM present relatively early with the classic signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia and deficient insulin release, including polyuria and polydipsia, sometimes associated with polyphagia and weight loss. Approximately 30 percent of children present with severe insulin deficiency and DKA [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. The topic below provides an overview of the management of T1DM in children who are not in DKA. Details of insulin therapy, including regimens, pumps, and blood glucose monitoring, are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129412.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p>Other aspects of childhood-onset T1DM are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Routine management:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5816.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129412.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5818.html" rel="external">"Complications and screening in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16412.html" rel="external">"Management of exercise for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5819.html" rel="external">"Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children during illness, procedures, school, or travel"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prevention and management of acute glycemic emergencies:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97229.html" rel="external">"Hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5809.html" rel="external">"Diabetic ketoacidosis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5808.html" rel="external">"Diabetic ketoacidosis in children: Treatment and complications"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5829.html" rel="external">"Diabetic ketoacidosis in children: Cerebral injury (cerebral edema)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF DIABETES EDUCATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4028043144"><span class="h2">Goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Successful management of children with diabetes includes [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Balance the goal of strict glycemic control, which reduces the risk of long-term sequelae of chronic hyperglycemia, against the goal of avoiding severe hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can occur more frequently in the setting of stricter control, but newer technologies mitigate this risk to variable degrees. Targeted glycemic goals define what is thought to be the best balance between these long- and short-term complications. (See <a class="local">'Overview of insulin therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Set realistic goals for each child and family. The patient's age and developmental status and the level of family involvement are important factors in establishing a practical management plan that can be implemented by the patient and family/caregivers. (See <a class="local">'Age-based care'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Train the patient and family/caregivers in diabetes self-management techniques to maintain blood glucose within a target range and to recognize and treat hypoglycemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5831.html" rel="external">"Self-management education for the child with diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintain normal growth, development, and emotional maturation and support increasing independence and self-care of diabetes as the child grows older.</p><p></p><p>Initial diabetes education and self-care training provided by a multidisciplinary team effectively permits the patient and family to acquire the knowledge and skills needed for care [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Team members should include an endocrinologist, nurse educator, dietitian, and mental health professional who can provide pediatric-specific education and care. Comprehensive management by a pediatric diabetes team reduces the number of hospitalizations and emergency room visits and is cost-effective [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Training and care of the patient and family/caregivers is divided into two management phases [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In the initial phase, treatment with insulin is initiated and the patient and family/caregivers are taught the most essential skills to safely manage diabetes. In the second phase, the family is given further education and support to optimize glycemic control and long-term management.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Initial management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial phase begins at the time of diagnosis. In these first few days, the family begins to understand the disease process and is trained to successfully measure blood glucose concentrations, administer insulin, recognize and treat hypoglycemia, and measure blood or urine ketone concentrations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71840" href="/z/d/graphic/71840.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basic understanding – The diabetes team teaches the patient and family the cause and treatment of T1DM, how to maintain a daily schedule and record of blood glucose test results, how to administer insulin, and the timing and carbohydrate content of meals and snacks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood glucose testing – Families/caregivers must master blood glucose testing. A variety of easy-to-use blood glucose meters are available for this purpose. The parents or caregivers are instructed on the frequency and timing of blood glucose testing, depending upon the needs of their child.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Insulin administration – Training includes teaching the family and caregivers about the different types of prescribed insulin, how to measure and inject insulin, and how to rotate injection sites. Family members and caregivers must learn about the duration and action of the various types of insulin prescribed for the child, and how to adjust the insulin dose based upon blood glucose concentrations and carbohydrate intake. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129412.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In our practice, we encourage the parents to administer the first injection. Although this requires additional assistance and fairly directive behavior on the part of the clinician, we find that it facilitates the learning process. Because most parents are frightened about administering an injection to their child, their ability to learn is limited until they have administered the first injection. We also find it useful to have the parents administer a <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/z/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> injection to themselves so that they realize the discomfort is minimal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypoglycemia – Families and caregivers are taught to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. Detection of hypoglycemia is particularly difficult in the nonverbal young child and infant in whom the signs of hypoglycemia are nonspecific. Parents are trained to check a blood glucose level and, if this is too low, to intervene with dietary measures and/or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13335" href="/z/d/drug information/13335.html" rel="external">glucagon</a>. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97229.html" rel="external">"Hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a> and <a class="local">'Age-based care'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ketosis – Families and caregivers are taught to check urine for ketones or measure blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration at times of illness and/or in the setting of significant or prolonged hyperglycemia (eg, if two consecutive blood glucose readings are greater than 250 mg/dL [13.9 mmol/L]) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This is especially important in young children, insulin pump users, or those with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5819.html" rel="external">"Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children during illness, procedures, school, or travel"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5809.html" rel="external">"Diabetic ketoacidosis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Care setting – The initial educational and care phase may occur either in the inpatient or ambulatory setting. Most institutions have moved from prolonged inpatient admissions for newly diagnosed patients to either short hospitalizations, day hospital settings, or exclusively ambulatory management. Patient outcome is similar with outpatient and inpatient management, regardless of the length of inpatient hospitalization, and health care costs are much less with day hospital or outpatient treatment [<a href="#rid8">8-12</a>]. Accordingly, we initiate the care of most newly diagnosed children with T1DM without DKA in the outpatient setting. A multidisciplinary team provides close follow-up (daily phone contact and ambulatory visits as necessary), comprehensive education, and an individualized management plan for the child and their family.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Supervision – Once the family and diabetes clinicians are comfortable with the family's ability to manage the child's diabetes at home, plans should be made to return the child to school or the daycare center, as appropriate. If the child will require insulin at school or daycare, a responsible individual must be identified and trained in basic diabetes management skills. Supervising adults should be taught to detect and respond to hypoglycemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5819.html" rel="external">"Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children during illness, procedures, school, or travel", section on 'School and daycare'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Patients with diabetes should wear a medical emergency bracelet/necklace to enable suitable intervention by emergency personnel should an emergency situation arise (ie, hypoglycemia or DKA). <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalert.org%2F&amp;token=5yLNPmHjkOhvnhOBCCm6DAZPLoHBubhCOVCA0Ec1SmN4Jzha8TnBpGZDjKJd2Nmq&amp;TOPIC_ID=5817" target="_blank">MedicAlert</a> provides an excellent resource.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Ongoing management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After the initial phase, the diabetes team continues to provide care, teaching, and support to the child and family. Sessions with individual team members (endocrinologist, nurse educator, dietitian, and mental health professional) allow more in-depth education and care directed toward the goal of maintaining excellent glucose control. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5831.html" rel="external">"Self-management education for the child with diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p>During these sessions, the concepts that are required for glycemic control are taught and reinforced. These include the interaction of insulin, diet, and exercise on blood glucose concentrations. A management regimen specific for each patient is designed to achieve the best possible glucose control. In addition, the clinician should explain that strict glycemic control helps to prevent long-term sequelae of T1DM; this discussion should be repeated and reinforced as often as necessary, particularly if glycemic control is suboptimal.</p><p>Providing age-appropriate psychosocial support for the patient and family by a proficient mental health professional improves adherence to the management plan [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Psychosocial issues'</a> below.)</p><p>As the child grows older, education and training are directed toward increased autonomy and self-management for the patient. (See <a class="local">'Age-based care'</a> below.)</p><p>Printed literature and websites available for patient and family education are valuable supplements to the teaching provided by the diabetes team  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71046" href="/z/d/graphic/71046.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20598376"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF INSULIN THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Insulin administration is the core treatment for all patients with T1DM. To be safe and effective, insulin therapy must be tailored to the individual patient and adjusted based on blood glucose testing.</p><p>Key steps include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring glycemic control</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) – A1C is monitored intermittently (typically, every three months) as an index of long-term glycemic control.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Blood glucose – Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is performed several times daily to detect short-term glycemic excursions. This can be done with a home glucose meter using fingerstick sampling or a device for continuous glucose monitoring. These data are used to adjust insulin dosing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In those using a continuous glucose monitor, "time in range" (time in the target glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL [3.9 to 10 mmol/L]) over a 14-day period is increasingly being used as a measure of diabetes control in children, adolescents, and adults and correlates well with long-term microvascular complications. The target glucose range could be set narrower (such as 70 to 140 mg/dL) if tighter glucose control is desired. Time in range correlates well with A1C, and continuous glucose monitor downloads now provide an estimated A1C level (referred to as the glucose management indicator) based on the 14-day continuous glucose monitor output. In addition, daily glycemic variability is a valuable tool for monitoring glycemic control, also available in the continuous glucose monitor downloads.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Targets for glycemic control</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A target A1C of &lt;7 percent (53 mmol/mol) is recommended for most children, adolescents, and adults who have access to comprehensive diabetes care [<a href="#rid5">5,13,14</a>]. Clinical experience with modern management methods (including insulin pump therapy and continuous glucose monitoring) suggests that relatively stringent A1C targets improve glycemic control without significantly increasing the risk for severe hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid5">5,13,14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129412.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Target for hemoglobin A1c'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97229.html" rel="external">"Hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">This target should be tailored to the individual patient. Targets for glycemic control in infants and young children are generally similar to those for older age groups, in which equal value is placed on avoiding both hypo- and hyperglycemia. However, less stringent A1C targets (eg, A1C &lt;7.5 percent) may be appropriate for some young children and other children with special risk factors for hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia is difficult to detect because infants are unable to communicate their symptoms and clinical signs are nonspecific (eg, poor feeding, lethargy, jitteriness, hypotonia).</p><p>Infants with severe hypoglycemia can present with seizures or coma, which may have permanent neurologic sequelae. In addition, repeated, prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia as well as persistent hyperglycemia may have deleterious effects on brain development and learning, especially in children younger than five years of age [<a href="#rid18">18-21</a>].</p><p>The frequent feeding schedule of infancy makes it challenging to develop a management plan that avoids episodes of hypoglycemia but provides sufficient glycemic control. In addition, caregivers may experience emotional stress and other challenges because of the burden of managing T1DM in an infant and may benefit from extra support and guidance [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Toddlers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The issues regarding the care of toddlers (one to three years of age) are similar to those in infants. The parents or caregivers must learn to manage diabetes and be responsible for the daily care of the child. Avoiding hypoglycemia can be challenging because of the erratic food intake and activity levels of toddlers. This problem can be addressed by frequent blood glucose monitoring (or use of continuous glucose monitoring) and use of an insulin pump or other flexible dosing systems.</p><p>Symptoms of hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in a toddler. In some cases, the altered behavior caused by hypoglycemia may resemble developmentally normal episodes of oppositional behavior and temper tantrums. Caregivers must learn to measure blood glucose in response to these symptoms rather than ignoring a temper tantrum.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Preschool and early school-aged children</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For preschool and early school-aged children (three to seven years of age), a parent or other caregiver must still provide most of the daily diabetes care [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. However, some children can begin to participate in their own care by testing their blood glucose or preparing materials. Often, such mastery behaviors are short-lived as the children rapidly become bored and wish to forgo such responsibilities. It is important to understand that this behavior is normal and age-appropriate. At this age, the child should participate in their diabetes care only under direct supervision by a parent or caregiver.</p><p>As children enter daycare or school, childcare providers and school nurses must be involved in their diabetes care. Some parents or primary caregivers may have difficulty sharing care with others, including the patient. Continued support by the diabetes care team is important to facilitate this transition. In the United States, children younger than six years may be eligible to receive supplemental Social Security income to help their parents with the economic impact of diabetes management in the young child [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

The child can learn to administer the routine insulin injections but still needs assistance and supervision for all management decisions that are not routine. All glucose testing and insulin administration should be under adult supervision. Children who make an early transition to independent self-management with minimal or no adult supervision tend to have poorer glycemic control [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of diabetes has a psychological impact on children, which may be manifested by depression and anxiety [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. Children may also have difficulty with social interactions because of the perception that they are different from their peers. The family and diabetes team should encourage participation in school activities to develop normal peer relationships and ensure regular school attendance [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Attendance at diabetes camp also may help children better adjust to their diagnosis [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. A diabetes camp can also help familiarize children with alternate methods for glucose monitoring and insulin administration, such as continuous glucose monitoring systems and insulin pumps, and the peer-interactive environment may help to engage patients with these technologies.</p><p>Screening for behavioral disturbances and discussion of psychosocial issues should be included in the routine medical care for a child with diabetes. Children who are at risk for these problems may benefit from mental health evaluation and support, which may include the parents or other family members [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The family and clinicians should also be alert for the possibility of developing cognitive deficits and learning difficulties, so that appropriate resources care to be provided if needed [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. This is particularly important for children who are at increased risk of cognitive deficits because they developed diabetes at a very young age or have poor glycemic control, frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, and/or longer duration of the disease.

Worsening of glycemic control is common, in part because insulin resistance and insulin requirements increase during puberty [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Therefore, determining the appropriate extent of adult involvement can be challenging [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Although adolescents can be responsible for the daily management of their diabetes, those who have minimal or no adult supervision tend to have poor glycemic control [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], and shared management between the adolescent and their parents or caregivers is associated with better glycemic control [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. On the other hand, excessive involvement by the parent or caregivers and parent-child conflict over daily management sometimes leads to poor control [<a href="#rid35">35-37</a>]. Similarly, depressed mood in the adolescent (even if mild) can interfere with family involvement and diabetes control [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>Family-focused teamwork, which includes developing shared parent-child responsibility and strategies to avoid conflict, improves the care of the older child or adolescent with diabetes [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. This was illustrated in a controlled trial of family-focused teamwork compared with standard multidisciplinary diabetes care in children who ranged from 8 to 17 years of age [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Family-focused care, which included establishing a responsibility-sharing plan at the end of each office visit and active family discussion, increased family involvement and resulted in better glycemic control (adjusted A1C 8.8 versus 9.3 percent). This approach allows the care team to develop a shared responsibility plan that is appropriate for the patient based upon their cognitive, physical, and psychosocial maturity.</p><p>Other issues for the adolescent patient with diabetes include [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Driving – Adolescents with diabetes should be taught to test blood glucose levels before driving.

It is essential that adolescents understand the risks of driving while hypoglycemic and that they carry carbohydrate snacks with them at all times. If the blood glucose test before driving is in the hypoglycemic range, they should take a carbohydrate snack and recheck their blood glucose to confirm normalization before driving.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Risky behavior – Adolescence is also a time period that is characterized by experimentation with risky behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use and unprotected sexual intercourse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Alcohol intake can be associated with severe hypoglycemia.

Young children often have variable food intake and picky eating habits, requiring adjustments to the insulin dose [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Insulin pumps facilitate variable dosing regimens and may be particularly useful for this age group.</p><p>Many patients experience weight loss when diabetes is first diagnosed. The lost weight is generally regained during the first few weeks of therapy due to insulin administration, hydration, and adequate energy intake. During this time of increased consumption, children often require large amounts of insulin to control their blood glucose levels. After the weight loss is corrected, ongoing assessment of growth (eg, weight, height, body mass index) is necessary to monitor adequacy of dietary intake and glycemic control [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p>Excellent glycemic control is necessary for normal growth and development [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Excess insulin administration, or failure to reduce insulin dose post-puberty or after initial regain of weight, may lead to excessive weight gain as the child attempts to treat hypoglycemia by overeating. If the child becomes overweight, caloric intake or insulin administration may need to be reduced [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Consultation with a registered dietitian with experience in pediatric nutrition and diabetes is an important component of diabetes care [<a href="#rid4">4,51</a>]. The dietitian provides instruction regarding the effect of food on blood glucose concentration, a diet that ensures adequate nutritional intake, and information regarding carbohydrate counting. Mastery of carbohydrate counting and understanding the glycemic effects of different kinds of carbohydrates are especially important in patients on an intensive regimen, who need to adjust premeal insulin boluses based upon the anticipated glycemic effect of consumed carbohydrates. The glycemic effect also depends on the balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in a given meal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129412.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Calculate prandial insulin'</a>.)</p><p>An appropriate goal for carbohydrate content of the diet is 45 to 65 percent of total calories, similar to that of children without T1DM. It is important to avoid sugar-sweetened beverages (other than at times of hypoglycemia) and high-carbohydrate desserts and to limit simple carbohydrates to avoid rapid increases in blood glucose levels. Thus, the typically recommended diet for T1DM includes complex carbohydrates balanced with protein, fat, and fiber.</p><p>Some patients choose to limit carbohydrates further. Limited evidence suggests that some carbohydrate restriction may improve glycemic control; however, the sustainability of such diets in children and adolescents, effects on physical growth and development, and long-term safety and efficacy have not been evaluated [<a href="#rid51">51,52</a>]. A guidance statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that patients may reasonably choose to follow a diet with moderate carbohydrate restriction (26 to 44 percent of total calories), provided that they have family support and medical monitoring to ensure healthy growth, healthy eating behaviors, and appropriate insulin dosing [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. If the goal is weight loss (or to avoid excessive weight gain), the main focus of counseling should be to limit total calories rather than stringent carbohydrate restriction, along with ample physical activity. Low-carbohydrate diets (&lt;26 percent of calories) and very low-carbohydrate diets (20 to 50 g daily) should generally be avoided due to safety concerns [<a href="#rid54">54,55</a>]. If a patient chooses to follow these more stringent diets, they should be closely monitored for ketosis, adverse effects on growth and puberty, micronutrient deficiencies, disordered eating, and weight rebound [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p>Nutrition management, including consistency of carbohydrate intake, carbohydrate counting, and glycemic content and index, is discussed in greater detail separately.

Exercise also presents several important challenges, which require careful management. In patients with diabetes, the intensity and duration of exercise affect the physiologic response and risk for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can occur during or immediately after exercise or be delayed by several hours. The physiologic response to exercise also depends upon the plasma insulin concentration at the time of exercise. Conversely, exercise can trigger hyperglycemia under certain circumstances. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16412.html" rel="external">"Management of exercise for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Clinical consequences'</a>.)</p><p>Children who participate in sport activities require increased monitoring of blood glucose (before, after, and at regular intervals during prolonged strenuous activity) and appropriate adjustment of insulin dosing. School personnel and coaches need to recognize symptoms of and be able to treat hypoglycemia. At the beginning of a new exercise regimen (eg, a new sports season), insulin requirements often decrease, particularly during and after exercise. Frequent blood glucose monitoring during the 12 hours after physical activity should be performed to guide insulin dose adjustment during this period. Afternoon or evening exercise may cause hypoglycemia later that night. Therefore, it is prudent for patients to check blood glucose during the overnight period after strenuous exercise. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16412.html" rel="external">"Management of exercise for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28"><span class="h2">Psychosocial issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest routinely assessing for depression, anxiety, school absences, family conflict, and other mental health challenges during most routine visits for diabetes care.

Patients with symptoms of depression or other concerns should be referred for evaluation by a mental health specialist. (See <a class="local">'Referrals'</a> below.)</p><p>Diabetes has a psychological impact on the patient and family, as do other chronic diseases. Depression and anxiety are common in older children and adolescents with diabetes and in their parents or caregivers [<a href="#rid26">26,27,56,57</a>]; adolescents are at risk for an eating disorder. In older children and adolescents, family conflict arises over the level of adult involvement in the care of the patient, during a normal developmental period of increasing independence and self-assertiveness. These psychological issues lead to poorer glycemic control and an increased risk of hospitalization and episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) [<a href="#rid58">58-61</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Adolescents'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5818.html" rel="external">"Complications and screening in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Psychiatric disorders'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, socioeconomic factors such as single-parent families, poor socioeconomic status, and chronic physical or mental health problems in a parent or other close family member are associated with poorer diabetes control and increased hospitalizations [<a href="#rid4">4,58,62-65</a>]. As an example, one study from New Zealand reported that Maori or Pacific ethnicity and social deprivation are independent predictors of poor metabolic control in T1DM [<a href="#rid66">66</a>].</p><p>Comprehensive management of diabetes that addresses these psychosocial issues can improve glycemic control and reduce hospitalization even in the high-risk adolescent.

This requires comprehensive case management and intensive training of the patient, family, and other caregivers. (See <a class="local">'Goals'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Diabetes education and self-management training by a pediatric diabetes multidisciplinary team provides the ideal setting to acquire the knowledge and skills needed for care.

However, glycemic targets should be further tailored to the individual patient; less-stringent goals may be appropriate for individual patients. Insulin therapy is tailored to the individual patient, and the dose is adjusted as needed to maintain blood glucose in the target range. Insulin may be administered as multiple daily injections or a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump, with or without integrated continuous glucose sensors and automated dose adjustments ["closed-loop systems"]). (See <a class="local">'Overview of insulin therapy'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129412.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age-based care</strong> – Specific challenges with diabetes management arise in each age group, and these should be anticipated and addressed with the child and family  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53457" href="/z/d/graphic/53457.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).
