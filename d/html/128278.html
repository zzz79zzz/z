         Esophagectomy consists of esophagogastric mobilization with or without lymphadenectomy, conduit construction, resection, and anastomosis. Each component can be performed open or with minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and robotic approaches [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In this topic, we describe the technique of total minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy in detail and other techniques briefly (eg, three-field McKeown esophagectomy, transhiatal esophagectomy).
        </p>
        <p>
         The indications for and complications of esophagectomy are discussed in other topics. (See

         The operation described here is a complete minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy with an intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Variations of this operation include laparotomy with thoracoscopy, laparoscopy with thoracotomy, and robot-assisted surgery. These are referred to as hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The minimally invasive Ivor Lewis technique is suitable for most distal esophageal cancers, gastroesophageal junction cancers, and short- to moderate-length Barrett esophagus with high-grade dysplasia. Given concerns about resection margins, the minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy should not be performed for upper-third or mid-esophageal cancer with significant proximal extension [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Advantages of the Ivor Lewis esophagectomy are a lower rate of anastomotic leak and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury compared with operations with a cervical anastomosis. Disadvantages include the requirement for single-lung ventilation [
         <a href="#rid3">

         The patient is placed either supine or in low lithotomy position. If supine positioning is used, the surgeon operates from the patient's right side. If the lithotomy position is chosen, the surgeon mostly operates from between the legs.

         The arrangement of port placement depends on surgeon preference and patient body habitus. Most commonly, five abdominal ports are used for the intra-abdominal portion of the operation  (

        </p>
        <p>
         A liver retractor is used to expose the diaphragmatic esophageal hiatus. We place the Nathanson retractor through a 5 mm subxiphoid stab incision.

         We prefer to perform this portion of the gastric mobilization prior to dissecting the greater curvature as carbon dioxide introduced into the lesser sac may facilitate entry into the correct plane during gastric mobilization.

         The hiatal dissection begins with opening of the gastrohepatic ligament at the pars flaccida to expose the right crus. This dissection is performed close to the liver to include all pertinent fibrofatty, perigastric tissue as the right crus is approached. The mobilization is typically continued anteriorly, working in a clockwise manner circumferentially around the anterior hiatus, and then down the left crus. The phrenoesophageal ligaments are often divided.

         Attention is then turned to identifying the left gastric artery and vein pedicle  (

          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Using a blunt-tipped laparoscopic grasper from the leftmost assistant port, the lesser curve is retracted laterally and elevated anteriorly toward the abdominal wall. This maneuver places the left gastric artery on tension and allows its base to be easily visualized  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef130790" href="/z/d/graphic/130790.html" rel="external">

         </span>
         We then perform a complete lymph node dissection using an energy device. Beginning at the base of the left gastric artery, all nodal and fibrofatty tissue is dissected free and swept toward the gastric specimen. This lymphadenectomy is typically continued along the splenic artery to the splenic hilum and includes the fatty tissue along the superior border of the pancreas, common and proper hepatic nodes, and celiac nodes  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111319" href="/z/d/graphic/111319.html" rel="external">

         Once the left gastric artery and vein are skeletonized of surrounding tissue and circumferentially dissected, they are divided with an endoscopic vascular stapler. We routinely make sure a visible pulse is present in the hepatic and splenic artery before firing the stapler to ensure that the main celiac axis is not inadvertently divided.

         The hiatal dissection continues until the base of the left crus is identified [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Returning to the right crus, the dissection is carried down inferiorly to expose the decussation of the left and right crus. If the periesophageal plane does not develop due to either tumor involvement or postinduction fibrosis, we resect some crural muscle fibers to ensure an R0 resection. We do not identify the vagi nerves, as they require division for an oncological resection.

         After the retroesophageal window is created and the esophagus is encircled with a Penrose drain, further dissection into the mediastinum is halted as violation of the pleural space may lead to laxity of the hemidiaphragm(s), which may compromise visualization or cardiopulmonary function.

         The greater curvature of the stomach is dissected next. Adequate dissection of the greater curve can be assured when the pylorus easily reaches the hiatus. At this point the stomach should be completely mobilized, and gastric conduit creation proceeds. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Conduit creation'

         Using a "minimal touch" technique (avoid grasping the stomach as much as possible), a window in the gastrocolic ligament is created about halfway up the greater curvature in order to enter the lesser sac. In patients who have a large amount of omental fat, entry into the correct plane can be difficult during this step; the transverse mesocolon must be protected. We aim to stay at least 3 to 4 cm away from the gastroepiploic vessels  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56689" href="/z/d/graphic/56689.html" rel="external">
          figure 2

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Once the lesser sac is entered, the greater curvature dissection is continued cranially toward the fundus of the stomach. Eventually, the gastroepiploic artery fades out and the short gastric vessels are reached. These are similarly divided with the energy device.
        </p>

         After this dissection is completed, the stomach is atraumatically retracted (without grasping) toward the patient's right and anteriorly. This places the retrogastric attachments on tension and allows them to be carefully divided.
        </p>

         Dissection is then carried through the gastrocolic ligament toward the pylorus. During this step, the right gastroepiploic artery must be protected  (

          figure 2

         ) as it forms the sole blood supply to the gastric conduit. The latter part of this dissection can be particularly difficult in patients with a history of pancreatitis or biliary tract procedures (eg, cholecystectomy). In patients with a lot of omental fat, it is important to avoid injuring the mesocolon.

         We begin our conduit creation at just about the level of the crow's foot on the lesser curvature. The stapling typically starts with a vascular load to divide the lesser curvature fat and small vasculature  (

         After the initial gastric stapling, the stomach is put on stretch in order to ensure a straight conduit. This is facilitated by having the assistant grasp the top of the fundus (preferably in an area that will be removed) and retract toward the left upper quadrant. At the same time, countertraction toward the patient's right lower quadrant is applied via a second Penrose drain placed around the stomach  (

         With the stomach on appropriate tension, the gastric conduit staple line is created with serial stapling toward the fundus, with each stapling parallel to the greater curvature. We aim to create a conduit approximately 4 to 5 cm in width to optimize postoperative conduit function  (

         We still routinely place feeding jejunostomy tubes during esophagectomy and have more often than not found them to be beneficial. A feeding jejunostomy can be placed via mini upper laparotomy or laparoscopically.

         Next, with downward retraction on the Penrose drain surrounding the esophagus, a mediastinal dissection is performed up to the level of the inferior pulmonary veins. We have found that a high mediastinal dissection during the laparoscopic portion facilitates the thoracoscopic phase of the operation.

         Prior to closing the abdomen, it is crucial to evaluate and maintain proper orientation of the conduit. It is also important to assess the size of the hiatal opening and reduce it to allow just the passage of the gastric conduit and minimize the risk of paraconduit hernia. The Penrose drain is placed high in the mediastinum for later retrieval during the thoracoscopic phase. Hemostasis is checked and ensured. Prior to closure, we perform bilateral transverse abdominis plane (TAP) and rectus sheath blocks laparoscopically for pain control. The liver retractor is removed, and the abdominal ports are closed.

         Once the abdominal portion of the procedure is complete, the single-lumen endotracheal tube is exchanged for a double-lumen endotracheal tube in order to achieve left-sided single-lung ventilation.

         During intrathoracic esophageal dissection, care must be taken regarding the position of the airway to prevent injury to the membranous portions of the right and left mainstem bronchi. Dissection posterior to the esophagus can cause an injury to the thoracic duct. While it is not our practice to routinely perform thoracic duct ligation, it may be required if an intraoperative chyle leak is suspected. Generous use of metal clips is recommended to seal large lymphatics and aortoesophageal vessels. The surgeon must also be aware of the location of the aorta as this too may be injured with overzealous dissection posterior to the esophagus.

         Prior to mobilization of the intrathoracic esophagus, a retraction suture is often placed through the tendinous portion of the diaphragm to allow inferior retraction and exposure of the distal esophagus in the right thoracic cavity.

         The inferior pulmonary ligament is divided up to the inferior pulmonary vein, and pulmonary ligament (level 9) lymph nodes are harvested  (

         ). With adequate mediastinal dissection previously completed from within the abdomen, the Penrose drain is often easily identified once the inferior pulmonary ligament is taken down. The lung is then retracted anteriorly while the esophagus is retracted posteriorly to allow this dissection to continue along the pericardium.

         The posterior mediastinal pleura is opened superiorly until the inferior border of the azygos vein  (

Dissection of the pleura overlying the esophagus is then transitioned inferiorly to within the posterior groove of the esophagus just anterior to the azygos vein, leaving a swatch of pleura adherent to the specimen. At this point, we often choose to perform our subcarinal lymph node dissection either en bloc with the specimen or separately.

         Next, the azygos vein is divided with a vascular stapler. Following this, the thoracic esophagus is then completely mobilized circumferentially to a level typically just above the divided azygos vein.

         Once the intrathoracic esophagus has been adequately mobilized, the proximal esophagus is divided with an Endo GIA stapler above the level of the azygos vein. The proximal extent of dissection is dependent on the indication for esophagectomy; however, the planned level of the intrathoracic anastomosis is always above the level of the azygos vein.

         Next, the specimen and gastric conduit are carefully brought into the thorax through the hiatus with gentle traction. The surgical team must be vigilant in maintaining proper orientation of the conduit to prevent torsion. The staple line of the gastric conduit should be facing laterally (toward the ceiling of the operating room). The gastric conduit staple line is then completed, and the esophagogastric specimen is removed through the low anterior access incision. The proximal and distal margins are sent for pathology.

         The gastric conduit should be brought further into the chest. The conduit should be assessed for length to estimate the location of the anastomosis and aim to place the anastomosis in an area that appears well perfused. The anastomosis should be tension free, but a redundant conduit should be avoided as it tends to lead to functional and emptying issues in the patient's postoperative course.

         Generally speaking, a cervical anastomosis is associated with a greater risk of anastomotic leak, stricture, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and swallowing dysfunction, whereas an intrathoracic anastomosis can be associated with more cardiopulmonary complications and direr consequences when the anastomosis leaks [

Oncologic outcomes of minimally invasive esophagectomy are discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Outcomes'
         </a>
         above.)

          Complications
         </strong>
         – The choice of minimally invasive esophagectomy techniques is largely determined by surgeon preference and partly dependent upon patient and tumor factors; the choice of techniques can have a direct impact on patients' postoperative morbidities. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Complications'
         </a>
         above.)
