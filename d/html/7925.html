         Plasma derivatives are products manufactured from human plasma by chromatographic and other fractionation techniques. Some proteins can also be purified from serum. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Starting material'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of plasma proteins (or their modified forms) are also produced using recombinant DNA technologies, in which the protein is produced from an expression system into which a gene has been introduced.
        </p>

         This topic review discusses selected plasma-derived, serum-derived, and recombinant proteins that are used in medical practice. Plasma products including Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pathogen-inactivated plasma, Cryoprecipitate, and fibrin sealant (fibrin glue) are discussed in detail separately:

         Plasma is the liquid portion of blood from which cellular elements have been removed. Serum is the remaining liquid portion after plasma has been allowed to clot and the clot removed. Serum does not contain coagulation factors; thus, plasma must be used to isolate coagulation factors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Products derived from plasma or serum have a theoretical risk of exposing the recipient to an infectious organism(s) present in the donor's blood; however, viral inactivation steps are highly effective in reducing viral transmission. (See
         <a class="local">

         Products prepared from plasma or serum may contain trace amounts of IgA and as such, may trigger anaphylactic reactions in some individuals with selective IgA deficiency who make no IgA and thus see the IgA protein as foreign. (See

         The starting material for purification of clotting factors is plasma. For other derivatives such as immunoglobulins or albumin, plasma or serum can be used. Harvard biochemist Edwin J Cohn and a team of scientists developed the first plasma fractionation process using cold ethanol fractionation; this method became known as the Cohn fractionation process [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Additional methods for purifying these proteins involve ion exchange, immune affinity chromatography, and other separation techniques, but modifications of the original cold ethanol process remain the mainstay for the production of plasma derivatives. The Cohn fractionation process causes immune globulins (ie, antibodies, primarily immunoglobulin G [IgG]) and some coagulation factors to precipitate in fractions II and III, from which relatively pure preparations can be produced. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Antibody products'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Manufacturers of plasma derivatives perform various additional steps to inactivate viruses and other infectious agents [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Examples include chromatography, filtration, nanofiltration, solvent/detergent treatment, heat treatment, and pasteurization. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7929.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogen inactivation of blood products", section on 'Technologies'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Often the proteins are purified from large pools of plasma donors (often thousands of donors). Many of these products can be stored as a lyophilized powder (ie, freeze-dried under a vacuum), which preserves biologic activity, increases shelf-life, and may eliminate the need for refrigeration.

         In addition to purification, a recombinant system can be used to manufacture proteins [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Typically, a gene of interest is introduced into a cell line that is used to produce the protein in cell culture; other methods for recombinant expression are also available.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recombinant proteins have advantages such as greater control over the source of starting material, easier ability to vary the quantity of protein produced (ie, to scale up or scale down production), and ability to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission from donors. However, recombinant proteins may differ in certain properties from proteins obtained from blood, such as the following:

         Proteins made in bacteria or non-human cell lines could lack human-specific post-translational modifications or codon preferences that optimize protein function in humans. As an example, glycosylation, phosphorylation, proteolytic processing, and formation of disulfide bonds (which are crucial for biologic activity) do not occur in
         <em>
          Escherichia coli
         </em>
         , a deficit that has to be overcome when making insulin in

         Proteins made in non-human systems could vary from the endogenous protein antigenically, which could lead to development of antibodies. This may be a concern with some recombinant coagulation factor products. However, the concern is not specific to recombinant products, as individuals who produce
         <strong>
          no
         </strong>
         endogenous factor will have the potential to recognize any factor as foreign and mount an antibody (inhibitor) response. (See

         Multi-subunit proteins may be especially challenging to produce in cell culture, and as a result, recombinant proteins may lack certain subunits. Recombinant factor XIII, A subunit is an example. (See
         <a class="local">

         Cell culture lines can carry viral or other pathogens; however, these can usually be characterized and/or their presence excluded. In some cases, albumin is added for stabilization. (See

         Although the technique has not been used extensively, recombinant methods can also be used to create transgenic animals (or plants) that produce the desired product. One example is antithrombin produced in the milk of transgenic goats. (See

         Albumin is the most abundant protein in blood (accounting for approximately 55 percent of serum protein) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Albumin acts as a carrier protein for many circulating proteins that are present at very low concentrations; it also provides oncotic pressure to retain fluid in the intravascular space.

         Albumin is purified from large pools of human plasma [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. It can be prepared as a 5 percent solution, which is iso-osmotic with plasma, or a 25 percent solution, which is hyperosmotic. Sometimes, pharmacies or nursing staff may dilute the 25 percent solution from its original 50 mL volume to a volume of 250 mL. If done, the dilution fluid must be

         , in order to maintain the proper osmolarity. A number of cases of hemolysis have been reported in patients undergoing therapeutic plasmapheresis due to dilution of 25 percent albumin with sterile water. Albumin solutions are pasteurized and do not transmit any known infectious diseases [

          hyaluronidase

Thus, SCIG is generally used to treat immunodeficiency. It can also be used for maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in some conditions such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). IMIG products have few advantages over SCIG and IVIG and are only used in selected settings such as postexposure prophylaxis or hepatitis A prophylaxis in unimmunized travelers. (See

         Since immunoglobulin products may be used to treat individuals with immunodeficiency, it is worth noting that one of the more important potential complications is an allergic or anaphylactic reaction to IgA present in the product; these reactions may occur in individuals with IgA deficiency who have developed an immune response directed against IgA. These reactions depend on host factors (eg, the severity of IgA deficiency) and product factors (eg, the concentration of IgA in the source plasma). Debate continues about the magnitude and severity of this risk despite years of experience [

         Hyperimmune globulins are preparations that are enriched for immunoglobulins directed against a specific antigen (eg, a pathogen or toxin). They are generated by selecting plasma from exposed individuals who have high titers of the desired antibody or by specifically immunizing donors to produce such antibodies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hyperimmune globulins can be used for passive immunization in individuals who require immunity more rapidly than can be achieved by immunization or for those exposed to substances for which immunizations are not available (eg, snake bite). Formulations are generally prepared for IM administration but in some instances, IV formulations are available.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hyperimmune globulins can also be produced in animals. This is especially true for hyperimmune globulins directed against a normal blood or tissue protein or if human exposure is unusual or unsafe. Examples include horse- or rabbit-derived antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for the treatment of aplastic anemia,

         Numerous products have been developed to enhance hemostasis. In general, it is preferable to administer the most specific product available (eg, factor X for factor X deficiency; fibrinogen for fibrinogen deficiency) as this is least likely to cause adverse effects. The use of a specific factor product will reduce the need for administration of plasma or Cryoprecipitate, which exposes the patient to the risk of transfusion reactions and transfusion-transmitted infections.

         – von Willebrand factor (VWF) products for von Willebrand disease (VWD) are discussed separately. (See

         Most of the available products provide coagulation factors in their unactivated, zymogen form. The risk of thrombosis is thought to be lower with unactivated factors than with the activated factors because the unactivated factors will only be activated at sites of injury. In contrast, when activated factors are transfused, they will be present in the active form in the general circulation (instead of primarily at the site of injury). Mechanisms of clotting factor activation and roles of the factors in the clotting cascade are discussed in detail separately. (See

        <p>
         Two products that contain clotting factors in the activated form are activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs; eg, factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity [FEIBA]) and recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa); in both of these, the activated factor is factor VII. (See

         Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) contain vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. The 4-factor PCCs contain the procoagulant factors II, VII, IX, and X (as well as the anticoagulant proteins protein S, protein C, and antithrombin). The 3-factor PCCs contain factors II, IX, and X (and proteins S and C) but only small amounts of factor VII. Activated PCCs (aPCCs; eg, factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity [FEIBA]) contain factor VII in the activated form (factor VIIa); the other factors are the same as in 4-factor PCCs.

         Activated PCC (aPCC) products are 4-factor PCCs in which factor VII is activated during purification. These products may be used for the prevention or treatment of bleeding in individuals with congenital hemophilia A complicated by an inhibitor, acquired hemophilia A (bleeding due to an autoantibody against factor VIII), other acquired factor inhibitors, or life-threatening bleeding associated with direct factor Xa inhibitor anticoagulants.

         PCCs carry a prothrombotic risk and should only be administered in situations where the benefit of therapy outweighs this risk. The risk of thrombosis appears to be especially high with aPCC in individuals receiving multiple doses and/or concomitant

         (a bifunctional antibody that substitutes for the function of factor VIIIa). Generally, multiple doses of aPCC are not recommended. Risk may be increased in those with liver disease due to reduced clearance of these activated products from the circulation, although data are extremely limited. Details and supporting evidence are presented separately. (See

         Fibrinogen (FBG, factor I) is the precursor to fibrin, the principal structural component of the fibrin clot. Fibrinogen is cleaved to fibrin at sites of vascular injury by thrombin. Typical fibrinogen levels in plasma range from approximately 200 to 400 mg/dL; these levels are significantly higher than any of the other coagulation factors.

         Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT, also called alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor) inhibits several proteases. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         AAT can be used in individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which carries increased risks for emphysema and less frequently for liver disease and panniculitis. In addition to a plasma-derived concentrate that is administered intravenously, studies are evaluating intravenous administration of a recombinant product and aerosolized therapy (direct delivery to the lung by inhalation). Details and supporting evidence are discussed separately. (See

          Albumin

          Coagulation factors
         </strong>
         – A number of procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins are available to optimize hemostasis, especially for patients who are deficient in specific clotting factors. In some cases, a single protein or a complex of proteins is purified from plasma; in others, a protein (or subunit of a protein) may be produced using recombinant methods. The procoagulant factor products are used to treat bleeding or prevent surgical bleeding in individuals with inherited or acquired factor deficiencies and, in some cases, in patients treated with an anticoagulant.
