         Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets refers to several inherited disorders characterized by renal phosphate wasting, the most common of which is X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). An acquired disorder, tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), has similar clinical manifestations to the inherited disorders.

         The etiology and treatment of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets and TIO will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and evaluation of rickets and osteomalacia are discussed separately. (See

         X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), other inherited forms of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)-mediated hypophosphatemic rickets, and tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) are all characterized by hypophosphatemia, normal serum levels of calcium, and either normal or modestly elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). These disorders have high or inappropriately normal circulating levels of FGF23, a circulating hormone that causes renal phosphate wasting and is a common final pathway (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82448" href="/z/d/graphic/82448.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The elevated FGF23 activity is the basis for treatment with the anti-FGF23 monoclonal antibody
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="117667" href="/z/d/drug information/117667.html" rel="external">

         . (See

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, FGF23 activity does not mediate the renal phosphate wasting in hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) and Dent disease (see
         <a class="local">
          'Hypophosphatemia with hypercalciuria'
         </a>
         below) or in Fanconi syndrome (primary impairment of proximal tubular function). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/830.html" rel="external">
          "Hypophosphatemia: Causes of hypophosphatemia", section on 'Fanconi syndrome'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, the term vitamin D-resistant rickets (VDRR) originally was used to describe these hereditary syndromes because they had certain features typical of vitamin D deficiency but did not respond to vitamin D replacement or pharmacologic doses of vitamin D. This disorder is now called hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets because the primary problem is now recognized as phosphate wasting rather than primary vitamin D resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, primary vitamin D resistance, characterized by hypocalcemia as well as hypophosphatemia, does occur and results from inherited defects in either the vitamin D metabolic pathway or the

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It is by far the most common cause of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets. Most cases are familial, but a significant minority appear to arise sporadically. XLH is completely penetrant, but the severity varies widely, even among members of the same family. Whether males are more severely affected than females is unclear. However, in the largest reported series of XLH patients, no sex difference in disease severity was detected [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. To best study this phenomenon, however, a within-family comparison would be ideal, as anecdotal reports of milder disease in females with certain variants have been published [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4

         The pathogenesis of XLH is not fully understood. A number of studies indicate that the functional renal tubular abnormality in patients with XLH, and in the corresponding mouse model (
         <em>
          Hyp
         </em>
         mouse), is caused by one or more circulating factors rather than by a defect in the kidney [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Because these circulating factors promote phosphate excretion and impair bone mineralization, they have been termed "phosphatonins" or "minhibins" [

         can cause XLH, and there is no obvious correlation between genotype and phenotype [

         ]. In a study of 118 families with at least one case of hypophosphatemic rickets, pathogenic
         <em>
          PHEX

         gene variants were found in 87 percent of familial cases and in 72 percent of apparently sporadic cases [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Interestingly, those with a sporadic variant pass the disease to their children in an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. In addition, in some cases of familial and sporadic disease in which typical exonic
         <em>

         variants are not apparent, intronic

         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Further, some of the apparently sporadic cases (11.5 percent) are due to a single-base change in the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of
         <em>
          PHEX
         </em>
         (c.*231A&gt;G) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]; however, more recent analyses have identified that patients with this variant also have a duplication in the coding sequence of exons 13 to 15. Thus, it is not clear whether the UTR base change or the duplication is causing the disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Inactivating variants in the
         <em>
          PHEX
         </em>
         gene (in bone tissue) cause XLH by increasing production, through an unknown mechanism, of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a phosphatonin [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. FGF23, in turn, acts as a counterregulatory hormone to inhibit phosphate reabsorption by sodium/phosphate cotransporters in the kidney, acting through specific FGF receptors with the important cofactor, klotho protein [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Elevated levels of FGF23 also appear to be an important common pathway for other (but not all) forms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, as well as tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), although mechanisms for the increased FGF23 vary among these disorders (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82448" href="/z/d/graphic/82448.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of XLH with phosphate and vitamin D supplementation leads to increased FGF23 levels. Mouse models of XLH (the
         <em>
          Hyp
         </em>
         mouse and the
         <em>
          Phex
         </em>
         <sup>
          K496X
         </sup>
         mouse) suggest that the phosphate set point for FGF23 production is altered by variants damaging to
         <em>
          PHEX
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. An altered phosphate set point would explain why FGF23 levels increase when patients with XLH are treated with phosphate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, FGF23 appears to mediate the renal abnormalities of XLH, primarily phosphate wasting; the resultant hypophosphatemia contributes to, but may not be fully responsible for, the bone demineralization and rickets, suggesting that FGF23 may not mediate all elements of the XLH phenotype. Experimental evidence in transgenic animals suggests that the mineralization defect, in part, may involve mechanisms other than FGF23-mediated phosphate wasting [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. Some of the other clinical manifestations of XLH (such as enthesopathy and dental abnormalities) also may be mediated by mechanisms other than FGF23.

         Skeletal abnormalities, including rickets, osteomalacia, and growth failure, are the major clinical findings in children with XLH. Adults with XLH may develop significant functional impairment and multiple complications, emphasizing that the disorder is truly lifelong and not simply a disorder of the growth plate that resolves with the cessation of growth.

         – Hypophosphatemia, slow growth, and rickets and osteomalacia are the major clinical findings in children with XLH. Low serum phosphate is often present soon after birth. However, it is only at the time of weightbearing that leg deformities (eg, bowing) and progressive departure from normal growth rate become sufficiently striking to attract medical attention. By that time, most children have radiographic evidence of rickets, particularly at the growth plates around the knee, which can cause severe bone pain. The axial skeleton often has a dense appearance. Iliac bone biopsies (not necessary for diagnosis in uncomplicated cases) show osteomalacia and hypomineralized periosteocytic lesions that are typical for this disorder [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The defects in bone mineralization consistently respond well to treatment with phosphate and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9183" href="/z/d/drug information/9183.html" rel="external">
          calcitriol
         </a>
         , but the effects of this treatment on skeletal growth are highly variable. One study suggests that the severity of the growth defect in affected children and the response to phosphate and calcitriol therapy may be predicted by the presenting height [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Another study found an association of both presenting height and growth response to this therapy with the Hap1(-) genotype of the vitamin D receptor promoter [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ] in an XLH cohort in France [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. In children with severe short stature, recombinant growth hormone has been suggested as an adjuvant treatment [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

Osteoarthritis is nearly universal in the adult population, with onset decades earlier than observed in a typical adult population. Enthesopathy (calcification of tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules) and/or development of osteophytes are also nearly universally encountered, usually beginning in the late second or third decade of life [

          24

The muscle weakness is more often reported by adults with XLH compared with children.

          Laboratory abnormalities
         </strong>
         – In addition to hypophosphatemia and a decreased tubular reabsorptive threshold for phosphate, untreated patients with XLH have normal serum levels of calcium, normal-to-high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, elevated (or sometimes normal) alkaline phosphatase activity, normal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, and normal or slightly reduced plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The last finding suggests that regulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis is abnormal in XLH because the expected physiologic response to hypophosphatemia is an increase in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. This defect appears to result from both increased catabolism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (due to increased expression of the
         <em>
          CYP24A1

          Hyperparathyroidism
         </strong>
         – Despite chronic hypophosphatemia, which typically inhibits PTH secretion, patients with XLH exhibit hypersecretion of PTH, a phenomenon that is poorly understood. We have observed elevated circulating PTH levels in numerous patients prior to the onset of any therapy. Furthermore, PTH hypersecretion is exacerbated after initiation of phosphate therapy, despite only modest increases in the serum phosphate level. With careful medical management and avoidance of extremely high phosphate doses, hyperparathyroidism requiring medical intervention can usually be avoided. (See

         – Children without a family history of XLH typically come to medical attention when they present with signs and symptoms of rickets, such as bowing of the legs when the child begins to bear weight. During the evaluation for rickets, the possibility of XLH should be raised by the finding of low serum phosphate and normal or mildly elevated PTH. These findings distinguish XLH and other forms of "phosphopenic" rickets from nutritional rickets due to vitamin D deficiency. (See

         (as evidenced in the randomized clinical trial described below). For untreated children who present with mild rickets, there are no data comparing the relative benefit of burosumab and therapy with phosphate and calcitriol. Nevertheless, burosumab should be considered the treatment of choice because of its demonstrated efficacy in the management of XLH, the importance of treating children effectively early in the course of their disease, and the potential adverse effects and treatment burden of phosphate and calcitriol therapy, which include poor palatability and the need for frequent biochemical monitoring. Moreover, repetitive phosphate dosing has limited efficacy for sustaining the serum phosphate at a level that will optimally benefit the skeleton. That being said, use of therapy with phosphate and calcitriol in mildly affected patients may be considered due to the substantially higher cost of burosumab and the absence of studies documenting the long-term safety of this drug (current data on burosumab describes treatment for up to three years). Should treatment with phosphate and calcitriol be initiated, assessment of the effects of such therapy should initially occur after 8 to 12 weeks and continued therapy frequently monitored, as described below.

Possible reasons to switch to burosumab include the favorable efficacy of burosumab compared with that of phosphate and calcitriol (as demonstrated in the randomized clinical trial described below and previously reported short-term studies) and the potential adverse effects and treatment burden of phosphate and calcitriol therapy noted above. Burosumab therapy is far more convenient and facilitates compliance with the treatment regimen since it is administered only every two weeks by subcutaneous injection and requires minimal monitoring after the initial dose titration. However, the treatment decision between therapy with phosphate and calcitriol and burosumab may be influenced by the substantially higher cost of burosumab compared with phosphate and calcitriol therapy and the absence of long-term safety and efficacy data. The full implications of switching to burosumab require studies with longer-term outcomes.

Subjects treated with burosumab also had significantly greater decreases in serum alkaline phosphatase activity, improvements in renal phosphate wasting and lower limb deformity, and slightly greater increases in linear growth velocity and functional mobility. These findings are similar to those from two phase 2 clinical trials of burosumab in children [

         <a href="#rid40">

         </a>
         ]. Burosumab treatment was also associated with significantly higher rates of fracture healing during 24 weeks of treatment (43 percent) compared with placebo (8 percent). Interestingly, these fractures tend to be asymptomatic, so they may be recognized only if the patient is evaluated with routine screening radiographs. Subsequent reports on the open-label extension of this study indicated continued fracture healing through the 24- to 48-week period of treatment (approximately 70 percent) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41

         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ], indicating that sustained therapy increases the likelihood of restoring a functional skeleton and improving symptoms in affected adults. A long-term study in adults found that burosumab effectively maintained normal serum phosphate and biomarkers of bone metabolism in at least 85 percent of participants, with no significant adverse effects, for up to 3.5 years follow-up [

         therapy for several reasons, including: (1) the occurrence of bone or joint pain is variable in affected subjects; (2) untreated hypophosphatemia may have limited consequences in adults; (3) while treatment results in higher rates of fracture healing, there are no data indicating that burosumab therapy prevents the occurrence of fractures; and (4) the potential high cost of burosumab therapy. On the other hand, clinical trials in adults with limited symptomatology indicate that treatment with burosumab results in increased activity levels and sense of well-being and very few of these patients choose to stop treatment.

         therapy to any adult patient who has the above noted symptoms or those with asymptomatic fractures. To detect asymptomatic fractures that would benefit from therapy, we routinely perform radiographs of the lower extremities, including the feet. The optimal duration of therapy has not been established, and longer-term observation and studies are warranted to establish long-term strategies. Finally, for any patient scheduled for an elective orthopedic surgical procedure, we recommend a course of therapy (either burosumab or phosphate and

         is not available or is contraindicated, because of a serious allergic complication, or in children with a sufficiently mild phenotype for whom burosumab would seem unlikely to offer greater benefit at lower risk than phosphate and calcitriol.
        </p>
        <p>
         When XLH is treated with phosphate, the resultant increase in plasma phosphate concentration with each dose transiently lowers the ionized calcium concentration. Phosphate therapy causes secondary hyperparathyroidism because of both hypocalcemia and the inherent defect in maintaining circulating
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9183" href="/z/d/drug information/9183.html" rel="external">
          calcitriol
         </a>
         levels, which normally inhibits PTH secretion. The elevated PTH levels increase urinary phosphate excretion and can aggravate the bone disease, thereby defeating the aim of oral therapy. The administration of calcitriol increases the intestinal absorption of calcium, and, together with a direct calcitriol effect, this aids in the suppression of PTH levels. Calcitriol also enhances intestinal phosphate absorption. (See

          45,46
         </a>
         ]. The rationale for this strategy is that reduction of PTH levels should limit the renal phosphate wasting caused by elevated FGF23, allow the use of lower doses of phosphate and calcitriol, and reduce the risk of nephrocalcinosis. Calcimimetics have been used effectively to reduce PTH in chronic kidney disease and in TIO [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. However, long-term studies in children with XLH are necessary before calcimimetics can be generally recommended. (See

         ) with no obvious advantage of one preparation over another. Tablets usually contain 250 mg elemental phosphorus per pill. Children who cannot take pills can receive phosphate supplementation in the form of Joulie's solution (155 g of dibasic anhydrous sodium phosphate and 64 g of phosphoric acid 85 percent per liter solution, corresponding to 50 mg/mL of elemental phosphorus). The amount of phosphate supplementation is usually limited by the occurrence of diarrhea. If diarrhea is a problem, the dose of phosphorus should be decreased by 250 to 500 mg and then gradually re-increased in steps of 125 mg. The aim should be to administer the minimum amount of phosphate that is sufficient for normal growth. Slow growth and persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase activity indicate inadequate dose of phosphate or compliance with therapy.

          Monitoring

         – Children should be seen every three months to monitor height; serum concentrations of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine; and random spot urinary calcium:creatinine ratio. In patients who are treated with phosphate and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9183" href="/z/d/drug information/9183.html" rel="external">
          calcitriol

         , renal ultrasonography should initially be performed annually to evaluate nephrocalcinosis (see
         <a class="local">
          'Nephrocalcinosis'
         </a>
         below). However, at the doses used above, we have rarely seen progression and have decreased the frequency of these tests to every three to five years if the level of nephrocalcinosis is stable. A radiograph of the distal femoral and proximal tibial sites is assessed every two years to exclude the reappearance of rickets and to determine bone age. This monitoring represents a significant burden of treatment but is essential because most patients need frequent dose adjustments for optimal efficacy and to minimize side effects.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Measures of therapeutic efficacy should include enhanced height velocity, improvement in lower extremity bowing and associated abnormalities, and radiographic evidence of epiphyseal healing. A failure to obtain these endpoints should trigger a review of adherence to treatment and dose adjustment, if necessary and practical. With the exception of a small percentage of affected patients who are innately resistant to therapy, maintenance of acceptable height velocity and improvement in skeletal deformities generally indicate adequate dosing. Since the aim of treatment is to achieve normal growth, therapy is maintained at least as long as the growth plates are open (usually until the age of 15 years in females and 18 years in males).

         Periodic evaluation by orthopedics and trained physical therapists is useful to identify early changes in tibial torsion or to initiate epiphysiodesis (growth plate clamping) in a timely manner. This technique employs "staples" or a commercially available system (brand name eight-Plate) to mechanically straighten the lower extremities during growth by clamping endochondral bone formation at the lateral or medial physes, as appropriate, diminishing the need for osteotomy [

         – In contrast with therapy for children, once a patient reaches adult height and the epiphyses have fused, the conventional goal for adults has been to simply manage generalized bone pain, enhance limited mobility (if either occurs), and cure any nonunion fractures. Histologic evidence of osteomalacia persists regardless of treatment with phosphate and

         ], and the consequences of the persistent osteomalacia may well play a role in the later development of enthesopathy, arthritis, and musculoskeletal pain. However, as conventional therapy with phosphate and calcitriol requires significant monitoring and may result in complications, a standard approach has often not been employed.

         should be monitored at least every six months for serum phosphate, calcium, creatinine, and PTH. Regular monitoring is important because patients who have been stable on safe and effective doses of phosphate and calcitriol for months or years may suddenly develop toxicity, manifest by hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. These events probably are triggered by sufficient healing of the skeleton to minimize the rate of mineral uptake in the skeleton, thus forcing elevations in circulating and urinary concentrations of calcium and phosphate.

          Follow-up
         </strong>
         – It is controversial whether phosphate and

          calcitriol
         </a>
         therapy should be continued on a routine basis for adults. The goal of therapy in this age group is to resolve the precipitating factor leading to initiation of therapy. In the case of bone pain, treatment can be discontinued if the pain resolves or improves. However, in some patients, the pain recurs, sometimes requiring chronic treatment with relatively low doses of phosphate and calcitriol. In some cases, the use of calcitriol alone, or together with small doses of phosphate, may be warranted. One observational study of 52 adults with XLH reported that treatment was also associated with a reduced frequency of dental abscesses but was not associated with improvement in radiographically determined enthesopathy [

          Pregnancy
         </strong>
         – It is unclear whether therapy should be prescribed in pregnant women with XLH. If a woman is being treated with phosphate and

          calcitriol

         at the time of conception, the therapy is typically continued but with close monitoring of the urinary calcium:creatinine ratio for early detection of hypercalciuria [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. Although the plasma phosphate concentration of the fetus is determined by diffusion across the placenta, it seems reasonable to maintain a higher level of phosphate in the pregnant mother than that in the untreated state. Nonetheless, women who are not on therapy at the time of conception are generally not started on treatment during pregnancy. Studies are necessary to determine if hypophosphatemia during pregnancy affects bone mineralization or development in the fetus.

         Nephrocalcinosis can be demonstrated on renal ultrasonography in up to 80 percent of patients with XLH treated with phosphate and

         <a href="#rid26">
          26,54
         </a>
         ]. The renal calcifications are located primarily in the tubules and are composed exclusively of calcium phosphate [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. The degree of calcium phosphate deposition correlates with the mean phosphate dose but not with the dose of calcitriol or the duration of therapy [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,55
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although most patients have a normal plasma creatinine concentration, the long-term effect of nephrocalcinosis on renal function is not known. However, normal kidney function has been maintained in XLH despite long-standing medullary nephrocalcinosis. Isolated cases of renal insufficiency have also been reported [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ] and, in the authors' experience, occurs in the presence of hypertension.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has also been speculated that the development of nephrocalcinosis results from intermittent episodes of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. These can result from an excessive
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9183" href="/z/d/drug information/9183.html" rel="external">
          calcitriol

         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. Thus, careful monitoring and control of serum and urine calcium are necessary to minimize nephrocalcinosis. The dose of calcitriol should be reduced when hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria occur. Alternatively, administration of thiazide diuretics with or without
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8550" href="/z/d/drug information/8550.html" rel="external">
          amiloride

         <a class="local">
          'Adjuvant therapy'
         </a>
         below), though the combination of a thiazide and calcitriol obligates the monitoring of serum calcium to avoid hypercalcemia. The importance of strict adherence to the burdensome phosphate supplementation schedule must be repeatedly emphasized to the patients and their caretakers.

         ]. It is thought that complexing of calcium with phosphate supplements results in intermittent hypocalcemia and persistent stimulation of PTH release despite the administration of calcitriol. When this secondary hyperparathyroidism is not adequately controlled, autonomous (tertiary) hyperparathyroidism can occur, necessitating surgical intervention [

         This complication can often be managed with decreases in the dose of phosphate or cessation altogether if necessary. If the serum or urinary calcium excretion allows, upward adjustments in

          61
         </a>
         ]. Surgical removal of the parathyroid glands may be indicated in severe disease. The typical finding is multigland parathyroid hyperplasia, and, if this is borne out by imaging studies, removal of three and one-half of the four parathyroid glands is usually performed.

         Iron deficiency is an environmental trigger that stimulates expression of bone FGF23 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein in both normal subjects and in patients with ADHR. Hypophosphatemic flares of ADHR often coincide with the onset of menses and following pregnancy, when iron deficiency is common. In addition, high FGF23 concentrations and low serum phosphate in patients with ADHR are associated with low levels of serum iron and ferritin. In the absence of a genetic defect, iron deficiency does not result in high FGF23 levels or phosphate wasting, because increased expression of FGF23 is matched by increased FGF23 cleavage; in patients with ADHR, the ability to increase FGF23 cleavage is impaired, which results in high FGF23 levels when iron stores are low [

         The clinical course in ADHR is similar to that usually observed in the X-linked disease. However, ADHR is especially notable for its variable age of onset and incomplete penetrance [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>
         ]. Approximately one-half of individuals harboring a variant in the causal gene present clinically evident disease at one to three years of age, which includes phosphate wasting, rickets, and lower extremity deformities. In some affected children, hypophosphatemia and the phosphate-wasting defect persist into adulthood, whereas in others, these abnormalities remit after puberty [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. The remaining patients have delayed disease onset, ranging from 14 to 45 years. Those who present after puberty and growth plate closure generally have bone pain, weakness, and fractures but no lower extremity deformities. Such delayed presentation has been observed only in women, soon after puberty or pregnancy and delivery [

In several case reports of adults with ADHR, correction of iron deficiency led to improvement in metabolic parameters and successful maintenance of normal phosphate values after discontinuation of phosphate and

         Children should be seen every three months to monitor height; serum concentrations of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine; and urinary calcium excretion. Renal ultrasonography should be performed once per year to evaluate nephrocalcinosis. A hand radiograph should be obtained once per year to exclude the reappearance of rickets and to determine bone age.

The most consistent feature is low molecular weight (LMW) proteinuria; other evidence of proximal renal tubular solute reabsorptive failure includes glycosuria, aminoaciduria, and phosphaturia, though not bicarbonaturia. When rickets occurs, it is usually evident from early childhood, but it only occurs in approximately 25 percent of patients. In a hypophosphatemic child with rickets, if other features suggest Dent disease, urinary LMW proteins (beta-2 microglobulin and retinol-binding protein) should be measured.

         Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), also known as oncogenic osteomalacia, is a rare acquired paraneoplastic syndrome in which the biochemical and bone mineralization abnormalities closely resemble those in genetic forms of hypophosphatemic rickets [
         <a href="#rid105">
          105-108
         </a>
         ]. Clinical and experimental studies have documented that tumors produce humoral factor(s) that underlie the abnormalities that occur in TIO. The tumors, typically benign, often are small, slow-growing polymorphous neoplasms, most commonly, phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors of the mixed connective tissue type [
         <a href="#rid109">

         Although primarily described in adults, TIO can occur in children and adolescents [

         </a>
         ]. Children with TIO present with clinical features of rickets, including gait disturbances, growth retardation, and skeletal deformities. The occult nature of TIO delays its recognition, and the time from onset of symptoms to a correct diagnosis often exceeds 2.5 years [

         The mesenchymal tumors associated with TIO ectopically express and secrete fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and other phosphaturic proteins. Most affected patients have increased circulating FGF23 levels [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,112-115
         </a>
         ]. FGF23 decreases reabsorption of phosphate and production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the kidney, acting via FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling [
         <a href="#rid116">
          116
         </a>
         ]. The resulting hypophosphatemia causes rickets, osteomalacia, bone pain, muscle weakness, and fractures.
        </p>
        <p>
         Serum levels of FGF23 usually fall promptly to the normal range after resection of the responsible tumors. These findings are consistent with a pathogenic role for FGF23 in most patients with TIO [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,112-114,117,118
         </a>
         ]. The other secreted proteins expressed in some mesenchymal tumors associated with TIO include MEPE (matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein), FGF7, and sFRP4 (secreted frizzled related protein 4), but the role of these phosphaturic proteins in the disease process remains obscure. Increased serum FGF23 levels also occur in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR), as discussed above (

         ]. Radiographs reveal evidence of rickets in children, and bone histomorphometry shows severe osteomalacia in all affected subjects. Detection and localization of the culprit tumor in TIO is crucial because surgical resection is curative. However, the mesenchymal tumors that cause this syndrome are often difficult to identify because they are small and slow growing and are frequently found in a variety of obscure anatomical locations (including long bones, distal extremities, nasopharynx, sinuses, and groin). The clinical presentation of patients with TIO is often more severe than in XLH, perhaps because the decrements in the serum phosphorus and calcitriol levels are often more severe than in XLH.

         Once TIO is suspected based upon the biochemical and bone abnormalities of the syndrome, confirmation of the diagnosis depends on identification and localization of the underlying tumor. Until the underlying tumor is identified, other renal phosphate-wasting disorders must be considered. However, the presence of a previously normal serum phosphate level in an affected patient, particularly an adult, generally supports the diagnosis of TIO (although, in rare instances, adults with ADHR can present with new-onset hypophosphatemia (see
         <a class="local">
          'Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemia'

         Finding the tumors can be a major diagnostic challenge since their small size and obscure locations make them difficult to localize with conventional imaging techniques. Because in vitro studies have revealed that mesenchymal tumors frequently express somatostatin receptors,
         <sup>

         indium-pentetreotide scintigraphy, a scanning technique that uses a radiolabeled somatostatin analog (

         <sup>

         </sup>
         F)FDG-PET/CT (positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro- D-glucose integrated with computed tomography). Systemic venous sampling for FGF23 has also been used to localize causative tumors, but this technique is better suited to determine if an identified mass is producing FGF23 [
         <a href="#rid121">
          121

         Ga-DOTATATE has been reported to be particularly sensitive in detecting causative tumors [
         <a href="#rid122">
          122-125
         </a>
         ]. Further, studies indicate that a stepwise approach of
         <sup>
          68
         </sup>
         Ga-DOTATATE-PET/CT, systemic venous sampling for FGF23 levels, and 3-Tesla (3T)-MRI can be effective for tumor diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid126">
          126
         </a>
         ]. Despite these varied approaches, the small size of the tumors and their location in bone limit the ability to identify and localize the tumor; success rates in various studies reveal tumor identification in 65 to 80 percent of patients with presumed TIO.

         Definitive treatment for TIO is complete tumor resection, which leads to prompt reversal of the biochemical abnormalities and healing of the bone disease over a period of 6 to 12 weeks [
         <a href="#rid105">
          105-108
         </a>
         ]. However, if the tumor is not localized by the techniques outlined above, medical management is required. Although there is limited experience with medical treatment of TIO, the clinical, biochemical, and radiologic characteristics of the disease are similar to those in XLH. Therefore, analogous treatment regimens are used for TIO. Therapy is continued indefinitely if the tumor cannot be identified and removed. In a few cases, however, recurrent search for the tumor, at various intervals after medical therapy is initiated, has resulted in successful localization of the tumor and cure of the syndrome upon its removal.

         <a href="#rid130">
          130

          calcitriol
         </a>
         therapy. In general, patients tolerated the medication well and had improved well-being. In another study of 13 patients with TIO, burosumab treatment for a two-year period was associated with sustained normalization of serum phosphate concentrations, improved ambulation, and reduced pain [
         <a href="#rid131">
          131
         </a>
         ]. As of June 2020, burosumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients two years or older with TIO due to tumors that cannot be curatively resected, based on the small observational studies described above [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. When burosumab is not available or is contraindicated because of a serious allergic complication, therapy with phosphate and calcitriol should be used, based on the experience using this regimen in patients with unremitting TIO before burosumab was available.

The phosphate is given to replace renal losses, and calcitriol is necessary to increase the intestinal absorption of phosphate and calcium and to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism. This therapy is continued at least through adolescence; it is controversial whether adults should continue therapy on a routine basis. (See

         Hypophosphatemia and hypercalciuria are the key features of three syndromes: hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH), Dent disease, and idiopathic hypercalciuria. These disorders are not mediated by FGF23 excess. (See

The tumors are typically benign, small, and of mesenchymal origin, and most often secrete FGF23. The metabolic pathways involved and clinical manifestations are similar to those of XLH (
