The many causes of acute vision loss and the time-sensitive need for evaluation and treatment pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>A careful history is key to narrowing the differential diagnosis and will allow for a more focused yet systematic physical examination. Prompt diagnosis and treatment may influence the visual outcome.</p><p>This topic will present an overview of the approach to patients with acute persistent visual loss. The differential diagnosis of the red eye and specific causes of acute vision loss are discussed separately. Transient visual loss, also known as amaurosis fugax, should be treated as a transient ischemic attack. Most transient ischemic attacks last less than one hour. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5245.html" rel="external">"Amaurosis fugax (transient monocular or binocular visual loss)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6900.html" rel="external">"The red eye: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF TERMS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute persistent visual loss is defined as lasting at least 24 hours and is typically not caused by transient ischemia [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. By contrast, acute transient visual loss is defined as a sudden deficit in visual function in one or both eyes lasting less than 24 hours. It is caused by a temporary vascular occlusion in the circulation to the eye or visual cortex, or by neuronal depression after a seizure or migraine [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5245.html" rel="external">"Amaurosis fugax (transient monocular or binocular visual loss)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1669437237"><span class="h2">Visual pathway anatomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Alterations in function of any of the structures along the visual pathway may cause vision loss. Pathology can be broadly divided into three major anatomic categories: media, retina, and neural visual pathway (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61855" href="/d/graphic/61855.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>To achieve clear vision, light must follow an unhindered path from the front to the back of the eye, traveling through the cornea, aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous humor to the retina (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67844" href="/d/graphic/67844.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Refracted by the cornea and lens (and perhaps also by glasses or contact lenses), light is focused onto the retina where it is transformed into an electrochemical signal by photoreceptors and supporting cells. The signal is transmitted via the optic nerve through the visual pathways to the occipital lobes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Media problems</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Corneal abrasion and keratitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A corneal abrasion is the result of mechanical trauma to the cornea resulting in loss of epithelial cells. Keratitis is inflammation of the cornea due to trauma, abrasive exposure, allergy, or infection. It is marked by cloudiness, irregularity, or loss of epithelial or sub-epithelial corneal tissues. Typically the eye is tearing, red, and painful or irritated, and there is often a foreign-body sensation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>On physical examination, loss of epithelial cells is demonstrated by corneal uptake of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">fluorescein</a> dye, creating a focal or diffuse green glow under a cobalt blue light. Deeper corneal disease may be visible on ophthalmoscopic examination as a focal or diffuse white opacity, or by dulling of the usually distinct reflection of light off of the cornea (corneal light reflex). Evaluation of abnormal findings requires ophthalmologic expertise in order to arrive at a precise diagnosis.</p><p>The most common causes of keratitis are infection (viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic) and trauma. Bacterial keratitis is usually associated with contact lens wear. Corneal abrasion and keratitis can also cause corneal edema. Patients suspected of having infectious keratitis should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist within 24 hours. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6896.html" rel="external">"Herpes simplex keratitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6913.html" rel="external">"Complications of contact lenses", section on 'Infectious keratitis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6900.html" rel="external">"The red eye: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a simple corneal abrasion without history of associated occult infection or embedded corneal foreign body can typically be treated by the initial provider, and symptoms should resolve in 24 hours. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Corneal edema</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Corneal swelling results in loss of corneal clarity. It most commonly occurs secondary to corneal abrasion, epithelial or stromal keratitis, or acute glaucoma. Physical examination may reveal dulling of the corneal light reflex or a frank grey or white color to the substance of the cornea.</p><p>A serious cause of sudden corneal edema is acute angle-closure glaucoma. The patient will have severely elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), typically associated with nausea and vomiting and may see colored halos around lights. The eye is tearing, red, and extremely painful, often with ipsilateral brow ache. Patients may have throbbing, intermittent, or constant unilateral headache, which rarely may simulate migraine [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In angle closure, the pupil may be fixed in a mid-dilated position, and biomicroscopic (slit lamp) examination may reveal a shallow anterior chamber. IOP is often dangerously elevated (usually 40 to 80 mmHg). If formal tonometry is not available, severely elevated IOP may be suspected by noting hardness to palpation in comparison to the fellow eye (tested sequentially rather than together). Patients suspected of having acute angle-closure glaucoma should be triaged immediately to the emergency department. Treatment is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6903.html" rel="external">"Angle-closure glaucoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Hyphema</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A hyphema is blood in the anterior chamber. It may result from blunt trauma or may occur spontaneously in a handful of conditions marked by abnormal growth or fragility of iris blood vessels (eg, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus).</p><p>Biomicroscopic examination reveals red blood cells circulating and/or layered in the anterior chamber (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6570.html" rel="external">"Traumatic hyphema: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>). Hyphema can induce dangerously high eye pressure and possible permanent corneal blood staining. Patients with hyphema should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist within 24 hours. Management requires detailed, often daily, examination to ensure that rebleeding does not occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95661.html" rel="external">"Traumatic hyphema: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Lens changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Changes in the size, clarity, or positioning of the crystalline lens may alter the focus of light onto the retina, resulting in visual disturbance. Trauma or a variety of congenital conditions can lead to lens dislocation and resultant vision loss. Lens clouding (cataract) is painless and does not typically occur acutely, except in the setting of trauma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6904.html" rel="external">"Cataract in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6270.html" rel="external">"Cataract in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6264.html" rel="external">"Ectopia lentis (dislocated lens) in children"</a>.)</p><p>Elevated blood glucose can cause increased lens tumescence, altering the refractive error. If the change is great enough, patients may perceive painless vision loss. Vision impairment typically resolves within days to weeks of normalization of blood glucose.</p><p>Lens changes can best be seen after pupillary dilation with a slit lamp biomicroscope.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Vitreous hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bleeding into the vitreous humor can occur in the setting of trauma, spontaneous retinal tear, spontaneous vitreous detachment, or any condition with retinal neovascularization such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Typical symptoms include painless floaters and sometimes flashes of light (photopsias).</p><p>The reduction in vision is directly proportional to the amount of blood in the vitreous. If the hemorrhage is dense enough, there may be a decreased red reflex (the reddish orange reflection off the subretinal layers when examining the eye with an ophthalmoscope), or the retina may not be visible on fundoscopic examination. Patients suspected of having vitreous hemorrhage should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist within 48 hours.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Uveitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Uveitis is the general term for inflammation inside the eye generally caused by autoimmunity or infection. Trauma may also cause inflammation of the anterior structures of the eye. Inflammation of the anterior structures of the eye is typically associated with redness and painful light sensitivity, whereas isolated inflammation of intermediate and posterior structures may be associated with normal general appearance of the eye, a decrease in the red reflex, and/or patient complaint of new floaters and sometimes photopsias. Biomicroscopic examination reveals white blood cells in the anterior chamber, vitreous space, or both. Posterior uveitis may manifest as whitening of the retina or choroid. A hypopyon (white blood cell accumulation) may form in the anterior chamber. Corneal edema and a decreased red reflex may also be present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5581.html" rel="external">"Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Endophthalmitis</strong> – The most important cause of acute persistent visual loss in this category is acute endophthalmitis. Endophthalmitis is a serious bacterial or fungal infection of all intraocular tissues, caused by surface organisms (usually in the setting of recent ocular surgery) or bloodborne pathogens. Patients suspected of having endophthalmitis should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist within 24 hours. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3418.html" rel="external">"Bacterial endophthalmitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2446.html" rel="external">"Treatment of endogenous endophthalmitis and chorioretinitis due to Candida species"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16220.html" rel="external">"Treatment of exogenous endophthalmitis due to Candida species"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16205.html" rel="external">"Treatment of endophthalmitis due to molds"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute retinal necrosis</strong> – Acute retinal necrosis (also known as acute viral panuveitis) is a rare and serious cause of visual loss. It is usually caused by herpesviruses and is discussed elsewhere. Patients suspected of having acute retinal necrosis should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist within 24 hours. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8327.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of herpes zoster", section on 'Acute retinal necrosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8232.html" rel="external">"Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections", section on 'Infectious causes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Other etiologies for uveitis are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5581.html" rel="external">"Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Retinal problems</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Central retinal artery occlusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The central retinal artery is the first branch of the ophthalmic artery and provides blood supply to the inner retina. Interruption in perfusion results in ischemic retinal damage leading to severe, sudden, painless, central or paracentral visual loss. A central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is the retinal equivalent of a cerebral vascular accident (stroke) and is typically caused by thromboembolism seen in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Other etiologies such as hypercoagulability, hypotension, and, importantly, giant cell arteritis (GCA; also known as temporal arteritis) must be considered [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. It is typically unilateral but may be bilateral in cases of a cardiac source of thromboembolism. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5236.html" rel="external">"Central and branch retinal artery occlusion"</a>.)</p><p>Within minutes to hours of the occlusion, the only abnormality noted on funduscopic examination may be vascular narrowing. An embolus is visible in about 20 percent of patients with CRAO [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. After several hours, the inner layer of the retina becomes ischemic, turning milky white except in the fovea, which appears as a cherry-red spot. An afferent pupillary defect is typically present. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients suspected of having CRAO should be triaged immediately to the emergency department for a stroke workup (including head/neck imaging) and possible ocular interventions. Proposed interventions are numerous, but most include an immediate attempt to lower the IOP with digital massage, paracentesis, or pharmacologic agents. Treatment is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5236.html" rel="external">"Central and branch retinal artery occlusion"</a>.)</p><p>The most common cause of CRAO is cardiovascular disease leading to a thromboembolic event. The most important alternative cause is GCA. Patients with GCA are at risk for any type of ischemic ophthalmic event, most notably retinal artery occlusions, and ischemic optic neuropathies. GCA is discussed below and elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Optic nerve lesions'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8242.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Central retinal vein occlusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) usually complain of the acute onset of painless blurred vision in one eye. The thrombosis results in venous stasis, leading to disc swelling, diffuse nerve fiber layer/preretinal hemorrhages, and cotton wool spots that create a dramatic appearance on funduscopic examination, often called "the blood and thunder" fundus (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72976" href="/d/graphic/72976.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15264.html" rel="external">"Retinal vein occlusion: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15263.html" rel="external">"Retinal vein occlusion: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p>While vision loss may be severe, the onset is typically subacute in contrast to the sudden visual loss typical of CRAO. When venous stasis is severe, infarction may occur due to slowed retinal blood flow on the arterial side. In this setting, a relative afferent pupillary defect is often present. Patients suspected of having CRVO should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist within 48 hours.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Retinal detachment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Detachment of the neurosensory retina may occur spontaneously or in the setting of trauma. The most common form is related to a tear or break in the retina in patients with a preexisting area of retinal thinning (usually highly myopic, or nearsighted, individuals). Patients may describe sudden onset of new floaters or black dots in their vision, often accompanied by photopsias. Symptoms do not include pain. In its early stages, a detachment may present as a persistent missing portion of the monocular visual field. Once the macula (central retina) has become involved, visual acuity will be severely compromised. Patients suspected of having retinal detachment should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist within 24 hours. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6910.html" rel="external">"Retinal detachment"</a>.)</p><p>Retinal detachment does not cause a red eye. There may be a dulling of the red reflex, and funduscopic examination may reveal the retina to be elevated with folds or cause the retina to be difficult to visualize with a direct ophthalmoscope. If the detachment is extensive, there may be a relative afferent pupillary defect.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Acute maculopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conditions that affect the macula are associated with a central blind spot (scotoma), blurred vision, or visual distortion. Alteration of the macula due to fluid leakage, bleeding, infection, inflammation or other causes can occur de novo or as an acute worsening of a chronic disease (eg, new edema in previously dry diabetic retinopathy, or new bleeding in previously dry macular degeneration). Diagnosis usually requires detailed ophthalmoscopy with a high magnification lens through pharmacologically dilated pupils and specialized ophthalmic imaging such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). Patients suspected of having acute maculopathy should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist within 48 hours.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2813894390"><span class="h2">Neural visual pathway problems</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with neural pathway visual loss must be evaluated immediately for additional neurologic symptoms, with a low threshold for additional studies as described below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h3">Optic nerve lesions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Optic nerve lesions usually produce monocular visual loss. Optic neuritis is the most common cause of optic nerve disease in younger adults, while ischemic optic neuropathy is the most common etiology in older patients. Acute visual loss can also occur when orbital cellulitis spreads to infect and damage the optic nerve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5244.html" rel="external">"Optic neuropathies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3414.html" rel="external">"Orbital cellulitis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ischemic optic neuropathy</strong> – Ischemic optic neuropathy refers to ischemic damage to the optic nerve due to an interruption in its blood supply, leading to severe, sudden, painless vision loss. It is the optic nerve equivalent of a stroke. Vision loss may be diffuse, but infarction occurring at the optic disc may result in a superior or inferior altitudinal defect.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The occlusion and resultant damage may be anterior (affecting the optic disc) or posterior (retrobulbar), and etiology may be due to GCA (arteritic) or due to other causes of ischemia (non-arteritic). GCA must be ruled out or treated in order to reduce risk of contralateral vision loss. Most embolic ischemic optic neuropathy occurs in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is the most common form of ischemic optic neuropathy and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5256.html" rel="external">"Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An afferent pupillary defect is typically present (see <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> below). In anterior optic neuropathy, the optic disc is swollen, often accompanied by splinter hemorrhages (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66013" href="/d/graphic/66013.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50320" href="/d/graphic/50320.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>).

Patients may present with a temporal headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, fever, weight loss, fatigue, and/or night sweats. The reported incidence of ocular involvement ranges between 14 and 70 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) may suggest the diagnosis.

Patients with newly discovered papilledema require a brain MRI with and without contrast and thorough neurologic examination to exclude the presence of a mass lesion. Patients with accompanying severe headache/nausea vomiting should be sent to the emergency department for immediate evaluation. Chronic elevated intracranial pressure can lead to transient visual obscurations or mild persistent blurred vision, often accompanied by positional headaches and pulsatile tinnitus or whooshing. Examination reveals bilateral optic nerve swelling without relative afferent pupillary defect. In the absence of a mass lesion on imaging, stable, non-toxic patients require non-emergency lumbar puncture with assessment of opening pressure and cerebral spinal fluid analysis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5241.html" rel="external">"Overview and differential diagnosis of papilledema"</a>).

Chiasmal disorders are typically associated with either a monocular visual field defect or a bitemporal hemianopia:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Homonymous hemianopia</strong> – Brain lesions in the region of the optic tract, the lateral geniculate body, the optic radiations, or the visual cortex produce a loss of vision on one side of both visual fields (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74068" href="/d/graphic/74068.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The visual field defect is relatively symmetric and respects the vertical midline. No other abnormalities are seen on ophthalmic examination. The most common cause is stroke or hemorrhage into a brain tumor. These patients often interpret the field cut as an “eye problem” (ipsilateral to the field cut). They often complain of bumping into things or being surprised by objects as they emerge from the side of decreased vision (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5247.html" rel="external">"Homonymous hemianopia"</a>). A bitemporal hemianopia is typical of a chiasmal lesion, and a right- or left-sided homonymous hemianopia is typical of a retrochiasmal lesion.</p><p></p><p>Any acute vision loss associated with a chiasmal or retrochiasmal disorder requires an emergency neurologic examination and brain MRI with and without contrast to rule out stroke or brain tumor.</p><p>Compressive chiasmal lesions typically cause gradual decline in vision, as they impinge upon the chiasm, optic nerve, or optic tract. Peripheral vision loss is often asymptomatic until visual acuity is compromised; therefore, most visual complaints are of gradual blurring or dimming of vision. Sudden chiasmal vision loss is less common and implies a rapidly expanding mass or an infectious, vascular, or inflammatory cause.</p><p>Chiasmal visual field defects classically involve the temporal fields and respect the vertical midline in one or both eyes. Defects of ocular motility, due to palsies of the third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve, may accompany chiasmal lesions that extend into the cavernous sinus. Ophthalmoscopic examination may reveal optic disc pallor if the process is longstanding. Optic disc swelling may result from papilledema (with third ventricle obstruction causing elevated intracranial pressure) or from an infiltrative or inflammatory process.</p><p>Pituitary apoplexy is relatively rare, usually occurring in patients with preexisting (but often undiagnosed) pituitary adenomas that undergo hemorrhage or infarction. Emergency steroid and other hormonal replacement, and/or transsphenoidal surgery, is often indicated. The clinical syndrome is characterized by the acute onset of visual loss, sudden-onset severe headache, ophthalmoplegia, and altered mental status due to hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland, resulting in rapid expansion into the suprasellar space and cavernous sinuses. Clinical suspicion mandates emergency MRI, as CT may miss the lesion [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].
