However, most febrile illnesses either resolve before a diagnosis can be made or develop distinguishing characteristics that lead to a diagnosis. FUO refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an established etiology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic testing.</p><p>Large case series of FUO have been collected over a number of decades; these facilitate an approach to patients with FUO and provide an understanding of the changing patterns of FUO with time and newer diagnostic techniques.</p><p>The definitions and special populations with FUO, as well as the diagnostic approach to the adult with FUO, are reviewed here. Specific discussions of the common and uncommon entities causing FUO and the approach to children with FUO are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2737.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in adults: Etiologies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5993.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1319609419"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS AND CATEGORIES OF FUO</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>From the perspective of a practicing clinician, an overarching definition of FUO is fever persisting longer than typical self-limiting conditions (eg, common viral illnesses) in the absence of an identifiable cause despite a reasonable evaluation by an experienced clinician.</p><p>Many clinical researchers have attempted to more precisely define FUO, but development of a clear definition has been elusive. Proposed definitions for FUO typically have three components:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition of fever</strong> – To define fever, one must first understand normal temperature variation. In adults, the mean normal body temperature is 36.7˚C (97.9˚F), and temperature fluctuates based on the time of day. The highest temperatures (up to 38˚C [100.4˚F]) occur in the late afternoon/early evening. Lower baseline temperatures (down to 35.3˚C [95.5˚F]) are associated with older age and lower body mass index. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2734.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults", section on 'Normal body temperature'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most FUO studies have defined fever as a temperature &gt;38.3˚C (100.9˚F), although definitions range from 38.0˚C (100.4˚F) to 38.5˚C (101.3˚F) [<a href="#rid1">1-11</a>]. Because the peak normal temperature in well individuals is 38.0˚C, experts have more recently proposed a cut-off temperature for FUO of &gt;38.0˚C (100.4˚F) instead of &gt;38.3˚C (100.9˚F) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Minimum duration of fever</strong> – A minimum of three weeks of unexplained febrile episodes is typically required to meet most proposed definitions of FUO.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Minimum diagnostic testing</strong> – Most definitions require that certain diagnostic tests be performed before a fever can be labeled to have an "unknown origin." The necessary tests vary but typically include basic laboratory tests (eg, complete blood count, urinalysis) as well as certain radiographic imaging.</p><p></p><p>FUOs are divided into four categories [<a href="#rid12">12-18</a>]:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1310209307"><span class="h2">Classic FUO</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most studies, classic FUO is defined as a temperature &gt;38.3˚C (100.9˚F) recorded on several occasions for &gt;3 weeks, despite an appropriate initial inpatient or outpatient evaluation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>From a clinical perspective, we often manage our patients as if they have FUO even if they don't meet the above parameters. For instance, we may consider a fever to be any temperature &gt;38.0˚C (100.4˚F) or require a duration of two weeks instead of three. Additionally, some patients may meet the definition of FUO except they may not have had a basic workup; in such cases, we often combine the basic workup necessary to confirm the diagnosis of FUO with components of the initial workup performed on patients with confirmed FUO. Ultimately, clinical judgment is necessary to decide whether to diagnose and pursue a workup for classic FUO.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2214524052"><span class="h2">Health care-associated FUO</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients undergoing or recently exposed to health care are at risk for specific infectious and noninfectious causes of fever. In such patients, FUO is often divided based on whether the patient is hospitalized in the ICU, hospitalized outside the ICU, or recently underwent surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1624.html" rel="external">"Fever in the intensive care unit"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2886.html" rel="external">"Fever in the surgical patient"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H840828322"><span class="h2">FUO in immunocompromised patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immunocompromised patients are at risk for a broad range of opportunistic infections in addition to more common conditions. </p><p>Defining immunocompromise in patients with FUO is challenging. Some experts have proposed the following definition:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 cells/microL for at least one week within three months prior to start of fever) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16708.html" rel="external">"Overview of neutropenic fever syndromes"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of immunosuppressive drugs for solid organ or hematologic stem cell transplant (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1396.html" rel="external">"Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1403.html" rel="external">"Overview of infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Known hypogammaglobulinemia (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3928.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3939.html" rel="external">"Secondary immunodeficiency induced by biologic therapies"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of 10 mg <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> or equivalent for ≥2 weeks in the three months prior to fever (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7988.html" rel="external">"Major adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or CD4 &lt;200 cells/mL (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3747.html" rel="external">"Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in patients with HIV"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of biologic therapies (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor or monoclonal antibody) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127104.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and prevention of infections associated with biologic agents and JAK inhibitors in adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2927293167"><span class="h2">Travel-associated FUO</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who recently traveled to foreign countries may return to their home country with unexplained febrile illnesses that can be unfamiliar to clinicians in the patient's home country. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3888.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of fever in the returning traveler"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2257543"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Regardless of how a clinician defines FUO, a methodical approach is recommended.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pace of evaluation</strong> – Because patients diagnosed with classic FUO have had prolonged fever, many can undergo an initial or sequential outpatient evaluations instead of being hospitalized.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, for patients who are severely ill or thought to be at risk for a life-threatening condition, hospitalization is appropriate to hasten diagnostic testing or provide rapid empiric treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Protocol-driven evaluation</strong> – Some experts have advocated for the use of a structured protocol-based approach to testing (eg, having a minimum set of studies performed for all patients with FUO), whereas others suggest avoiding a routine battery of tests. A systematic review and meta-analysis found insufficient evidence to support one approach over the other [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We typically use a protocol-based approach and supplement the tests in the protocol with additional tests if the patient's history and examination suggest a specific diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H146024906"><span class="h2">Obtaining a history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The importance of obtaining a detailed history cannot be overstated in the evaluation of FUO. From our experience, delays in determining the cause of FUO can often be traced to initial gaps in the patient's history.</p><p>If possible, we also obtain a collateral history from the patient's partner or family member. They may recall information that the patient withheld or forgot. Additionally, the partner's history may be relevant (eg, if the partner works in an abattoir with animals infected with Q fever and brings home work clothes). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4015940650"><span class="h3">History of present illness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The history of present illness should focus on the fever itself as well as any associated symptoms. It is often useful to focus on the temporal relationship of these associated symptoms. For example, a patient who develops jaundice or joint swelling and then fever is likely to have a different final diagnosis than a patient who develops fever and then jaundice or joint symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2285310703"><span class="h4">Fever history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Information to acquire about the fever includes the date of the first episode of fever, the maximum daily temperatures recorded by the patient, and the duration and frequency of febrile episodes. (See <a class="local">'Classic FUO'</a> above.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition of fever</strong> – It is important to recognize that temperature variation is normal and that experts differ on the temperature threshold for fever (the traditional definition is &gt;38.3˚C [100.9˚F] compared with more recent proposed definition of &gt;38.0˚C [100.4˚]F). (See <a class="local">'Definitions and categories of fuo'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2734.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults", section on 'Individual daily variation'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever patterns</strong> – Historically, fever patterns have been used to attempt to narrow the differential diagnosis of FUO. However, specific fever patterns have not been proven to be sensitive or specific enough to narrow the differential, as discussed separately [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2734.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults", section on 'Deciding whether to treat'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Fever patterns mentioned in the literature include tertian and quartan fever patterns (ie, fevers every 48 hours or 72 hours, respectively) associated with malaria and Pel-Ebstein patterns (fevers that cyclically increase then decrease over a period of one to two weeks) associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Method of temperature measurement</strong> – It is also important to determine how a patient obtains their temperature and whether there are witnesses at home who can corroborate the results. Some patients assume they have a fever because of subjective symptoms (eg, chills, sweats); these patients should be advised to perform actual temperature measurements with a thermometer before further workup is performed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although rectal temperature is the most accurate, oral or tympanic membrane thermometers are usually adequate However, the quality of commercially available tympanic membrane (TM) thermometers varies substantially. Axillary and infrared contact and noncontact forehead thermometers are not recommended due to significant variations in results. Further details regarding temperature measurement are available separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5989.html" rel="external">"Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management", section on 'Site and method of measurement'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2734.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults", section on 'Methods of measurement'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3932678775"><span class="h4">Associated symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Additional manifestations of illness may occur during febrile episodes or may have no clear relationship to the fevers.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptoms associated with febrile episodes include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rigors – Shaking chills (ie, rigors) are often associated with infectious etiologies, especially bacteremia, but can also be associated with reactions to drugs, including biologic agents and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and other causes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118012.html" rel="external">"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2811.html" rel="external">"Infusion-related reactions to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies used for cancer therapy", section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Diaphoresis, fatigue, and malaise – These nonspecific symptoms are commonly associated with fevers of any etiology and may also be present in some patients who do not truly have a fever.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evanescent rash during fever – A rash that appears on the trunk and/or extremities during fever and disappear as fever resolves may be indicative of adult-onset Still's disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5611.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease", section on 'Rash'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Additional symptoms – A complete review of systems should be obtained on initial presentation. Specific symptoms can help to focus the workup of FUO, especially when grouped together. For instance, the combination of fever, oral ulcers, and rash should prompt consideration of acute HIV syndrome (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86984.html" rel="external">"Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>). As explained above, the sequence of the onset of additional symptoms can be diagnostically useful.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2433998828"><span class="h3">Past medical history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A thorough medical history should be obtained because many medical diseases are risk factors for conditions that are known to cause FUO. Examples include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Valvular or congenital heart disease, or prosthetic heart valve – These conditions are risk factors for infectious endocarditis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2151.html" rel="external">"Native valve endocarditis: Epidemiology, risk factors, and microbiology", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Past exposure to or history of tuberculosis, BCG vaccination, or positive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10029" href="/d/drug information/10029.html" rel="external">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) test – alters baseline risk for tuberculosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of orthopedic or other metal implants – These can be sites of insidious infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immunocompromising condition – Patients with a significant immunocompromising condition are categorized and managed differently than patients with classic FUO.

A systematic review of these tests in patients with FUO identified a total of eight case reports/series from 2000 to 2020 [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Diagnoses were made in seven of the eight studies; example diagnoses included <em>Abiotrophia </em>endocarditis, culture-negative tuberculosis, splenic abscess due to <em>Mycobacterium avium </em>complex, and disseminated <em>Mycoplasma </em>spp. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3345428171"><span class="h3">Role of empiric treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients whose fevers continue after weeks of evaluation, the likelihood of identifying an etiology diminishes, particularly for serious underlying diseases.</p><p>Some clinicians treat these patients with empiric glucocorticoids. A therapeutic trial of glucocorticoids for an inflammatory process should not replace relevant biopsies for steroid-responsive diseases such as sarcoidosis, other granulomatous diseases, or vasculitis. Furthermore, corticosteroids should not be initiated until infectious etiologies and malignancies have been convincingly excluded; glucocorticoids may worsen infections and mask malignancies. </p><p>For these patients, we advise antipyretics if they provide symptomatic relief. We do not provide empiric antibiotics because the probability of infection is low in these patients, and all antibiotics have some level of associated risk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2539927622"><span class="h2">Indications for consultation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians may elect to consult specialists, particularly for ill-appearing patients whose initial evaluation is unrevealing. Such specialists may include infectious diseases specialists, rheumatologists, and/or hematologist/oncologists.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H690962097"><span class="h1">OUTCOMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies have estimated that up to half of patients with classic FUO remain without an etiologic diagnosis [<a href="#rid4">4-9,34,35</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 19 prospective observational studies published worldwide (Europe and Asia) from 1997 to 2021, including almost 2700 patients with FUO, 22 percent went undiagnosed [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. </p><p>Most adults who remain undiagnosed after an extensive evaluation have a good prognosis [<a href="#rid7">7,8,34,36</a>]. In the above-mentioned meta-analysis, fever resolved spontaneously in 59 percent of undiagnosed patients [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Favorable prognosis was also illustrated in a study of almost 200 patients in Belgium with FUO, 61 of whom (30 percent) were discharged from the hospital without a diagnosis. Of those without a diagnosis [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thirty-one (51 percent) became symptom-free during hospitalization or shortly following discharge.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Eighteen (30 percent) had persisting or recurring fever for several months or even years after discharge, without any other sequelae.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Four were treated with glucocorticoids, and six required intermittent therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Six died, but the cause of death was considered to be related to the disease that caused FUO in only two cases.</p><p></p><p>The overall mortality rate in the above meta-analysis was 11 percent and dependent on the underlying etiology of the FUO [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. For malignancies, mortality was 48 percent compared to 27 percent for infections, 7 percent for noninfectious inflammatory conditions, and 5 percent for miscellaneous conditions such as pulmonary embolism.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition of classic fever of unknown origin (FUO)</strong> – The traditional definition for classic FUO is a temperature &gt;38.3˚C (100.9˚F) recorded on several occasions for &gt;3 weeks without an established etiology despite intensive evaluation. Some experts have proposed that the temperature cutoff be lowered to &gt;38.0˚C (100.4˚F). (See <a class="local">'Definitions and categories of fuo'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with recent health care exposure, underlying immunocompromise, or recent travel are excluded from the definition of classic FUO. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pace of evaluation</strong> – Because patients diagnosed with classic FUO have had prolonged fever, many can undergo an initial or sequential outpatient evaluations instead of being hospitalized. (See <a class="local">'Initial evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History and physical examination</strong> – The importance of obtaining a detailed history and examination cannot be overstated. The gathered information will often guide the clinical evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Obtaining a history'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial diagnostic evaluation</strong> – We send a panel of initial tests in all patients with classic FUO, and we add additional tests during the initial evaluation if the history or physical examination is suggestive of specific diagnoses. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Our minimum initial testing panel includes (see <a class="local">'Basic tests for all patients'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Complete metabolic panel including calcium</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Liver biochemical tests</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Two sets of blood cultures obtained from two separate sites (obtain before any antibiotics and incubate the cultures for a minimum of five days)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Urinalysis with reflex urine culture</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>HIV antigen/antibody testing with reflex to confirmatory testing</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Antinuclear antibodies</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rheumatoid factor</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Heterophil antibody or Epstein-Barr antibody tests in young adults</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ferritin</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Thick and thin blood smears for malaria in endemic areas</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (see <a class="local">'Initial diagnostic testing'</a> above) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional testing, including biopsy</strong> – During the initial visit and subsequent visits, further tests should be obtained to target any suspected etiologies. A biopsy is appropriate if the clinical data support a diagnosis that can be confirmed from a tissue sample. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited role of empiric antibiotics and glucocorticoids</strong> – We do not administer empiric antibiotic therapy to patients with FUO unless they are suspected of having a potentially life-threatening infection. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients strongly suspected of having giant-cell arteritis, prompt empiric corticosteroid is indicated to prevent complications. For other patients with FUO, we do not administer empiric glucocorticoids unless the patient is severely ill and suspected of having a steroid-responsive illness. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Outcome</strong> – Up to half of patients with classic FUO remain without an etiologic diagnosis after extensive evaluation. Most adults who remain undiagnosed after an extensive evaluation have a good prognosis.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">PETERSDORF RG, BEESON PB.
