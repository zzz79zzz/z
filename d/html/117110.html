This topic reviews the effects of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on pregnancy outcomes and provides recommendations for management of pregnant patients who are on dialysis.</p><p>Related topics on the management of pregnant patients who have nondialysis-requiring chronic kidney disease (CKD), pregnant patients with specific types of nephropathy, and pregnant patients with kidney transplants are all presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7205.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy and contraception in patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4679.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113826.html" rel="external">"Sexual and reproductive health after kidney transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. We encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender-expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H286704716"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fertility is decreased in both males and females who are on dialysis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, while females on dialysis may have erratic and/or absent menstrual cycles, pregnancy still occurs. The reported frequency of conception among females of childbearing age on dialysis appears to be increasing. While studies from the 1990s reported pregnancy rates of 0.3 to 2.2 percent per year [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>], the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) reported increasing rates of up to 3.3 per 1000 patient-years (3.3 per 1000 patient-years in 1996 to 2008 compared with 0.54 and 0.67 per 1000 person-years from 1976 to 1985 and from 1986 to 1995, respectively) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. A retrospective cohort study of over 47,500 females on dialysis between 2005 and 2013 reported an overall pregnancy rate of 17.8 per 1000 patient-years, with the highest rate in females aged 20 to 24 years (40.9 per 1000 patient-years) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Racial differences were noted; rates were highest among Native American patients, Hispanic American patients, and Black patients as compared with White patients. Furthermore, patients with diabetes had the lowest pregnancy rates.</p><p>The reasons underlying this observed increased fertility rate are unknown. Potential factors may reflect improved dialysis-related care, including achievement of higher dialysis dose and improved treatment of anemia because of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) leading to improved libido.</p><p>The type and timing of dialysis also appears to impact pregnancy rates. The reasons for the difference in outcomes between modalities is not known:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nocturnal hemodialysis – Patients receiving nocturnal dialysis appear to have higher pregnancy rates compared with conventional hemodialysis. In a small cohort study including 45 females of childbearing age, five females undergoing nocturnal hemodialysis had seven pregnancies, resulting in six live infants [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. If this finding is reproduced in future studies, it may be related to the higher dialysis dose provided by nightly therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1959.html" rel="external">"Outcomes associated with nocturnal hemodialysis", section on 'Fertility/pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Peritoneal dialysis – The pregnancy rate is lower among patients on peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis [<a href="#rid4">4,6,9</a>]. In an analysis of registry data from ANZDATA, 2.54 pregnancies per 2000 patient-years occurred among patients on hemodialysis versus only 1.06 among patients on peritoneal dialysis [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Similarly, in the aforementioned retrospective cohort study of females on dialysis between 2005 and 2013, females on peritoneal dialysis had a lower likelihood of pregnancy compared with those on hemodialysis (hazard ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.41-0.55) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2074539338"><span class="h1">OBSTETRIC OUTCOMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients on dialysis historically have had dismal pregnancy outcomes, but these have improved with better delivery of dialysis care. Small studies have suggested that intensified (ie, high frequency) dialysis improves pregnancy outcomes [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Maternal</strong> <strong>hypertensive disorders of pregnancy</strong> – Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including uncontrolled hypertension, preeclampsia, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome are common adverse obstetric events experienced by pregnant persons receiving dialysis [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. More contemporary studies have shown improvements in these maternal outcomes, perhaps reflecting benefits associated with more intensive dialysis [<a href="#rid11">11,13</a>]. A 2023 systematic review of 14 observational studies published between 2010 and 2020, including 2364 patients and 2754 pregnancies, reported hypertension in 7.7 percent, preeclampsia in 11.9 percent, and HELLP in 0.7 percent of patients [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. There were no cases of maternal death. Compared with prepregnancy dialysis schedules, the time burden of more intense or high-frequency dialysis can be difficult for some females, and it is important to provide adequate social and emotional support during pregnancy. These females should be screened for depression both during pregnancy and in the postpartum period given the context of a significant chronic illness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fetal</strong> – Major fetal issues for pregnant females receiving dialysis include high rates of neonatal death/stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birth weight.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Live birth rate</strong> – Since approximately 1990, reported live birth rates for females undergoing dialysis have ranged from 40 to 86 percent [<a href="#rid3">3-5,10,13-20</a>]. Factors contributing to the wide range of outcomes may include relatively small study sizes, variations in dialysis intensity, and improvements in antenatal and neonatal care over time. A study of 77 pregnancies in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplantation Registry (ANZDATA) from 2001 to 2011 reported a live birth rate of 73 percent, while a Canadian cohort of 22 pregnancies treated with intensified hemodialysis between 2000 and 2013 reported a live birth rate of 86 percent [<a href="#rid10">10,21</a>]. Longer duration of dialysis (&gt;36 hours/week) was associated with an increased live birth rate. For comparison, a 2011 systematic review of over 3500 females with kidney transplants reported a 73.5 percent live birth rate [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Patients on dialysis with residual kidney function may have better live birth outcomes. In ANZDATA, the live birth rate was higher for females who conceived before starting dialysis compared with those who conceived after initiation (91 versus 63 percent, respectively), even though all females remained on long-term kidney replacement therapy [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The improved outcome may have been due to higher residual kidney function, which often declines with time on dialysis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Preterm birth</strong> – While preterm birth, defined as less than 37 completed weeks of gestation, has been reported in 50 to 100 percent of births to females on dialysis [<a href="#rid9">9,10,13</a>], a contemporary systematic review found multiple studies published in 2018 or later with mean gestational ages of 34 to 36 weeks [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Studies have typically not differentiated spontaneous from medically-indicated preterm birth, which remains high because of the high prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Low birth weight</strong> – While earlier small observational studies reported low birth weight occurred in approximately 45 percent of infants born to patients undergoing hemodialysis, a systematic review of studies published between 2010 and 2020 reported significant improvements (intrauterine growth restriction of 5.9 percent, small for gestational age 18.9 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2024194465"><span class="h1">PRECONCEPTION CARE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2641986938"><span class="h2">Preconception counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preconception counseling should be initiated in any female of child-bearing potential. Patients should be informed that pregnancy in patients on dialysis is considered high risk and will require a multidisciplinary effort that involves both a high-risk obstetrician and nephrologist. The following issues should be discussed with the patient prior to conception:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Contraceptive methods to be used until pregnancy is actively attempted (see <a class="local">'Contraception'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnancy outcomes (both maternal and fetal) in the setting of dialysis (see <a class="local">'Obstetric outcomes'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maternal risks (see <a class="local">'Maternal complications'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Management of medications before, during, and after pregnancy (see <a class="local">'Management of medications'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Management of dialysis during pregnancy (see <a class="local">'Dialysis prescription and administration'</a> below)</p><p></p><p>A discussion of preconception care for the general population is presented in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/448.html" rel="external">"The preconception office visit"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H63683177"><span class="h2">Contraception</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As pregnancy in females undergoing dialysis is associated with increased maternal and fetal risks, contraceptive counseling is an active part of preconception care to aid planned timing of pregnancy. We discuss contraception with all females with reproductive potential and advise contraceptive use until pregnancy is actively planned. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7205.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy and contraception in patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>Options for contraception in females with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are the same as in the general population. In general, long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) are the preferred methods for females who desire the most effective and/or long-acting contraception options. LARC methods include copper intrauterine devices (IUDs), levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs, and the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8870" href="/d/drug information/8870.html" rel="external">etonogestrel implant</a>. Estrogen-containing methods, including oral pills, the transdermal patch, and vaginal rings, are less preferred because of the markedly increased cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESKD patients.

The decision to proceed with or delay conception is highly individualized and is impacted by the baseline health of the female, the female's age, and the anticipated wait time for a donor kidney, if applicable. Comorbidities such as systemic lupus erythematosus and diabetes should be optimally controlled prior to conception. In general, pregnancy outcomes are better early in the course of CKD compared with advanced CKD or ESKD.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/421.html" rel="external">"Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4679.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus", section on 'Preconception evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94859.html" rel="external">"Pregestational (preexisting) diabetes: Preconception counseling, evaluation, and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>For females with ESKD, it may be advantageous to delay pregnancy among dialysis patients who are anticipating kidney transplantation since transplant recipients have a higher incidence of successful pregnancies, fewer complications, and fewer birth abnormalities [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. This degree of planning is only possible if the patient has a living donor for kidney transplantation. Females awaiting deceased-donor kidney transplantation may be advised not to delay conception until after transplantation due to the prolonged waiting time for a deceased-donor kidney and the progressive reduction in fertility with increasing age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113826.html" rel="external">"Sexual and reproductive health after kidney transplantation"</a>.)</p><p>For females who are unable or choose not to delay conception for transplant, we discuss the need for more frequent dialysis during pregnancy (ie, near daily) and that they may have an increased risk of allosensitization after pregnancy (although the magnitude of risk has not been quantified).

We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beyond the Basics topic (see  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/d/html/582.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)"</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2026516771"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology </strong>– While females on dialysis may have erratic and/or absent menstrual cycles, pregnancy still occurs. The reported frequency of conception among females of childbearing age on dialysis ranges from 0.3 to 2.2 percent per year. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Obstetric outcomes </strong>– Patients on dialysis historically have had dismal pregnancy outcomes, but these have improved with better delivery of dialysis and neonatal care. Adverse maternal outcomes include higher rates of preeclampsia, induction of labor, and cesarean delivery. Adverse fetal outcomes include stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birth weight. (See <a class="local">'Obstetric outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preconception care</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Contraception </strong>– As pregnancy in females undergoing dialysis is associated with increased maternal and fetal risks, contraceptive counseling is an active part of preconception care. We discuss contraception with all females with reproductive potential and advise contraceptive use until pregnancy is actively planned. Options for contraception in females with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are the same as in the general population, although some contraceptive methods are less preferred because of the markedly increased cardiovascular risk in patients with ESKD. (See <a class="local">'Contraception'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Timing of conception and baseline evaluation </strong>– The decision to proceed with or delay conception is highly individualized and is impacted by the baseline health of the woman, the woman's age, and the anticipated wait time for a donor kidney, if applicable. The possibility of pregnancy should be discussed with all females who are on dialysis and are in childbearing years. Among females who wish to conceive, we discuss the optimal timing of conception, perform a baseline evaluation, and assess the compatibility of their medications with pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Timing of conception'</a> above and <a class="local">'Baseline evaluation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Management of medications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management during pregnancy</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Monitoring </strong>– Pregnant females with ESKD on dialysis should be monitored jointly by a nephrologist and by a maternal-fetal medicine specialist familiar with the management of dialysis in a pregnant woman. Our approach is defined above. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Prevention of preeclampsia </strong>– Patients with ESKD on dialysis are considered to be at high risk for preeclampsia. Low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of preeclampsia in females at moderate to high risk of the disease, but studies have not included patients with ESKD. In pregnant patients with ESKD, we weigh the potential risks and benefits of low-dose aspirin therapy and offer treatment to those without any contraindications to aspirin use. (See <a class="local">'Prevention of preeclampsia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Preferred dialysis modality</strong> – We suggest hemodialysis rather than peritoneal dialysis for females who wish to become, or are, pregnant (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). The pregnancy rate is lower among patients on peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis, and there appears to be a higher rate of small for gestational age (SGA) pregnancies among patients on peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis. (See <a class="local">'Preferred modality'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Dialysis prescription </strong>– The dialysis prescription is adjusted as soon as possible after conception. For all patients on dialysis, we recommend intensification of the dialysis regimen rather than continuing standard dialysis dosing (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_3" rel="external">Grade 1C</a>). Providing more dialysis increases the chances of live birth. For patients on hemodialysis who do not have residual kidney function, we target ≥36 hours dialysis per week. This may be modified for patients with residual kidney function. Our approach is defined above. (See <a class="local">'Hemodialysis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For patients who choose to remain on peritoneal dialysis, intensive dialysis may be provided by increasing the volume and number of exchanges. In later stages of pregnancy, the number of exchanges must be increased (preferably with the use of a cycler) to provide sufficient dialysis since the volume is limited by the expanding uterus. (See <a class="local">'Peritoneal dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postpartum care </strong>– Routine postpartum care is similar for females on dialysis compared with those with normal kidney function. There are no contraindications to breastfeeding among patients on dialysis. (See <a class="local">'Postpartum care'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Holley JL, Schmidt RJ.
