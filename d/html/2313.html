Treatment of this disorder is primarily aimed at decreasing the urine output, usually by increasing the activity of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as arginine vasopressin [AVP]) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Replacement of previous and ongoing fluid losses is also important. Most patients with AVP-D have a normal or only mildly elevated plasma sodium concentration because concurrent stimulation of thirst minimizes the degree of net water loss. However, hypernatremia can occur if thirst is impaired or the patient has no access to water [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. Correction of the hypernatremia requires repair of this free water deficit. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2339.html" rel="external">"Treatment of hypernatremia in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of AVP-D will be reviewed here. The causes of this disorder and the approach to the patient with polyuria are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2373.html" rel="external">"Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus): Etiology, clinical manifestations, and postdiagnostic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2381.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of patients with polyuria"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3394290649"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a survey of 1034 patients with central diabetes insipidus, 823 (80 percent) described situations in which their diagnosis was confused with diabetes mellitus by health care professionals [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The great majority (85 percent) supported renaming the disease; the most favored alternative names for central diabetes insipidus were:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vasopressin deficiency</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Arginine vasopressin deficiency</p><p></p><p>Other groups have also suggested renaming central diabetes insipidus to improve patient safety. In one report, for example, a 22-year-old patient who received a hip replacement at an academic hospital died as a result of confusion about their diagnosis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. No <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> was administered postoperatively, and the patient died from hypernatremia. </p><p>In February 2016, the English National Health Service (NHS) sent an alert to health care providers about the risk of omitting life-sustaining medication, including 471 incidents involving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> over a six-year period. Omission of desmopressin was a common error, resulting in four deaths during this period.</p><p>In 2022, the Endocrine Society, European Society of Endocrinology, Pituitary Society, Society for Endocrinology, European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, Endocrine Society of Australia, Brazilian Endocrine Society, and Japanese Endocrine Society all proposed to change the name of this disorder from central diabetes insipidus to arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H144709921"><span class="h1">CHOICE OF THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are three main options for the treatment of polyuria in patients with AVP-D:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">Desmopressin</a>, which is an antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as arginine vasopressin [AVP]) analog, is the preferred drug in almost all patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other drugs, such as chlorpropamide, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9198" href="/d/drug information/9198.html" rel="external">carbamazepine</a>, thiazide diuretics, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are rarely used and mentioned here only for their antidiuretic properties.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A low-solute (mostly low-sodium, low-protein) diet. In normal individuals, the urine output is primarily determined by fluid intake, a relationship that is mediated by changes in the release of ADH. When the urine osmolality is fixed, as in untreated AVP-D, the urine output is determined by the intake and subsequent urinary excretion of solutes (mostly sodium salts and urea), which has been called the renal solute load. As an example, at a fixed urine osmolality of 100 mosmol/kg, the urine output will be 6 L/day if urinary solute excretion is 600 mosmol/day and 3 L if urinary solute excretion is 300 mosmol/day on a low-sodium, reduced-protein diet. A low-solute diet can be combined with a thiazide diuretic. (See <a class="local">'Low-solute diet and thiazide diuretics'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The choice of therapy varies with the severity of the polyuria and whether or not the patient has access to water and is able to drink  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140119" href="/d/graphic/140119.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>Patients with partial AVP-D and mild to moderate polyuria and nocturia may be adequately controlled with a low-solute diet (if acceptable to the patient) and, if necessary, a thiazide diuretic. Although these modalities also reduce the urine output in patients with marked polyuria and nocturia, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> therapy is usually required for symptom control. Desmopressin can also be used in patients with less severe AVP-D who do not want to comply with a low-solute diet.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H216816629"><span class="h1">THERAPEUTIC GOAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The only symptoms of AVP-D are polyuria, nocturia, and thirst (unless the patient has a hypothalamic lesion causing hypodipsia). Thirst is essential so that the excess urinary water losses can be replaced. Patients without an intact thirst mechanism can develop severe hypernatremia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2376.html" rel="external">"Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults", section on 'Hypothalamic lesions affecting thirst or osmoreceptor function'</a>.)</p><p>The initial aim of therapy is to reduce nocturia, thereby providing adequate sleep, most often by the administration at bedtime of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a>, which is the <strong>preferred therapy</strong> for AVP-D  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140119" href="/d/graphic/140119.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Once this is achieved, one aims for <strong>partial</strong> control of the diuresis during the day since complete control can lead to retention of water and hyponatremia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H216816636"><span class="h2">Risk of hyponatremia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Water retention leading to the development of hyponatremia is a potential risk in patients with AVP-D who are treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> or other therapies that increase the response to or secretion of ADH (eg, chlorpropamide and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9198" href="/d/drug information/9198.html" rel="external">carbamazepine</a>). Desmopressin-associated hyponatremia could lead to brain injury if the plasma sodium is not carefully monitored [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. Once desmopressin is given, the patient has nonsuppressible ADH activity and may be unable to excrete ingested water normally, possibly leading to hyponatremia, as occurs in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2384.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)", section on 'Pathogenesis of hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p>Although thirst will be suppressed by effective therapy, much of the fluid intake during the day is not driven by thirst (eg, coffee with breakfast, soda with lunch and dinner). In addition, previously untreated patients may have become accustomed to drinking large amounts of fluids and may continue to do so for a short period after the initiation of effective therapy to control polyuria, possibly resulting in the development of hyponatremia. Thus, we suggest measuring the serum sodium one to two days after the initiation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> therapy and, if the initial measurement is normal, repeating the measurement at four days.</p><p>Once a stable dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> is achieved, annual or biannual monitoring of the serum sodium may be performed. If a patient treated with a stable dose of desmopressin begins experiencing increased urinary frequency or nocturia, and/or the serum sodium is elevated, a 24-hour urine should be collected to ascertain whether the patient is polyuric.</p><p>Preventing water retention is more difficult in infants and young children and more frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration is recommended. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring of serum sodium'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H216816726"><span class="h3">Dosing to prevent hyponatremia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the risk of hyponatremia, patients treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> should be educated about the symptoms that may be induced by hyponatremia. These include nausea, vomiting, headache, lethargy, and, if severe, seizures and coma. Patients should be instructed to call the clinician at the first sign of such manifestations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2287.html" rel="external">"Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults", section on 'Hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">Desmopressin</a> dosing is an empiric process. Hyponatremia can usually be avoided by giving the <strong>minimum</strong> desmopressin dose that is required to control the polyuria. The initial aim of therapy is to reduce nocturia, thereby permitting adequate sleep. Thus, the first dose (0.1 or 0.2 mg tablet or 5 to 10 mcg of the nasal spray) is typically given at bedtime. The size of and necessity for a daytime dose is determined by the effectiveness of the evening dose. If, for example, polyuria does not recur until noon, then one-half the evening dose may be sufficient at that time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H216816692"><span class="h2">Course of AVP-D and duration of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The duration of AVP-D varies with the cause. As examples, AVP-D is permanent in idiopathic disease, most often transient following neurosurgery (usually transsphenoidal) or trauma, and may be reversible with appropriate therapy in patients with infiltrative diseases. The supportive data are presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2373.html" rel="external">"Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus): Etiology, clinical manifestations, and postdiagnostic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">Desmopressin</a> therapy should be continued for as long as the patient has symptomatic AVP-D. As mentioned above, the goal of therapy is control of nocturia and partial control of polyuria during the day since more aggressive therapy can promote the development of hyponatremia. The AVP-D induced by neurosurgery or trauma is often transient. Thus, such patients should be questioned carefully at each visit about the degree of polyuria. If the polyuria is said to be less pronounced or to have ceased, the desmopressin dose can be gradually tapered and eventually withdrawn if polyuria does not recur.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DESMOPRESSIN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Since the primary problem in AVP-D is deficient secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as arginine vasopressin [AVP]), control of the polyuria can be achieved by hormone replacement. In the past, this was achieved by intramuscular injections of vasopressin (Pitressin) tannate in oil, which is no longer available. This preparation had two problems: the requirement for intramuscular administration; and the occasional development of anti-vasopressin antibodies with a secondary increase in urine output that appears to be ADH resistant [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Intramuscular vasopressin has been replaced by <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> (dDAVP), a desaminated form of ADH with a different orientation of arginine that has potent antidiuretic but no vasopressor activity [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H144709866"><span class="h2">Preparations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">Desmopressin</a> comes in liquid form that is usually administered intranasally, in an oral tablet form, and in a parenteral formulation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90924" href="/d/graphic/90924.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The intranasal preparation can be blown into the nose by the patient with a curved, dose-calibrated small plastic tube or delivered with a nasal spray. An initial dose of 5 mcg at bedtime can be titrated upward in 5 mcg increments depending upon the response of the nocturia and then additional daytime doses added. The daily maintenance dose is approximately 5 to 20 mcg once or twice a day (suggested maximum dose 40 mcg daily).</p><p>The <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> metered spray bottle is currently used more commonly than the rhinal tube because of greater convenience of administration. Although flexibility is more limited with the metered spray bottle because the minimum dose is 10 mcg, this does not represent a problem for most patients. The usual daily maintenance dose is 10 to 20 mcg intranasally once or twice a day. Using a urine osmolality of 400 mosmol/kg or greater to judge effect, the mean duration of action after 10 and 20 mcg intranasal doses was seven to nine hours, respectively [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>An oral tablet preparation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> is also available [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The absorption of desmopressin in normal persons is decreased by 40 to 50 percent when taken with meals [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. This usually has little effect on the antidiuretic action but administering the drug in the fasting state may be tried if there is a poor response to the usual doses taken with meals.</p><p>The oral form has approximately one-tenth to one-twentieth the potency of the nasal form because only approximately 5 percent is absorbed from the gut. Thus, a 0.1 mg tablet is the equivalent of 2.5 to 5 mcg of the nasal spray. However, because the oral dose cannot be precisely predicted from a previous nasal dose, transfer of patients from nasal insufflation to oral therapy usually requires some dose retitration.</p><p>The initial dose of the tablet form is 0.05 mg (one-half a 0.1 mg tablet) at bedtime, which is then incrementally titrated. The usual daily maintenance dose ranges from 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg in divided doses but may be as high as 1.2 mg/day.</p><p>There are few long-term data on the use of the tablet form of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a>. In one study, eight children with AVP-D were treated and followed for up to 3.5 years [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. There was no attenuation of the antidiuretic effect, and no side effects or antibody formation were noted. In another report, ten adults had satisfactory maintenance of the antidiuretic effect over one year with doses of 0.3 to 0.6 mg/day given in two to three doses per day; doses larger than 0.2 mg had no greater effect, eg, 0.4 versus 0.2 mg, but probably lasted longer [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">Desmopressin</a> has also been developed as a sublingual lyophilizate (melt) formulation containing 60, 120, and 240 mcg. This formulation improves the bioavailability of desmopressin by approximately 60 percent compared with the tablet.</p><p>Although patients generally prefer the oral preparation because of ease of administration, not all patients have an adequate response. As a result, we recommend starting with the intranasal preparation; this ensures that the patient understands what constitutes a good antidiuretic response prior to performing a trial of oral therapy.</p><p>If <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> cannot be administered intranasally or orally, it can be given subcutaneously. A usual antidiuretic dose is 1 mcg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours. Some patients do not respond well to subcutaneous desmopressin due to inadequate absorption.

Suppose an infant with a daily intake of 750 mL of human milk has a maximum urine osmolality of 100 mosmol/kg. This quantity of human milk provides 56 milliosmoles of solute per day (0.75 L x 75 milliosmoles/L) so that the daily urine volume would be 0.56 L (56 milliosmoles per day/100 milliosmoles/L). Changing to a regular cow milk-based formula would increase the renal solute load to 83 mosmol/day (0.75 L x 110 milliosmoles/L) and the daily urine volume would increase by 0.28 L to 0.84 L (ie, from 560 to 840 mL/day).</p><p>Thiazide therapy is typically given with the low-solute diet to induce mild volume depletion, which will further reduce the urine volume.

Adolescents can be treated with same dose used in adults (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8529" href="/d/drug information/8529.html" rel="external">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, 25 mg once or twice daily or its equivalent). (See <a class="local">'Older children'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infants and small children should be treated with a low-solute diet (low salt and low protein) plus a thiazide diuretic. This will reduce the urine output and therefore thirst in infants and toddlers with AVP-D. For infants who are dependent upon a milk diet, human milk is preferred, if possible, because of its proven nutritional and immunologic benefits and lower solute load compared with formulae or cow's milk. (See <a class="local">'Infants and small children'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Thiazide therapy is typically given with the low-solute diet to induce mild volume depletion. Oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8529" href="/d/drug information/8529.html" rel="external">hydrochlorothiazide</a> is commonly used in infants up to six months of age at a dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg per day divided in two doses, maximum dose: 37.5 mg/day. The dose in older infants and small children is 2 mg/kg per day (divided in two doses). (See <a class="local">'Low-solute diet and thiazide diuretics'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Infants and small children differ from older children and adults since all or almost all of their calories are consumed as liquids, not as solids. As a result, monitoring of the serum sodium concentration and body weight is important to detect hypernatremia due to water loss with a low-solute diet and thiazide diuretic and to detect hyponatremia due to water retention resulting from excessive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> therapy.
