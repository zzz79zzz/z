It can be induced either by disease of the aortic valve leaflets or by distortion or dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta.</p><p>This topic will review the causes, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and major clinical features of chronic AR. Issues related to course and therapy and to acute AR are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8160.html" rel="external">"Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8166.html" rel="external">"Acute aortic regurgitation in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At least trace AR by color Doppler echocardiography is common, even in healthy subjects. A study from the Framingham Heart Study found that, in a population-based cohort, AR of at least trace severity on color Doppler echocardiography was present in 13 percent of men and 8.5 percent of women [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of AR varied with age and disease severity [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. More than trace AR was unusual before age 50 and then increased progressively.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For mild AR, the prevalence was 3.7, 12.1, and 12.2 percent in men at ages 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 83, respectively. The comparable values in women were 1.9, 6.0, and 14.6 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For moderate to severe AR, the prevalence was 0.5, 0.6, and 2.2 percent in men at ages 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 83, respectively. The comparable values in women were 0.2, 0.8, and 2.3 percent.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2358779662"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic AR is caused by disease of the valve leaflets or enlargement of the aortic root. In the developing world, the most common cause of AR is rheumatic heart disease. However, in developed countries, AR is most often due to aortic root dilation, congenital bicuspid aortic valve, and calcific valve disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50707" href="/z/d/graphic/50707.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All forms of AR produce a similar hemodynamic abnormality. The inability of the aortic valve leaflets to remain closed or coapted during diastole results in a portion of the left ventricular (LV) stroke volume leaking back from the aorta into the LV. The added volume of regurgitant blood produces an increase in LV end-diastolic volume and an elevation in wall stress. The ventricle responds and adapts with compensatory eccentric hypertrophy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58408 graphicRef87847" href="/z/d/graphic/58408.html" rel="external">figure 1A-B</a>).</p><p>The combination of LV eccentric hypertrophy with chamber enlargement raises the total stroke volume. The net effect is that forward stroke volume and systemic blood flow are initially maintained despite the regurgitant lesion. Although LV volume is increased, end-diastolic pressure remains normal due to an increase in ventricular compliance. Thus, the heart initially adapts well to chronic AR, functioning as a compliant high-output pump.</p><p>The increased stroke volume results in an increase in systolic pressure. Regurgitation into the LV leads to a rapid fall in arterial pressure with quick collapse of the arteries and a low diastolic pressure that may approach LV diastolic pressure in severe disease. The resulting wide pulse pressure leads to a number of characteristic physical findings. (See <a class="local">'Arterial pulse and related findings'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15762271"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with AR may remain asymptomatic for decades, even if there is progressive ventricular dilation.</p><p>Symptoms that develop in some patients with severe AR (stage D) include exertional dyspnea, angina, and other symptoms of heart failure  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53536" href="/z/d/graphic/53536.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>Exertional dyspnea develops in some patients with severe AR, particularly (but not exclusively) in patients who have developed LV systolic dysfunction. More severe heart failure symptoms such as orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and pulmonary edema may develop without appropriate treatment.</p><p>Exertional angina develops in some patients with severe AR. Angina can occur even in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease, though the coronary arteries are typically large. With severe AR, angina is caused by reduced coronary flow reserve as epicardial coronary flow shifts from predominantly diastolic to predominantly systolic. Angina can also occur at night when the heart rate slows, arterial diastolic pressure falls, and regurgitant volume increases, thus reducing coronary diastolic perfusion pressure. Some patients with severe AR also develop nocturnal abdominal discomfort due to splanchnic ischemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1472.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with suspected angina pectoris"</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with severe AR may complain of symptoms related to the increased LV size and stroke volume. Such symptoms differ from those that generally lead to consideration of aortic valve replacement (eg, dyspnea, angina). These include a sense of pounding, an uncomfortable awareness of the heartbeat, and atypical chest pains. These symptoms are especially pronounced when lying down or lying on the left side which brings the LV apex closer to the chest wall, augmenting the sensation of cardiac activity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Examination of the peripheral pulses, precordial inspection and palpation, and auscultation of the heart are all helpful in patients with AR. The physical examination in patients with chronic severe AR is often dramatic and frequently establishes the diagnosis, though findings are frequently more subtle in patients with milder disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15762210"><span class="h3">Arterial pulse and related findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of physical findings are caused by the wide pulse pressure in patients with chronic AR:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Corrigan pulse – A "water hammer" or "collapsing" pulse is characterized by a rapidly rising and falling arterial pulse with a wide pulse pressure. This finding is best appreciated by palpation of the radial or brachial arteries (exaggerated by raising the arm) or the carotid pulses.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>de Musset sign – A head bob occurring with each heartbeat.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Traube sign – A pistol shot pulse (systolic and diastolic sounds) heard over the femoral arteries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Duroziez sign – A systolic and diastolic bruit heard when the femoral artery is partially compressed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Quincke pulses – Capillary pulsations in the fingertips or lips.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mueller sign – Systolic pulsations of the uvula.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Becker sign – Visible pulsation of the retinal arteries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Landolfi sign – Constriction and dilation of the pupils with each heartbeat.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hill sign – Popliteal cuff systolic pressure exceeding brachial cuff pressure by more than 20 mmHg with patient in the recumbent position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mayne sign – More than a 15 mmHg decrease in diastolic blood pressure with arm elevation from the value obtained with the arm in the standard position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rosenbach sign – Systolic pulsations of the liver.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gerhard sign – Systolic pulsations of the spleen.</p><p></p><p>Although all of these clinical signs have been described as ancillary findings useful in the diagnosis of AR, there are few published studies that have assessed the predictive value of any of these findings [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Among the four signs with sufficient literature for review (Corrigan pulse, Duroziez sign, Hill sign, and Austin Flint murmur [discussed below]), information on specificity was strongest for the Hill sign (specificity 71 to 100 percent overall) and the Hill sign is more frequent with more severe AR (sensitivity 75 to 100 percent among patients with moderate to severe or severe AR).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H637301457"><span class="h3">Precordial examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>On precordial inspection and palpation, the combination of LV enlargement and forceful systolic function results in the apical impulse being displaced laterally and inferiorly and being diffuse and hyperdynamic. A prominent pulsation (and occasionally a thrill) may be felt at the sternal notch due to concurrent dilation of the ascending aorta. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1081.html" rel="external">"Examination of the precordial pulsation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Cardiac auscultation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic AR is associated with a distinctive early diastolic murmur as well as less specific sounds (such as a mid-systolic ejection murmur) that may be heard in addition to or instead of the characteristic murmur. The heart sounds typically have the following characteristics (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1078.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults", section on 'Aortic regurgitation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>S1 may be soft, often reflecting a long PR interval</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>S2 is variable; it may be soft, absent, or single</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A2 is often soft or absent while P2 may be normal, but obscured by the diastolic murmur</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A systolic ejection sound may be due to abrupt aortic distension caused by the large stroke volume</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A third heart sound (S3 gallop) is heard when LV function is severely depressed</p><p></p><p>A diastolic murmur is a key sign favoring the diagnosis of AR, though absence of a diastolic murmur does not exclude the diagnosis. In a review of the literature, the presence of an early diastolic murmur, as heard by a cardiologist, was the most useful finding for establishing the presence of AR (positive likelihood ratio 8.8 [ie, the odds of AR are increased 8.8-fold]) and its absence the most useful finding for reducing the likelihood of AR (negative likelihood ratio 0.2 to 0.3) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, the reported frequency of a diastolic murmur among patients with chronic AR has varied widely (14 to 73 percent) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p>The diastolic murmur of AR begins immediately after A2  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77962 graphicRef76340 graphicRef56371" href="/z/d/graphic/77962.html" rel="external">movie 1A-C</a>). It is high pitched, often blowing in quality, and may be sustained in intensity or decrescendo. It may be soft and barely audible, often appreciated only when the patient is sitting up, leaning forward, and holding his or her breath in end-expiration.</p><p>The intensity of the diastolic murmur does not correlate well with the severity of AR. The timing and duration of the murmur may be helpful in assessing the severity of AR. However, the physical findings are not sufficiently reliable and echocardiography is typically used to assess severity.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In mild AR, the murmur occurs only in early diastole and is blowing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As the regurgitation becomes more severe, the murmur extends through more of diastole, may become holodiastolic, and is often rougher in quality. Patients with a longer diastolic murmur, a displaced LV impulse, a wide pulse pressure, and the peripheral findings of a wide pulse pressure cited in the previous section are considered to have severe AR.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In very severe regurgitation with ventricular decompensation, the murmur may become soft or even absent. This change in character reflects the near equalization of aortic diastolic and LV diastolic pressures, which diminish regurgitant flow. A similar situation can occur when AR is acute and the LV diastolic pressure is very high.</p><p></p><p>The intensity of the murmur can also be affected by certain maneuvers. As examples, the murmur increases with squatting and decreases with the Valsalva maneuver  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69748" href="/z/d/graphic/69748.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1080.html" rel="external">"Physiologic and pharmacologic maneuvers in the differential diagnosis of heart murmurs and sounds"</a>.)</p><p>The site at which the murmur is best heard varies with the cause. The murmur is heard best along the left sternal border, at the third and fourth intercostal space, when AR is due to valvular disease. In contrast, abnormalities of the aortic root produce murmurs that are best heard at the right sternal border and apex.</p><p>A mid-systolic murmur is heard in many patients with AR [<a href="#rid5">5,7</a>]. A study found that a systolic murmur was more frequently heard than a diastolic murmur by noncardiologists in patients with trace to moderate AR [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The systolic murmur typically resembles the ejection type of murmur heard in aortic stenosis, ie, a crescendo-decrescendo harsh murmur beginning after S1. This murmur is caused by a large ejection volume and thus does not necessarily reflect concurrent aortic stenosis.</p><p>A second type of diastolic murmur (the Austin Flint murmur) may also be appreciated. This murmur is a low-pitched, mid to late diastolic rumble, heard at the apex. The murmur has been attributed to the effects of competing antegrade turbulent diastolic blood flow from the left atrium and the retrograde regurgitant flow from the aorta. The sensitivity and specificity of the Austin Flint murmur is uncertain. A review found a higher sensitivity (57 to 100 percent) among patients with severe AR compared with patients with mild to moderate disease (0 to 50 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1078.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H479813241"><span class="h2">Chest radiograph</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A chest radiograph is not indicated for the diagnosis of AR but may be obtained in selected patients with AR such as those in whom the cause of dyspnea is uncertain. In patients with severe AR, the chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly due to the dilation of the LV, which enlarges in an inferior and leftward direction. The heart size on a chest radiograph may vary by about one centimeter from end diastole to end systole. Therefore, an apparent increase in heart size on serial examinations does not necessarily indicate progressive LV chamber enlargement. The ascending aorta (and often the aortic arch or knob) are typically markedly dilated.</p><p>Left atrial enlargement does not occur unless there is significant LV dysfunction. Thus, its presence in patients with mild to moderate AR suggests associated mitral valve disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3209353359"><span class="h2">Electrocardiogram</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An electrocardiogram (ECG) is not indicated for diagnosis of AR but is commonly included in the evaluation of patients with AR to exclude concurrent conditions (eg, arrhythmia), and to establish a baseline for future comparison.</p><p>The ECG reflects the adaptive changes that occur in the LV as a result of the volume overload, typically with findings for LV eccentric hypertrophy.</p><p>Conduction abnormalities are usually not seen, but can occur late in the course of AR when significant LV dysfunction occurs. Isolated atrial and ventricular premature beats are common, but sustained supraventricular or ventricular tachyarrhythmias are unusual in the absence of significant LV dysfunction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2272033624"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H394069558"><span class="h2">When to suspect chronic aortic regurgitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic AR should be suspected in patients with physical examination findings consistent with AR. This includes patients with typical exam findings (eg, early diastolic murmur) as well as those with less specific findings (eg, a systolic ejection murmur or wide pulse pressure). Symptoms such as dyspnea are present only late in the disease. In addition, AR should be suspected in patients with dilated aortic sinuses or ascending aorta and in patients with bicuspid aortic valve [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], even if no murmur is apparent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H479813594"><span class="h2">Approach to diagnosis and evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AR is generally diagnosed and evaluated by echocardiography. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is indicated for evaluation of patients with moderate or severe AR with suboptimal or inconclusive echocardiographic assessment. Invasive angiography is indicated for diagnosis and evaluation when noninvasive tests are inconclusive or provide discrepant results from clinical findings [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>An ECG is not indicated for diagnosis of AR but is commonly included in the evaluation of patients with chronic AR.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2272033931"><span class="h2">Echocardiogram</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Echocardiography is indicated in patients with known or suspected valve disease. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is generally the key test in diagnosis and evaluation of AR. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is indicated in selected patients with AR such as those with technically suboptimal TEE or endocarditis with nondiagnostic TTE  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60777" href="/z/d/graphic/60777.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis of AR, establishes its severity, provides an assessment of aortic root and ascending aorta dilation, and evaluates LV size and function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5295.html" rel="external">"Echocardiographic evaluation of the aortic valve"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5327.html" rel="external">"Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of aortic valve disease"</a>.)</p><p>Characteristic echocardiographic findings include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The valve leaflets may be abnormal or may be normal but stretched due to aortic dilation, depending upon the etiology of the AR.

In the developing world, the most common cause of AR is rheumatic heart disease. (See <a class="local">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms</strong> – Patients with AR may remain asymptomatic for decades, even if there is progressive ventricular dilation. Exertional dyspnea develops in some patients with severe AR, particularly (but not exclusively) in patients who have developed left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. (See <a class="local">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Signs</strong> – Examination of the peripheral pulses, precordial inspection and palpation, and auscultation of the heart are all helpful in patients with AR. Patients with chronic severe AR have a wide pulse pressure and the apical impulse is displaced laterally and inferiorly and is diffuse and hyperdynamic. An early diastolic murmur is characteristic of AR but its absence does not exclude AR  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76340" href="/z/d/graphic/76340.html" rel="external">movie 1B</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56371" href="/z/d/graphic/56371.html" rel="external">movie 1C</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77962" href="/z/d/graphic/77962.html" rel="external">movie 1A</a>).
