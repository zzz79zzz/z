Reviews suggest that among patients who committed suicide, 80 percent had contact with primary care clinicians within one year of their death, whereas only 25 to 30 percent of decedents had contact with psychiatric clinicians within the year of their death [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>There are no data to show that routine screening for suicide in primary care reduces mortality. Additionally, predicting which patients with suicidal thoughts will go on to attempt suicide cannot be achieved with a high degree of sensitivity or specificity [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, primary care clinicians see a large portion of the patients who subsequently die by suicide, which suggests that an approach to case finding based upon risk factors, sensitivity to high-risk situations in depressed patients, and assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior in patients being treated for depression are appropriate in the primary care setting, and may uncover patients who make their intent known and are amenable to intervention.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, risk factors, evaluation, initial management, and follow-up of suicidal patients.

There were more than 800,000 deaths from self-harm and among nearly 250 causes of death, suicide was the 14<sup>th</sup> leading cause of global mortality. The most common methods used include pesticide ingestion, hanging, and firearms [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>China and India accounted for approximately 50 percent of all suicides [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In addition, self-harm was one of the top 10 causes of years of life lost in many countries and regions, including Australia, China, Europe, India, and Japan.</p><p>The age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States is more than 15 per 100,000 individuals [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In 2016, nearly 45,000 people killed themselves, making suicide the 10<sup>th</sup> leading cause of death [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Among individuals who commit suicide in the United States, firearms (see <a class="local">'Firearms'</a> below) are involved in approximately 50 percent of the deaths [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The second and third leading methods of suicide in the United States are suffocation (eg, hanging, about 25 percent of suicides) and poisoning (eg, drug overdose; about 15 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H432251785"><span class="h3">Suicide attempts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Based upon community surveys in 21 countries (n &gt;100,000 adults), the 12-month prevalence of nonfatal suicide attempts is approximately 0.3 to 0.4 percent [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], and the lifetime prevalence is 3 percent [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In the United States in 2015, 1.4 million adults attempted suicide, which amounted to a 12-month prevalence of 0.6 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>Suicide attempts are far more common than suicide deaths. Each year in the United States, there are more than 30 suicide attempts for each suicide death [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Among individuals with nonfatal suicide attempts, approximately 40 percent do not come to medical attention [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3704429499"><span class="h3">Suicidal ideation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The World Health Organization conducted community surveys in 21 countries (n &gt;100,000 individuals) and found that the 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation (thoughts) was approximately 2 percent [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], and that the lifetime prevalence was 9 percent [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>Other findings from the cross-national study included the following [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among individuals with a lifetime history of suicidal ideation, the probability of ever making a plan is approximately 33 percent, and the probability of ever making a suicide attempt is approximately 30 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among individuals with a lifetime history of suicidal ideation and a plan, the probability of attempting suicide was approximately 55 percent; among ideators without a plan, the probability of attempting suicide was only 15 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consistently across countries, about 60 percent of the transitions from suicidal ideation to suicide plan, and from plan to suicide attempt, occurred in the first year after onset of suicidal ideation.</p><p></p><p>In the United States, the annual prevalence of suicidal ideation in adults is 4 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. More than 50 percent of individuals with suicidal thoughts do not receive mental health services.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H156510794"><span class="h2">Sex</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mortality from suicide is higher in males than females [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In 2012, the global age-standardized suicide rate in males was 15 per 100,000 individuals and in females was 8 per 100,000, yielding a male to female ratio of 1.9 [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, these rates vary according to national income. In high income countries, the male to female ratio of suicides is 3.5, whereas in middle and low income countries, the ratio is 1.6. High income countries are more likely to provide good quality data.</p><p>Community surveys in 21 countries (n &gt;100,000 individuals) estimate that the 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation (thoughts) is greater in females than males (2.2 to 2.4 percent versus 1.6 to 1.7 percent), whereas the prevalence of suicide attempts is comparable for females and males (0.3 to 0.5 percent and 0.3 to 0.4 percent) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>In the United States, public health data indicate that the annual rate of suicide per 100,000 individuals is three to four times higher in males than females (24 versus 7) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. However, the annual rate of nonfatal suicide attempts and suicidal ideation are each comparable for females and males [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2380264304"><span class="h2">Age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Age related patterns of suicide vary across regions of the world. In most regions, suicide rates for both males and females are highest in persons aged 70 years or more [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, in the United States, the annual rate of suicide attempts is three to five times greater in young adults aged 18 to 25 years, compared with older age groups [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>The estimated annual rate of suicide deaths per 100,000 males and females in the United States, in different age groups, is as follows [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>15 to 24 years – males 18, females 5</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>25 to 44 years – males 24, females 7</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>45 to 64 years – males 30, females 10</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>65 to 74 years – males 27, females 6</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>75 or more years – males 39, females 4</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1842966487"><span class="h2">Race/ethnicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, suicide is a common cause of death in most racial/ethnic groups. Data from 2016 found that suicide was one of the 10 leading causes of death in American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, Hispanic Americans, and White Americans (but not Black Americans) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The annual rate of suicide per 100,000 individuals is two to four times greater for American Indians/Alaska Natives and White Americans than other racial groups [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>American Indians/Alaska Natives – males 27, females 9</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders – males 9, females 4</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Black Americans – males 10, females 2</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hispanic Americans – males 10, females 3</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>White Americans – males 26, females 8</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1458841839"><span class="h2">Education</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fewer years of education may be associated with higher suicide rates. In the United States, the suicide rate in 2014 was approximately two times greater in males with a high school education than males with a college degree or more education (39 and 17 suicides per 100,000 individuals) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. A similar pattern was seen in females with a high school education and females with a college degree or more (10 and 6 suicides per 100,000 individuals).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The subsections below describe factors that are associated with an increased risk of suicide. Identifying modifiable factors, as well as protective factors (see <a class="local">'Protective factors'</a> below), can guide treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H285171097"><span class="h2">History of previous suicide attempts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is estimated that there are 10 to 40 nonfatal suicide attempts for every completed suicide [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>], and a prior history of attempted suicide is the strongest single factor predictive of suicide is [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. A study of a community sample used medical records from 1986 to 2007 to identify 1490 individuals with a first lifetime suicide attempt reaching medical attention; more than 5 percent (n = 81) perished by suicide [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Of the 81, more than half (n = 48, 59 percent) died immediately from the index suicide attempt, and among the 33 individuals who survived the index attempt, 27 (82 percent) killed themselves within one year.</p><p>One of every 100 suicide attempt survivors will die by suicide within one year of their index attempt, a risk approximately 100 times that of the general population [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Following a suicide attempt, the risk for completed suicide is greatest in patients with schizophrenia, unipolar major depression, and bipolar disorder [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Psychiatric disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychiatric illness is a strong predictor of suicide [<a href="#rid25">25,28</a>]. More than 90 percent of patients who attempt suicide have a psychiatric disorder [<a href="#rid24">24,29</a>], and 95 percent of patients who successfully commit suicide have a psychiatric diagnosis [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>Severity of psychiatric illness is associated with risk of suicide. As an example, a meta-analysis found that the lifetime risk of suicide is 8.6 percent in patients who have had a psychiatric inpatient admission involving suicidal ideation, 4 percent in patients who have had a psychiatric admission for an affective disorder without suicidality, 2.2 percent in psychiatric outpatients, and less than 0.5 percent in the general population [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Patients who have multiple psychiatric comorbidities appear to be at higher risk than those with uncomplicated depression or an anxiety disorder [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>].</p><p>Suicide may be concentrated in the days and weeks following psychiatric inpatient hospitalization. In one systematic review, 41 percent of those who committed suicide had been psychiatric inpatients within the previous year, and as many as 9 percent of suicides occurred within one day of discharge from psychiatric inpatient care [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. This last figure may have been inflated by including some patients who committed suicide during their inpatient stays.</p><p>The psychiatric disorders most commonly associated with suicide include depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or other substance abuse, schizophrenia [<a href="#rid35">35</a>], personality disorders, anxiety disorders including panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorders, and delirium [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Among patients with depression, a history of suicide attempts correlated most strongly with feelings of worthlessness [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Concurrent personality disorder was also strongly correlated with suicide attempts in depressed patients.</p><p>Anxiety disorders more than double the risk of suicide attempts (odds ratio 2.2) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>], and a combination of depression and anxiety greatly increases the risk (odds ratio 17) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Symptoms of psychosis (delusions, command auditory hallucinations, paranoia) may increase the risk regardless of the specific diagnosis.</p><p>Information about the association between other specific psychiatric disorders and suicide is discussed in separate topics, which include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14693.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Course of illness", section on 'Suicide'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7809.html" rel="external">"Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, adverse consequences, screening, and assessment", section on 'Mortality'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6619.html" rel="external">"Borderline personality disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, course, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7684.html" rel="external">"Risk factors, comorbidities, and consequences of insomnia in adults", section on 'Association with suicide'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Hopelessness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Across psychiatric disorders, hopelessness is associated with suicidal ideation and behavior.

In addition, improvement of depression, including hopelessness and suicidal ideation, was greater with active treatment.</p><p>Self-harm includes both nonsuicidal self-injury and suicide attempts, which differ in multiple ways, including frequency; nonsuicidal self-injury may occur daily, whereas suicide attempts occur less frequently [<a href="#rid131">131</a>]. Multiple studies indicate that CBT can specifically reduce suicide attempts; however, CBT does not seem to reduce suicide. As an example, in a systematic review of randomized trials that examined the use of CBT in patients at risk for suicide, the primary findings included the following [<a href="#rid132">132</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials compared CBT with usual care in patients (n &gt;1200) who attempted suicide within six months of study entry. CBT reduced the risk of subsequent suicide attempts by 50 percent, compared with usual care (relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.7).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other meta-analyses found that suicidal ideation and hopelessness improved more with CBT than usual care.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Subsequent suicides were comparable with CBT and usual care. However, it is more difficult to demonstrate that an intervention can reduce suicides because they occur less frequently than suicide attempts.</p><p></p><p>If CBT or problem solving therapy are not available, it is reasonable to use other types of other psychotherapies. As an example, a meta-analysis of three randomized trials compared dialectical behavior therapy with usual care in patients (n = 292) with an episode of self-harm, and found that the frequency of self-harm decreased more with dialectical behavior therapy [<a href="#rid130">130</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1003549102"><span class="h3">Electroconvulsive therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For severely depressed suicidal patients, electroconvulsive therapy frequently provides a rapid response that may be lifesaving in the short term, and perhaps in the long term as well. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1711.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Indications for and efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)", section on 'Suicidality'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1709.html" rel="external">"Overview of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for adults", section on 'Continuation and maintenance ECT'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H895928862"><span class="h3">Adjunctive interventions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adjunctive interventions that address social isolation, and provide a bridge between an emergency department visit and outpatient care, may help reduce suicide attempts. As an example, a prospective observational study compared the benefit of usual care alone (n = 497); universal screening for suicidal ideation or behavior plus usual care (n = 377); and universal screening, usual care, plus an adjunctive intervention (n = 502) in patients who presented to an emergency department and confirmed the presence of active suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt in the past week [<a href="#rid133">133</a>]. The intervention included formulating a self-administered safety plan during the emergency department visit and seven subsequent telephone calls (each lasting 10 to 20 minutes) focused upon coping with risk factors, personal goals, safety planning, and treatment adherence. Patients were followed for up to one year, during which the risk of suicide attempts was less in patients who received the adjunctive intervention, compared with usual care alone (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.97). By contrast, the number of suicide attempts was similar for universal screening plus usual care compared with usual care alone. Another intervention with demonstrated success for postcrisis suicide prevention includes periodically sending letters or postcards to patients [<a href="#rid134">134,135</a>].</p><p>However, digital supplements to usual care appear to be ineffective for managing suicidal ideation and may be harmful. A study enrolled patients (n &gt;18,000) who were receiving usual care for frequent suicidal thoughts, and randomly assigned them to add-on care management, add-on dialectical behavior therapy skills training, or usual care alone [<a href="#rid136">136</a>]. Care management included assessments of suicide risk and motivational enhancement to promote recommended care. Skills training included video instruction in mindfulness, emotional awareness, and paced breathing. The adjunctive interventions were administered online through the electronic health record portal messaging system. Within 18 months of randomization, the rate of fatal or nonfatal self-harm with care management and with usual care alone were comparable (3.3 and 3.1 percent of patients). However, self-harm occurred in more patients with add-on, digital skills training than usual care alone (3.9 versus 3.1 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h2">Monitoring and follow-up</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients at risk of suicide should be followed regularly as warranted by the level of risk, bearing in mind that risk fluctuates, particularly if the patient's situation changes. As part of monitoring previously suicidal patients, the clinician should determine if there have been changes, especially a reemergence of precipitating events, adverse life circumstances, or mental disorders. Following acute management of suicidal ideation and behavior, the primary care clinician should assure that patients are actively engaged in ongoing care for any mental disorders and that they receive maintenance treatment to prevent or forestall recurrent episodes of unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, and substance use disorders.</p><p>The risk of suicide is increased in the days and initial weeks following discharge from psychiatric hospitalization, particularly if patients perceive that they have lost a therapeutic support system, including contact with a mental health professional. The risk is particularly high in the first week after discharge [<a href="#rid137">137</a>], and more than one-third of all suicides in the first year following hospital discharge occur in the first month [<a href="#rid138">138</a>].</p><p>Scheduling the first follow-up visit soon after a psychiatric hospitalization may reduce suicide rates. An observational study found that implementing a policy to follow-up patients within seven days of discharge was associated with a decreased rate of suicide during the three months after discharge (from 2.5 to 2.0 suicides per 10,000 discharged patients) [<a href="#rid139">139</a>].</p><p>Patients are also at high risk for nonadherence to pharmacotherapy soon after discharge, and thus have a consequent increased risk of suicide. By contrast, those who continue care in the community and who maintain pharmacotherapy are at lower risk [<a href="#rid140">140</a>]. In addition, an observational study found that assertive community outreach to patients who are nonadherent with medications or appointments was associated with decreased suicide rates [<a href="#rid139">139</a>]. Nonadherence may be due to adverse effects, lack of symptom relief, not understanding the purpose of medications, or failure to appreciate the consequences.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24"><span class="h1">POSTSUICIDE INTERVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postsuicide interventions are intended to help family, friends, and coworkers understand why suicide victims killed themselves, and decrease the assumption of inappropriate guilt for the death [<a href="#rid141">141</a>]. The intervention is often designed to identify those at risk of suicide, as well as prevent posttraumatic stress disorder, complicated grief, and depressive syndromes.</p><p>However, there is little evidence that postsuicide interventions are beneficial. As an example, a randomized trial compared psychoeducation (four sessions, each lasting two hours, administered during home visits) with no intervention in 83 individuals bereaved through suicide; improvement of depressive symptoms (including suicidal ideation) and complicated grief symptoms in the two groups was comparable [<a href="#rid142">142</a>]. Nevertheless, monitoring for posttraumatic stress disorder, complicated grief, depression, and suicide risk factors may be beneficial.</p><p>Information about managing grief and bereavement is discussed separately.
