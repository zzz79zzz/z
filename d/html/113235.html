         Advanced heart failure (HF) occurs when patients with HF experience persistent severe symptoms that interfere with daily life despite maximum tolerated evidence-based medical therapy. Patients with advanced HF have alternatively been described as having "refractory," "end-stage," or "American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stage D" HF [

         While signs and symptoms of advanced HF are variable, common manifestations of advanced HF include exercise intolerance, unintentional weight loss, refractory volume overload, recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, as well as hypotension and signs of inadequate perfusion (eg, low pulse pressure). These signs and symptoms occur on optimal (maximum tolerated doses up to target) evidence-based medical therapy, following insertion of all appropriate devices (eg, cardiac synchronization therapy) and with all reversible causes of HF addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mortality risk increases with each subsequent HF hospitalization [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. The presence of repeated hospitalizations, unplanned acute visits for HF decompensation, or complicated hospitalizations (eg, requiring intensive care unit care or inotropes) can suggest advanced HF [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         As HF progresses, patients frequently develop symptoms such as dyspnea, lightheadedness, or fatigue at rest or with minimal exertion that limits exercise capacity. Patients with advanced HF generally exhibit New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III (symptoms with minimal exertion) or IV (symptoms at rest or with any activity) symptoms  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683" href="/z/d/graphic/52683.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Since normal exercise capacity varies based on individual factors, such as age and activity level, standard benchmarks for exercise capacity may not be suitable for individual patients. Thus, a patient’s report of decline in exercise capacity over time can be most informative in signaling a significant change in exercise capacity. However, exercise limitation that is worrisome for advanced HF includes inability to walk a city block or perform activities of daily living such as bathing or dressing without limiting symptoms [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Many patients will progress to have dyspnea at rest, including at night (orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea). Poor functional status is an adverse prognostic indicator in patients with HF. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3477.html" rel="external">

         The role of objective assessment of exercise tolerance is discussed below. (See

         Unintentional weight loss sometimes leading to cachexia is a common complication of advanced HF. It is characterized by body wasting, including loss of lean tissue (ie, muscle) and fat [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. While often accompanied by anorexia (loss of appetite), it can occur despite adequate caloric intake, due to catabolic/anabolic imbalances.

         Patients with advanced HF often present with refractory volume overload despite escalating doses of diuretics. Volume overload can manifest as pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, ascites, and elevated jugular venous pressure. A requirement of very high doses of loop diuretics, such as

          metolazone

         is common in advanced HF. Worsening renal function and inadequate diuresis despite escalating doses of diuretics is also frequently observed. Volume assessment in HF is discussed in more detail separately. (See

         On physical examination, patients with low cardiac output may have signs of poor perfusion, including narrowed pulse pressure, cool extremities, hypotension, and mental status changes.

        <p>
         Although many patients with HF (particularly those with HF with reduced ejection fraction) have low blood pressure as a result of the combined effect of medical therapy and cardiac dysfunction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg) accompanied by symptoms such as lightheadedness and/or signs of organ dysfunction (eg, worsening renal function) can be indicative of advanced HF. Low blood pressure has been associated with increased mortality in patients with HF [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. In particular, intolerance or the need to cut back doses of neurohormonal antagonists such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers due to symptomatic hypotension is suggestive of poor prognosis and advanced HF [

         Impaired renal function is defined by a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is most often estimated using serum creatinine concentration. A variety of factors can contribute to a reduction in GFR in patients with HF, including neurohormonal adaptations, reduced renal perfusion, increased renal venous pressure, and right ventricular dysfunction. Both lower GFR and higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been associated with increased mortality in HF [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,11-13
         </a>
         ]. In addition, worsening renal function, as evidenced by increase in BUN or creatinine over time, is associated with worse prognosis [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. Advanced HF is often characterized by worsening renal function, often in response to diuresis for refractory volume overload. (See

         Right-sided HF (which often accompanies left-sided HF) can result in hepatic congestion, which is often suggested by abnormal liver biochemical tests. A mild elevation in serum bilirubin (total bilirubin &lt;3 mg/dL) is most common, though serum aminotransferase levels are elevated in a subset of patients. Serum alkaline phosphatase is usually normal or only mildly elevated. Elevated total bilirubin is associated with increased risk of death in HF [

         ECG abnormalities are common in patients with advanced HF (eg, Q waves, ST and T wave abnormalities in patients with prior myocardial infarction or with cardiomyopathy). However, there is no ECG finding that is specific for advanced HF. Increased frequency or new onset atrial (eg, atrial fibrillation) and ventricular (eg, ventricular tachycardia) arrhythmias can contribute to the development of advanced HF symptoms and should be assessed.

         Advanced HF should be suspected when a patient with HF experiences persistent severe symptoms despite optimal evidence-based therapy (pharmacologic therapy plus cardiac resynchronization therapy, as indicated and tolerated). The vast majority of patients presenting with advanced HF will have a known diagnosis of HF. Over time, many will progress to advanced HF that is refractory to guideline-directed medical therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Less commonly, a patient may present with symptoms and signs of advanced HF without prior diagnosis of HF. In such cases, the patient should undergo initial stabilization followed by appropriately titrated evidence-based management (particularly for HF with reduced ejection fraction). The diagnosis of advanced HF is not made unless severe symptoms persist on maximally tolerated doses of evidence-based therapy, including cardiac resynchronization therapy (as indicated), with adequate time allowed for a therapeutic response.

         Echocardiography can be useful for assessment of biventricular function, estimating hemodynamics, and evaluation other cardiac conditions such as valve disease, congenital abnormalities, and pericardial disease. While advanced HF can occur in patients with HF and both preserved and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, a drop in ejection fraction [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ] or very low ejection fraction (≤25 to 30 percent) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ] has been associated with worse prognosis. Right ventricular dysfunction is associated with adverse prognosis in patients with HF, regardless of ejection fraction, and should be thoroughly assessed [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-24
         </a>
         ]. Echocardiography can also provide a noninvasive assessment of hemodynamics that can be helpful in patients with suspected or confirmed advanced HF. Variables such as cardiac output, right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure can be estimated using Doppler echocardiography and have been shown to be reliable when assessed by experienced operators [
         <a href="#rid25">

         Objective assessment of exercise capacity with a six-minute walk test and/or a cardiopulmonary exercise test can confirm the presence of severely limited exercise capacity. A cardiopulmonary exercise test can further determine whether exercise limitation is due to cardiovascular factors.

         Exercise capacity can be quantified by measuring oxygen uptake (VO
         <sub>

         ) and other parameters during a cardiopulmonary exercise test. The peak VO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         provides the most objective assessment of functional capacity in patients with HF, and lower values are associated with worse prognosis. A peak VO

         of ≤12 mL/kg/min (or ≤50 percent of age- and sex-predicted VO

         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. The six-minute walk test measures the distance ambulated on a level surface during six minutes, and shorter distances achieved are consistent with more severe HF. A distance of ≤300 m has been associated with increased risk of death [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

However, results are generally less informative than cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing is favored if available, as it allows assessment of the contribution of cardiac versus noncardiac factors that can limit exercise. Exercise testing in HF is described in more detail elsewhere. (See

         Right heart (eg, pulmonary artery) catheterization can be helpful to measure intracardiac pressures and determine eligibility for advanced HF therapies. Abnormal hemodynamics are generally necessary for the diagnosis, although the precise pattern and severity of hemodynamic dysfunction may vary greatly from patient to patient, and abnormal hemodynamics, per se, are not sufficient for the diagnosis of advanced HF. Typically, there is persistently elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &gt;20 mmHg, right atrial pressure ≥12 mmHg) and/or decreased cardiac index (≤2.2 L/min/m

         Sleep-disordered breathing (obstructive sleep apnea [OSA] and/or central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stoke breathing [CSA-CSB]) is common in patients with HF. Both OSA and CSA-CSB can impair systolic and diastolic cardiac function, and the presence of either in patients with HF is associated with worse prognosis. Evaluation of patients with HF should include questions about potential sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (eg, snoring, excessive daytime somnolence, or poor sleep quality). (See

         When a diagnosis of advanced HF is suspected, it is important to exclude other potential causes of persistent severe symptoms and signs of HF despite optimum evidence-based therapy. Two key considerations are inadequate therapy for HF and presence of one or more concurrent conditions (eg, lung disease) in a patient with HF (that is not advanced) that may cause signs and symptoms like those of advanced heart failure.

         In addition, reversible causes and contributing factors to HF should be excluded. (See

         Poor adherence to medications and dietary restrictions (such as salt or fluid restriction) or undertreatment can contribute to persistent or worsening HF symptoms and should be assessed. Before assigning a patient a diagnosis of advanced HF, it is important to thoroughly review the patient’s current and prior HF therapies to ensure that all evidence-based therapies have been considered. Optimal medical management includes use of target doses (or maximally-tolerated doses when target doses are not tolerated) of evidence-based medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers. Furthermore, if one medication or medication class is not tolerated, alternative agents with similar therapeutic efficacy should have been tried. For example, if a patient does not tolerate ACE inhibitors due to cough, an angiotensin receptor blocker should be initiated as an alternative. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) should be added if indicated. It is also important to ensure that the patient has been given adequate time to respond to therapy (eg, one month after initiation of CRT). (See

          Kidney disease
         </strong>
         – There are complex interactions between the heart and the kidney, such that worsening function in one organ impacts the performance of the other. In patients presenting with advanced HF symptoms and renal dysfunction, it is important to distinguish between underlying kidney disease and impaired kidney function due to cardiorenal syndrome. (See

          Lung disease

         – Concomitant lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is common in patients with HF, present in up to 40 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-32
         </a>
         ]. Since lung disease and HF can both cause dyspnea, it can be challenging to sort out the relative contribution of each to symptom burden and functional status. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can be helpful in distinguishing cardiac and pulmonary contributions to dyspnea in patients presenting with suspected advanced HF. Adequate treatment of lung disease may improve symptom burden in advanced HF. (See

         – Cirrhosis can present with similar signs and symptoms as advanced HF, including ascites/abdominal distension, lower extremity edema, and fatigue. The presence of a normal jugular venous pressure on physical examination in a patient with ascites can be helpful in attributing the ascites to a noncardiac cause. However, it is important to recognize that longstanding right HF and elevated central venous pressure can also result in cirrhosis, and advanced HF and cirrhosis may coexist. (See

          When to suspect advanced heart failure
         </strong>
         – Advanced heart failure (HF) should be suspected when a patient with HF experiences persistent severe symptoms despite optimal evidence-based therapy (pharmacologic therapy plus cardiac resynchronization therapy, as indicated). The vast majority of patients presenting with advanced HF will have a known diagnosis of HF. A subgroup of patients with chronic HF will progress to develop advanced HF refractory to guideline-directed medical therapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'When to suspect advanced heart failure'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Symptoms and signs
         </strong>
         – While signs and symptoms of advanced HF are variable, common manifestations of advanced HF include dyspnea, fatigue, exercise intolerance, unintentional weight loss, refractory volume overload, hypotension, and signs of inadequate perfusion (diminished peripheral pulses or worsening renal function). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Initial tests
         </strong>
         – The diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected advanced HF includes a history, physical examination, blood tests, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiogram, and exercise testing. In addition, a right heart catheterization is required in patients with advanced HF who are undergoing evaluation for mechanical circulatory support and cardiac transplantation. (See

          How to diagnose advanced heart failure
         </strong>
         – A diagnosis of advanced HF is made based upon clinical evaluation confirming severe symptoms; episodes of refractory fluid retention, hypoperfusion, and/or recurrent malignant ventricular arrhythmias; evidence of severe cardiac dysfunction (on echocardiogram or right heart catheterization);
         <strong>
          and

         evidence of severe impairment of exercise capacity. (See

         <strong>
          Evaluation for reversible causes and contributing factors
         </strong>
         – In patients diagnosed with advanced HF, it is important to perform a thorough evaluation to ensure that there are no potentially reversible etiologies causing or contributing to the patient’s signs and symptoms of advanced HF. Important contributing factors including anemia, thyroid disease, and sleep-disordered breathing. (See
