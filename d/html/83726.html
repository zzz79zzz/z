In the United States, in 2019 it was estimated that approximately 4.5 percent of patients were receiving opioids for chronic pain [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Patients receiving chronic opioid therapy for pain commonly experience episodes of acute pain, sometimes due to new injuries or illnesses and sometimes related to the cause of their chronic pain, eg, postoperatively following knee replacement for advanced osteoarthritis.</p><p>This topic presents a stepwise approach to patients receiving chronic opioids who experience acute pain, including postoperative pain. Management of acute pain in patients with treated and untreated opioid use disorder, and management of patients with cancer-related pain (including breakthrough pain) are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia", section on 'Management of breakthrough pain'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Pharmacologic management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121628.html" rel="external">"Management of acute pain in adults with opioid use disorder"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Management of acute pain in patients with sickle cell disease, many of whom take opioids chronically, is also discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7144.html" rel="external">"Acute vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p>The overarching principles of acute pain management are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130312.html" rel="external">"Approach to the management of acute pain in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3508615618"><span class="h1">TREATMENT GOALS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients chronically using opioids, goals include providing adequate analgesia, preventing withdrawal and abstinence syndrome, and avoiding development or relapse of OUD. The imperatives to adequately treat pain but to avoid iatrogenic opioid use disorder and opioid overdose make medical decisions particularly complex. Patients receiving opioid therapy for pain even in the absence of OUD are at risk for opioid dose escalation during each episode of pain, and also at risk for remaining on higher doses of opioids even when an episode of pain subsides.</p><p>The guiding principles for acute pain management in these patients are similar to those that apply to patients who do not use opioids chronically. They are shown in a table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef133183" href="/d/graphic/133183.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and are discussed separately (see <a class="local">'Creating a plan for treatment'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130312.html" rel="external">"Approach to the management of acute pain in adults", section on 'Goals and principles for acute pain management'</a>). A basic principle of acute pain management for all patients should be to employ multimodal analgesia including nonpharmacologic methods to minimize or eliminate the use of opioids whenever possible. Opioids should be avoided because of their side effects (ie, nausea, vomiting, slowed bowel recovery, sedation, urinary retention and, especially, respiratory depression), and also because of the contribution of prescription opioids to the ongoing opioid epidemic [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3249590930"><span class="h1">CHALLENGES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are both psychosocial and biological reasons why treating acute pain in patients on long-term opioids can be difficult.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2720311219"><span class="h2">Psychosocial factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation and treatment of acute pain in patients who take opioids often occurs in an atmosphere of mutual distrust and, for patients, stigmatization and inadequate access to pain control. It can be difficult to decide upon the cause of acute pain in some patients who are on long-term opioid therapy, eg, whether the episode represents a flare-up of the pre-existing problem or a new diagnosis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinicians may have concerns about malingering or opioid use disorder (OUD) that make it difficult to interpret or trust the patient-reported history [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Many clinicians are not adequately trained to recognize and manage OUD. Based upon their clinical intuition, they may assume that a patient who uses opioids chronically has OUD. However, clinical assessment of the likelihood of misuse of prescribed opioids is often inaccurate and racially biased [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with a high requirement for opioids may be labeled as "drug seekers" or "addicts," and clinicians, out of appropriate concerns about overdose and addiction, may undertreat such patients' pain.</p><p></p><p>It is therefore critical that clinicians use objective methods to determine which patients are likely to have OUD and, when possible, make a specific diagnosis for the cause of pain. (See <a class="local">'Assessment for opioid use disorder'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121628.html" rel="external">"Management of acute pain in adults with opioid use disorder", section on 'Screening for OUD'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3595263263"><span class="h2">Biological factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In daily practice it may be unclear whether acute pain represents exacerbation of a chronic condition or a new process. In addition, patients may have altered pain perception or pain-related behavior, further complicating the diagnosis of acute pain. Central sensitization, tolerance, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) may contribute to difficulty managing pain in patients on chronic opioids.</p><p>Central sensitization is caused by amplified synaptic transfer of nociceptive impulses from the nociceptor terminal to dorsal horn neurons; the glutamate-activated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is integral to sensitization (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118590.html" rel="external">"Overview of chronic widespread (centralized) pain in the rheumatic diseases", section on 'Neurophysiologic and neuroimaging changes in chronic widespread pain'</a>). Central sensitization is implicated both in opioid tolerance (ie, the requirement for increasing doses of opioids over time to maintain the same level of analgesia) as well as OIH, in which patients with chronic opioid exposure become more likely to experience pain with less intense noxious stimuli.</p><p>Animal and human studies have clearly established the existence of OIH but the relevance of such studies to everyday acute pain management is not clear. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2800.html" rel="external">"Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain", section on 'Opioid-induced hyperalgesia'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3208888502"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A careful history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic studies should be performed to attempt to determine the cause of acute pain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1557818577"><span class="h2">Differential diagnosis of acute pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A differential diagnosis taking into account the site and nature of pain should be developed. Acute pain may result from exacerbation of a chronically painful condition (eg, sickle cell crisis or arthritis flare), acute pain with an identifiable cause (eg, surgery, trauma), or an acutely painful medical condition (eg, diverticulitis, nephrolithiasis), cancer-related pain exacerbation (hemorrhage into a tumor, pathologic fracture, epidural metastasis with spinal cord compression, or obstruction/perforation of a hollow viscus), or in some cases, without an identifiable cause. Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) are at risk of infectious causes of pain, including HIV-related infection, abscess, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. Psychosocial issues and spiritual distress can also evoke complaints of acute pain.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessment of baseline pain intensity </strong>– The clinician should explore the patient's preexisting chronic pain and how the acute pain compares with the chronic pain in location, intensity, pattern, exacerbating and relieving factors, and quality. The patient should be asked about baseline chronic pain intensity at rest and during activity on an average day, using a numeric scale  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62346" href="/d/graphic/62346.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exacerbation of chronic pain </strong>– A waxing and waning course is typical of many chronically painful conditions such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatic conditions (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis), phantom limb pain, complex regional pain syndrome, sickle cell disease, fibromyalgia, and functional abdominal pain. It is common for patients to experience intermittent, unpredictable, and inexplicable flare-ups of their preexisting pain. Nonetheless, a specific cause for exacerbation should always be sought. As examples, exacerbations can be caused by medication interactions that decrease the effectiveness of an existing regimen, or the development of tolerance to the current analgesic regimen. Injury or localized infection of a chronically painful body part, diffuse inflammation as a result of infectious illness, or other physical stressors can exacerbate pain. Acute exacerbation of chronic pain is discussed in multiple other topics on specific disorders that cause chronic pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychosocial causes for acute pain </strong>–<strong> </strong>Psychological stressors, including abuse, violence in the home, financial issues, family discord, or work-related stress can all lead to worsening chronic pain or new acute pain, particularly unexplained abdominal and pelvic pain [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. We screen for trauma, domestic violence, sexual assault/abuse, and psychiatric disorders for patients on chronic opioid therapy who present with acute pain including an exacerbation of chronic pain. Depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more common in patients with chronic pain than in the general population, and a worsening of psychiatric disorders may exacerbate patients' experience of pain [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Specific somatization disorders, such as functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) or somatoform disorder can present as acute pain superimposed on chronic pain. Coordination with an outpatient provider who knows the patient well can help avoid unnecessary testing and medication trials in patients who suffer from these disorders. Though there are few data on the role of psychiatric disorders in acute pain, treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders has been found to improve chronic pain [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109552.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Epidemiology and clinical presentation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14826.html" rel="external">"Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) in adults: Terminology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1845973328"><span class="h2">Baseline opioid dose</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who take opioids for chronic pain, the quantity of opioids used daily prior to the acute event should be ascertained as accurately as possible, including individual doses, intervals, and total daily dose. The patient-reported history should be confirmed using the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) or, if necessary, by contacting the dispensing pharmacy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1897852956"><span class="h2">Assessment for opioid use disorder</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As OUD becomes increasingly prevalent, it is important to distinguish between acute pain and drug seeking related to OUD. Patients with OUD who request opioids for acute pain present a diagnostic dilemma but should not be dismissed out of hand; they may have acute pain that requires adequate analgesia (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121628.html" rel="external">"Management of acute pain in adults with opioid use disorder", section on 'Patients receiving pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121628.html" rel="external">"Management of acute pain in adults with opioid use disorder", section on 'Patients with untreated opioid use disorder'</a>). In addition, because OUD is a life-threatening illness that responds to treatment, it is incumbent on medical providers to make this alternative diagnosis and initiate treatment when possible [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2107608014"><span class="h1">CREATING A PLAN FOR TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The plan for treatment of acute pain in all patients should be firmly based on the consideration of all relevant options that are judged by their potential benefits and risks. Treatment should start with nonopioid strategies, with opioids added only when anticipated or proven to be necessary, and the anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The pain management strategy should be multimodal and include nonpharmacologic methods of pain control (ie, ice or heat, elevation, immobilization, rest, physical therapy, acupuncture, hypnosis, relaxation techniques, meditation, and other options), nonopioid analgesics, and regional anesthetic techniques as feasible. Opioids should be prescribed only when necessary and should be tapered and discontinued as quickly as possible.</p><p>The plan for pain control should be based on the degree of existing or expected pain (eg, after elective surgery). However, the plan must be flexible because pain intensity and the requirement for additional opioids may be unpredictable in patients who chronically use opioids, and often increases with activity. Practitioners should be prepared to titrate opioid doses upwards rapidly if pain relief is not achieved despite use of a multimodal regimen selected to correspond to the likely pain severity, and to taper opioids and other medications as pain intensity and opioid requirement subside.</p><p>In the patient who chronically uses opioids, it is helpful to discuss the plan with the patient and agree that acute opioid therapy (if warranted) should be temporary, with the goal to return to baseline opioid doses within the expected time for resolution or healing. If the expected outcome is not met, the acute pain should be reevaluated, particularly before increasing or extending opioid prescribing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3265410529"><span class="h2">Preoperative opioid taper</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite increasing calls to routinely taper or discontinue opioids prior to surgery, it is not clear that tapering itself improves outcomes after surgery. Multiple observational studies have found an association between preoperative chronic opioid use and worse outcomes after orthopedic surgery [<a href="#rid17">17-21</a>]. However, literature comparing patients who do wean opioids preoperatively with those who do not is scant, and there are no randomized trials. A single center retrospective cohort study of 120 patients who underwent knee or hip arthroplasty found that patients who weaned their chronic opioids preoperatively had improved postoperative outcomes compared with patients who did not wean [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In contrast, in an insurance claim database study of over 57,000 patients who chronically used opioids and underwent various common surgical procedures, preoperative changes in opioid doses were not associated with clinically significant differences in long term opioid utilization [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In retrospective studies like these, it is not clear whether patients' ability and willingness to wean opioids were surrogate markers for other factors that may affect outcome (eg, positive attitude, adherence to postoperative instructions, less severe pain, patient education in behavioral pain relief methods, an enthusiastic transitional pain service, or having unscheduled emergency operations).</p><p>All patients who chronically use opioids should have pain management optimized with nonopioid strategies, and in collaboration with the patient, opioids should be weaned or eliminated if benefits do not exceed risks (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126111.html" rel="external">"Approach to the management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120967.html" rel="external">"Opioid tapering for patients with chronic pain"</a>). Further study is required before recommending the routine practice of weaning opioids preoperatively with the primary purpose of improving surgical outcomes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H832648877"><span class="h2">Continue the patient's baseline opioid regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient's baseline opioid regimen should be continued in order to prevent withdrawal and to maintain the existing level of chronic pain control, but should not be expected to be sufficient to treat the acute pain. If the patient is unable to take the baseline opioid in the usual formulation (eg, unable to take oral medication), the equivalent dose of an intravenous (IV) preparation should be administered. (See <a class="local">'Parenteral opioids'</a> below.)</p><p>Continuation of chronic opioids should be considered carefully and may not be appropriate for patients who are hemodynamically unstable due to comorbidities (eg, cardiac disease, sepsis) or trauma (eg, gunshot wounds, multitrauma). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94536.html" rel="external">"Perioperative uses of intravenous opioids in adults: General considerations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94536.html" rel="external">"Perioperative uses of intravenous opioids in adults: General considerations", section on 'Prevention and management of adverse opioid effects'</a>.)</p><p>Patients commonly consume less than the full dose of opioids prescribed chronically, and instead hoard or divert pills. Therefore, patients should be monitored for respiratory depression when baseline doses as prescribed are administered in the hospital. If there is a specific concern for medication saving or diversion, or if the daily prescribed dose is particularly high (eg &gt;100 <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">morphine</a> milligram equivalents [MME]), providers can consider giving a half-dose, monitoring for respiratory depression for one to three hours and providing the second half of the patient's dose if the first was well tolerated.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1350912526"><span class="h2">Potentially mild pain, anticipated duration one to two days</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mild pain can be expected after sprains, nonspecific low back pain, dental extraction, limited sunburn, or headaches. Nonopioid analgesics (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), including those administered topically, usually provide adequate analgesia; additional opioids, beyond the patient's baseline opioids, should not be required to adequately treat minor pain [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Nonopioid strategies for pain control'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H703140638"><span class="h2">Potentially moderate pain, anticipated duration three to five days</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most laparoscopic and minimally invasive surgery, most soft tissue surgeries, limited second-degree burns, and noncompound and noncomminuted fractures are expected to result in moderate pain that lasts for several days. Moderate pain usually requires short-acting opioids, in addition to the patient's baseline opioid and nonopioid multimodal pain control strategies.</p><p>Because patients on chronic opioid therapy may have hyperalgesia, it can be difficult to predict accurately how severe and how prolonged their experience of pain will be and how much opioid will be required. Treatment of moderate pain in patients who chronically take opioids must be individualized. Patients on chronic opioids may require hospitalization for parenteral opioids or regional anesthesia for injuries and surgeries that could be managed on an outpatient basis in other populations.</p><p>In the emergency department, postoperative, or urgent care setting, it may be appropriate to trial a test dose of both nonopioid and oral opioid pain medication prior to discharge. If pain control is inadequate, we either admit the patient to the hospital for pain control or titrate oral opioids.

Prescribe 10 percent of that dose as a single dose for short-acting pain relief.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reassess in 20 to 30 minutes and if the pain score remains &gt;3, provide a second dose 1.5 times higher than the last.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Continue this titration until pain control has been achieved.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H877285609"><span class="h4">Ongoing pain control</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once pain is initially controlled, parenteral opioids can be administered with intermittent bolus dosing by a health care provider or via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), with a basal rate for patients chronically receiving long-acting oral opioids. Although intermittent opioid dosing regimens administered by a clinician give the clinical staff more control over when to administer a bolus than PCA, they may lead to delay between the patient's request for analgesia and the delivery of the medication. For this reason, PCA is often the preferred strategy for ongoing management of severe pain. Intermittent clinician-administered bolus dosing is the best choice for acute pain control in patients who are unable to manage PCA, who may require rapid and closely monitored dose titration, and who have sufficient nurse staffing to provide such close attention. Multimodal nonopioid analgesic strategies should be continued along with opioid administration. (See <a class="local">'Nonopioid strategies for pain control'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H702674302"><span class="h5">Intermittent intravenous opioid</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following is a reasonable strategy for intermittent dosing with short-acting IV opioids (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">morphine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8538" href="/d/drug information/8538.html" rel="external">hydromorphone</a>) for acute pain in a hospital and/or emergency department, based on expert opinion and clinical experience with the management of acute pain in cancer patients [<a href="#rid46">46-48</a>]. This strategy can also be applied to patients with exacerbations of chronic non-cancer pain.</p><p>When pain control has been achieved, administer IV opioids at the dose that was found to control pain during the initial titration period every three to four hours as needed, while continuing the long-acting opioid at the patient's baseline dose or at an equivalent parenteral dose, for those unable to take oral medications.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3814276630"><span class="h5">Patient-controlled analgesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PCA may be the best choice for acute pain control in patients who are alert and who have the capacity to press a button repeatedly to titrate analgesic drug dosing appropriately. Patients should be started on PCA only after an initial dose titration, as described above, to achieve rapid pain control before transitioning to the more metered dose administration of PCA.</p><p>PCA includes intermittent patient administered boluses at a set lockout interval, up to a maximal total dose limit per unit time. A background infusion may also be provided by PCA but basal infusion is not recommended, unless it is required to maintain baseline opioid dosing during intervals when oral or transdermal administration is not possible. If a background infusion is necessary, the hourly dose should be calculated to deliver the patient's baseline opioid consumption. For a patient who takes 60 mg oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">morphine</a> per day, the baseline IV morphine equivalent would be 20 mg per day, or approximately 0.8 mg IV per hour baseline infusion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134254.html" rel="external">"Use of opioids for postoperative pain control", section on 'Patient controlled analgesia'</a>.)</p><p>The initial patient-controlled bolus dose should be one-half of the patient's baseline <strong>hourly</strong> opioid requirement, with a lockout interval of 10 minutes. As an example, for a patient who usually takes 60 mg oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">morphine</a> daily, equivalent to 20 mg per day (ie, 0.8 mg/hr) IV morphine, the demand dose would be 0.4 mg morphine IV, with a lockout interval of 10 minutes. Incremental PCA bolus doses can be adjusted to accommodate the temporarily increased opioid requirement.</p><p>The importance of constant vigilance for oversedation and respiratory depression during PCA cannot be overemphasized. Cautions about concomitant use of other nonopioid drugs with the potential to depress ventilation (eg, benzodiazepines) apply equally in settings of acute as well as chronic pain. As pain intensity subsides, stimulation of respiratory drive may also decrease, so patients who are receiving basal opioids (either orally or via basal IV infusion) in combination with PCA boluses must be closely monitored for opioid sedation and respiratory depression. For example, if a surgical procedure is likely to resolve the source of round-the-clock preoperative pain such as a compressed or inflamed lumbar nerve root, it may be reasonable to discontinue the PCA and rely upon opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia supplemented by as-needed opioid boluses. Transition to an oral regimen for the (potentially decreased) basal portion of pain control should be initiated as early as tolerated by the patient.</p><p>Most patients whose pain is not refractory to opioids achieve adequate pain control with PCA bolus doses until they are able to transition to an oral regimen. In the postoperative setting, PCA represents a standard approach to pain control for patients who receive opioids. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134254.html" rel="external">"Use of opioids for postoperative pain control", section on 'Patient controlled analgesia'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H595607297"><span class="h4">Transition to oral opioids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once a patient's pain is well controlled on intermittent IV or PCA opioids and the patient is able to tolerate oral medication, we transition to short-acting oral opioids. It is rarely appropriate to increase the patient's baseline dose of long-acting opioids to treat acute pain. Because most acute pain improves over the course of days to weeks, the incremental increase of a patient's opioid needs during the acute pain episode should likewise subside. Treating acute pain with short-acting opioids, with quicker onset and offset compared with long-acting opioids, facilitates appropriate dose reduction as pain improves.</p><p>The first step in transitioning from intermittent IV opioids or PCA to oral opioids is to calculate the total daily opioid consumption during the prior 24 hours, over and above the baseline maintenance opioid dose. Next, 70 percent of that 24-hour requirement should be provided through short-acting oral opioids, administered in divided doses every three to six hours depending on the opioid. In this setting, we order standing short-acting opioids that are offered to the patient at regular intervals, with the option for the patient to refuse the dose, or the clinician to withhold the dose due to sedation or respiratory depression.</p><p>Alternatively, an order may be written for short-acting opioids at regular intervals, to be given only at the request of the patient. This may lead to delays and gaps in analgesia but can also provide the patient with an increased sense of control and allow the patient to self-taper more rapidly.</p><p>Orders for PCA (bolus opioid doses only, without continuous infusion) or as-needed IV opioid may remain in place for the first day of the transition to oral opioids, to provide rescue dosing, then discontinued.</p><p>For example, a patient who is on 30 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">morphine</a> extended-release twice daily at baseline for chronic pain has received 46 mg of IV bolus morphine over a 24-hour period; 46 mg of IV morphine is equivalent to approximately 130 mg of oral morphine, so this patient can be transitioned to 90 mg per day of short-acting morphine (70 percent of the 24-hour bolus needs) divided every four hours. This translates to 15 mg per dose every four hours. In addition, the patient should continue to receive their baseline 30 mg of morphine twice daily for chronic pain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1740360751"><span class="h3">Duration and taper of treatment with opioids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The duration of opioid therapy required for acute pain varies with the etiology of the pain and how it is managed. Clinicians are now revisiting discharge orders for opioids to avoid unnecessarily large or prolonged prescriptions [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>]. Consequently, the doses and durations of opioid therapy required for acutely painful events in opioid naïve patients are being increasingly well characterized, particularly for common surgical procedures. This evidence-guided approach to postoperative opioid prescribing is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108806.html" rel="external">"Management of acute pain in opioid naïve adults in the ambulatory setting", section on 'Strategy based on expected degree and duration of pain'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1">Data regarding expected opioid doses and duration in opioid naïve patients can be used as a starting point for opioid-tolerant patients, recognizing that such patients often require higher doses of opioids and longer durations of opioid therapy after procedures. Such doses and durations are often reported as medians or means and, therefore, would be expected to be inadequate if ordered for the 50 percent of patients with durations of need greater than the median. Short-acting opioids should only be prescribed for the expected duration of acute pain. If a patient's long-acting medications were increased during the acute pain episode, those should be tapered down to pre-acute pain doses or below as the cause of acute pain resolves. In patients who undergo surgery for their chronically painful condition, it may be possible to taper opioids completely off postoperatively.</p><p></p><p>Excessive discharge opioid prescribing for acute pain has led to quantities of unused opioids in home medicine cabinets, whose diversion and misuse contribute to the opioid overuse and overdose crisis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108806.html" rel="external">"Management of acute pain in opioid naïve adults in the ambulatory setting", section on 'Opioid dose and duration'</a>).

A chronic pain exacerbation may be an opportunity to introduce nonopioid treatments into a patient's pre-existing regimen, rather than increasing the baseline opioid dose. Clinicians can help identify and personalize nonopioid strategies that have not been employed or optimized for such patients. In addition to pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, support groups, interventional pain management, complementary therapies, and physical, occupational, and aquatic therapy can all be explored in the setting of chronic pain flares.

Patients can be coached to identify their first sign of a pain flare and to develop a specific self-management plan for addressing pain flare-ups quickly and effectively. This may include taking extra as-needed opioid or nonopioid (eg, NSAID or muscle relaxant) medication, but it may also include reducing or introducing physical activity (eg, back exercises) temporarily, applying heat, ice, or topical therapies, engaging in specific self-care strategies, or connecting with support systems.</p><p>Management of pain flares is discussed in multiple topics on disorders that cause chronic pain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4116152077"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
