Most major bleeding in patients with VWD is treated with VWF concentrates. Examples include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bleeding that causes a decrease in hemoglobin concentration of 2 or more g/dL</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bleeding that leads to transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red blood cells</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bleeding into a closed space or compartment such as intracranial, spinal, or joint bleeding</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Major surgical procedures for which serious bleeding could be life-threatening</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Uncontrolled surgical or traumatic bleeding</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pregnant women with baseline VWF activity &lt;50 IU/dL during and shortly after delivery and/or invasive procedures (amniocentesis, neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Any bleeding requiring treatment in a person with type 3 VWD (absent VWF) or severe types 1 or 2 VWD  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71525" href="/z/d/graphic/71525.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Many of these situations are considered a medical emergency, and VWF should be administered without delay. Dosing and monitoring are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'VWF concentrates for major bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When the individual with major bleeding is stabilized, they should be transferred as appropriate to a location where there is expertise in managing VWD and laboratory monitoring of VWF levels is available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>DDAVP</strong> – Administering DDAVP (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/z/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a>) leads to the release of endogenous VWF from storage sites in endothelial cells. Although the response is predictable in patients who have demonstrated a response to DDAVP in the past, the rise in VWF level may not be sufficient or last for a long enough period in situations of serious bleeding. DDAVP is generally more appropriate for minor bleeding and minor surgery. It can be given only for approximately three days, after which tachyphylaxis occurs. If more prolonged therapy is needed, VWF concentrates are used.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antifibrinolytic therapy</strong> – An antifibrinolytic agent such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10011" href="/z/d/drug information/10011.html" rel="external">tranexamic acid</a> is often helpful in stabilizing clots, especially in areas with high fibrinolytic activity such as the uterus (for heavy menstrual bleeding and postpartum bleeding). This should be done as an adjunct to raising VWF levels but is not sufficient to treat most serious bleeding by itself. </p><p></p><p>Appropriate treatment is generally based on the type of VWD and the patient's baseline VWF activity level. There are three main types of inherited VWD (type 1, quantitatively reduced VWF; type 2, various forms of dysfunctional VWF; type 3, absent VWF), as outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71525" href="/z/d/graphic/71525.html" rel="external">table 2</a>); as well as acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110531.html" rel="external">"Acquired von Willebrand syndrome"</a>.)</p><p>There are special treatment considerations for different types of VWD patients. Additional considerations for monitoring and therapy in patients with VWD types 2B, 2N, and 3, and for AVWS are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Caveats for uncommon VWD types (2B, 2N, 3)'</a> below.)</p><p>While the type of VWD informs treatment, therapy should <strong>not</strong> be withheld while obtaining this information if there is serious or life-threatening bleeding and obtaining this information would create a significant delay that could adversely affect outcomes. In such settings, blood samples for VWF measurements should be obtained, and VWF concentrate should be administered as quickly as possible. Analysis of the blood samples obtained prior to VWF infusion should be performed concurrently, as well as a review of the patient's prior history, which may be helpful in guiding subsequent testing and treatment.</p><p>Treatment with VWF concentrates (or DDAVP) may be accompanied by additional, less specific treatments, including antifibrinolytic agents and topical therapy in some circumstances  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75956" href="/z/d/graphic/75956.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Antifibrinolytic agents stabilize the clot by preventing clot breakdown and are especially useful in areas of high fibrinolytic activity such as the uterus, nose, or oropharynx. Attention should also be paid to other conditions that might contribute to bleeding, such as an anatomic/surgical defect, concomitant factor VIII deficiency (factor VIII activity &lt;30 IU/dL) or thrombocytopenia, which would necessitate additional interventions, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Other therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>For severe, persistent, or refractory bleeding, other therapies such as recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) may be added. (See <a class="local">'Refractory bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>Cryoprecipitate is not used as a source of VWF because it has not undergone pathogen inactivation procedures that are used for the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8782" href="/z/d/drug information/8782.html" rel="external">plasma-derived VWF</a> concentrates. Cryoprecipitate can provide VWF in the rare setting of serious bleeding when no VWF concentrate is available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7943.html" rel="external">"Cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrate"</a>.)</p><p>Our approach is consistent with the 2021 guidelines from the American Society of Hematology, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, the National Hemophilia Foundation, and the World Federation of Hemophilia on the management of VWD, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health, the United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors' Organisation (UKHCDO), the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council (MASAC) of the National Hemophilia Foundation, and other agencies [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>].

Raising the VWF level into the normal range is the primary treatment for severe or life-threatening bleeding or major surgery in most individuals with VWD; even patients with a VWF inhibitor may receive a VWF concentrate initially to assess any effect on clinical bleeding, particularly if a bypassing agent is not immediately available. Exceptions may include those with a VWF inhibitor who require a bypassing agent or those for whom VWF concentrates are not available. (See <a class="local">'Overview of approach'</a> above.)</p><p>Available concentrates are listed below (see <a class="local">'Available VWF concentrates'</a> below). Regardless of which type of concentrate is used, we generally administer it as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>With rare exception, we give VWF concentrate by intravenous bolus at a rate of approximately 2 to 4 mL/minute. This is generally administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to the surgery (or as soon as possible for major bleeding).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We target a VWF activity of approximately 100 IU/dL  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75956" href="/z/d/graphic/75956.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); generally the level is checked in the recovery room so as not to delay the procedure, unless there is reason to believe there may be rapid clearance or other issues with normal recovery of VWF levels, in which case it can be checked prior to surgery. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We provide repeated infusions, usually at 8 to 12 hours, as needed to maintain the VWF level above 50 IU/dL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The length of therapy should be individualized and may range from three to seven or more days. </p><p></p><p>In some cases (eg, if the individual has developed a VWF inhibitor and does not have a response to bolus injections), concentrates are given by continuous infusion. (See <a class="local">'Continuous infusion of plasma-derived VWF concentrates'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H699673679"><span class="h2">Available VWF concentrates</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision of whether to use a plasma-derived or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="105705" href="/z/d/drug information/105705.html" rel="external">recombinant VWF</a> concentrate is generally based on availability and cost. The plasma-derived and recombinant products have not been directly compared in a head-to-head trial, but efficacy and adverse effects are similar in separate studies. A concern with plasma-derived products is the accumulation of factor VIII, which carries an increased risk of thrombosis. Neither type of VWF concentrate has had concerns with transmission of bloodborne pathogens. (See <a class="local">'Evidence for efficacy of VWF concentrates'</a> below and <a class="local">'Adverse effects (VWF concentrates)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3110069843"><span class="h3">Plasma-derived VWF concentrates</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, the approved <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8782" href="/z/d/drug information/8782.html" rel="external">plasma-derived VWF</a> products are Humate-P, Alphanate, and Wilate. Each product is labeled with VWF activity expressed in units of ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo, one of the assays of VWF activity) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1307.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease"</a>), and dosing is calculated using the VWF:RCo units  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75956" href="/z/d/graphic/75956.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The plasma-derived products all contain factor VIII in addition to VWF; the ratio of VWF:factor VIII is different for each product [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Dosing of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8782" href="/z/d/drug information/8782.html" rel="external">plasma-derived VWF</a> for major bleeding and major surgery is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial dose</strong> – The goal is to infuse sufficient concentrate to reach a VWF:RCo activity (and factor VIII activity) of 100 IU/dL. Although there are slight variations in dose recommendations with each product, the usual initial dose to reach this activity is in the range of 40 to 60 VWF:RCo units/kg. With some concentrates, when administered to individuals with type 2 or type 3 VWD, the initial dose recommended by the manufacturer ranges as high as 60 to 80 units/kg. The package insert for each product details this information.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subsequent doses</strong> – The goal is to provide additional doses of VWF to maintain the plasma VWF:RCo activity (and factor VIII activity) above 50 IU/dL. This is done by giving approximately one-half the initial dose given every 8 to 24 hours. Doses of each product may be adjusted according to the ongoing clinical picture and the measured VWF:RCo and factor VIII activity levels. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring and duration of therapy (VWF concentrates: plasma derived and recombinant)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There are two potential implications of the factor VIII in the plasma-derived products:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals treated with these products generally do not require a separate initial source of factor VIII.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Repeated doses may lead to factor VIII accumulation, which increases the risk of thrombosis.</p><p></p><p>High plasma levels of factor VIII (&gt;200 percent) lead to concerns about an increased risk of thrombosis; however, this is generally extrapolated from populations with venous thromboembolism (VTE) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

The usual initial dose to reach this activity is 50 to 80 units/kg. The package insert details this information.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial dose of</strong> <strong>factor VIII (for use with rVWF only)</strong> – Since rVWF does not contain factor VIII, patients being treated for acute bleeding are given an infusion of factor VIII with the first dose of rVWF, with the goal of raising the factor VIII activity level to 100 IU/dL. Recombinant factor VIII has been used with rVWF in the early studies of bleeding and surgery. The factor VIII dose is calculated based on patient weight; the dose is 50 units/kg to raise the factor VIII level to 100 IU/dL. After the first dose of rVWF has been given, the individual's endogenous factor VIII will increase, and additional doses of a factor VIII product are generally not required. Dosing is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Factor VIII'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For elective major surgery, the initial dose of factor VIII can be omitted in the majority of patients if a dose of rVWF alone is given 12 hours before the surgery; this allows the person's endogenous factor VIII level to rise to hemostatic levels [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The next dose of rVWF is given approximately one hour prior to the procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subsequent doses of rVWF</strong> – The goal is to provide additional doses to maintain VWF:RCo levels above 50 IU/dL. This is done by giving doses of 40 to 60 units/kg every 8 to 24 hours, with the frequency of dosing determined by the ongoing clinical picture and the measured VWF:RCo and factor VIII activity levels. This is generally continued for seven days or more, depending on clinical monitoring of the healing. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring and duration of therapy (VWF concentrates: plasma derived and recombinant)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3643128101"><span class="h2">Continuous infusion of plasma-derived VWF concentrates</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Continuous infusion of a VWF concentrate has been used for individuals who have an inhibitor (alloantibody to infused VWF) or acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to an autoantibody against their own endogenous VWF and have not had a response to bolus injections. Continuous infusion may also be used in individuals without inhibitors; this approach has been shown to decrease the total dose needed for treatment (and cost) by as much as 20 to 50 percent [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In one study involving eight individuals with VWD (three mild and five severe) without inhibitors who had 17 episodes of bleeding or surgery, the dose required to maintain the hemostasis (assessed clinically and by measuring VWF:RCo and factor VIII activity) was approximately one-half of what would have been given with bolus infusions [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110531.html" rel="external">"Acquired von Willebrand syndrome", section on 'Consequences of reduced VWF'</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with VWD who have GI bleeding should be evaluated for GI angiodysplasia if other causes for the bleeding are not found. Angiodysplastic lesions are commonly associated with more severe types of VWD and often cause recurrent bleeding [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Patients who have recurrent GI bleeding due to angiodysplasia may benefit from treatment with antiangiogenic agents such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8949" href="/z/d/drug information/8949.html" rel="external">atorvastatin</a> in addition to VWF concentrate prophylaxis [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. A review discusses the subject in detail [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Treatment decisions should be individualized and discussed with an expert in bleeding disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2794.html" rel="external">"Overview of angiogenesis inhibitors", section on 'Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs)'</a>.)</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that regular prophylaxis can provide dramatic reductions in chronic bleeding of various types (epistaxis, oral or GI bleeding, joint bleeding, heavy menstrual bleeding) and can reduce hospitalizations [<a href="#rid37">37-41</a>]. </p><p>The approach using chronic VWF administration is most likely to be appropriate in individuals with one or more of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequent or chronic bleeding that recurs, usually in the same site, despite appropriate on-demand (intermittent) therapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bleeding that interferes with daily activities, school attendance, or work</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bleeding that adversely affects quality of life</p><p></p><p>An antifibrinolytic agent may also be given, particularly if the bleeding is in a site of high fibrinolytic activity (eg, epistaxis).

Their initial study indicated that in 10 patients using an escalating dose frequency that began with a once weekly schedule of 50 international units/kg and escalated to three times per week if necessary, the bleeding rate had decreased significantly (mean annualized bleeding rate decreased from 25 to 6.1) [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>An open-label randomized trial involving 19 individuals showed that prophylactic treatment was associated with a decrease in bleeding compared with on-demand treatment given at the time of bleeding [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. </p><p>A study involving 2790 VWD patients followed over 22 years showed that individuals with VWD had twice as many hospitalizations and outpatient visits as matched controls; in a subgroup of the VWD patients, prophylactic therapy decreased hospitalizations by one-half [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1240220980"><span class="h2">Joint bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with severe VWD, especially type 3, can experience joint or soft tissue bleeding similar to that seen in people with hemophilia. Acute management is similar to that for other serious bleeding in VWD with the addition of orthopedic consultation.
