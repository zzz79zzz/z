         Thionamides are often started in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism to attain a euthyroid state rapidly in preparation for radioiodine therapy or thyroidectomy. However, patients who want to avoid or defer ablative therapy with radioiodine or surgery can continue the thionamide for prolonged periods. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7872.html" rel="external">
          "Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment", section on 'Selection of therapy'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although hyperthyroidism can almost always be controlled as long as the drug is taken, overall, only approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients achieve a permanent remission after one to two years of treatment. This estimate includes patients with severe disease in whom remissions are unlikely, as well as patients with mild disease in whom remission rates may be as high as 75 percent. Studies using long-term antithyroid drugs for 5 to 10 years or longer have reported remission rates as high as 84 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Rate of prolonged remission'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients treated with thionamides take three to eight weeks or longer to become euthyroid because they block new hormone synthesis, and any already formed thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) stored in the colloid must be secreted and metabolized for clinical improvement to occur.

         Thionamide drugs are contraindicated in patients with a previous major adverse reaction to thionamides (eg, agranulocytosis, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis). (See

         There have been concerns about PTU-associated hepatoxicity. Although hepatotoxicity is still a rare complication, the ATA and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend that PTU

We administer therapy initially in divided doses (eg, 10 mg two or three times a day or 15 mg twice daily) to normalize thyroid function more quickly and to possibly minimize gastrointestinal side effects and then change to single daily dosing if tolerated and as the dose is reduced. The dose is tapered to maintenance levels (5 to 10 mg/day) as the patient improves. Few patients require more than 40 mg/day of

However, block and replace may have utility in those rare patients in whom thyroid function tests fluctuate above and below the normal range despite minimal changes in methimazole dose. It may also be useful in the pediatric population to minimize the need for serial laboratory testing. (See

         Patients with Graves' disease who are treated with thionamides require monitoring of thyroid function and for the rare but serious adverse effects of thionamides (primarily agranulocytosis, hepatotoxicity, and pancreatitis).

          Thyroid function
         </strong>
         – Patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism who are treated with a thionamide should have their thyroid function (free T4 and total T3) initially assessed at four- to six-week intervals until stabilized on maintenance thionamide therapy. Once the patient has a normal free T4 and total T3, the dose of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/z/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">
          methimazole
         </a>
         can be decreased by 30 to 50 percent. Subsequent thyroid tests (TSH, free T4) should be repeated four to six weeks after each dose adjustment. A typical maintenance dose of methimazole is 5 to 10 mg daily. When a stable maintenance dose is achieved, thyroid tests (TSH, free T4) can be performed every six months.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         It is important to measure both serum free T4 and total T3 initially because serum T3 concentrations may remain high even though serum free T4 concentrations become normal. The serum T3:T4 ratio is particularly high in Graves' hyperthyroidism, and patients with so-called "T3-predominant" Graves' disease may respond less well to thionamide therapy and are less likely to attain prolonged remission [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. A few patients taking a thionamide have high serum T3 concentrations in association with low serum free T4 concentrations [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In comparison with the importance of serum T3 and T4 values, serum TSH values may be misleading during the initial period of treatment [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Pituitary TSH production is suppressed by hyperthyroidism, an effect that can persist for several months after serum T4 and T3 concentrations become normal. As a result, serum TSH concentrations are often low despite normal or even low serum T4 and T3 concentrations during the first several months of treatment. Often, however, the serum TSH concentration rises into the normal range within a few weeks. When this happens, there is no longer a need to measure serum T3 concentration.

         The importance of maintaining a biochemical euthyroid state in patients taking thionamides is suggested by a study that demonstrated increased all-cause mortality during treatment with thionamides (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61) and after radioiodine while still hyperthyroid (SMR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.46) but not after achieving hypothyroidism following radioiodine [

          Adverse effects
         </strong>
         – Controversy exists as to the value of monitoring white blood cell counts. We do not routinely monitor white blood cell count (for the development of agranulocytosis) or liver function tests (for the development of hepatotoxicity) in patients taking thionamides. However, a complete blood count (white count with differential) should be obtained during any febrile illness and at the onset of pharyngitis. We advise patients taking a thionamide to discontinue the drug at the earliest sign of a fever, sore throat, or other infection until the result of the white blood cell count is available. Agranulocytosis is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Liver function should be assessed in patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis (eg, jaundice, light-colored stool or dark urine, pruritic rash).

         In patients with normal thyroid function, we typically measure serum thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs), either using a thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) or a thyrotropin-binding inhibiting immunoglobulin (TBII) assay, initially after 12 to 18 months of thionamide therapy [

         Patients with normal levels have a greater chance for remission (up to 80 percent) once thionamides are discontinued. Thus, thionamides can be discontinued if TRAbs and TSH are normal at 12 to 18 months. Patients require monitoring for recurrence. (See

         Persistently high levels of TRAbs are associated with very high relapse rates. Such patients should either continue

         or proceed with definitive therapy (radioiodine or surgery). In some patients with borderline elevated antibody levels who want to be certain that they need definitive treatment, methimazole can be discontinued, and they should be monitored frequently and plan on definitive therapy with radioiodine or preparation for thyroidectomy as soon as recurrent hyperthyroidism is documented.

         <a href="#rid27">
          27

Another study found high serum TSH-binding inhibitory activity after 18 months of treatment in 60 percent of patients who relapsed and 15 percent who remained in remission [

         The frequency of prolonged remission among patients treated with a thionamide for one to two years is usually under 40 percent [
         <a href="#rid29">

         <a class="local">
          'Rate of prolonged remission'
         </a>
         below). Thus, after discontinuation of thionamides, patients require monitoring for recurrent hyperthyroidism.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with normal TRAbs and TSH at 12 to 18 months, thionamides are discontinued, and serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are measured initially at two- to three-month intervals beginning two to three months after stopping treatment or earlier if the patient notes recurrent hyperthyroid symptoms. Using this approach, recurrent biochemical hyperthyroidism is usually detected before the patient develops many symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Not surprisingly, a suppressed TSH level in the face of normal free T4 and T3 is a predictor for relapse [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If thyroid tests remain normal for six months, monitoring should occur at four- to six-month intervals for the next six months and then every 6 to 12 months. For patients who remain euthyroid for a year, thyroid testing (TSH) can be performed annually.

         Recurrent hyperthyroidism is initially manifested by a low serum TSH concentration. The time to relapse is related to the presence or absence of TRAbs. In antibody-positive patients, relapse can occur as soon as 10 days after drug cessation, while in antibody-negative patients, it can take many months or even years for recurrence to develop in that fraction of patients (25 to 30 percent) who eventually recur. Prolonged remission is likely if the patient remains euthyroid for six months, and late relapse occurs in only 8 to 10 percent of patients who remain euthyroid for six months. Recurrences are particularly common in the postpartum period in women who were previously in remission after thionamide treatment [

         The frequency of prolonged remission among patients treated with a thionamide for one to two years has been variably reported to be 15 to 80 percent but is usually under 40 percent [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,23

        </p>
        <p>
         A question that remains unresolved is whether the remissions that are associated with thionamide therapy are due to the drug or to the natural history of the disease. As an example, the spontaneous remission rate in a group of patients treated with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9829" href="/z/d/drug information/9829.html" rel="external">
          propranolol

         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Although these patients had mild hyperthyroidism, this observation supports the hypothesis that the thionamides primarily buy time for spontaneous remission to occur. On the other hand, the remission rate after 12 to 18 months of thionamide treatment in patients with mild disease may be as high as 50 to 75 percent [

         We do not prescribe combined thionamides and L-thyroxine (block and replace therapy), because it is of unproven benefit and requires higher doses of thionamides, resulting in a higher rate of adverse effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was initially hypothesized that the lower serum TSH concentrations achieved in patients treated with combined thionamides and T4 resulted in lower TRAb concentrations and, thus, improved remission rates. However, in a meta-analysis of 12 studies, remission rates were similar in patients treated with a thionamide plus T4 compared with a thionamide alone [

         Destruction of functioning thyroid tissue by extensive lymphocytic infiltration, similar to chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), may prevent the gland from responding to TRAbs and can eventually result in spontaneous hypothyroidism. Serum antithyroid peroxidase antibody concentrations correlate with the degree of lymphocytic infiltration, and patients with higher concentrations have a higher rate of spontaneous "remission" of Graves' disease [

         Rarely, remission can be associated with the appearance of thyrotropin receptor-blocking antibodies (also called thyroid-blocking immunoglobulins), which occupy the thyrotropin receptor and block the stimulatory action of TSH or TRAbs [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52

         (PTU), are effective treatment for patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. They are often started in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism to attain a euthyroid state rapidly in preparation for definitive therapy with radioiodine therapy or thyroidectomy. In the United States, patients are initially treated for one to two years with the hope of attaining a remission. However, patients who want to avoid or defer ablative therapy with radioiodine or surgery can continue the thionamide for prolonged periods. (See

          Choice of thionamide
         </strong>
         – Although all of the thionamides are effective for hyperthyroidism,

         and carbimazole have a number of advantages over PTU. Methimazole is always preferred to PTU (except during the first trimester of pregnancy or during the initial treatment of thyroid storm) because it can reverse the hyperthyroidism more quickly, and it has fewer side effects. There have been increasing concerns about PTU-associated hepatotoxicity. Although hepatotoxicity is still a rare complication, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued guidelines on the choice of antithyroid drugs in different clinical settings.

         . For patients taking ≥20 mg daily, we administer therapy initially in divided doses (eg, 10 mg two or three times a day or 15 mg twice daily) to normalize thyroid function more quickly and to possibly minimize gastrointestinal side effects and then change to single daily dosing if tolerated and as the dose is reduced. Few patients require more than 40 mg/day of methimazole.

          Thyroid function

         can be decreased by 30 to 50 percent. Subsequent thyroid tests (TSH, free T4) should be repeated four to six weeks after each dose adjustment. When a stable maintenance dose is achieved, thyroid tests (TSH, free T4) can be performed every four to six months. (See

         It is important to measure both serum T4 and T3 initially because serum T3 concentrations may remain high even though serum T4 concentrations become normal. Serum TSH values may be misleading during the initial period of treatment. Often, however, the serum TSH concentration rises into the normal range within a few weeks. When this happens, there is no longer a need to measure serum T3 concentration. (See

          Monitoring for recurrence
         </strong>
         – All patients require monitoring for recurrence of hyperthyroidism after discontinuation of thionamides, but it typically occurs months to years after drug cessation in patients whose TRAbs are normal at the time the thionamide is stopped. We measure serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 initially at two- to three-month intervals beginning two to three months after stopping treatment (earlier if the patient has hyperthyroid symptoms). Using this approach, recurrent biochemical hyperthyroidism is usually detected before the patient develops many symptoms of hyperthyroidism. If thyroid tests remain normal for six months, monitoring should occur at four- to six-month intervals for the next six months and then every 6 to 12 months. For patients who remain euthyroid for a year, thyroid testing (TSH) can be performed annually. (See
