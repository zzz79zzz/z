These devices can reduce the risk of death and improve quality of life [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, long-term MCS therapy requires frequent follow-up, testing, and self-care to manage residual HF symptoms, safely operate the MCS device, and prevent or treat common complications such as stroke, infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p>This topic will discuss the evaluation and indications for MCS, types of devices, and the outcomes and complications of durable MCS therapy.</p><p>The management of patients with a long-term MCS device is discussed separately.

In some patients who are eligible for heart transplantation, another goal of MCS therapy is to reduce the risk of mortality and to improve or maintain organ function until heart transplantation can be performed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H788403617"><span class="h1">TYPES OF DURABLE MCS DEVICES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are two basic types of long-term MCS devices:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4103360930"><span class="h2">Ventricular assist devices</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A durable ventricular assist device (VAD) is the general term for a surgically implanted MCS device that is intended for use outside the hospital. The purpose of a VAD is to support patients with HF by increasing perfusion and reducing the filling pressures in the heart. However, VADs only assist the pumping action of the diseased ventricle, which can fill and contract, albeit at a reduced cardiac output. In patients with advanced HF who undergo VAD placement, the device augments but does not completely replace the function of the heart.</p><p>Typically, VADs consist of an "inlet cannula" (ie, a rigid metal tube) that directs blood from the left ventricle (LV) into an electrical motor, which continuously pumps blood (also known as continuous-flow VAD [CF-VAD]) into the aorta via a flexible "outflow graft"  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86144" href="/z/d/graphic/86144.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138618" href="/z/d/graphic/138618.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The VAD motor receives power via a "driveline" (ie, insulated cable) that extends through a tunnel in the skin to an external controller connected to batteries. The patient and their caregiver team use the controller to receive basic information about the pump’s settings, power consumption, and battery life. The controller also generates alarms indicating low battery power or other abnormalities that require the attention of the patient or their caregiver.</p><p>The two most common VADs in use are the HeartMate III device and the HeartWare device, though the HeartWare device was removed from the market in June 2021 and is no longer available for implant [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The long-term management of patients with a VAD is presented elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Education on MCS therapy and alternatives'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4129404604"><span class="h2">Artificial hearts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An artificial heart is a surgically implanted MCS device that is used to treat refractory HF not amenable to treatment with a VAD. The artificial heart treats patients with HF by increasing cardiac output and reducing filling pressures. In contrast to a VAD, an artificial heart device completely replaces the function of the native heart; both ventricles and most of the atria are excised during artificial heart implantation. Compared with VADs, artificial hearts are used infrequently.</p><p></p><p>The artificial heart consists of two rigid "ventricles" that each have two valves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86145" href="/z/d/graphic/86145.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). One ventricle is connected between the vena cavae and pulmonary artery to pump blood to the pulmonary circulation, while the other ventricle is connected between the pulmonary veins and the aorta to pump blood to the systemic circulation. The most commonly used artificial heart rapidly shuttles air in and out of a polymer bladder contained inside the ventricles; this action creates a systolic pumping action and a diastolic "suction" effect  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86145" href="/z/d/graphic/86145.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). Air travels to and from the patient via large pneumatic tubes ("drivers") that are tunneled through the skin to an external unit that contains a pneumatic pump, batteries, and the controller. The controller monitors the function of the pump, displays battery power and setting information, and generates alarms indicating low battery power or other abnormalities that require the attention of the patient or their caregiver.</p><p>The long-term management of patients with an artificial heart is presented elsewhere.

Details on the approach to goals of care discussion can be found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110747.html" rel="external">"Palliative care for patients with advanced heart failure: Decision support and management of symptoms"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H135923021"><span class="h2">Eligibility for heart transplantation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients undergoing evaluation for durable MCS device placement, we consider the option of heart transplantation and evaluate for heart transplantation if appropriate; many patients eligible for MCS device placement will also be eligible for heart transplantation, and the patient’s decision to undergo MCS device placement can be influenced by the likelihood of future transplantation. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> below.)</p><p>The details of the transplant evaluation can be found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3528.html" rel="external">"Heart transplantation in adults: Indications and contraindications"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3081933618"><span class="h1">ADDITIONAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients who have advanced HF and whose goals of care align with durable MCS device support, the next step is to determine whether relative or absolute contraindications to device therapy are present. While the exact criteria for relative and absolute contraindications vary between centers, the common goal of the presurgical evaluation is to identify relative and absolute contraindications to therapy and determine which type of device (if any) can be used for support.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1907255217"><span class="h2">Cardiovascular assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cardiac assessment is focused on identifying conditions that pose a risk to the patient during the perioperative period or during the long-term phase of care.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Right heart dysfunction</strong> – In patients who undergo LV assist device (LVAD) placement, the right ventricle (RV) can acutely fail due to the stress of surgery or fail over time as the result of the cardiomyopathic process or as the result of other factors (eg, pulmonary hypertension). RV failure of varying severity occurs frequently and is noted as a common cause of death and morbidity in patients implanted with LVAD [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ideally, the assessment of RV function should occur at a time when the patient’s HF management is optimized. The risk of RV failure increases in the presence of one or more of the following factors:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Central venous filling pressure ≥15 mmHg.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>RV stroke work index (RVSWI) &lt;0.5 mmHg x L/m<sup>2</sup> [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Low pulmonary artery pressure index (PAPi) &lt;2.0 [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to central venous pressure ratio &gt;0.63 [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Signs of liver congestion and coagulopathy (eg, elevated liver enzymes or international normalized ratio).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reduced RV systolic function by qualitative assessment or tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) &lt;1.4 cm/s [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ongoing or recent use of inotropes or temporary MCS devices.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients who have one or more of these risk factors are at risk for RV dysfunction after LVAD placement. Risk models that predict RV failure after LVAD placement have been proposed, but they lack accuracy and are not commonly used as the sole determinant of RV failure [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Valve dysfunction</strong> – For patients who will undergo placement of a LVAD, normal or near normal function of the aortic valve is required, and abnormal function of the other valves may preclude or increase the risk of LVAD implantation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Aortic or pulmonic valve </strong>– In the presence of aortic valve regurgitation and LVAD support, blood can flow from the systemic circulation into the LV during diastole, which prevents the LVAD from unloading the LV. Thus, patients who will undergo durable MCS device placement with a LVAD must have normal or near-normal function of the aortic valve, and patients with more than mild aortic insufficiency should have a plan for surgical correction at the time of implant (ie, by aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis or oversewing of the aortic valve). Patients with aortic valve regurgitation that cannot be surgically repaired can undergo aortic valve bioprosthetic replacement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Similar to aortic valve abnormalities, pulmonic valve abnormalities must be addressed if a VAD will be placed as an RV assist device (RVAD).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Tricuspid valve</strong> – The presence of tricuspid valve regurgitation increases the risk of RV dysfunction after LVAD placement (see above). Whether tricuspid regurgitation represents a contraindication to LVAD placement or requires surgery at the time of LVAD implant is determined by the overall risk of RV failure and by the risk of tricuspid repair. (See <a class="local">'Ancillary surgery during device placement'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mitral valve</strong> – In the presence of a LVAD, blood must flow from the left atrium to the LV apex. Thus, mitral stenosis can prevent unloading of the left atrium, and moderate or severe mitral valve stenosis must be corrected at the time of LVAD implant. In patients who cannot undergo mitral valve surgery at the time of implant, moderate or severe mitral stenosis is a contraindication to LVAD support.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Mitral valve regurgitation is not a contraindication to LVAD placement; LVADs continuously unload the LV, which reduces mitral regurgitation and the effects of mitral regurgitation (ie, reduces left atrial pressure).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Prosthetic valves</strong> – The presence of a prosthetic valve in the mitral or aortic position can increase the risk of stroke during LVAD support [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In general, the presence of a mitral or aortic valve bioprosthesis or a mechanical mitral valve is a relative contraindication to LVAD placement. A mechanical aortic valve is an absolute contraindication to LVAD placement unless replaced with a bioprosthetic aortic valve, fixed in a closed position with sutures, or sewn over with a patch at the time of LVAD implantation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rhythm disorders</strong> – For some patients, durable MCS placement is the treatment of choice for severe rhythm disorders (eg, ventricular tachycardia). However, patients who undergo LVAD placement require normal function of the RV, which can be diminished by ongoing ventricular tachycardia. Thus, patients with a high burden of ventricular tachycardia may require additional therapy for ventricular tachycardia at the time of LVAD surgery (eg, surgical ablation) or following LVAD surgery (eg, antiarrhythmic therapy, catheter-based ablation).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In general, atrial arrythmias are not a contraindication to VAD placement, though patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo VAD placement have an increased risk of stroke [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aortic calcification </strong>– Surgery for durable MCS device placement requires anastomosis of the device to the aorta. All patients undergoing durable MCS device placement should have an assessment for calcification of the great vessels with a chest radiograph or chest computed tomography (CT). Typically, the cardiac surgeon will assess whether the presence of aortic calcification represents a contraindication to durable MCS device placement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease</strong> – Patients who undergo durable MCS device placement are at risk for stroke and peripheral vascular events during the initial implant surgery (eg, limb ischemia) and have an increased risk of stroke after device implantation. Thus, all patients under evaluation for durable MCS device placement should have an initial assessment with a focused history and neurologic examination, carotid ultrasonography, and ankle-brachial index measurement. Additional testing with brain CT or lower extremity ultrasound may be necessary if the initial evaluation reveals abnormalities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The presence of prior stroke, carotid artery stenosis, or severe peripheral vascular disease increase the risk of durable MCS device placement. Patients who have a severe stroke with residual motor dysfunction or peripheral vascular disease that results in an inability to ambulate or operate a durable MCS device have a contraindication to durable MCS device placement in most programs, while patients with lesser degrees of morbidity from a prior stroke or peripheral vascular disease are assessed by each center to determine whether the effects of their disease pose a contraindication to durable MCS device placement.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1155791728"><span class="h2">Noncardiac assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The noncardiac assessment is focused on identifying conditions that pose a risk to the patient during the perioperative period or during long-term phase of care.
