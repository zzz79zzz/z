In a retrospective review of 37,898 non-diabetes, noncritical care hospital admissions, the estimated frequency of a low glucose level (≤55 mg/dL [3 mmol/L], detected by point-of-care or laboratory testing) was 36 per 10,000 admissions [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In these patients, hypoglycemia was associated with a variety of non-diabetes drugs, alcohol, and critical illnesses such as sepsis, chronic malnutrition, or liver, kidney, or heart failure. Most patients had multiple possible reasons for hypoglycemia. Only seven patients had unexplained hypoglycemia, which did not recur during the inpatient admission. Few data exist regarding the frequency of unexplained hypoglycemia in the outpatient setting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The symptoms of hypoglycemia are nonspecific and do not differ between individuals with and without diabetes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73797" href="/z/d/graphic/73797.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Autonomic versus neuroglycopenic symptoms</strong> – Hypoglycemia can cause autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms. In individuals without diabetes, the occurrence of neuroglycopenic symptoms provides clinically compelling evidence of pathologic as opposed to physiologic hypoglycemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In studies of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in healthy volunteers, the following findings were noted [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Autonomic symptoms included tremor, palpitations, and anxiety/arousal (catecholamine mediated, adrenergic) and sweating, hunger, and paresthesias (acetylcholine mediated, cholinergic).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neuroglycopenic symptoms included dizziness, weakness, drowsiness, and confusion or altered mental status.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The nature of the hypoglycemic symptoms is often consistent across episodes in an individual, and symptoms may occur in the fasting or postprandial state [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Hypoglycemic disorders historically have been classified on the basis of fasting or postprandial timing. However, this classification may have limited utility, as patients may be uncertain about the timing of symptoms in relation to meals. Further, this classification does not always help identify an underlying etiology, as many causes of hypoglycemia can variably produce fasting or postprandial symptoms. Symptoms may not be recognized by the patient, even when evident to an observer. Many patients cannot describe their episodes in any detail because of associated cognitive dysfunction at the time of symptoms, so clinical history also should be obtained from a close family member or friend whenever possible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a case series of patients with insulinoma, approximately 77 percent of patients presented with autonomic symptoms and 96 percent with neuroglycopenic symptoms; ≥80 percent had confusion or abnormal behavior, 50 percent lost consciousness or had amnesia for the event, and 12 to 19 percent had grand mal seizures [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Evidence of recurrent, unequivocal neuroglycopenic symptoms warrants supervised testing for insulin-mediated causes of hypoglycemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1798.html" rel="external">"Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Determining the etiology", section on 'Supervised testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Glucose threshold for symptom onset</strong> – The onset of hypoglycemic symptoms normally occurs as glucose levels fall below 55 mg/dL (3 mmol/L), although the specific threshold varies among and within individuals over time. A counterregulatory response (eg, release of glucagon and epinephrine) can be detected at glucose levels approximately 10 mg/dL (0.6 mmol/L) higher, before the onset of hypoglycemic symptoms. However, the glycemic thresholds for these counterregulatory responses may shift to higher glucose concentrations in patients with diabetes who have chronic hyperglycemia and to lower glucose concentrations in patients with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia associated with intensive diabetes therapy [<a href="#rid10">10</a>] or an insulinoma [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1808.html" rel="external">"Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in healthy individuals and patients with diabetes mellitus", section on 'Counterregulatory hormones'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Impaired awareness (reduced or absent symptoms) of hypoglycemia may occur in individuals without diabetes, particularly those with recent, antecedent hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In these patients, the typical symptoms may occur at progressively lower glucose levels, or symptoms may be altered or entirely absent. Therefore, patients should be queried about both current and remote hypoglycemic symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Assessment in asymptomatic individuals'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1808.html" rel="external">"Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in healthy individuals and patients with diabetes mellitus", section on 'Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diaphoresis and pallor are common signs of hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure are generally modestly elevated, whereas diastolic blood pressure falls, leading to an increase in pulse pressure [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Neuroglycopenic manifestations (eg, cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, psychomotor abnormalities) are often observable. Occasionally, transient neurologic deficits occur. Permanent neurologic damage is rare and, should it occur, is more likely in individuals with underlying diabetes and prolonged, severe hypoglycemia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Laboratory findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The lower limit of the reference range for a normal fasting plasma glucose level is typically 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). However, lower values can be encountered in healthy individuals, especially during prolonged fasting when insulin secretion appropriately declines and fatty acids increasingly supplant glucose as the primary fuel source. In this setting, glucose can decrease to approximately 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) and should not be accompanied by impaired cognitive function. The normal response to prolonged fasting includes an elevation in circulating ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate. If insulin secretion does not appropriately decline (eg, due to exogenous insulin administration or insulinoma), the transition to fat as a fuel source is inhibited, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels do not rise, and symptomatic hypoglycemia can occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1798.html" rel="external">"Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Determining the etiology", section on 'Interpretation of supervised fast results'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">CAUSES OF HYPOGLYCEMIA</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Medications and alcohol</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medications</strong> – Drugs are the most common cause of hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In addition to insulin, sulfonylureas, and meglitinides, other medications also may cause hypoglycemia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52892" href="/z/d/graphic/52892.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). In a systematic review of 448 publications describing drug-induced hypoglycemia (excluding alcohol and drugs used to treat diabetes), 164 different drugs were associated with hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. However, the evidence supporting most of the associations was very low quality. The drugs most associated with hypoglycemia were quinolones, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9752" href="/z/d/drug information/9752.html" rel="external">pentamidine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9847" href="/z/d/drug information/9847.html" rel="external">quinine</a>, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The possible contribution of drugs to hypoglycemia in either ill or seemingly well individuals cannot be overemphasized. A thorough review of a patient's medication history including nonprescription medications is essential. In older patients taking glucose-lowering medications, particularly insulin or sulfonylureas, erratic eating with missed meals is a frequent precipitant of hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Other drugs may induce hypoglycemia in patients with underlying kidney or liver dysfunction [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Individuals taking prescription medications are also at risk for hypoglycemia due to prescribing or dispensing errors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ethanol</strong> – Ethanol inhibits gluconeogenesis but not glycogenolysis [<a href="#rid12">12,16</a>]. Thus, alcohol-induced hypoglycemia typically follows a several-day alcohol binge with hepatic glycogen depletion due to limited ingestion of food. Ethanol may not be detectable in blood at the time of presentation. Gluconeogenesis becomes the sole source of glucose production during prolonged hypoglycemia, so alcohol also can contribute to hypoglycemia progression in patients with insulin-treated diabetes who are at greater risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Alcohol ingestion is often a contributing cause of hypoglycemia in the emergency department setting.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Illness and comorbid conditions</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Critical illness</strong> – Severe hypoglycemia can occur during critical illnesses [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In a retrospective study of hypoglycemia in an adult intensive care unit, independent risk factors for developing hypoglycemia included diabetes, septic shock, kidney impairment, mechanical ventilation, severity of illness, and treatment with intensive insulin therapy to achieve tight glycemic targets [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Sepsis is a relatively common cause of hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid12">12,18</a>]. Cytokine-accelerated glucose utilization is usually matched by increased glucose production. Hypoglycemia only develops when glucose production is impaired, which may occur as a consequence of cytokine-induced inhibition of gluconeogenesis when glycogen stores are depleted [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Liver or kidney dysfunction</strong> – Impaired kidney or liver function can lead to hypoglycemia, particularly in the setting of reduced food ingestion or exogenous insulin use. The mechanisms of hypoglycemia in chronic kidney disease include impaired renal gluconeogenesis (resulting in decreased renal contributions to endogenous glucose production) and reduced renal clearance of insulin. Gluconeogenesis is also impaired, usually as a late manifestation, in severe liver disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malarial infection</strong> – In tropical countries where malaria is endemic, hypoglycemia can result from malaria, its treatment, or both [<a href="#rid12">12,14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5709.html" rel="external">"Malaria: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in nonpregnant adults and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malnourishment</strong> – Malnutrition can cause hypoglycemia due to substrate limitation of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the setting of glycogen depletion. Hypoglycemia has been reported in patients with anorexia nervosa [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cortisol deficiency</strong> – Hypoglycemia can occur in patients with cortisol deficiency (Addison disease) [<a href="#rid12">12,23</a>]. However, it is rarely the sole presenting manifestation of cortisol deficiency and almost uniformly accompanied by other signs and symptoms suggestive of the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Individuals with cortisol deficiency, particularly when due to hypopituitarism, may have concurrent hypothyroidism and/or growth hormone deficiency. Although hypothyroidism or growth hormone deficiency alone rarely causes hypoglycemia, either can contribute to more severe or prolonged episodes when hypoglycemia results from another etiology. Hypothyroidism can contribute to hypoglycemia severity through multiple mechanisms including decreased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Growth hormone is a key component of the glucose counterregulatory response that defends against hypoglycemia. The role of growth hormone in glucose counterregulation is reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1808.html" rel="external">"Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in healthy individuals and patients with diabetes mellitus", section on 'Counterregulatory hormones'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hypoglycemia is more common in infants and children with primary adrenal insufficiency, patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency caused by isolated corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency, and patients with concurrent adrenal insufficiency and type 1 diabetes. In the setting of type 1 diabetes, exogenous insulin action becomes largely unopposed due to loss of the gluconeogenic effect of cortisol. In addition, individuals with either antecedent hypoglycemia or autonomic neuropathy may have reduced epinephrine secretion and, consequently, diminished glucose counterregulation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1808.html" rel="external">"Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in healthy individuals and patients with diabetes mellitus", section on 'Impairment of behavioral and counterregulatory responses'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malignancy</strong> – Hypoglycemia has been observed in a small number of patients with nonislet cell tumors; these are usually large, clinically obvious tumors of mesenchymal or epithelial cell types. Hypoglycemia is most often due to tumor production of an insulin-like growth factor (IGF; eg, incompletely processed IGF-2) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Endogenous production of insulin is appropriately suppressed. The diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1798.html" rel="external">"Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Determining the etiology", section on 'Insulin level &lt;3 microU/mL'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1780.html" rel="external">"Nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h2">Endogenous hyperinsulinism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia occurs when insulin secretion fails to fall appropriately in the setting of hypoglycemia; hypoglycemia results from low rates of glucose production rather than high rates of glucose utilization [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>Endogenous hyperinsulinism is more likely in an otherwise healthy individual with no clinical clues suggesting other common causes of hypoglycemia. The diagnosis is often unrecognized for years. In adults, hypoglycemia due to endogenous hyperinsulinism can be caused by the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919" href="/z/d/graphic/78919.html" rel="external">table 3</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A beta cell secretagogue, such as a sulfonylurea. (See <a class="local">'Accidental, surreptitious, or malicious hypoglycemia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A beta cell tumor (insulinoma). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2187.html" rel="external">"Insulinoma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A functional beta cell disorder that can occur as a feature of the noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS).

This mismatch is due to rapid transit of calories through the upper gastrointestinal tract [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. Individuals who have undergone gastric bypass surgery also may have postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia occurs in patients who have antibodies directed to endogenous insulin or to the insulin receptor. Symptoms can occur postprandially, fasting, or in both states. In patients with insulin antibody-mediated hypoglycemia, insulin secreted in response to a meal is thought to bind to antibodies and then disassociate in an unregulated fashion, causing hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. In patients with antibodies to the insulin receptor, hypoglycemia occurs as a result of antibody activation of the receptor [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) or congenital hyperinsulinism, while very rare, is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants. PHHI is a genetic disorder with both familial and sporadic forms, characterized by dysregulation of insulin secretion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5810.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of congenital hyperinsulinism"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h2">Accidental, surreptitious, or malicious hypoglycemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The possibility of accidental, surreptitious, or even malicious hypoglycemia should be considered when the cause of pathologic hypoglycemia is not apparent [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Accidental hypoglycemia can result from medical, pharmacy, or patient errors, such as the mistaken use of an oral hypoglycemic medication by an older spouse of a patient with diabetes. It may also occur after ingestion of herbal products contaminated with sulfonylureas [<a href="#rid29">29</a>] or after covert self-administration of an oral hypoglycemic drug or insulin by a patient with or without diabetes. Finally, eating unripe Ackee fruit can result in severe hypoglycemia (Jamaican vomiting illness) mediated by toxins called hypoglycins that inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis.</p><p>Surreptitious use of a glucose-lowering medication, often a sulfonylurea, occurs more commonly in a person who is knowledgeable about the drug and has immediate access to it.

Synthetic insulin analogs are not detected by some insulin assays, and specialized assays may be needed for their detection [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].
