         Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha are important therapeutic agents used for a number of inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and psoriasis. TNF-alpha inhibitors offer a targeted strategy that contrasts with the nonspecific immunosuppressive agents traditionally used to treat most inflammatory diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite their benefits, multiple potential adverse effects of TNF-alpha inhibition have been reported through both clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance. These include:

         Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors are associated with potentially serious adverse effects. However, these risks must be interpreted in the context of the potential benefits of these medications, adverse effects of the disease itself, and adverse effects of alternative therapies. The adverse effects of conventional treatments and other targeted biologic agents, including the risk of malignancy induction, are also significant in many cases. Thus, the decision to use a TNF-alpha inhibitor must be an individual one, based upon the specific clinical features and the unique risk profile of a given patient.

         Five inhibitors of TNF-alpha are widely available for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, and several other inflammatory disorders  (

         TNF-alpha, originally known as cachexin or cachectin, was recognized in 1975 when it was associated with tumor lysis in a variety of in vitro and mouse models (hence the name "tumor necrosis factor") [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The biology of TNF-alpha is discussed in detail separately. (See

          "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: An overview of adverse effects", section on 'TNF-alpha biology'

        </p>
        <p>
         The activity of TNF-alpha against tumors in laboratory models and, potentially, in humans raised the possibility that TNF-alpha inhibition might potentiate the clinical risk of malignancy. Experimental evidence of an anti-tumor effect for TNF-alpha led to the local administration of this cytokine for the treatment of some malignancies, usually in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.

         </span>
         In many formal analyses of the risk of malignancy posed by TNF-alpha inhibitor use, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) have been used to assess the degree of risk among patients receiving TNF inhibitors compared with the baseline risk of malignancy in the general population. While providing an indication of malignancy risk associated with treatments, they cannot differentiate between the risk associated with treatment and the risk associated with the diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         SIR is defined in the following manner:
        </p>
        <div class="formulaContainer">
         <div class="formula">
          <p>
           SIR = (Observed cases of malignancy/Expected cases of malignancy)
          </p>
         </div>
        </div>
        <p>
         To estimate the number of expected cases of malignancy within a population over a specific period of time, investigators often refer to one of several large registries. In the United States, data can be obtained from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, a population-based registry that includes all invasive cancers plus cancer of the urinary bladder and breast carcinoma in situ [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In many European countries, including Sweden, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, there are national cancer registries with mandatory reporting. These national registries have been used as a source of background population rates for comparison with patients treated with TNF inhibitors.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The relative risk (RR) presents the risk in patients exposed to a treatment compared with the risk in patients not exposed to a treatment, or exposed to an alternative treatment. The advantage of calculating RR is that it is more specific for analysis of treatment-associated risks compared with SIRs, which use data from the general population without the disease of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many ways to calculate RR depending upon the nature of the data available (eg, a comparison of incident rates [incident rate ratio], a comparison on time to an event [hazard ratio]). For the purpose of this review, all RRs will be labelled "relative risk," regardless of the statistics used to calculate risk.

         Proof of a link between tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor use and the development of cancer is difficult for several reasons. These include:

         <strong>
          Risk from underlying disease
         </strong>
         – Patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors may have an inherent predisposition to cancer based upon their underlying disease. As examples, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may have up to a 10 to 15 percent overall increase in the risk of cancer (relative risk [RR] 1.10 to 1.15) compared with the general population, and patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of colon cancer [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-6
         </a>
         ]. The risk of malignancy is site-specific in RA, in which it appears to be increased for lymphoma and, perhaps, for lung cancer, but in which it appears to be potentially decreased for colorectal and breast cancer [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. It can be difficult to distinguish the additional risk conferred by TNF-alpha inhibitors from the baseline risk, although many of the later studies have included analytic approaches that can account for this baseline risk.

         <strong>
          Risk from other medications
         </strong>
         – Patients with immune-mediated disorders often receive other medications concomitantly with TNF-alpha inhibitors that increase the risk of cancer [

         – Patients with prior malignancy have been excluded from clinical trials with TNF inhibitors because of concern over a potentially increased risk of recurrent or new malignancy in such patients. Thus, data regarding cancer risk in this population of particular interest are limited. (See

         Rigorous clinical trials have been performed for TNF-alpha inhibitors in contrast to most nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), facilitating detection of events that occur during the trial period. Long-term risks of cancer, however, cannot be determined from short-term randomized trials.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although some meta-analyses of clinical trial data have found increased cancer risk with TNF inhibitor use, observational data, particularly from registries, have generally been unable to confirm these findings [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,12-18
         </a>
         ]. This discrepancy may result, in part, from the more complete reporting of malignancies in clinical trials than in the context of routine practice, in which, in the absence of a cancer registry, reporting may depend upon voluntary postmarketing surveillance. Evaluation of risk using observational studies is also highly dependent upon how cancers are identified and upon what comparator is chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite most evidence suggesting no increase in malignancy risk overall, these analyses have assumed that the effect of TNF inhibitor therapies would be the same across all anatomical sites and malignancy subtypes. Instead, risks may be different for certain individual malignancies. (See

         Increasingly, evidence indicates that overall cancer risk does not increase over time in patients who use TNF inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rather than other therapies. Additional evidence suggests that these agents do not increase cancer risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other conditions. Several reports, including data for patients with RA, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and other conditions, have shown that risk may only be elevated for skin cancer but not for other cancers overall compared with patients receiving other DMARDs [

         Although the majority of evidence available has suggested no association between TNF inhibitor therapy and overall cancer risk, there has been interest in whether there may be an increased risk of lymphoma and some skin cancers in patients with RA. Reports of a potential increase in some solid tumors and lymphoma in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and IBD emphasizes that there may be differences between diseases.

         A US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analysis identified 48 cases over a 10-year period (1998 to 2008) of malignancies in children and adolescents who received TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy for JIA or IBD [
         <a href="#rid25">

When limited to children with IBD, the study did find a higher standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of malignancy compared with the general population among children who received TNF inhibitor in combination with a thiopurine compared with children who only received a TNF inhibitor, suggesting this may be a group of patients at higher risk. However, the absolute risk of cancer across all groups was extremely low (TNF inhibitor with thiopurine: three malignancies in 2977 person-years of follow-up; TNF inhibitor without thiopurine: four malignancies in 8913 person-years of follow-up) and adjustments for disease severity were not included in this part of the analysis, which could also influence risk. Nonetheless, clinicians should be aware of this higher risk in this population, regardless of the cause.

The absolute risk of lymphoma in these groups was very low, with only five cases among the patients receiving etanercept or infliximab and two cases in the group treated with conventional DMARDs. Although the relative risk estimate was increased in the TNF inhibitor group, the very wide confidence intervals indicate that the risk estimates were very imprecise (SIR 11.5, 95% CI 3.7-26.9, versus 1.3, 95% CI 0.2-4.5), likely due to the small sample sizes analyzed. This increase in risk was not confirmed in subsequent larger studies with longer follow-up.

         Women with RA are at increased risk of cervical cancer, and based upon observations from one study, this risk might be slightly increased with use of TNF inhibitors (depending on the comparator group). This study from Sweden evaluated the pattern of cervical screening and cervical cancer risk among 9629 female patients receiving TNF inhibitors for RA compared with 34,984 biologic-naïve women with RA [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40

         ]. Patients receiving TNF inhibitors were not at an increased risk of low-grade cervical dysplasia (carcinoma in situ), termed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, but were at an increased risk of the more severe CIN 2 or higher-grade changes (relative risk [RR] 1.36, 95% CI 1.01-1.82) and invasive cervical cancer (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.04-4.23), although the results were imprecise.

        <p>
         The risk estimates with TNF inhibitors were lower (although still slightly elevated) when a stricter definition of a biologic-naïve patient was used (treated with two or more other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs]). This likely represented a more closely matched population and suggests the initial risk observed with TNF inhibitors could be explained in part by higher severity of RA and past exposures to other immunosuppressive drugs, rather than a direct effect of TNF inhibitors themselves. There was no difference detected in screening patterns between women who were and were not receiving TNF inhibitors to account for the differences.

         There has been evidence of an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer among patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors compared with those not receiving these agents, including meta-analyses of data from registries, prospective observational studies, and randomized trials [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16,42,43

         <a href="#rid19">

         Thus, in all patients with RA, regardless of TNF inhibitor use, we advise routine skin cancer surveillance. Patients should also be educated regarding skin cancer prevention when starting treatment, including use of broad-spectrum sunscreens when in the sun, sun avoidance, and skin self-examination. (See

         In a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from four observational studies involving over 28,000 patients, the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer was significantly increased among patients exposed to TNF inhibitors compared with those who were not (relative risk [RR] 1.45, 95% CI 1.15-1.76) [

         The British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for Rheumatoid Arthritis (BSRBR-RA) also found no increased risk (eg, for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) among 11,881 TNF inhibitor-treated patients compared with 3629 TNF inhibitor-untreated patients with RA [

         The BSRBR-RA also studied the risk of recurrent skin cancer in 283 patients receiving either TNF inhibitors or conventional DMARDs with a past history of nonmelanoma skin cancer prior to starting therapy. The crude incidence rate of new skin cancer was almost 10-fold higher compared with those without a previous skin cancer; however, the risk was not increased in those receiving TNF inhibitor therapies compared with patients receiving nonbiologic therapies.

         Both the Danish and British studies did find an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with RA compared with the general population. This risk increase ranged from a 76 to 83 percent increase in patients with RA who were not treated with TNF inhibitors and a 72 to 92 percent increase among patients treated with TNF inhibitor therapies. This supports the view that all patients with RA should be screened for skin cancer, regardless of whether they are receiving TNF inhibitors.

         A large variation in risk was observed across the different countries, although this was felt to be explained largely by the low rates of melanoma within each registry. There were limitations to the study methods common to observational research, such as ascertainment bias, and individual variation of risk among populations with higher baseline risk, such as in Scandinavia; therefore, a small risk of melanoma cannot be excluded completely. However, the absolute risk is very low.

The paucity of data regarding this question has resulted from the exclusion of such patients from clinical trials with TNF inhibitors because of earlier concerns over such risk and from practice guidelines or drug labeling promoting caution in this population, given the lack of information to document safety.

         Whether melanoma conveys greater risk than other malignancies for disease recurrence following TNF inhibitor treatment remains to be determined by further study, but the successful use of immunotherapies for the treatment of melanoma underlines the role of the immune system in management of melanoma (see

When a melanoma develops in a patient receiving TNF inhibitors, it would be the author's approach to discontinue the TNF inhibitor and consider alternative biologic DMARDs in consultation with the patient's oncologist. A similar approach is taken in patients with a prior history of melanoma. Whether this theoretical risk also extends to patients with a family history of melanoma or those at high risk due to geographic region or history of significant sun exposure is unknown.

          General issues

         – The decision to use a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor must be based upon the specific clinical features and unique risk profile of a given patient. The risks associated with TNF inhibitor use must be interpreted in the context of the potential benefits associated with these medications, as well as the adverse effects associated with conventional treatments for immune-mediated diseases. The adverse effects of untreated arthritis, including the risk of malignancy induction, are also significant in many cases. (See

          Challenges in establishing malignancy risk
         </strong>
         – Challenges in establishing the true magnitude of risk (if any) between TNF inhibitor use and the development of malignancy include:

          Skin cancer risk
         </strong>
         – The risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer may be increased in patients who receive TNF inhibitors; however, the risk may be increased in all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) regardless of treatment. Thus, general screening for skin cancer in patients with RA should be encouraged. The risk of melanoma is uncertain but may also be increased. (See
