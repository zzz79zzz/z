         In many countries, the mean maternal age at first birth is rising. However, fertility declines with advancing age. Thus, many females in more advanced age groups are presenting for fertility evaluation and treatment.

         This topic will discuss the background, evaluation, and treatment of infertility in females of advancing reproductive age (ARA). While the phrase "advanced maternal age," or AMA, has traditionally been used to describe these patients, we prefer the broader phrase "advancing reproductive age" because it applies to all aspects of reproductive biology and not just maternity. Related topics on infertility in female individuals are presented separately.

         In resource-rich countries, the median age of first birth is rising, with many women not starting a family until after their 35

         birthday
         <sup>

         [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. These trends have been attributed to a number of societal changes, such as increased education for women, higher employment rates, and better access to reliable birth control [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The rising mean age of first pregnancy has been further impacted by declining birth rates in younger individuals combined with rising birth rates in individuals of advancing reproductive age. A report on United States birth data from 2017 to 2018 found declining birth rates for individuals ages 20 to 29 years, stable birth rates for those 30 to 34 years, and a 2 percent increased birth rate in those 35 to 44 years [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The mean age of females having their first child increased from 21.4 years in 1970 to 26.9 in 2018.

         Fertility declines as a female matures, with gradual decline beginning at 32 years of age [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Although exceptions exist, there are few spontaneous conceptions that result in live births in females over 43 years of age [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. This decline in fertility is likely multifactorial. Females are born with a fixed number of oocytes, which decreases with age. The quality of oocytes also falls with age because meiotic errors occur more frequently with increasing age [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. During the menstrual cycle, the process to select a dominant follicle for ovulation does not exclude genetically abnormal oocytes [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Thus, as females age, the number of chromosomally anomalous oocytes ovulated increases, which results in lower fertility and increased risk of miscarriage. In addition to the endogenous accumulation of genetic errors in the oocyte pool over time, other factors such as smoking, other environmental exposures, and certain medical and surgical treatments can compromise oocyte quality, ovarian reserve, and chance for a healthy outcome for pregnancy as females age.
        </p>
        <p>
         This decrease in both oocyte quantity and quality is manifested by a prolongation in the average time for achieving conception [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Fecundability (ie, the probability of achieving a pregnancy in one menstrual cycle) begins to drop significantly in the early to middle 30s with a more rapid decline a few years later (approximately age 37) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Several lines of evidence from both natural and assisted cycles support this finding:

         In historical cohorts in whom deliberate fertility control was rare and conception did not generally precede marriage, the rate of involuntary childlessness in women who married at age 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, and 40 to 44 was 6, 9, 15, 30, and 64 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>

         A large well-designed study reported the probability of clinical pregnancy following intercourse on the most fertile cycle day in women of average fertility age 19 to 26 years, 27 to 34 years, and 35 to 39 years was approximately 50, 40, and 30 percent, respectively, if the male partner was the same age [

         A classic study of women undergoing donor insemination for male factor infertility (azoospermia) found women ≥35 years of age had lower conception rates and required more cycles to achieve conception [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         ]. Women who were 26 to 30 years of age had similar conception rates to women 25 years of age or younger, while women 31 to 35 had an intermediate success rate. Conception rates for women under age 31 years, age 31 to 35 years, and over age 35 years were 74, 62, and 54 percent, respectively.

         Population-based data on outcome of in vitro fertilization using fresh nondonor eggs reported the success rate for females in their late 30s and early 40s was significantly lower than for females under 37 years of age [

By contrast, in individuals who used eggs obtained from healthy, young donors, 58 (fresh oocyte donation) and 47 (frozen oocyte donation) percent of fresh embryo transfers resulted in a live birth, regardless of the age of the recipient.

         <strong>
          Definition
         </strong>
         – Ovarian reserve describes the functional capability of the ovary and includes the number and quality of a woman's remaining oocytes [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. Generally, diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) refers to a woman of reproductive age who has regular menses but reduced fecundity or decreased response to ovarian stimulation compared with age-matched women. However, there are no universally agreed upon criteria for diagnosing DOR. Tests can include assessment of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (both drawn on the third day after start of menses), anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC). In fact, either AMH or AFC can be used alone depending on the experience of the ultrasonographer. Previously a

          clomiphene

         challenge test was done but this is no longer endorsed by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-19
         </a>
         ]. The National Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance System (NASS) also includes reduced ovarian volume related to congenital, medical, surgical or other causes and age greater than 40 years in its definition [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         <strong>
          Limitations
         </strong>
         – Because of the heterogeneity of definitions, it is difficult to provide a prognosis to those who are suspected to have DOR. While these markers may predict decreased ovarian response to ovarian stimulation, they do not predict conception or live birth [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. In a prospective cohort study of women age 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for three months or less, the predicted probability of conception after either 6 or 12 cycles of spontaneous attempts was similar among women with normal and abnormal levels of AMH and FSH [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. This study, however, does not address conception or birth rates for women with a known diagnosis of infertility. For women in this age group with known infertility who are considering in vitro fertilization (IVF), these tests do have some prognostic value [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. A discussion of the specific tests used to assess ovarian reserve is presented separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5445.html" rel="external">
          "Female infertility: Evaluation", section on 'Assessment of ovarian reserve'
         </a>

         </span>
         <strong>
          Our approach
         </strong>
         – In our practice, we define diminished ovarian reserve similarly to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology consensus statement [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. To be diagnosed with poor ovarian response, two of the three must be present: (1) Advanced age (greater than or equal to 40 years old) or any other risk factor, (2) Previous poor response to ovarian stimulation (three or fewer oocytes with IVF), and (3) Any abnormal ovarian reserve test (AFC &lt;5 or AMH &lt;1.1 ng/mL). Because the definition includes results from ovarian stimulation, patients who are over 40 years with abnormal ovarian reserve testing are also considered poor responders.
        </p>
        <p>

         </span>
         <strong>
          Impact of age
         </strong>
         – Even with very sensitive laboratory testing, age is one of the most reliable single prognostic factors for both spontaneous conception and for successful fertility treatments. As an example, even in the setting of normal laboratory testing, women who are over the age of 40 can struggle to conceive and/or deliver a healthy pregnancy. Conversely, younger women who have abnormal testing may have a limited amount of time to complete reproduction but may have better outcomes depending on the cause of the low ovarian reserve. For example, a woman who has had multiple cystectomies for dermoids may have a better prognosis than a woman with low ovarian reserve of a genetic etiology (eg, Turner's syndrome). Thus, women of any age who have abnormal ovarian reserve testing should be expeditious in building their family.

         </span>
         Consistent with the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), we advise initiating an infertility evaluation after six months of attempting conception for women 35 years and older and immediate consultation for those who are attempting at 40 years and older [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, risk factors such as prior pelvic surgery (particularly involving the ovaries or ovarian vasculature), endometriosis, chemotherapy, pelvic infections, and known male factor infertility should prompt consideration of an earlier evaluation. Thus, we consider any woman with risk factors for infertility as given above as needing a timely evaluation. The general evaluation of female infertility is presented separately. (See

        <p>
         In addition to the general infertility evaluation, women ≥40 years usually undergo a

          clomiphene

         citrate challenge test (CCCT). While the utility of the CCCT has been debated, CCCT is still widely used [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. However, the ASRM has stated that its use should be stopped and antral follicle count (AFC) or anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) levels be used instead [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,25
         </a>
         ]. In the presence of an experienced ultrasonographer, AFC should be the primary test used [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. They also caution that while AMH levels and AFC are predictive of oocyte and embryo yield, they are weakly associated with positive pregnancy test.

         Selecting a treatment strategy can be a complex process. In addition to giving thought to test results, there are social and financial considerations. Issues that need to be discussed prior to outlining a treatment plan include the size of family the patient envisions, religious and ethical views on reproduction interventions, and the patient's attitudes about genetic testing of embryos, selective reduction, termination of pregnancy, and the potential for having a child with a chromosomal anomaly such as Down syndrome. As with many treatments that are heavily dependent on the patient's values, there is often more than one option, and the choice is ultimately determined by the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our practice, if there are no medical, financial, or social limitations, we suggest a more aggressive approach with women age 35 years and older who have undergone an infertility evaluation and offer them treatment as follows  (

         For women with adequate ovarian reserve but additional abnormal testing on fertility evaluation (eg, male factor, distal or bilateral tubal factor), we recommend they proceed directly with in vitro fertilization (IVF) as IVF has demonstrated efficacy for these women with a fecundability rate higher than that of natural conception or ovarian stimulation (OS) with intrauterine insemination (IUI) [

         For women with adequate ovarian reserve, otherwise normal fertility evaluation, and no restrictions to IVF, we suggest they proceed with IVF because of the higher pregnancy rates in fewer treatment cycles for IVF compared with initial treatment with OS and IUI [

         For women who decline IVF but have adequate ovarian reserve and otherwise normal fertility evaluation, we offer OS and IUI. For women of advanced reproductive age, the author prefers OS with gonadotropins because gonadotropin treatment results in a higher probability of live birth compared with

          31

         ]. However, gonadotropin treatment also results in more multiple gestations, including triplet and higher gestations. For this reason, other experts prefer CC as the first OS agent and proceed with gonadotropin treatment only if CC/IUI is not successful. This discrepancy reflects the challenge of balancing the desire for live birth with the risk of multiple gestations. Thus, careful counseling is required for women considering OS. We do not use aromatase inhibitors because they have a lower pregnancy rate than either gonadotropin or CC treatment, although some experts will use aromatase inhibitors in women who are unable to proceed with IVF and have not conceived with gonadotropins or CC [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         Given that the pool of healthy oocytes is reduced in females with advancing age, pharmacologic ovarian stimulation (OS) is one approach to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. The principal behind OS in women who are already ovulatory is to medically rescue potentially healthy oocytes that are lost during the ovulatory process to atresia. Although the fraction of chromosomally abnormal oocytes increases with age, OS increases the number of oocytes that are matured and ovulated each month, thus increasing the probability that one of the oocytes released will be healthy and available for fertilization. [

         Risks associated with OS include formation of ovarian cysts that can result in hemorrhage and/or torsion and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), although OHSS is relatively rare in women with limited ovarian reserve. Pregnancy-related risks include ectopic pregnancy and multifetal gestation. Maternal risks of multifetal gestations include hypertension, diabetes, need for cesarean section, and acute fatty liver. Fetal risks include intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and preterm delivery. Selective reduction is an option for those with multifetal gestation, but it is associated with a risk of loss of the entire pregnancy. Each of these issues is presented in more detail separately:

         OS can be monitored by ultrasound to determine the number of follicles developing and by checking estradiol levels. These steps may reduce the risks of multiple pregnancy and possibly lower the risk of OHSS. The goal number of follicles for ovulation is dependent on the clinical situation. In general, the desired number of follicles recruited increases with female reproductive age and is similar to the number of embryos one would suggest being transferred during IVF. After appropriate follicular recruitment, ovulation can be monitored naturally (by monitoring urine luteinizing hormone with commercially available kits) or induced with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Both allow for optimal timing of intercourse. If desired, or if there is evidence of male subfertility, an IUI can be done.

        <p>
         In women with idiopathic infertility age 35 years and younger, OS increases the monthly fecundity from 2 percent per month to a cumulative pregnancy rate of approximately 30 percent over three cycles [

         The basic steps of IVF include hormonally stimulating the ovaries, harvesting oocytes, fertilizing the oocytes, and transferring one or more embryos back into the woman's uterus to implant and develop. As with spontaneous conception, increasing maternal age negatively impacts the live birth rate after embryo transfer when the patient's own eggs are used  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50854" href="/z/d/graphic/50854.html" rel="external">

         ). This effect is particularly pronounced for women age 40 and greater  (

          figure 3
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal is to harvest a larger number of oocytes than would normally be ovulated; these oocytes would otherwise be lost to atresia. Because a larger number of oocytes are available, there are more resultant embryos than during a natural ovulatory cycle. During IVF, these embryos are observed for the first few days of development. There is evidence that the pattern of an embryo's development is correlated with its genetic health and therefore with the probability of implantation and further development [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Thus, IVF results in higher fecundity compared with natural cycles. The risks, benefits, and techniques available for IVF are presented in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7404.html" rel="external">
          "In vitro fertilization: Overview of clinical issues and questions"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For women who desire fertility treatment, at least one trial has reported that pursuing IVF instead of OS results in higher pregnancy rates with fewer treatment cycles [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. However, women with extremely low ovarian reserve are not good candidates for IVF because the potential power of IVF is based on obtaining more oocytes than would normally be ovulated. For women of advanced reproductive age with low anti-müllerian hormone, and low antral follicle count, there can be a failure of multi-follicular recruitment simply because of the low number of antral follicles present. If it is suspected that fewer than four to five oocytes will be obtained, IVF may present a challenge. As an example, a 43-year-old woman would need to generate six to eight oocytes during an IVF cycle in order to have four to five embryos to transfer (anticipated fertilization rate of 60 to 70 percent), providing a 10 percent chance of live birth. In one retrospective cohort study, the live birth rate among all women with poor ovarian response during IVF was only 4 percent [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Thus, in our practice, for women ages 40 and older undergoing an IVF cycle, we convert from IVF to IUI if fewer than three dominant follicles develop, unless there is evidence of severe tubal disease or male factor infertility. Women who are unlikely to have an adequate ovarian response should be counseled about other fertility treatments (eg, donor oocytes) and other family planning options (eg, adoption, foster parenting).
        </p>
        <p>
         The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) has published guidelines for age-appropriate numbers of embryos for transfer based on the age of the woman at the time the oocytes were retrieved  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112844" href="/z/d/graphic/112844.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. These guidelines are based on predicted attrition of the embryo cohort and thus do not predict the outcome for any one woman. While transfer of more embryos increases the probability of pregnancy, the likelihood of multiple gestation also rises with increasing number of embryos transferred. Multifetal gestations can be effectively avoided in women of advanced reproductive age either through preimplantation genetic testing (PGT; resulting in transfer of only genetically euploid embryos) or selective reduction after implantation has occurred. As selective reduction is not acceptable to all women, these options are discussed prior to initiating IVF treatment. (See

         . Results are stratified by patient age because age is one of the single most important prognostic factors. For example, women &lt;35 years old who undergo IVF with their own eggs can expect an approximately 42 percent chance of singleton live birth from an IVF cycle (including all transfers) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. This percentage of live birth with IVF drops with advancing reproductive age: 31 percent for women ages 35 to 37 years, 19 percent for women ages 38 to 40 years, and 9 percent for women ages 41 to 42 years. After age 42, the probability of live birth decreases to less than 3 percent; thus, many clinics will not provide IVF to women using autologous oocytes after the 44
         <sup>
          th

         birthday. Of note, the decreasing live birth rate by age occurs despite more embryos being transferred during IVF cycles in older women. In 2020 in the United States, for women undergoing transfer of fresh embryos from their own eggs, an average of 1.1 embryos were transferred in women under age 35, 1.2 embryos for women ages 35 to 37 years, 1.3 embryos for women ages 38 to 40 years, and 1.6 embryos for women ages 41 to 42 years [

         Women who undergo IVF can have their embryos tested for aneuploidy prior to transfer (preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy [PGT-A], formerly called preimplantation genetic screening [PGS]) or tested for specific genetic diseases (preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders [PGT-M]) or structural rearrangements (PGT-SR). PGT is generally performed at the blastocyst stage. A few cells are removed from the trophectoderm, and the embryo is cryopreserved until a result is available. (See

        <p>
         As the number of aneuploid oocytes increases with advancing maternal age, the opportunity for screening can be considered in females undergoing IVF. However, evolving data have provided conflicting results, and a patient-centric approach is thus required.

         </strong>
         – In a trial of over 200 women ages 38 to 41 years undergoing IVF comparing PGT-A without genetic evaluation prior to blastocyst transfer, the women in the PGT-A group required fewer embryo transfers (68 versus 91 percent), had lower miscarriage rates (3 versus 39 percent), and had higher live birth rates after the first transfer, both per transfer (53 versus 24 percent) and per patient (36 versus 22 percent), compared with the no PGT-A group [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. Although there were no differences in the cumulative delivery rates per patient by six months after study closure, the women in the PGT-A group had a lower mean number of embryo transfers per live birth (1.8 versus 3.7) and a shorter time to pregnancy (7.7 versus 14.9 weeks) compared with the no PGT-A women. Of note, the use of PGT-A improved outcomes despite resulting in a lower number of cycles that reached embryo transfer (69 versus 91 percent for PGT-A and no PGT-A, respectively), mainly because of the large reduction in miscarriage rate for the women in the PGT-A group.

          Our approach

         – In view of the above data, we offer PGT-A to women of all ages who are proceeding with IVF. However, based on age-related risk of aneuploidy, PGT-A is primarily utilized by women of advancing reproductive age who desire single embryo transfer [

          45
         </a>
         ] or by those who wish to avoid an aneuploid pregnancy. We counsel patients that, due to limitations of the technique and potential mosaicism, false-positive and false-negative results are possible. (See

         For women with decreased ovarian reserve, multiple failed cycles, or clinical findings associated with low probability of success, treatment using donor oocytes (either fresh or frozen) results in a live birth rate of approximately 50 percent, which is higher than the live birth rate of women undergoing IVF with fresh nondonor eggs [

          46,47

         As the incidence of diminished ovarian reserve rises with increasing age, the use of donor oocytes to achieve pregnancy also rises as women age.

         Providing public education regarding reproduction and family planning is as important as education on appropriate use of birth control. Studies including both men and women have reported a limited understanding of age-related fertility decline [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51-53
         </a>
         ]. Unfortunately, because social and financial issues are important in family building, discussing timely family building can create a great deal of discomfort for patients as they may feel that they are unable to control many of the factors that influence the time frame in which they can build a family. In a study of reproductive age Japanese men and women comparing fertility education with control interventions, the group who received fertility education reported greater knowledge but also more anxiety. A study of female clinicians revealed that almost half would have made other reproductive choices if they had known more about fertility and infertility earlier in their careers [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An additional challenge is that clinicians often do not have an accurate understanding of age-related fertility changes. As an example, a survey of general gynecologists reported that half of those interviewed thought that the reproductive life span extended up to 50 years of age, that oral contraceptive pill use prolonged the fertility age window, and that assisted reproductive technology was more effective in women of advanced reproductive age than it actually is [
         <a href="#rid55">

         For women who desire pregnancy at some time in the future and are concerned about age-related fertility decline, options for fertility preservation include embryo and oocyte cryopreservation. The risks and benefits of these two therapies are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7429.html" rel="external">
          "Fertility preservation for deferred childbearing for nonmedical indications"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         With both embryo and oocyte cryopreservation, though, patients must understand the medical and social ramifications of delaying family building. As described elsewhere, pregnancy complications rise as women age. Additionally, as medical issues arise as parents age, certain aspects of child care may become more challenging. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/421.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Oocyte cryopreservation to preserve future fertility in women without a medical indication is growing in popularity. Data are accumulating about the expected success rates and safety from frozen oocytes from donor oocyte banks. Because this is still a relatively new technology, the long-term health of offspring conceived with cryopreserved oocytes is not known. For this reason, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) advises careful counseling of women who inquire about this technology about risks, expected success rates, and costs [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. In addition to upfront costs for procedures and medications, one should be made aware of costs of long-term storage and eventual use.

          Fecundability and decline
         </strong>
         – Fecundability (ie, the probability of achieving a pregnancy in one menstrual cycle) begins to decline significantly in the early 30s (approximately age 32 years), with a more rapid decline a few years later (approximately age 37). This decline in fertility is likely multifactorial. Women are born with a fixed number of oocytes, which declines with age, and the quality of oocytes also declines with age because meiotic errors occur more frequently as age rises. (See

In addition, risk factors such as prior pelvic surgery (particularly involving the ovaries or ovarian vasculature), endometriosis, chemotherapy, pelvic infections, and known male factor infertility should prompt consideration of an earlier evaluation.

         For women with adequate ovarian reserve but additional abnormal testing on fertility evaluation (eg, male factor, distal or bilateral tubal factor), we recommend they proceed directly with in vitro fertilization (IVF) (

          Grade 2B

         For women with adequate ovarian reserve and otherwise normal fertility evaluation but who are unable to proceed with or do not desire IVF, an alternate approach is OS and IUI. We prefer OS with gonadotropins because gonadotropin treatment results in a higher probability of success compared with

          Role of expectant management
         </strong>
         – Expectant management is most appropriate for those who do not want to or cannot pursue more aggressive approaches. For women who present with idiopathic infertility who are 35 years and younger, the fecundability plateaus at two percent per month after one year of attempting conception. As women mature, this continues to decline until the 44
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         birthday, when the fecundability is negligible. (See

          Superovulation
         </strong>
         – Given that the pool of healthy oocytes is reduced in women with advancing age, one approach to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy is OS. The principal behind OS in women who are already ovulatory is to medically rescue potentially healthy oocytes that are lost during the ovulatory process to atresia.

         <strong>
          In vitro fertilization
         </strong>
         – The basic steps of IVF include hormonally stimulating the ovaries, harvesting oocytes, fertilizing the oocytes, and transferring one or more embryos back into the woman's uterus to implant and develop. As there are a larger number of oocytes are available, there are more resultant embryos than during a natural ovulatory cycle. (See

          Fertility preservation
