          Cyclophosphamide
         </a>
         (CYC), an alkylating agent, is one of the most potent immunosuppressive therapies available. It has been used extensively to treat severe manifestations of a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Examples include organ-threatening manifestations of rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), polyarteritis nodosa, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; Churg-Strauss syndrome), Behçet syndrome, primary angiitis of the central nervous system, and isolated vasculitic neuropathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a prodrug that is converted to its active form in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in other organs. It can be administered either orally or intravenously. Oral administration usually corresponds to daily dosing and intravenous use to intermittent dosing (eg, every two to four weeks), but some exceptions exist. For example, extremely ill patients who are unable to ingest medications orally may rarely receive daily doses of CYC via the intravenous route at the same doses they would otherwise receive orally.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although very effective, CYC has the potential for devastating toxicity both in the short and long term (even after the medication has been stopped). Concerns about such drug toxicity, especially malignancy, have restricted its use to patients with the most severe disease, or patients who are either intolerant of or unable to adhere to less toxic orally administered immunosuppressive drugs (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9670" href="/z/d/drug information/9670.html" rel="external">
          mycophenolate
         </a>
         mofetil). Newer, short-term protocols using significantly reduced cumulative doses of CYC have reduced, but not eliminated, associated risks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Two major aims govern the use of CYC:

         Discontinuation of CYC as soon as possible and replacement with a less toxic alternative, to minimize the short- and long-term morbidity that often results from CYC itself
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The pharmacology, administration, and monitoring of both oral and intravenous CYC will be reviewed here. The mechanism of action of CYC and other alkylating agents and the general toxicity of these drugs are discussed elsewhere (see

          Absorption, metabolism, and distribution
         </strong>
         – Oral CYC is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. It is metabolized primarily in the liver to 4-hydroxy CYC and aldophosphamide  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ); the latter compound is then converted to the active metabolite phosphoramide mustard and the highly reactive aldehyde, acrolein, which is primarily responsible for bladder and cardiac toxicity. The appearance of these metabolites is delayed after the initial administration. Acrolein can be found in the urine as long as 24 hours after CYC administration. The active metabolites are highly protein-bound and distributed to all tissues including brain and cerebrospinal fluid. The active metabolites are assumed to cross the placenta and are known to be present in breast milk in small amounts [

          Elimination

         CYC, like other alkylating agents, is teratogenic and is generally contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy. In females of childbearing potential, highly effective contraception and appropriate pregnancy testing are indicated. In life-threatening circumstances, particularly in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, the use of CYC may be appropriate for severe disease when an effective and safer alternative is unavailable [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]; however, other agents are typically preferred when possible. Late pregnancy exposure to CYC may not increase the risk for adverse fetal effects. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7998.html" rel="external">
          "Safety of rheumatic disease medication use during pregnancy and lactation"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, because CYC can cause genetic changes in sperm, several groups recommend that males taking CYC avoid conceiving a pregnancy while taking the medication and in the 90 days following treatment. Because CYC may cause long-term azoospermia, sperm cryopreservation is recommended prior to CYC initiation. (See

         Some patients may be too ill to institute contraception at the time of initial drug administration, in which case the issue must be addressed as soon as possible. Even patients with severe rheumatic disease are fertile and can conceive without contraception. Patients should be carefully, clearly, and repeatedly counseled about avoiding conception with appropriate documentation while on CYC. (See

         CYC therapy is associated with both hemorrhagic cystitis and bladder cancer. The major cause of bladder toxicity is the exposure to the metabolite acrolein, which can appear in the urine for up to 24 hours after CYC administration. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pharmacology'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The occurrence of hemorrhagic cystitis increases the risk of developing secondary bladder cancer and is traditionally considered a contraindication to further administration of CYC, particularly if alternative therapies are available. This common practice is not strongly evidence-based and it is arguable that, in the face of severely active disease with a remote or poorly documented history of hemorrhagic cystitis and no equally effective alternate therapy, use of pulse intravenous (but not daily oral) CYC may be reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of bladder toxicity secondary to CYC use is discussed in detail elsewhere (see

         CYC is a prodrug that is converted to its active form (4-hydroxycyclophosphamide) by several cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver, notably CYP2B6. CYP2B6 is highly polymorphic, which may account for some of the pharmacokinetic variability seen among patients [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In addition, other drugs may alter the metabolism of CYC, which may impact the therapeutic effects. Thus, an assessment for drugs that alter the pharmacokinetics or toxic effects of CYC must be considered prior to administration.

         Patients with childbearing potential should receive counseling prior to treatment with CYC about the significant risk of infertility, and of premature menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency [POI]) in females.

         </strong>
         – Cryopreservation of ejaculated semen is usually the preferred fertility-preserving measure in males. This should be completed prior to initiation of CYC as the risk for genetic anomalies within sperm is highest in the one to two weeks following CYC dosing. If the sample is not collected prior to CYC treatment, some recommend delaying sample collection to 6 to 12 months following CYC completion [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21
         </a>
         ]. As many samples as is feasible are collected (typically one to six samples); given current advanced reproductive health technology, even limited sperm numbers with poor morphology can often be used to fertilize an egg. A sperm bank can generally be identified by contacting a local reproductive endocrinologist or urologist, and samples can often be collected by appointment prior to consultation with a specialist. If the patient is not able to ejaculate, urologists can surgically extract sperm. (See

          Females
         </strong>
         – Female patients may be offered cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes, although undergoing egg harvesting is often impractical in seriously ill patients. For female patients who are acutely ill and cannot access, afford, or medically tolerate cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes, the authors of this topic use a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist as an attempt to preserve fertility through ovarian suppression. In such cases, we give a GnRH agonist 10 to 14 days prior to the initial, or more commonly due to the urgency of CYC treatment, 10 to 14 days prior to the second CYC dose. In addition, we offer GnRH agonist to female patients who wish to preserve their own reproductive function and/or wish to not develop premature ovarian insufficiency. Dosing of the GnRH agonist on the day of CYC dosing is avoided because the initial dose of GnRH agonist typically induces an overstimulation of ovarian follicles and may increase the degree of ovarian damage if coincident with CYC dosing. The authors use either 3.75 mg of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9549" href="/z/d/drug information/9549.html" rel="external">
          leuprolide

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Limited data support the use of GnRH agonists in patients with rheumatic disease. A meta-analysis indicated that patients who received GnRH with CYC were more likely to have preservation of ovarian function (94.6 versus 58 percent, odds ratio 10.3, 95% CI 4.8-36.3) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

          23

         (CYC), usually administered intravenously every two or four weeks, is the most common approach for CYC treatment. One of the principal reasons for using intermittent CYC is concern about the long-term complications of daily oral therapy. If administered over the same time period, daily oral dosing results in a several-fold higher cumulative dose of CYC than intermittent CYC. Moreover, with intermittent pulses (eg, monthly), the bladder is exposed to acrolein for only one or two days each cycle, rather than every day.

          Initial dose
         </strong>
         – Selection of the initial dose of CYC for intravenous infusion for treatment of most of the vasculitides is based upon estimated body surface area (BSA) expressed in square meters (m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) and is further adjusted for renal function as estimated by a calculated creatinine clearance, advanced age, and obesity. Studies of and guidelines for intermittent CYC administration in breast cancer and other malignancies support treatment according to total rather than ideal body weight and suggest that this practice does not increase the incidence of infection [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. The authors use total rather than ideal body weight in calculating initial bolus CYC doses for patients who are obese, but they try not to include body weight gained from fluid retention in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Since the ratio of ideal to actual body weight varies up to threefold in rheumatic disease patients, the choice of approach may have important implications.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients with normal renal function, the recommended initial dose of intermittent CYC is typically in the range of 500 to 750 mg/m

Recommendations for dose adjustment in patients with more severe renal dysfunction are varied and not evidence-based. In the setting of renal failure, the extent of dose reduction may also be influenced by the acuteness and severity of the disease. Specific dose adjustments for altered kidney function are provided elsewhere. (See

         <strong>
          Subsequent doses
         </strong>
         – Subsequent doses are adjusted based upon the patient's response to therapy and the nadir of the white blood cell count. The nadir of the lymphocyte count is usually at day 7 and the granulocyte count at day 14 [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. For patients receiving CYC every four weeks, we routinely check complete blood counts (CBC) for the purpose of dose adjustment around day 10 as well as on the day of the subsequent pulse to be sure there was no significant residual bone marrow suppression from the previous dose. Most CYC protocols are administered for three to six months, after which patients are typically transitioned to another immunosuppressive agent with a lower risk of toxicity. As an example, patients receiving a CYC-based induction regimen for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) may be transitioned to

         In patients who are stable, intermittent intravenous CYC can be administered safely in the outpatient setting. Exceptions should be made for patients with heart failure or severe pulmonary hypertension (who may not tolerate the required pretreatment hydration well), those with severe nephrotic syndrome (who may be unable to maintain brisk urine outputs), and those who, for reasons of frailty, may tolerate even moderate nausea poorly. The aggressive use of diuretics and bladder irrigation through three-way Foley catheters are more feasible in inpatients. Even in the outpatient setting, however, intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and

          Antiemetics

Adequate prevention of nausea and vomiting during and for the first 24 to 48 hours after the administration of the first dose of intravenous CYC helps prevent anticipatory emesis, which is a conditioned response of developing nausea during chemotherapy that can persist with subsequent treatments.

Unfortunately, many patients on CYC have diseases associated with decreased renal function. In such settings, the dose of CYC must be modified  (

         Resistant disease – In patients with resistant disease, cautious upward titration of CYC dose may be attempted. Clinicians must be as certain as possible that disease "refractoriness" is truly due to active disease rather than to irreversible damage (the latter will not respond to more CYC) or poor adherence (where increasing the dose may lead to unexpected toxicity). In prescribing CYC, the authors do not exceed 2.5 mg/kg per day of CYC; higher doses are associated with substantially increased risks of hematologic toxicity, opportunistic infections, and drug-induced cystitis.

         A moderate quantity of CYC is removed from circulation at dialysis. Thus, a supplemental dose of CYC should be given after a hemodialysis session if the dialysis patient received their usual daily dose of CYC prior to the session. The supplemental dose is generally equal to 50 percent of their usual daily dose.

         – Complete blood counts (CBC) with differential should be obtained frequently. As an example, we repeat cell counts and differential every two weeks for as long as the patient is on CYC.

         should lead to dose reductions, because lower counts are associated with a markedly increased risk of opportunistic infection. (By contrast, isolated lymphopenia, an anticipated effect although not a goal of therapy, does not indicate a need for altering the CYC dose.)

Declines in renal function may necessitate adjustment of the CYC dose. (See

          Urinalysis
         </strong>
         – CYC-treated patients should have urinalyses every month while on CYC, and at least annually after its discontinuation. The presence of blood on dipstick should prompt a microscopic examination of the urine sediment. Hematuria may signal drug-induced cystitis, premalignant changes in the bladder epithelium, the development of frank bladder cancer, or the occurrence (or recurrence) of glomerulonephritis. In the absence of clinical findings that strongly suggest glomerulonephritis (eg, significant new/increasing proteinuria, red blood cell casts, and a rising serum creatinine), cystoscopy should be performed promptly as the next test in the evaluation of hematuria. Failure to promptly evaluate significant hematuria can lead to future uncertainty as to whether hemorrhagic cystitis, a contraindication to further CYC administration, has occurred. (See

         Interpreting the presence of hematuria is clearly more difficult in patients with systemic lupus or vasculitis who have hematuria at baseline because of renal involvement. In this setting, a clue to the development of bladder toxicity is an increase in hematuria in the absence of cellular casts, dysmorphic cells on urinalysis, or other signs of active systemic disease and without laboratory evidence of worsening renal function.

         (CYC), an alkylating agent, is one of the most potent immunosuppressive therapies available. Although very effective, CYC has the potential for devastating toxicity both in the short and long term. Two major aims in the use of CYC are prompt control of the underlying disease and discontinuation of the medication as soon as possible, replacing it with a less toxic alternative to minimize the short- and long-term morbidity that often results from CYC itself.

          Pharmacology
         </strong>
         – The metabolism and excretion of CYC are important issues related to its toxicity. The active metabolites are highly protein-bound and distributed to all tissues. Both active and inactive metabolites are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with elimination complete by 48 hours, with the potential for bladder toxicity leading to cancer. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pharmacology'

          Intermittent CYC administration
         </strong>
         – Intermittent CYC, usually administered intravenously every two or four weeks, is the most commonly used form of CYC in the treatment of systemic rheumatic diseases. One of the principal reasons for using intermittent CYC is concern about the long-term complications of daily oral therapy. Intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9615" href="/z/d/drug information/9615.html" rel="external">
          Mesna
         </a>
         may be used to prevent toxicities commonly associated with CYC. Selection of the initial dose of CYC for intravenous infusion should be adjusted for renal failure. Subsequent intravenous doses are further adjusted based upon the patient's response to therapy and the nadir of the white blood cell count. (See
         <a class="local">

          Oral CYC administration
         </strong>
         – Daily oral CYC remains an important treatment for life-threatening manifestations of systemic rheumatic diseases, but it has been largely replaced by the use of intermittent CYC. The daily dose should be modified in patients with diminished or improving renal function or on hemodialysis, with resistant disease, and in the setting of obesity. Regular and frequent laboratory evaluations are required to screen for bone marrow toxicity, monitor renal function, and avoid major drug-induced bladder complications. (See
