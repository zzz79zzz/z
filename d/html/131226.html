As patients progress, increasing respiratory support is required, which often necessitates intensive care unit level of care, depending on the facility and patient characteristics. Respiratory support includes oxygenation with low-flow and high-flow systems, noninvasive ventilation, and the use of other adjunctive therapies (eg, nebulized medications) and rescue therapies (eg, prone positioning). While some patients improve and respiratory support can be de-escalated, a proportion continue to deteriorate, and a decision needs to be made regarding intubation and mechanical ventilation.</p><p>This topic discusses noninvasive respiratory support of the critically ill COVID-19 patient as well as the timing and procedure of intubation. Clinical features of the critically ill adult with COVID-19 and management of the hospitalized and the intubated patient with COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128323.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical features"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127429.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management in hospitalized adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127419.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of the intubated adult"</a>.) <span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-128064">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-128064" href="/pathway/128064?topicRef=131226&amp;source=see_link">COVID-19: Anticoagulation in adults with COVID-19</a>.)</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2516258117"><span class="h1">GENERAL ISSUES FOR ALL HYPOXEMIC PATIENTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1150861762"><span class="h2">Awake pronation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For hospitalized patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 who are receiving oxygen or noninvasive modalities of support (including low-flow oxygen, high-flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannulae [HFNC], or noninvasive ventilation [NIV]), we suggest attempting awake/nonsedated prone positioning. While an optimally beneficial amount of time has not been established, we typically encourage at least 6 to 8 hours prone in a 24-hour period in the appropriate patient. We encourage adherence but recognize that some patients have difficulty with this maneuver because of personal discomfort or preference (eg, face, neck, or arm pain; cannot fall asleep prone) or discomfort from external hardware (eg, mask and tubing). Patients with COVID-19 who have hypoxemic respiratory failure due to other conditions do not necessarily need to undergo pronation (eg, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism). Contraindications to pronation (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68536" href="/z/d/graphic/68536.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1630.html" rel="external">"Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome", section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>Similar to ventilated patients, we monitor for any adverse effects of pronation (eg, pressure ulcers, retinal damage), although we typically observe fewer complications in those who undergo self-pronation presumably because they can self-adjust for ongoing comfort  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68536" href="/z/d/graphic/68536.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1630.html" rel="external">"Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome", section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>The rationale for this approach is based on limited direct evidence in patients with COVID-19 that demonstrates transient improvement in oxygenation with this strategy [<a href="#rid1">1-18</a>] and indirect evidence of its efficacy in ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Consistent between trials is that awake pronation has not yet been shown to reduce mortality. However, data on its impact on intubation rates are conflicting but on balance suggest benefit. Future data are warranted to identify the optimal indications for and duration of pronation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1630.html" rel="external">"Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127419.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of the intubated adult", section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation in the prone position'</a>.)</p><p>Several trials support awake pronation as an intervention to improve oxygenation and decrease intubation [<a href="#rid8">8,9,14,19-22</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Several meta-analyses support awake pronation.

Although a mortality benefit was suggested, the wide confidence interval limits reduce the certainty of this benefit (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73-1.13).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a meta-analysis of 29 trials (10 of which were randomized trials), awake pronation reduced the need for intubation compared with supination (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.98), particularly among those who needed advanced respiratory support (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.97) or ICU admission (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.97) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This meta-analysis was largely influenced by one meta-trial of six randomized open-label trials [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. For the latter trial, several factors may have reduced the certainty of the effect, including issues such as stopping the trial early for benefit and the open-label nature of the study (which could have affected the threshold for intubation).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A randomized trial of 430 patients with COVID-19 receiving HFNC found a similar effect of prone positioning on intubation rates (30 versus 43 percent; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.90) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]; features associated with intubation despite prone positioning included duration of awake pronation &lt;7.7 hours, respiratory rate ≥25 breaths per minute (bpm) at enrollment, and a decrease in respiratory rate &lt;3 bpm after the awake pronation session.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Several prospective studies have consistently shown improved oxygenation parameters in response to awake pronation that is not always sustained upon resupination [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Most patients tolerated awake pronation for three hours or more (eg, two-thirds).</p><p></p><p>However, some trials [<a href="#rid18">18,24</a>] have not supported awake pronation as a tool to reduce intubation rates [<a href="#rid18">18,21,24</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one trial of 501 patients with COVID-19-associated hypoxemia who were assigned to awake pronation or usual care based upon an even or odd medical record number, there was no difference between groups in progression to mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality at 14 or 28 days [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Pronation was associated with higher levels of oxygen support on day 5, although the clinical significance of this is uncertain given the lack of difference at subsequent timepoints.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another randomized open-label trial of 400 patients with COVID-19 who were receiving oxygen at an FiO<sub>2</sub> ≥0.4 or NIV, awake pronation did not significantly reduce the rate of intubation at 30 days compared with those who did not undergo proning (34 versus 41 percent; hazard ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.59-1.12) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Similarly, awake pronation had no impact on mortality, ventilator-free days, or ICU-free days. However, the effect estimates were imprecise suggesting that the possibility of benefit is not ruled out.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H301509741"><span class="h2">Oxygenation targets</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The World Health Organization suggests titrating oxygen to a target peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of ≥94 percent during initial resuscitation and ≥90 percent for maintenance oxygenation. For most patients, we prefer the lowest possible FiO<sub>2</sub> necessary to meet oxygenation goals, ideally targeting an SpO<sub>2</sub> between 90 and 96 percent, if feasible. Hyperoxia should be avoided. If a higher SpO<sub>2</sub> is achieved during initial resuscitation and stabilization, supplemental oxygen should be weaned as soon as is safe to avoid prolonged hyperoxia. Individualization of the goal is important, as some patients may warrant a lower target (eg, patients with a concomitant acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) and others may warrant a higher target (eg, pregnancy). Data that support this target range are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit", section on 'Fraction of inspired oxygen'</a>.)</p><p>Using SpO<sub>2 </sub>targets in patients with darkly pigmented skin warrants special attention because of the potential for pulse oximetry to overestimate arterial oxygenation and fail to identify hypoxemia in such individuals [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have highlighted these concerns when risk-stratifying patients with COVID-19 [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. We believe that in patients with darkly pigmented skin who have COVID-19, it is prudent to correlate the SpO<sub>2</sub> value with a saturation value derived from an arterial blood gas to ensure accuracy of the SpO<sub>2</sub> measurement. Of note, the SpO<sub>2</sub> to arterial oxygen saturation correlation may not be fixed over time in a given patient; thus, repeat correlation checks may be indicated, especially in acute situations, or at some regular interval. The potential for such discrepancy was illustrated by an analysis of over 1200 patients with COVID-19 who had oxygen saturation levels that were concurrently measured by pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Pulse oximetry overestimated arterial oxygen saturation in Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients compared with White patients. Occult hypoxemia occurred in approximately one-third of Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients compared with 17 percent of White patients. Importantly, predicted overestimation of arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was associated with both a failure to identify Black and Hispanic patients who were qualified to receive COVID-19 therapy, and a delay in initiation of COVID-19-related therapy. Another study showed similar results [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].  (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1612.html" rel="external">"Pulse oximetry", section on 'Skin pigmentation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1995523367"><span class="h2">Precautions with aerosol-generating procedures</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1968707148"><span class="h3">Nebulized medications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nebulizers are associated with aerosolization and potentially increase the risk of viral transmission. In spontaneously breathing patients with suspected or documented COVID-19, nebulized bronchodilator therapy should therefore be reserved for those with clear indications (eg, acute bronchospasm in the setting of asthma or COPD exacerbation; hypertonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>, antibiotics, or DNase for cystic fibrosis).</p><p>Interventions that may decrease the risk of virus spread (eg, use of metered-dose inhalers, use of a mouthpiece rather than a mask, breath-synchronized nebulizer) are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/552.html" rel="external">"Delivery of inhaled medication in adults", section on 'Infection control'</a>.)</p><p>If nebulized therapy is used, patients should be in an airborne infection isolation room, health care workers should use contact and airborne precautions, and all nonessential personnel should leave the room during nebulization. Some experts also suggest not re-entering the room for two to three hours following nebulizer administration, unless clinically necessary.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4400.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications", section on 'Bronchoscopy in COVID-19 patients'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127419.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of the intubated adult", section on 'Bronchoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>If any of these therapies are performed, similar personal protective equipment to that described for nebulizer therapy should be used. (See <a class="local">'Nebulized medications'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3717073383"><span class="h1">PATIENTS WITH MINIMAL OXYGEN NEEDS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3703120153"><span class="h2">Low-flow oxygen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19, supplemental oxygenation with a low-flow system (ie, up to 6 L/minute) via nasal cannulae is appropriate as an initial strategy. The degree of viral aerosolization at low-flow rates is unknown but likely minimal. (See <a class="local">'Oxygenation targets'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6394.html" rel="external">"Continuous oxygen delivery systems for the acute care of infants, children, and adults"</a>.)</p><p>As flow increases, the risk of viral aerosolization may increase, potentially contaminating the surrounding environment and staff. However, the flow rate at which aerosolization risk increases is unknown. To address this issue, we typically have patients who wear nasal cannulae, low or high flow, also wear a droplet mask, especially during transport or when staff are in the room. Data to support this practice are largely non-peer-reviewed or derived from simulation experiments but make practical sense as a maneuver to reduce the infectious risk associated with potential aerosolization [<a href="#rid30">30-32</a>]. Additional information on infection precautions while using oxygen is provided below. (See <a class="local">'Infection control precautions for noninvasive modalities'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4011842544"><span class="h1">PATIENTS WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCED RESPIRATORY SUPPORT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once oxygen requirements start to increase over 6 to 15 L/minute or breathing becomes labored, options are high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) and oxygen delivered via a noninvasive ventilation (NIV) device. Among these options, we prefer an initial trial of HFNC or NIV; either or both modalities can be trialed, unless there is a separate indication for one specific modality (eg, concomitant acute hypercapnia or heart failure requiring bilevel or continuous positive airway pressure, respectively). (See <a class="local">'Choosing oxygen via high-flow nasal cannulae versus noninvasive ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1108165678"><span class="h2">Noninvasive modalities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and higher oxygen needs than low-flow oxygen can provide, we suggest that noninvasive modalities be used. We believe that the decision to initiate noninvasive modalities, either HFNC or NIV, should be made by balancing the risks to and benefits for the patient, the risk of exposure to health care workers, best use of resources, and patient tolerance [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Both modalities, HFNC and NIV, have been used variably in critically ill patients with COVID-19. In retrospective cohorts, rates for HFNC use ranged from 14 to 63 percent, while 11 to 56 percent were treated with NIV [<a href="#rid34">34-37</a>]. While these modalities improve oxygenation and/or dyspnea, data demonstrating success at preventing progression to intubation have notable limitations and clear mortality reductions have not been found. However, reduced rates of mechanical ventilation have been reported after shifting to higher intubation thresholds during the pandemic, suggesting that some patients may not proceed to intubation if appropriately supported with noninvasive methods [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Timing'</a> below.)</p><p>Support for advancing to HFNC in patients with increasing oxygen needs is derived from randomized trials that have demonstrated decreased intubation rates when compared with low-flow oxygen, even without mortality reductions and in the setting of a low-risk intervention [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a randomized trial of 220 patients with COVID-19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, intubation rates were lower with oxygen delivery through HFNC compared with standard low-flow delivery, with each adjusted to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) ≥92 percent (43 versus 51 percent; hazard ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.96; number needed to treat 7) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. HFNC also reduced the time to clinical recovery (11 versus 14 days), but the mortality difference was not statistically significant (8 versus 16 percent). However, the study excluded a number of medical comorbidities (eg, hypercapnia, heart failure, advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, demyelinating disease, advanced cirrhosis, or imminent death), limiting interpretation of the trial.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another open-label randomized trial of 711 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 reported lower intubation rates with HFNC compared with standard low-flow oxygen delivered through a nonrebreather mask (45 versus 53 percent), although the partial arterial oxygen tension was lower in the HFNC group (75 versus 80 mmHg) [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].

The optimal duration of proning is uncertain, but we encourage patients to spend as much time as is feasible (eg, 6 to 8 hours in a 24-hour period). (See <a class="local">'Awake pronation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Oxygen targets</strong> – For most patients, we use the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) necessary to meet oxygenation goals. The ideal goal is uncertain, but we typically target a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) between 90 and 96 percent. Hyperoxia should be avoided. In patients with darkly pigmented skin, it is prudent to correlate SpO<sub>2</sub> with arterial blood gas (ABG) results to avoid occult hypoxemia. (See <a class="local">'Oxygenation targets'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1653.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Ventilator management strategies for adults", section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation: Initial settings'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit", section on 'Fraction of inspired oxygen'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with low oxygen requirements (ie, &lt;6 L/minute)</strong> – Supplemental oxygenation with a low-flow system via nasal cannulae is generally sufficient. We typically apply a droplet mask, especially during transport or when staff are in the room to reduce aerosolization. (See <a class="local">'Patients with minimal oxygen needs'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6394.html" rel="external">"Continuous oxygen delivery systems for the acute care of infants, children, and adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with more advanced respiratory needs</strong> – Options for patients who need more advanced support than low-flow oxygen, but who do not yet require intubation, include noninvasive ventilation (NIV, including continuous positive airway and bilevel positive airway ventilation) and high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC). (See <a class="local">'Patients with requirements for advanced respiratory support'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Choice between NIV and HFNC</strong> – The choice between NIV and HFNC is based largely upon the patient's comorbidities and the tolerability of the device. In practice, either or both modalities can be trialed, unless there is a separate indication for one specific modality (eg, concomitant acute hypercapnia or heart failure requiring bilevel or continuous positive airway pressure, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>NIV via an oronasal or full facemask (with a good seal) is appropriate if the patient has a comorbidity for which there is proven efficacy of NIV (eg, acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, underlying sleep-disordered breathing [eg, obstructive sleep apnea or obesity hypoventilation], or respiratory muscle weakness), as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1636.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications", section on 'Patients likely to benefit'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>In the absence of such comorbidities, either modality is acceptable. The tolerability of the device and patient comfort are often the determining factors. In practice, either or both modalities can be trialed. Studies involving patients with COVID-19 and patients with non-COVID-19-related acute hypoxic respiratory failure suggest that compared with low-flow oxygen, noninvasive respiratory support (including HFNC, continuous positive airway pressure, and bilevel positive airway pressure) reduces intubation rates and may improve mortality. The available clinical trial data do not clearly demonstrate a benefit of one modality over the other. (See <a class="local">'Choosing oxygen via high-flow nasal cannulae versus noninvasive ventilation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114077.html" rel="external">"Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications", section on 'Medical patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1636.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications", section on 'Patients less likely to benefit'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Monitoring and duration</strong> – Vigilant monitoring for progression during HFNC or NIV use is warranted. We evaluate patients every one to two hours and obtain an ABG after the first two hours to ensure efficacy and safe ventilation. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring on noninvasive modalities'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">There is no set duration for a trial period of either modality. In our experience, some patients deteriorate quickly (hours to a few days), while others tolerate noninvasive support for prolonged periods (eg, one week to 10 days). (See <a class="local">'Course and duration'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Precautions</strong> – As potentially aerosol-generating therapies, HFNC and NIV warrant airborne in addition to standard precautions (ie, airborne infection isolation room [negative pressure room] and full personal protective equipment [PPE]), although high-quality data are scarce. With HFNC, we use the lowest effective flow rate (eg, 20 L/minute and 0.4 FiO<sub>2</sub>). For NIV, we use an oronasal or full facemask with a good seal and generally start with continuous positive airway pressure rather than other modes (eg, bilevel positive airway pressure). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection"</a> and <a class="local">'Infection control precautions for noninvasive modalities'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The decision to intubate</strong> – Determining when patients are failing noninvasive modalities and require intubation involves judgement, and the decision should be individualized. Intubation should <strong>not</strong> be routinely delayed until the patient has features of impending respiratory arrest or is on maximum noninvasive support, since this is potentially harmful to both the patient and health care workers. In general, we use the following criteria to indicate a high risk of requiring intubation (see <a class="local">'The decision to intubate'</a> above and <a class="local">'Timing'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rapid progression over hours</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Persistent need for high flows (eg, &gt;60 L/minute) and FiO<sub>2</sub> (eg, &gt;0.6)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evolving hypercapnia, increasing work of breathing, decreasing tidal volume, worsening mental status, increasing duration and depth of desaturations</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hemodynamic instability or multiorgan failure</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Intubation is a high-risk procedure for viral aerosolization.
