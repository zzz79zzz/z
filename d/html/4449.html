In most of these cases, labor and delivery results in good outcomes in the absence of physician/midwife intervention or a traditional delivery site [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>This topic is intended for health care providers (eg, emergency department, medical or surgical hospital unit) who do not perform obstetric deliveries as part of their usual practice. It will review the key points for assisting hospitalized patients in the process of imminently giving birth at a location other than the labor and delivery unit. One emergency department identified the following three issues as their main problematic areas related to these births: availability of accessible appropriate equipment; appropriate training for the clinical care of these patients before, during, and after a vaginal birth; and knowledge of the specialized documentation of the labor and delivery process, including disposition documentation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>Related topics on labor and delivery are presented in detail elsewhere. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4445.html" rel="external">"Labor and delivery: Management of the normal first stage"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134953.html" rel="external">"Labor and delivery: Management of the normal second stage"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134954.html" rel="external">"Labor and delivery: Management of the normal third stage after vaginal birth"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17178.html" rel="external">"Inter-facility maternal transport"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5068.html" rel="external">"Overview of the routine management of the healthy newborn infant"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. We encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender-expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18203034"><span class="h1">DEFINITION AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term precipitate or precipitous labor has been defined as a labor that lasts no more than three hours from onset of regular contractions to delivery [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Precipitous delivery is generally thought to result from abnormally low resistance of the birth canal, abnormally strong uterine contractions, lack of awareness of painful contractions, or some combination of these [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3368555112"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The major risk factors for precipitous birth appear to be placental abruption, multiparity, and very small infant size, but data are inconsistent [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT AND PREPARATION</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Call for help</strong> – There are two patients in an obstetric delivery. Ideally, an obstetric provider (eg, obstetrician, midwife, family practitioner) should be available for the mother, and a pediatric provider (eg, pediatrician, pediatric nurse practitioner, family practitioner) should be available for the infant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rapid obstetric assessment</strong> – Quickly assess the woman's delivery history, medical history, and gestational age. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Gravidity and parity</strong> – Gravidity refers to the number of prior pregnancies regardless of outcome, while parity refers to the number of births (preterm and term live births and stillbirths) but not miscarriages, pregnancy terminations, or ectopic pregnancies. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Women who have had a prior vaginal birth or have had a prior precipitous birth tend to have more rapid labors than women who have not had a prior vaginal birth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Gestational age</strong> – Most women, and their partners, will know their estimated due date (EDD) and the current gestational age of the pregnancy. If only the EDD is known, the current gestational age can be calculated (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13503.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). If only the date of the last menstrual cycle is available, the EDD and current gestational age can be calculated (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13505.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For those who do not know the EDD or are unable to communicate (eg, intoxicated), palpate the top of the uterine fundus. After 20 weeks of gestation, measuring the distance from the symphysis pubis to the top of the uterus (fundus) in centimeters crudely corresponds with the week of gestation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115429" href="/d/graphic/115429.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Leiomyoma, twins, or higher-order multiple gestations; other factors affecting uterine size (eg, abnormal amniotic fluid volume); and obesity can reduce the diagnostic performance of physical examination-based gestational age assessment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5391.html" rel="external">"Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Gestational age impacts the type of pediatric care that may be required. A birth before 37 weeks of gestation is considered preterm; these newborns are at increased risk of morbidity, particularly respiratory problems and difficulty maintaining their temperature. Most preterm infants born ≥26 and &lt;37 weeks have a high likelihood of survival, while virtually no infant born &lt;22 weeks will survive. From 22 to 25 weeks of gestation, chances of survival rapidly increase, and morbidity decreases with each additional week of gestation, as long as appropriate neonatal care is available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4965.html" rel="external">"Overview of short-term complications in preterm infants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13511.html" rel="external">"Periviable birth (limit of viability)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Obstetric and medical problems</strong> – Ask about obstetric issues, such as twin gestation, previous cesarean birth, fetal anomalies, maternal bleeding diathesis, or other medical conditions that may complicate delivery, the immediate maternal postpartum course, or immediate newborn care. For example, women with a previous cesarean birth are at risk for uterine rupture during labor, and women with a bleeding diathesis are at risk for postpartum hemorrhage, both of which can be life-threatening complications.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Preeclampsia</strong> – Women with preeclampsia with severe features  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975" href="/d/graphic/76975.html" rel="external">table 1B</a>) are at risk for developing seizures (eclampsia), which should be prevented by administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9585" href="/d/drug information/9585.html" rel="external">magnesium sulfate</a> intravenously or intramuscularly. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The most common <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9585" href="/d/drug information/9585.html" rel="external">magnesium sulfate</a> regimen in patients with normal kidney function is:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Intravenous</strong> – Loading dose 4 to 6 g of a 10% solution intravenously over 15 to 20 minutes followed by 1 to 2 g/hour as a continuous infusion </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Intramuscular</strong> – If intravenous access is not available, an alternative regimen is 5 g of a 50% solution intramuscularly into each buttock (total of 10 g) followed by 5 g intramuscularly every four hours (may be mixed with 1 mL of xylocaine 2% solution to reduce pain). Intramuscular administration results in more fluctuation in magnesium levels and is associated with more side effects, particularly pain at the injection site. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/139247.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Intrapartum and postpartum management and long-term prognosis", section on 'Seizure prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Status of fetal membranes</strong> – Determine if and when the fetal membranes ("bag of waters") ruptured (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6754.html" rel="external">"Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation and diagnosis'</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">While this information may not change the immediate care at the time of a precipitous birth, it will be important for the clinicians who assume care of the mother and baby. For example, rupture of membranes for ≥18 hours before delivery is a risk factor for early onset Group<em> B Streptococcus </em>infection in the newborn. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5961.html" rel="external">"Group B streptococcal infection in neonates and young infants"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – A pelvic examination is performed to determine the presenting fetal part and whether birth is imminent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Is the woman voluntarily pushing with her contractions? If so, she is more likely to be in the second stage of labor (cervix fully dilated) and about to give birth. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4464.html" rel="external">"Labor: Overview of normal and abnormal progression", section on 'Definitions for the stages and phases of labor'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Is the fetus visible and beginning to emerge from the vagina (ie, crowning)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51141" href="/d/graphic/51141.html" rel="external">picture 1A</a>)? If so, birth is imminent, particularly if the fetus is visible when the woman is not pushing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If the fetus is not visible, imminent birth is still likely if she wants to bear down/push or states she "can feel the baby coming" and the perineum distends with contractions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The median second stage of labor (time from full cervical dilation to birth) is approximately 30 minutes in nulliparous women (no previous birth) and 12 minutes in multiparous women (one or more previous births). If contractions are more than two minutes apart, there may be time to transport the mother to Labor and Delivery for delivery under more controlled conditions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>What is the presenting part? On transvaginal examination at full dilation, the hard rounded skull of a cephalic presentation can be distinguished from the soft irregular buttocks (and sometimes feet) of the breech presentation. The anal orifice is often also palpable with breech presentation. If ultrasound is available, presentation can be confirmed by imaging, if uncertain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If a fluid-filled amniotic sac is visible, leave it alone until it ruptures naturally. If a foot is visible, do not pull on it. Vaginal breech delivery is presented in detail separately, but a critical point is to allow the baby in breech presentation to delivery naturally, without traction by the provider. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5384.html" rel="external">"Delivery of the singleton fetus in breech presentation"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prepare the woman and immediate area for delivery</strong> – Ideally, clean absorbent materials are placed under the mother to collect blood and body fluids eliminated during the birth process. Providers should wear personal protective equipment if available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Utilize available equipment</strong> – If there is time and the equipment is available, maternal temperature and blood pressure should be checked. Fever suggests chorioamnionitis. Hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg) is the key finding for preeclampsia. Preeclampsia can progress to eclampsia (ie, seizures) and can be associated with life-threatening complications (eg, hepatic rupture, pulmonary edema, stroke, kidney failure)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79977 graphicRef76975" href="/d/graphic/79977.html" rel="external">table 1A-B</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4453.html" rel="external">"Intrapartum fever"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6762.html" rel="external">"Clinical chorioamnionitis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6814.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6825.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Antepartum management and timing of delivery"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1662.html" rel="external">"Eclampsia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The fetal heart rate can be checked with a Doppler device, by auscultation with a stethoscope, or with use of a portable ultrasound unit, if available. A normal fetal heart rate is between 110 and 160 beats per minute. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/418.html" rel="external">"Intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring: Overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16663.html" rel="external">"Intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Position the mother for giving birth</strong> – Position the mother in a semi-sitting position, with hips flexed and abducted, and knees flexed (lithotomy position)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73352" href="/d/graphic/73352.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In the absence of a birthing bed or table with stirrups, it is easier to assist birth of the baby if pillows, a stack of towels, or an upside-down bedpan is placed under the mother's hips and back to raise the perineum above the surface of the bed/stretcher. This provides additional room to maneuver when guiding the infant posteriorly to ease his/her shoulder under the symphysis pubis. Alternatively, the mother may lie on her side with her leg held up by a support person  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55925" href="/d/graphic/55925.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For offsite deliveries, readily available materials can be used to aid a delivery. </p><p>If available, the following supplies make up a standard delivery kit:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antibacterial cleansers to wash your hands and the mother's perineum</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gauze sponges</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sterile gloves and gowns</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clean cloth or gauze sponges to wipe infant's nose and mouth</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Two sterile clamps to clamp the umbilical cord</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sterile scissors or knife to cut the umbilical cord between the clamps</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A red-top tube to collect fetal blood from the placental end of the cut umbilical cord</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clean towels, sheets, and/or blankets to dry and swaddle the infant</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blankets to keep the mother warm</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suitable containers for the placenta and wet, bloody clothing and sheets</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A diaper</p><p></p><p>In addition, appropriate equipment for neonatal resuscitation (eg, suction device, newborn-sized endotracheal tubes, and intubation blades) is desirable. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">PROCEDURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The key points for performing an emergency birth are presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70178" href="/d/graphic/70178.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and discussed in the following sections. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2543239745"><span class="h2">Images</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The birth process (called the cardinal movements of labor) is illustrated in the diagrams  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71178" href="/d/graphic/71178.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65965" href="/d/graphic/65965.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) and photographs  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51141 graphicRef64939 graphicRef76754 graphicRef57824 graphicRef65504 graphicRef75270" href="/d/graphic/51141.html" rel="external">picture 1A-F</a>). </p><p>Several videos that show how to deliver a baby are available online at no cost. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Intravenous access</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If available, insert a large bore intravenous catheter (14 or 16 gauge) into an arm vein and draw a blood sample to have a clot for blood type and antibody screen if the patient hemorrhages and needs a transfusion.

The goal is to control, not restrain, fetal expulsion. Ask her to pant or make only modest expulsive efforts in an attempt to achieve a controlled birth (ie, gradual expulsion of the fetus), which is less likely to cause maternal or fetal trauma than an uncontrolled birth.

The movement of the fetus through and out of the vagina are presented in the image  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71178" href="/d/graphic/71178.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Episiotomy is not performed routinely. It is performed in approximately 10 percent of deliveries in the US [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>], when the clinician believes enlarging the birth outlet to facilitate delivery of the fetus will benefit the mother or baby and warrants maternal exposure to the potential adverse outcomes associated with the procedure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4478.html" rel="external">"Approach to episiotomy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Delivery of the head</strong> – One option is to place one hand on the crowning portion of the fetal head and apply light pressure to maintain the head in a flexed position (ie, hands-on approach). Use the other hand to ease the perineum over the fetal face (the most common fetal position at expulsion is facing the mother's back)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64939" href="/d/graphic/64939.html" rel="external">picture 1B</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76754" href="/d/graphic/76754.html" rel="external">picture 1C</a>). Do not pull on the head; let the mother gradually push it into your hands. Her strong urge to bear down will abate somewhat when the head is out. If the membranes still cover the baby's head, use a clamp, fingers, or forceps to rupture them.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An alternative approach is to avoid touching the perineum or fetus until the head is born (ie, hands-off approach). Neither approach has been proven to be superior [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Restitution of the head</strong> – After the infant's head has delivered, it will usually rotate to the side  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57824" href="/d/graphic/57824.html" rel="external">picture 1D</a>). Feel for a loop of umbilical cord around the baby's neck. If present, gently slip it over the head. If it resists, it may be possible to slip it caudally over the shoulders and deliver the body through the loop. If these maneuvers are unsuccessful and leaving the cord alone is not feasible, doubly clamp and cut the cord. It is important not to rupture or avulse the cord because serious fetal/neonatal bleeding can occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14181.html" rel="external">"Nuchal cord", section on 'Delivery'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Delivery of the shoulders</strong> – With the next push, guide the head slightly downward so that the anterior shoulder slips under the symphysis pubis and delivers, then guide the head slightly upward to deliver the posterior shoulder over, rather than through, the perineum  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65504" href="/d/graphic/65504.html" rel="external">picture 1E</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the shoulders do not deliver easily, have your assistant or the mother sharply flex her thighs back against her abdomen  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74910" href="/d/graphic/74910.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>); this opens the pelvis to its maximum dimension. Ask her to push again. Do not pull on the head in an attempt to extract the baby if it does not slide out of the vagina easily. Advanced maneuvers for management of shoulder dystocia (eg, suprapubic [not fundal] pressure to disimpact the anterior shoulder, delivery of the posterior arm, rotational maneuvers) are described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5397.html" rel="external">"Shoulder dystocia: Intrapartum diagnosis, management, and outcome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Delivery of the body</strong> – Once both shoulders have delivered, the rest of the baby usually immediately follows  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75270" href="/d/graphic/75270.html" rel="external">picture 1F</a>). Document the time of expulsion. Use your hands to hold onto the back of the head and buttocks of the baby securely as it delivers. The baby can then be cradled against your body, with the back of its head in your cupped hand and its body supported by your forearm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As soon as possible, place the baby on the mother's chest or upper abdomen (skin to skin) where she can cradle it and keep it warm. The infant can be wiped down while being held by the mother. In the absence of uterotonic agents, rapidly initiating breastfeeding helps to contract the uterus and decrease bleeding. The cord is not clamped/cut yet. (See <a class="local">'Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Newborn care and assessment</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Protect the airway</strong> – The newborn's neck is held in a neutral to slightly extended position to open the airway. The nose and mouth are wiped of blood and mucus with a clean cloth. There is no strong evidence that routinely suctioning with a bulb or catheter is beneficial. However, if the infant appears to have an airway obstruction, use a bulb to gently suction the mouth first (avoid the posterior pharynx) and then the nose; newborns are obligate nose breathers [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The mouth is cleared first, so its contents are not aspirated if the newborn gasps when the nose is suctioned. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134953.html" rel="external">"Labor and delivery: Management of the normal second stage", section on 'Spontaneous birth'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dry and keep warm</strong> – Drying the newborn promptly is important, as it significantly reduces heat loss. Maintaining body heat is an important initial step in caring for the newborn because hypothermia in the immediate newborn period increases oxygen consumption and metabolic demands and is independently associated with increased mortality. Low birth weight and preterm infants are particularly prone to rapid loss of body heat because of their large body surface area relative to their mass, thin skin, and decreased subcutaneous fat. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5068.html" rel="external">"Overview of the routine management of the healthy newborn infant", section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If skin-to skin contact with the mother is not possible, additional ways to keep the infant warm after drying include swaddling in warm towels/blankets, performing skin-to-skin contact with a support person, placing it in a warm (36.5ºC) isolette, raising the environmental (room) temperature, and providing clothing. While the baby is being dried, cord clamping is delayed, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stimulate</strong> – Drying the infant generally provides adequate stimulation. If the baby is limp and not breathing, tactile stimulation should be initiated promptly. Appropriate ways of providing this additional stimulation include rubbing the infant's back or chest or flicking the soles of the feet with your fingers. More vigorous stimulation is not helpful and may cause injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assess Apgar score</strong> – If possible, Apgar scores are recorded at one and five minutes after birth. The Apgar score assesses neonatal heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color. Up to two points are assigned for each variable (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13501.html" rel="external">calculator 3</a>). Approximately 90 percent of neonates have Apgar scores of 7 to 10, and generally require no special intervention. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5068.html" rel="external">"Overview of the routine management of the healthy newborn infant"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the infant is not breathing or crying and/or has poor muscle tone, the initial steps in resuscitation include warming the infant, clearing the airway, and drying and stimulating the infant, as described above. The next steps depend on the respiratory and cardiac responses to these measures and are summarized in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140126" href="/d/graphic/140126.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) and described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5015.html" rel="external">"Neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The umbilical cord should not be clamped until at least 30 to 60 seconds have elapsed since fetal expulsion to facilitate the fetal to neonatal transition and increase infant iron stores. For preterm infants, delayed clamping results in reduced hospital mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134954.html" rel="external">"Labor and delivery: Management of the normal third stage after vaginal birth", section on 'Early versus delayed cord clamping'</a>.)</p><p>If sterile instruments are available, doubly clamp the cord approximately four inches from the baby and cut the cord between the clamps with scissors or a knife. There are no nerve endings in the umbilical cord; cutting it is painless. If sterile instruments or tape for clamping/tying and cutting the cord are not available, the cord can be left connecting the baby to the placenta. A cool room temperature (compared with body temperature) causes the Wharton's jelly to swell and blood vessels in the cord to collapse and constrict, creating a natural clamp. </p><p>Once the cord is clamped, collect one red-top tube of blood from the placental end of the cord; this blood is used for determining the newborn's blood type and RhD status.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Delivery of the placenta</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Do not pull excessively on the cord to deliver the placenta, which may still be attached to the uterus. The three classic signs indicating placental separation from the uterine wall are (1) lengthening of the umbilical cord out of the vagina, (2) a gush of blood from the vagina, signifying separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, and (3) change in the shape of the uterine fundus from discoid to globular with elevation of the fundal height.</p><p>Placental separation occurs naturally, usually within five minutes of expulsion of the infant; there is no maternal benefit in trying to hasten this process. Waiting 30 to 60 minutes after delivery, or even longer, is reasonable if bleeding is not profuse. </p><p>Contractions typically diminish after the baby is born, and then resume upon separation of the placenta. If the placenta is not expelled within approximately five minutes of seeing signs of placental separation, ask the mother to bear down and gently tug on the umbilical cord to deliver it while simultaneously applying counterpressure on her uterus [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Firm pressure should be placed on the mother's abdomen, just above her pubic symphysis, to secure the uterine fundus and prevent uterine inversion (uterus turns inside out). When the placenta protrudes from the introitus, grasp and gently rotate it to extract the placenta with the attached membranes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4458.html" rel="external">"Puerperal uterine inversion"</a>.)</p><p>After placental expulsion, a uterotonic drug is administered to stimulate the uterus to contract and remain contracted, which will reduce maternal blood loss. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">Oxytocin</a> is infused into a maternal vein. A typical infusion is 30 units in 500 mL crystalloid infused at 334 mL/hour to provide 10 units over the first 30 minutes, followed by a maintenance rate of 125 mL/hour to provide 7.5 units over the next 60 minutes. Bolus intravenous injection is less safe, even at low doses. If there is no venous access, intramuscular injection (usually 10 units) is effective. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4437.html" rel="external">"Management of the third stage of labor: Prophylactic pharmacotherapy to minimize hemorrhage"</a>.)</p><p>If <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a> is not available, vigorously massage the uterine fundus (which will be at the level of the maternal umbilicus) to help it contract into a firm (like a contracted biceps) globular mass. A flabby fundus suggests atony, which is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Also attempt to initiate breastfeeding to stimulate uterine contractions. </p><p>Place the placenta in a bag or suitable receptacle for later examination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5393.html" rel="external">"Gross examination of the placenta"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">LACERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inspect the perineum for lacerations. Superficial lacerations generally do not require any treatment. Deeper lacerations should be evaluated and treated by an obstetrician. Until the appropriate care providers and setting are available to repair lacerations, we advise the clinician to apply pressure to lacerations that are bleeding briskly until these lacerations can be repaired. Alternately, the laceration site can be firmly packed if sterile dressing material is available.
