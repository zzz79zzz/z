However, the clinical spectrum of this disorder has been expanded  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132581" href="/d/graphic/132581.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The duodenum is a common site of tumors (gastrinomas) in these patients, and bronchial and thymic neuroendocrine tumors, gastric carcinoid tumors, adrenal adenomas, and lipomas are more common than in the general population.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of MEN1 will be reviewed here. The genetics of this disorder, its distinction from other multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, and its treatment are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2037.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Genetics"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2026.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7870.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF MEN1</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare heritable disorder classically characterized by a predisposition to tumors of the parathyroid glands, anterior pituitary, and pancreatic islet cells [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. MEN1 also includes a predisposition to gastrinomas in the duodenum, bronchopulmonary and thymic neuroendocrine tumors, gastric carcinoids, adrenal adenomas (occasionally carcinomas), angiofibromas, lipomas, and other tumors  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132581" href="/d/graphic/132581.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>The presence of MEN1 is defined clinically as the occurrence of two or more primary MEN1 tumor types, or in family members of a patient with a clinical diagnosis of MEN1, the occurrence of one of the MEN1-associated tumors  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132581" href="/d/graphic/132581.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). It should be noted that these are clinical definitions and do not necessarily indicate that a pathogenic variant of the <em>MEN1 </em>gene (ie, a "mutation") will be identifiable or responsible (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2037.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Genetics"</a>). In addition, for diagnosis of MEN1, there are situations where genetic criteria can be used. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4058708"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Primary hyperparathyroidism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple parathyroid tumors causing hyperparathyroidism are the most common manifestation of MEN1, displaying almost 100 percent penetrance overall and at least 75 percent penetrance by age 50 years  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132582" href="/d/graphic/132582.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. In most cases, it is the initial manifestation of MEN1, although clinical presentations are unusual before the age of 10 years. Reliable incidence figures do not exist, but it has been estimated that the incidence of MEN1 ranges from 1 to 18 percent in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] and probably much closer to the lower end of this range [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Primary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of familial MEN1 has a number of different features from the common sporadic (non-familial) form of the disease [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The male-to-female ratio is even in MEN1 in contrast to the female predominance in sporadic hyperparathyroidism.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hyperparathyroidism in MEN1 typically presents in the second to fourth decade of life, approximately two decades earlier than in sporadic hyperparathyroidism.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple gland disease is typical in MEN1 and, given sufficient time, perhaps universal. In comparison, approximately 80 to 85 percent of patients with sporadic disease have single parathyroid adenomas. There can be marked asymmetry in size among the distinct glands and, upon initial neck exploration, some parathyroid glands in MEN1 may appear to be grossly normal. However, even the smaller glands will generally exhibit hypercellularity on histologic examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A strong and seemingly inexorable proliferative drive in parathyroid cells appears to exist in classical MEN1, as indicated by the high rate of recurrent hyperparathyroidism after apparently successful subtotal parathyroidectomy. One report from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as an example, found a recurrence rate above 50 percent at 12 years [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]; most other studies have had shorter follow-up periods. The high recurrence rate clearly distinguishes the hyperparathyroidism of MEN1 from that seen in sporadic disease. It has also resulted in differences of opinion with respect to optimal surgical management of this disorder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2026.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Similar to sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism, the majority of patients are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, and hypercalcemia is detected by routine or surveillance-driven biochemical screening. If clinical manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism are present, they may include decreased bone mineral density, kidney stones, and symptoms of hypercalcemia (eg, polyuria, polydipsia, constipation). The biochemical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is based, as it is in other patients, on the demonstration of hypercalcemia with inappropriately high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. Parathyroid carcinoma, typically presenting with severe hypercalcemia, is extremely rare in MEN1. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2031.html" rel="external">"Primary hyperparathyroidism: Clinical manifestations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2029.html" rel="external">"Primary hyperparathyroidism: Diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Pituitary adenomas</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinically apparent pituitary adenomas have been found in approximately 15 to 20 percent of patients with MEN1 when sought by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] and 42 percent in a multicenter study of 324 MEN1 patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132582" href="/d/graphic/132582.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The pathologic prevalence in one series was over 60 percent [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Pituitary tumors have been reported to be the first manifestation of MEN1 in 13 percent of patients [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The range of pituitary cell types is similar to that found in sporadic pituitary adenomas. Thus, the most common type of pituitary adenoma in MEN1 is lactotroph, but somatotroph, corticotroph, gonadotroph, and clinically nonfunctioning tumors can also occur  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132581" href="/d/graphic/132581.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Multiple pituitary tumors are rarely present in MEN1.</p><p>The phenotypic presentation of pituitary disease is variable. In one large kindred, as an example, lactotroph adenomas predominated, and none of the 165 patients had acromegaly [<a href="#rid7">7,11</a>]. Furthermore, the distribution of lactotroph adenomas was not even; the prevalence was more than 50 percent in some branches of the kindred and very low in others [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>A multicenter study of 324 MEN1 patients (42 percent of whom had pituitary tumors), compared with 110 non-MEN patients with pituitary adenomas, revealed that [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Of the 136 MEN1 patients with pituitary adenomas, 85 percent had macroadenomas (versus 42 percent in non-MEN1 patients).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the same patients, hormonal hypersecretion was normalized in 42 percent after treatment versus 90 percent in non-MEN1 patients, reflecting the finding that the MEN1 patients had adenomas that were larger and more aggressive than those in non-MEN patients.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, another study, which examined the results of systematic presymptomatic screening for pituitary adenomas over a significant follow-up period (median six years), showed that such screening primarily detected nonfunctioning microadenomas that grew only occasionally and without clinical consequence; detected prolactinomas responded well to medical treatment [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Thus, it seems likely that functioning and nonfunctioning pituitary microadenomas represent the most common type of pituitary abnormality in MEN1, and they are frequently detected on routine biochemical and/or radiologic surveillance with macroadenomas accounting for 25 to 35 percent of tumors.</p><p>Whether a program of routine and lifelong surveillance by imaging would decrease morbidity from pituitary disease in MEN1 remains unknown.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, approach to diagnosis, and therapy of pituitary adenomas in patients with MEN1 are similar to that in patients with sporadic adenomas. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6632.html" rel="external">"Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses", section on 'Pituitary adenomas'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Pancreatic islet cell/gastrointestinal endocrine tumors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Effective treatment is usually available for the hyperparathyroidism and pituitary disease in MEN1; as a result, the malignant potential of enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is now the primary life-threatening manifestation of MEN1. However, subclinical involvement is more common; anatomic or intensive biochemical studies reveal evidence of enteropancreatic tumors in up to 80 percent of patients with MEN1  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132581" href="/d/graphic/132581.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Functioning tumors</strong> – Functioning pancreatic islet cell or gastrointestinal endocrine cell tumors become clinically apparent in one-third to two-thirds of patients with MEN1  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132582" href="/d/graphic/132582.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The most common cause of symptomatic disease is the Zollinger-Ellison (gastrinoma) syndrome (ZES), leading to multiple peptic ulcers or diarrhea (see <a class="local">'Zollinger-Ellison syndrome'</a> below). It has been estimated that 60 percent of patients with MEN1 have either ZES or asymptomatic elevation in serum gastrin concentrations; on the other hand, MEN1 is present in approximately 25 percent of patients with ZES [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Symptomatic insulinomas also occur with moderate frequency, while VIPomas and glucagonomas are rare. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2610.html" rel="external">"VIPoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2611.html" rel="external">"Glucagonoma and the glucagonoma syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonfunctioning tumors</strong> – The prevalence of radiographically confirmed, nonfunctioning tumors is similar to that of gastrinomas, ranging from 30 to 80 percent [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>]. Like hormonally active enteropancreatic tumors in MEN1, clinically "nonfunctioning" pancreatic NETs may be malignant and capable of causing liver metastases. Nonfunctioning tumors now represent the leading cause of premature mortality in MEN1. (See <a class="local">'Nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The diagnosis and localization of MEN1-associated pancreatic tumors may be confounded by the presence of multiple synchronous tumors, and one cannot assume that a tumor visualized on imaging studies represents the source of any coexisting pancreatic hormone excess (eg, gastrin, insulin). For example, it is likely that patients previously identified with one or more pancreatic lesions assumed to be gastrinomas, may instead have had nonfunctioning pancreatic lesions with coexistent microscopic duodenal gastrinomas. Likewise, in those patients with evidence of metastatic disease, it cannot be assumed that the largest observable pancreatic tumor represents the source of metastases.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Zollinger-Ellison syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historically, attempts at surgical cure of the hypergastrinemia in ZES in patients with MEN1 were uniformly unsuccessful. It is now apparent that the basis for the failure of these approaches, namely resection of palpable tumors and/or partial pancreatectomy, is due to the biological nature and characteristics of the tumors in MEN1. In contrast to sporadically occurring gastrinomas, the gastrinomas in MEN1 patients are multifocal, often exceedingly small, and easily overlooked. In addition, the duodenum is a common site of gastrinomas both in MEN1 and in sporadic gastrinoma [<a href="#rid14">14,20,21</a>]; in comparison, in MEN1, the tumors that are found in the pancreas do not usually secrete gastrin [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Gastrinomas in MEN1 usually present in adulthood with a typical age of onset of 30 to 50 years. A previous history of <em>H. pylori</em> infection is reported to be associated with an increased prevalence and severity of hypergastrinemia.</p><p>The risk of death from malignant spread of MEN1-associated gastrinoma appears to be less than that for sporadic gastrinoma. Local lymph node metastases are common, reported in up to 80 percent of patients but are not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis or a high likelihood that clinically important metastases will occur [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The reported 5- and 10-year survival of patients with MEN1-associated gastrinoma in a recent study was reported to be approximately 80 and 65 percent, respectively, with reduced survival observed in those with gastrin levels &gt;20 times the upper limit of normal, a coexisting pancreatic tumor &gt;2 cm, and/or presence of liver metastases or multiple synchronous tumors [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. </p><p>In one large series, investigators at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) prospectively followed 107 patients with MEN1 and ZES and reviewed 1009 cases from the literature [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Their findings were as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Approximately 25 percent of MEN1/ZES patients had no family history of MEN1.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ZES was the initial clinical manifestation of MEN1 in only 8 percent of patients with MEN1/ZES if careful testing was done.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The onset of ZES symptoms preceded the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism in 45 percent of patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The diagnosis of ZES was delayed for three to six years after its onset.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pituitary disease occurred in 60 percent of patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients without a family history of MEN1, ZES and other MEN1 manifestations occurred later and were less severe.</p><p></p><p>Hypersecretion of gastrin in ZES in MEN1 may be suspected clinically by the presence of multiple peptic ulcers  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57632" href="/d/graphic/57632.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) or symptoms like diarrhea. The diagnosis is confirmed by the same biochemical and gastric acid output criteria as are used in the sporadic cases [<a href="#rid22">22,25,26</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2627.html" rel="external">"Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>). Hypercalcemia from coexisting hyperparathyroidism can significantly exacerbate the symptoms of ZES, and parathyroidectomy to correct hypercalcemia can reduce fasting and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10259" href="/d/drug information/10259.html" rel="external">secretin</a> stimulated gastrin levels and basal acid secretion [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>The incidence of Cushing syndrome has been reported to be increased in patients with ZES. When Cushing syndrome occurs in patients with nonfamilial gastrinoma, the usual cause is ectopic corticotropin (ACTH) release from the islet-cell tumor. These cases are associated with severe symptoms. In contrast, patients with familial MEN1 and ZES who develop Cushing syndrome usually have a corticotroph adenoma of the pituitary and relatively mild symptoms of cortisol excess [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Insulinoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Insulin-producing pancreatic islet cell adenomas in MEN1 are often small, may be multiple, and may be associated with the simultaneous presence of other islet cell tumors. Insulinoma in MEN1 typically presents in the second to fourth decade of life, earlier than in sporadic insulinoma, which usually occurs in individuals older than 40 years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The diagnosis of insulinoma depends, as in nonfamilial causes, upon the documentation of hypoglycemia with characteristic symptoms that are rapidly reversed by the administration of glucose, and inappropriately high serum insulin concentrations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2187.html" rel="external">"Insulinoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is important to recognize that pancreatic NETs in MEN1 often synthesize multiple hormones. But hormone synthesis does not always have clinical consequences, suggesting that many such tumors may be defective in their peptide hormone processing apparatus or have an inefficient secretory mechanism [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Like hormonally active enteropancreatic tumors in MEN1, clinically "nonfunctioning" pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may be malignant and can metastasize to the liver. Nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs have been detected as early as ages 12 to 14 in asymptomatic children with MEN1 [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>].</p><p>Nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs are among the most common tumor of the pancreaticoduodenal region in patients with MEN1 [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>]. In a report of 579 MEN1 patients, 108 patients with isolated nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs were identified with the following clinical characteristics and course [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The penetrance of nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs was 34 percent at age 50 years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The risks of metastasis and death were low for patients with tumors ≤20 mm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Average life expectancy for patients with nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs was similar to that for gastrinoma patients (69 to 70 years) and shorter than that for patients without pancreatic tumors (77 years).</p><p></p><p>The recognition of nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors is important as they now represent the leading cause of premature mortality in MEN1 [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. The risk of metastases is reported to be associated with tumor size, such that attempts to diagnose such tumors should focus on detecting those most likely to be clinically relevant. However, the best way to detect these nonfunctioning tumors is unclear. Assays for tumor markers like chromogranin A have low sensitivity [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>]. A limited amount of data suggests that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) outperforms CT scanning in this setting, and a combination of MRI plus EUS has been recommended [<a href="#rid2">2,31</a>]. <sup>68</sup>Gallium-DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning has been reported to have especially high sensitivity for detecting neuroendocrine tumors in MEN1, at times leading to a change in management [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Such sensitive imaging methods increase detection of indolent tumors as well as potentially aggressive lesions. In a retrospective study, <sup>18</sup>F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT imaging was useful for predicting the malignant potential of pancreatic NETs in MEN1 [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

In general, the primary and most compelling purpose of such screening in human tumor predisposition syndromes is to prevent disease-related morbidity and mortality that would otherwise occur. However, there is at present little evidence that early, preclinical detection actually reduces overall morbidity or mortality in MEN1. Nonetheless, because benefit seems likely in some instances and because other helpful information can potentially result, screening may be pursued and DNA-based testing merits serious consideration. The optimal age to being screening has not been established. Some advocate starting early in childhood (ie, &lt;5 years of age), while others suggest this can be deferred until the individual is able to decide for themselves whether to undergo testing.

Nevertheless, some published guidelines have opted for pointing the clinician to a more aggressive screening protocol for MEN1-associated risks beginning at very early ages [<a href="#rid1">1,60</a>]. A 2012 paper, for example, while acknowledging weaknesses in available supporting data, suggested routine annual measurement of serum calcium, PTH, gastrin, fasting glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), prolactin, and chromogranin-A, starting in childhood and continuing for life. Imaging tests (MRI of the pituitary and MRI/CT scan/EUS to evaluate for enteropancreatic tumors) were suggested every one to three years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Others have recommended more limited biochemical testing and somewhat different imaging approaches [<a href="#rid13">13,32,65</a>].</p><p>We believe that cost-effectiveness and risk-benefit considerations (including those related to diagnostic radiation exposure) can be taken into account in determining the prospective preclinical surveillance program of an individual with MEN1 or a family member at risk, beyond the maintenance of disease-focused clinical vigilance. For example, annual measurement of serum calcium offers the opportunity to inexpensively detect asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism, which might be treated surgically. Other combinations of biochemical and imaging surveillance, including those in published protocols, can reasonably be used but are not mandatory given the absence of support by high-quality evidence [<a href="#rid1">1,32</a>]. </p><p>However, it is also important to bear in mind that the main purpose of screening should be the detection of clinically important manifestations either requiring immediate treatment or closer monitoring. For example, almost all MEN1 patients will develop multiple small, nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs (eg, 0.5 to 5 mm), but their detection using highly sensitive imaging modalities is generally unlikely to alter treatment decisions or patient prognosis. Thus, the surveillance approach will also be reasonably informed by one's potential use of tumor size criteria in the decision to operate on enteropancreatic endocrine tumors (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2026.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Management", section on 'Pancreatic islet cell/gastrointestinal tumors'</a>). New advances in treatment could dramatically alter these recommendations; for example, a future demonstration that an aggressive surgical approach to gastrinoma clearly improves disease-related mortality would provide a rationale for intensive biochemical and anatomic screening, which is capable of detecting gastrointestinal or pancreatic disease in asymptomatic family members [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2976704172"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/d/html/111962.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28380297"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General principles</strong> – Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare heritable disorder classically characterized by a predisposition to tumors of the parathyroid glands, anterior pituitary, and pancreatic islet cells. Given the complexity of decision-making and specialized skills needed in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of MEN1, it is strongly advised that patients are evaluated and managed in centers with established multidisciplinary teams experienced in the care of MEN1 patients. (See <a class="local">'Definition of MEN1'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>MEN1 diagnosis</strong> – The clinical diagnosis of MEN1 is based upon the occurrence of two or more primary MEN1 tumor types (parathyroid gland, anterior pituitary, and enteropancreatic). In family members of a patient with a clinical diagnosis of MEN1, the occurrence of one of the MEN1-associated tumors is consistent with familial MEN1  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132581" href="/d/graphic/132581.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The diagnosis of MEN1 (or at least a determination that an individual is genetically predisposed to developing MEN1 clinically) can also be made by identifying a germline <em>MEN1</em> mutation in an individual in whom the clinical diagnosis of MEN1 is not clearly established or in an asymptomatic family member who has not yet developed the serum biochemical or radiologic abnormalities associated with tumor development. (See <a class="local">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary hyperparathyroidism</strong> – In most cases, multiple parathyroid tumors causing primary hyperparathyroidism are the initial manifestation of MEN1, and they are found in the large majority of patients by age 50 years  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132582" href="/d/graphic/132582.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Similar to sporadic adenomas causing primary hyperparathyroidism, most patients are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, and hypercalcemia is detected by routine (or surveillance-based) biochemical screening. The biochemical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is based, as it is in all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, upon the demonstration of hypercalcemia with inappropriately high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. (See <a class="local">'Primary hyperparathyroidism'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pituitary adenomas</strong> – The most common type of pituitary adenoma in MEN1 is a lactotroph adenoma, but somatotroph, corticotroph, gonadotroph, and clinically nonfunctioning adenomas can also occur  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132581" href="/d/graphic/132581.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The approach to diagnosis and therapy of pituitary adenomas in patients with MEN1 is similar to that in patients with sporadic adenomas. (See <a class="local">'Pituitary adenomas'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6632.html" rel="external">"Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses", section on 'Evaluation of a sellar mass'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pancreatic islet cell/gastrointestinal endocrine tumors</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Functioning tumors</strong> – Functioning pancreatic islet cell or gastrointestinal endocrine tumors become clinically apparent in approximately one-third of patients with MEN1  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132582" href="/d/graphic/132582.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The most common cause of symptomatic disease is the Zollinger-Ellison (gastrinoma) syndrome (ZES)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132581" href="/d/graphic/132581.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), although insulinoma may occur at a young age and can be the first clinical presentation of MEN1. (See <a class="local">'Pancreatic islet cell/gastrointestinal endocrine tumors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Nonfunctioning tumors</strong> – Nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors are now recognized as the most common pancreatic tumor type in MEN1 and are responsible for considerable morbidity and premature mortality. The detection of clinically relevant nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors is usually dependent on one of several imagining techniques as sensitive blood-based tumor markers are not currently available. (See <a class="local">'Pancreatic islet cell/gastrointestinal endocrine tumors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genetic testing </strong>– DNA testing for a pathogenic variant of the <em>MEN1</em> gene is available commercially and can provide valuable information in specific situations, although its results generally do not dictate use of a major intervention established to improve morbidity or mortality. We make determinations regarding MEN1 DNA testing on a case-by-case basis, but discussions with patient and genetic counselor more often than not lead to pursuit of such testing. For those declining genetic testing or in those kindreds without a detectable <em>MEN1 </em>mutation, regular clinical and/or biochemical/radiologic assessment may alert the clinician to the onset of relevant tumors. (See <a class="local">'Genetic testing'</a> above and <a class="local">'Index patient'</a> above and <a class="local">'Family members in MEN1 kindreds'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring for MEN-1 associated tumors</strong> – We carefully monitor all patients with MEN1, known <em>MEN1</em> mutation carriers, and at-risk family members with unknown carrier status for symptoms or signs of MEN1-associated tumors, such as nephrolithiasis, amenorrhea (females), galactorrhea, erectile dysfunction (males), peptic ulcer disease, diarrhea, and neuroglycopenic or sympathoadrenal symptoms from hypoglycemia. We typically measure serum calcium, PTH, and prolactin annually to detect asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism and prolactinoma, respectively. Often, we perform additional surveillance using biochemical and imaging modalities. Others routinely use more aggressive screening protocols for MEN1-associated risks, beginning at very early ages. Differences in approaches to surveillance in large part relate to the poor quality of supportive evidence in this area. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring for MEN1-associated tumors'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Thakker RV, Newey PJ, Walls GV, et al.
