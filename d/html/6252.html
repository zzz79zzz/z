         Pediatric palliative care is an interdisciplinary collaboration that seeks to improve the quality of life for children with life-threatening conditions, as well as their families. It focuses on preventing and relieving suffering, regardless of the stage of disease, and comprehensively addresses the physical, psychosocial, or spiritual needs of the child and family/caregivers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pediatric palliative care, including the approach to developing palliative care plans, establishing goals of care, symptom management, and end-of-life care in children, will be discussed in this topic. Other aspects of palliative care are discussed in separate topic reviews:

         – Examples include certain genetic conditions such as trisomy 13, trisomy 18, and type II osteogenesis imperfecta. It is important to note that as novel therapies emerge and change the disease trajectory, management may shift from a palliative focus to a more curative focus. Examples include

         therapy for spinal muscular atrophy type I, gene therapy for certain metabolic and immunologic disorders (adrenal leukodystrophy, adenosine deaminase deficiency), or supportive therapies such as heart surgery for infants with trisomy 18. Nevertheless, palliative care teams remain a valuable resource in these settings as they can assist families with decision-making and provide ongoing support since some of these novel therapies are experimental and the outcomes may be variable.

         Families of children with a diagnosis where a cure may not be possible are ideally introduced to palliative care shortly after the time of diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-12
         </a>
         ]. Palliative care is introduced from the beginning of the treatment by acknowledging that it helps to ensure an ongoing focus on quality of life with relief of symptoms so that the child's enjoyment of life can continue [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-17
         </a>
         ]. Palliative care may be introduced at any of the following time points:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Children with chronic, potentially progressive conditions, such as cystic fibrosis or severe neurologic impairment, may benefit from the introduction of palliative care if symptom management is difficult or if there is significant suffering. This often becomes evident at a time of decline in health status, which results in uncertainty regarding outcome and impacts quality of life [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The introduction of palliative care does not preclude the use of potentially curative or disease-modifying treatments [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Nonetheless, common barriers to palliative care are overly optimistic estimates of prognosis and concerns by the medical team that families "are not ready" [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The available evidence suggests that integration of palliative care does not lessen parents' hope [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. In addition, prognostic information that clinicians consider upsetting does not lessen a parent's desire for this information and is often considered important to decision-making [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Palliative care recognizes that there is always care to provide, such as attention to physical symptoms or emotional distress, regardless of the clinical situation [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,11,20
         </a>
         ]. In the setting of a poor prognosis, palliative care has a positive benefit for preparing families for later bereavement [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Parents and families who are poorly prepared in addressing quality of life tend to choose more intensive and invasive interventions that may prolong suffering near the end of life [
         <a href="#rid13">

         Integration of palliative care for a child requires a customized care plan, developed based on goals that enhance the quality of life of the patient and their family. Goals and the care plan are made collaboratively with patients and their families.

         Developing care plans based on goals – Decision-making about ongoing medical treatment based upon the goals for the total care of the child and family, rather than treating a clinical problem in isolation. This can help to avoid the pitfall of performing an intervention out of a sense of needing to do something when parents and clinicians become distressed over the limits of medicine. The care plan needs to adapt to alterations in the needs of the patient and family as the disease progresses.

Disciplines required for the spectrum of palliative care needs of the child and family typically include a clinician, clinical nurse specialist or advanced practice nurse, social worker, child life specialist, and chaplain. Interdisciplinary teams can help ensure that the emotional, spiritual, physical, and practical needs of children and families are identified and met.

         Physical – Clinicians, including physicians, clinical nurse specialists, or advance practice nurses, can bring expertise in symptom management. It is always important to remember that physical symptoms improve with attention to each of the other three domains. Palliative care clinicians also can serve as facilitators between other health care providers and families and can help coordinate medical care.

         When a child is facing a life-threatening condition, parents are the legal decision makers about treatment options, including the introduction of palliative or hospice care services.

         Spirituality represents an individual's relationship to the meaning of life and his/her sense of peace, purpose, and connection to others [

          37
         </a>
         ]. For some families, spirituality may be found and expressed through an organized religion, but for others, spirituality is expressed outside of such structures. Interdisciplinary care that explores spiritual needs can provide an avenue for expression of the beliefs, values, hopes, and fears that ultimately guide decisions and impact grieving. Providing assistance to families regarding spirituality and discussion about death often includes the patient, parents, and the child's siblings. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2198.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Serious illness naturally raises questions for patients and parents of "why me?", with a desire to seek meaning at such times. Attending to the spiritual needs of the child and family can help the child manage these questions, prepare parents for such questions, and provide hope and comfort at the end of life [
         <a href="#rid38">

         The medical team and family need to establish patient-centered goals of care with attention to relief of the child's and family's distress. The goals of palliative care do not necessarily exclude the goals of disease-directed therapy. For example, children with cancer and their parents often have simultaneous goals for palliative care to lessen suffering and for cancer-directed therapy to extend life [

        <p>
         The child's well-being should be the primary guide. The job of the parents and care providers is to watch, listen, and reflect honestly on what is in the best interest of the child. This process includes a reflection on the benefits and adverse effects of past interventions, and the expected outcome of current and future treatment. The following series of questions/issues are useful to consider and review with families while developing goals of care that can help instruct care plans.

         In a child with life-threatening illness, invasive and life-sustaining interventions, such as resuscitative measures (eg, intubation), are available even at the end of life. Prior to a life-threatening event, it is important to consider whether such interventions should be performed. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86248.html" rel="external">
          "Advance care planning and advance directives"

        </p>
        <p>
         Early discussion allows children and parents to make decisions that fit with their values and goals of care [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,12
         </a>
         ]. This assessment should consider whether any of the proposed interventions (eg, intubation, chest compressions, defibrillation) will result in a desired outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
         Discussing resuscitative and life-sustaining efforts requires an honest assessment of the likelihood of benefit and possible harm and is based upon the steps discussed above. It is important that the care team assume responsibility for this process so as to not imply undue parental responsibility for any decision regarding life-sustaining measures. This is ideally a process of shared decision-making. As an example, avoid asking "Do you want your child to be intubated?". This focused question implies offering something that would benefit the child and shifts the decision-making burden to the parents. It is also important to reassure patients and families that a decision to forgo life-sustaining measures will not alter ongoing care of a patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is also a time to remind families that when there is a decline in health, it is not a result of any decisions made to limit interventions or of the care provided at home but rather a result of the health problems that cannot be "cured" or "fixed." The family should be reassured that interventions will continue as long as they maintain sufficient benefit to quality of life.

         During the course of a life-threatening condition or when a life-threatening fetal diagnosis is made, any decision to implement therapies of uncertain benefit needs to be considered within the context of the goals of the child (or fetus) and family [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         To avoid misunderstanding during these discussions, it should be made clear to the family that the care team is not trying to limit treatments that may have reasonable benefit. The goal is to protect the child from interventions with little or no benefit that may harm or prolong suffering and to provide care that maximizes comfort throughout the child's life.

         Patients in pediatric palliative care can undergo surgical procedures when deemed medically appropriate. Surgery has not been associated with excess risk in such patients and potentially may extend survival. In a large cohort study, children who underwent surgical interventions (ranging from relatively minor procedures such as feeding tube or tracheostomy placement to life-threatening procedures such as cardiac surgery) while receiving palliative care had greater five-year survival than those who did not undergo surgery (71 versus 61 percent, respectively) [

         Families benefit from the opportunity to prepare and plan prior to delivery. This planning involves supportive care for the mother during labor and delivery, involvement of the father/coparent when appropriate, and care plans that account for variable outcomes of the fetus.
        </p>
        <p>
         A delivery plan can be developed that indicates the care plan for the infant following delivery. Communication is an essential part of planning to ensure that interventions that are consistent with the parents' goals for their newborn are implemented. This may involve a decision
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         to resuscitate and to focus on the infant's comfort while parents maximize their time with the infant. (See

         Appointing a health care proxy allows a patient over 18 years of age to designate someone to make medical decisions if they are unable to make or communicate those decisions. A social worker or other trusted team member involved with the patient can assist with the process of identifying someone the patient trusts and filling out the necessary documentation. This process also provides an opportunity to discuss goals of care, revisit key medical decisions, and assure a clear understanding of the patient's preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
         For those unable to participate in decision-making (incapacitated), guardianship involves obtaining the legal authority to make decisions for another person. Parents must seek guardianship if their child will remain incapacitated once 18 years of age.

         Dyspnea is the experience of feeling short of breath, which may be due to difficult or painful breathing. It is a common symptom found in numerous medical disorders. Objective measures (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) and clinical observations do not necessarily correlate with the patient's perception of breathlessness. A child may be able to report the degree of distress associated with dyspnea using a scale similar to the visual analog scale used for pain. Although instruments are available for assessing dyspnea, including the Respiratory Distress Observational Scale, which is used in adults unable to report about symptoms, they have not been validated in children [

If the child is already receiving an opioid agent, the dose is increased by 30 percent.

         </span>
         Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms in patients with chronic diseases that may be due to the underlying disorder or its treatment. The underlying pathophysiology is a complex process that involves abdominal vagal afferent input, vestibular system, and two areas of the brainstem: the area postrema (referred to as the chemoreceptor trigger zone) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (referred to as the vomiting center)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70638" href="/z/d/graphic/70638.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Neurotransmitters of primary importance within this process include histamine, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), and substance P (neurokinin-1 receptor). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85750.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptom management is based upon determining and eliminating the underlying cause. Medications can cause nausea, and it may be necessary to discontinue or replace them. As an example, opioids are a common source of nausea and vomiting, as they stimulate the area postrema mediated through dopamine 2 receptors and the vestibular system, and also cause constipation. Treatment includes rotation of different opioids, prevention of constipation, and the use of dopamine receptor antagonists.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, therapy for nausea and vomiting includes management of electrolyte abnormalities, managing mucositis, treating constipation, and the use of antiemetic therapy, if needed. In children, several classes of antiemetic drugs are available that generally antagonize the neurotransmitter receptors involved in the physiology of nausea and vomiting  (

          Agitation
         </strong>
         – Agitation is an unpleasant state of arousal. It may present as loud speech, crying, increased motor activity, increased autonomic arousal (eg, diaphoresis, increased heart rate), inability to relax or concentrate, or disturbed sleep-rest pattern. Although symptoms of agitation can overlap with anxiety, they generally tend to have more motor than psychological manifestations.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Management of both delirium and agitation involves treating the underlying cause when possible. Medications that can help manage the symptoms of delirium and agitation include benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications. It is also important to rule out conditions that give the appearance of agitation, such as akathisia (an unpleasant state of motor restlessness), from antidopaminergic medications, myoclonus, withdrawal from opioids, and paradoxical reactions from medications.

         An increased risk of bleeding can occur in children with cancer due to a decrease in either platelet count or function, typically caused by an adverse effect of therapy or underlying disease. In these patients, mucosal bleeding can sometimes be controlled with

         At some point, a cure becomes no longer realistic or disease-modifying therapy is no longer beneficial in some children with life-threatening illness and the goals of treatment shift. Care at the end of life is focused on comfort for the dying child and minimizing suffering (eg, distress and anxiety) for both the patient and family. It requires understanding and anticipating the needs of the patient and family and managing the social, legal, economic, and institutional circumstances that surround the child's death. Although preparing families for a child's death can be difficult, it is tremendously beneficial for families. A number of factors contribute to the quality of end-of-life care provided to children in the inpatient setting  (

         Planning for the death of a terminally ill child includes deciding upon the preferred location of death [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Locations include the home, hospice facilities, and inpatient hospital units. Parents/caregivers who are able to plan for the location of death generally feel more prepared for the child's death and are less likely to have doubts or regrets later on about the setting of their child's death [
         <a href="#rid118">
          118
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Planning begins with the palliative team explaining treatment options. An important part of the planning process is involvement of the child when appropriate. When the preferred site is at home, discharge planners and social workers help arrange for a hospice service or for other resources within the community.
        </p>
        <p>
         One study of 140 parents who lost a child to cancer reported that planning for the location of death resulted in more home deaths compared with no planning (72 versus 8 percent) [
         <a href="#rid118">
          118
         </a>
         ]. For children who died in the hospital, planning resulted in more deaths in the inpatient units rather than the intensive care unit and fewer children being intubated.

          Benefits of hospice

         – Hospice teams are ideally suited to provide comprehensive services to the dying child, siblings, parents/caregivers, and extended family [
         <a href="#rid119">
          119,120

         ]. The hospice team is interdisciplinary and includes clinicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, bereavement staff, child life specialists, and mental health and complementary medicine therapists. In a retrospective survey, parents of children who received end-of-life home hospice services as part of their oncology care more often reported their child had fun (70 versus 45 percent), experienced events that added meaning to life (89 versus 63 percent), and died at home (93 versus 20 percent) compared with parents of children who died without home hospice involvement [

         Cost and reimbursement of hospice care – Hospice reimbursement is often based on a per-visit mode (per diem) at a rate often ranging from $125 to $190 per day. This rate is intended to cover all of the personnel, medications, equipment, and supplies that the child needs. In the United States, there may be requirements for insurance coverage, such as a life expectancy of no more than six months and an absence of life-sustaining treatments (eg, chemotherapy).

          Funding
         </strong>
         – In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) allows terminally ill children who are enrolled in a Medicaid or state Children's Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) hospice benefit to concurrently receive curative care related to their terminal health condition [

         In the United States, local regulations generally require that a clinician pronounce death and complete a death certificate. If hospice is involved, the family should be directed to call the hospice and a nurse will generally come to the home and pronounce the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who die in the hospital, the covering clinician is typically summoned to pronounce the patient. The clinician should inform the family that the child has died in a clear and compassionate manner. The clinician should also inform the family of the option to pursue autopsy and organ or tissue donation. Family communication regarding organ donation is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1663.html" rel="external">
          "Assessment of the pediatric patient for potential organ donation", section on 'Family communication'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In many areas, local regulations require that pediatric deaths be reported to the local medical examiner (coroner), who may choose to investigate the death and may perform an autopsy [
         <a href="#rid122">
          122
         </a>
         ]. This typically happens when the circumstances surrounding the death are uncertain. In cases where the child's death was expected, examination by the coroner is usually not necessary; however, the decision is at the discretion of the coroner. If the coroner declines the case, the family can be offered the option of pursuing a medical autopsy. Autopsy may provide important information both for the care team and family. In particular, the review of autopsy results with a trusted provider may allow lingering questions or concerns that are causing parental distress to be answered [
         <a href="#rid123">

          What is palliative care?
         </strong>
         – Pediatric palliative care utilizes an interdisciplinary team to focus on preventing and relieving suffering in children with life-threatening illnesses, regardless of the stage of disease. It comprehensively addresses the physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs of the child and family. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General approach'

         <strong>
          Patient selection
         </strong>
         – Conditions in which palliative care is beneficial include those in which curative treatment is possible but may fail (eg, cancer), progressive conditions without curative treatment (eg, trisomy 13), chronic conditions with intensive medical long-term therapy (eg, advanced cystic fibrosis), and severe nonprogressive conditions with health complications (eg, severe cerebral palsy). Palliative care is optimally introduced shortly after a life-threatening diagnosis is made or, in children with chronic diseases, when there is a decline in health status from baseline. (See
         <a class="local">
