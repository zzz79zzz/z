         Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are among the most common congenital heart lesions. VSDs occur in isolation or in combination with other congenital heart disease defects, as in an atrioventricular canal, tetralogy of Fallot, and, occasionally, D-transposition of the great arteries. (See

         The management approach for VSD is dependent on the presence and severity of symptoms, the likelihood of spontaneous closure, and the risk of long-term complications that could be prevented by early intervention. These factors are primarily dictated by the size of the defect and magnitude of left-to-right shunting (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109955" href="/z/d/graphic/109955.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). The clinical examination and echocardiography (which also confirms the diagnosis) provides information on the size of the defect and degree of shunting. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5787.html" rel="external">

         No intervention – For patients with small defects, intervention is usually not required. These patients are typically asymptomatic and have a reasonable expectation of spontaneous closure or decrease in the size of the defect over time. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5787.html" rel="external">

         Medical therapy – Medical therapy is required for patients with symptoms of heart failure. For patients with moderate defects, medical management may adequately address the needs of the patients. For those with more severe symptoms, surgical correction is usually necessary and medical management is aimed at reducing symptoms in the interim. (See

         Closure of the defect – For patients who are not adequately managed by medical therapy, and in those at risk for long-term significant sequelae (eg, pulmonary hypertension or valvar damage) surgical repair is generally warranted. (See

         The degree of shunting during the first weeks of life varies with the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life due to changes in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance that normally occur during this time period. As a result, ongoing monitoring in the neonatal period is important to determine which infants will remain asymptomatic and require no intervention versus those who develop heart failure and require intervention. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5787.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In our practice, once the diagnosis of VSD is established in the neonate, the next appointment is scheduled at three to four weeks of after birth, provided the infant is well. The visit is timed to coincide with the anticipated onset of symptoms of heart failure in at-risk patients with moderate to large VSDs. In addition, parents and primary care providers are asked to monitor the patient for signs or symptoms of failure, which should prompt an earlier visit with the pediatric cardiologist. (See

         Our approach to managing infants with small VSDs is as follows:

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Patients should undergo follow-up assessment at three to four weeks of age by a pediatric cardiologist to detect any signs or symptoms of increased left ventricular volume overload. The exception is trivial muscular VSDs. If initial imaging and Doppler demonstrate a very small defect, follow-up is not generally necessary until three to six months of age, by which time many will have closed.

         <span class="glyph">

         For those patients who remain asymptomatic, a follow-up evaluation is scheduled with the cardiologist at around six months of age.

         Between visits with the cardiologist, routine care is provided by the primary care provider. If the patient becomes symptomatic (eg, poor weight gain, tachypnea), the patient should be promptly referred to the specialist for cardiac evaluation. (See

         Patients who continue to have a murmur, but are otherwise asymptomatic and growing well at the six-month visit, are seen again by the pediatric cardiologist at approximately 12 months of age.

         Asymptomatic patients with residual small defects are usually followed every two to five years for overall assessment. Potential complications of residual small defects are rare and may include infective endocarditis, aortic regurgitation, right or left ventricle outflow tract obstruction and shunting from the left ventricle to right atrium. These complications are discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         Medical therapy is initiated in any symptomatic patient. However, since heart failure is not expected in association with small VSDs, the development of new symptoms, particularly late, should prompt reassessment of the original diagnosis and evaluation for other causes of the symptoms.

         Infants with moderate to large VSDs usually become symptomatic within the first months of life as pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) declines. The primary care provider should monitor the infant during the first weeks of life for manifestations of heart failure (eg, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, poor weight gain or failure to thrive, and diaphoresis particularly with feeding). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Health care maintenance'

        </p>
        <p>
         If an assessment has not been done earlier, the infant is evaluated at three to four weeks of age by a pediatric cardiologist because of the expected decrease in PVR resulting in increased left ventricular (LV) flow. At that visit, the infant is assessed for early signs of heart failure. If symptoms develop, medical therapy is warranted as detailed in the following sections. Infants who remain asymptomatic should have ongoing follow-up and monitoring. (See
         <a class="local">

         Regular follow-up should occur throughout the first year of life for all infants with moderate to large VSDs, even if symptoms are lacking. It is important to assess these patients for evidence of pulmonary hypertension. If the murmur is gone but the pulmonic component of second heart sound (S2) is increased in intensity (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104785" href="/z/d/graphic/104785.html" rel="external">
          movie 1
         </a>
         ), an echocardiogram is obtained to estimate pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). For patients with estimated PAP &lt;50 percent of systemic arterial pressure, the risk of developing pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease (PHVD) is low [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Patients with PAP ≥50 percent of systemic arterial pressure are at risk of developing PHVD and they should be referred for surgical closure by six months of age and no later than one year of age. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of patients with pulmonary hypertension'
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         Controversy exists regarding the optimal management of asymptomatic patients (no heart failure or failure to thrive) without pulmonary hypertension (ie, PAP &lt;50 percent of systemic arterial pressure), but who have a persistent large left-to-right shunt (ie, ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow [Qp:Qs] &gt;2:1) with corresponding LV dilation. Although many centers advocate closure by one year of age for these patients, others allow for more time for resolution of LV dilation beyond the first year of life. In one case series of patients with pressure-restrictive VSD and moderate to severe LV dilation without heart failure or pulmonary hypertension, conservative medical management with observation (mean follow-up of 7.8 years) resulted in spontaneous resolution of LV dilation and avoidance of surgical closure in 29 of 33 patients [

         ]. However, until larger long-term studies are performed to evaluate this conservative approach, it remains uncertain whether complications may occur in adults with sizeable residual VSDs [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Surgical intervention early in life may be necessary to avoid long-term sequelae. If symptoms and/or evidence of pulmonary hypertension develop, the patient should be referred for closure. Otherwise, the decision to close the defect is based largely upon the degree of LV dilation and provider and patient preferences. In most instances, the decision can be made by the end of the first year. (See

         For patients who remain asymptomatic after the first year of life without evidence of pulmonary hypertension or LV dilation, follow-up visits are scheduled every one to two years with an echocardiographic evaluation approximately every two years in stable patients. In addition, echocardiography is performed in children &gt;2 years old whose defects have not closed if outflow tract obstruction or aortic regurgitation is suspected [

         For symptomatic patients, medical intervention may postpone and possibly avoid the need for surgical correction. The goals of therapy are to alleviate heart failure symptoms and normalize growth. Management of symptomatic patients includes nutritional support and pharmacologic treatment of heart failure (eg, diuretic therapy). Measures to prevent respiratory tract infections are also an important component of management (eg, influenza immunization and respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis if eligible). (See

         Nutritional support may facilitate weight gain in infants with moderate to large VSDs. These infants have increased caloric needs due to an increased metabolic demand and may need a caloric intake that is &gt;150 kcal/kg per day [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Infants with heart failure often tire with feeding and their intake may be limited. Increasing the caloric density of feeds can provide the necessary caloric intake in a smaller total daily volume, which the patient is more likely to be able to consume each day. The caloric density is increased by the addition of carbohydrate and/or medium-chain triglyceride preparations to conventional formulas [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         One strategy to increase daily caloric intake is to provide more frequent feedings; however, parents may find this challenging. These infants usually take a long period of time to eat and the amount of time required to ensure adequate intake can be substantial. The use of nasogastric feedings may be necessary to improve caloric intake. This may include bolus or continuous feeds, which can be given at night or during the day. The use of these measures usually indicates that closure of the VSD will be required [
         <a href="#rid5">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Fluid restriction is generally not helpful in the management of infants with heart failure related to VSDs because it tends to result in inadequate caloric intake. Although fluid restriction is often used in the management of adults and older children with heart failure, it is counterproductive in infants because they are totally dependent on a liquid diet. Diuretic therapy rather than fluid restriction should be used to reduce and prevent volume overload as discussed in the following section.

         Infants with iron deficiency anemia should be treated with supplemental iron to increase the hematocrit and oxygen-carrying capacity. (See

         The medical management varies depending on the severity of heart failure symptoms. Diuretics are the mainstay of therapy. Though angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used in the past, their effectiveness appears to be minimal and they are no longer routinely used. In severe cases, intravenous (IV) inotropic agents may be used (eg,

         For patients who respond to medical therapy (including satisfactory growth), regular follow-up should occur throughout the first year of life. The frequency of follow-up visits is dictated by the severity of symptoms. Patients are monitored for dose adjustment of the medical regimen and to detect any evidence of pulmonary hypertension that may indicate a need for surgical repair. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of patients with pulmonary hypertension'

        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who have resolution of heart failure symptoms (including normal growth) and are successfully weaned off of heart failure therapies, ongoing monitoring is performed as previously described. (See

        <p>
         For infants who continue to require medical therapy, the timing and need for surgical closure is determined by symptoms of heart failure and the estimated PAP. Symptomatic infants with normal PAP, but with a large left-to-right shunt, should have surgery by one year of age. If PAP is elevated (ie, &gt;50 percent of systemic arterial pressure), surgical repair is performed in the first six months of life. Earlier repair may be warranted in infants with Down syndrome because they have an increased risk of developing irreversible pulmonary hypertension. (See

         Infants with large VSDs are at risk for PHVD, which can develop as early as six months of age.

By contrast, the risk of PHVD is low in patients with normal PAP.

         )) and echocardiography (eg, regurgitant tricuspid jet flow, septal position, or right-to-left shunting). Though rarely necessary, patients who have echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension may require further assessment with cardiac catheterization. (See

         Decisions regarding closure of VSDs and the type of procedure are made on a case-by-case basis. Factors to consider include the severity of heart failure, likelihood of progression of pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease (PHVD) or other complications, likelihood of reduction in size or spontaneous closure of the defect, the morbidity and mortality of the procedure in young infants in the center where the surgery is to be performed, and the likelihood of successful surgical closure. Infants with Down syndrome are at increased risk of developing PHVD and therefore early surgical intervention may be warranted in patients with moderate to large defects.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal of VSD closure is to alleviate or prevent heart failure symptoms and to intervene before irreversible PHVD develops, which may occur as early as six months in high risk patients. Patients with moderate to large VSDs who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy should generally be referred for closure intervention by the age of one year. Earlier intervention is warranted in patients with severe symptoms and those at increased risk for PHVD (eg, Down syndrome, elevated pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] on echocardiography). (See

        <p>
         Primary patch surgical closure is the preferred procedure in most cases. Transcatheter closure is generally reserved for patients with defects that are technically challenging to close operatively (eg, remote apical muscular defect, multiple muscular defects ["Swiss cheese" septum]) or for patients unable to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass for various reasons. Transcatheter VSD closure is technically challenging and should be performed in centers with considerable experience and expertise in interventional catheterization techniques and with surgical backup.

         VSD closure is generally contraindicated if PAP is suprasystemic or if pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is &gt;12 Wood units (WU). As previously noted, in these patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, closure of the defect may result in low cardiac output and increased perioperative mortality. In these circumstances, there may be consideration for placement of a restrictive VSD patch, but this is a rare circumstance. (See
         <a class="local">

         are not absolute contraindications to VSD closure; however this degree of pulmonary hypertension can be associated with increased risk of perioperative complications and decisions regarding closure of the defect should be made on a case-by-case basis. In these patients, closure of the defect may not result in a concomitant decrease in PVR. As a result, these patients may have persistent RV hypertension, possibly suprasystemic with development of RV failure without the presence of a pop-off from the RV to the LV. These patients require judicious postoperative ventilator and vasodilator management. (See

         For most children who require a VSD closure intervention, direct patch closure under cardiopulmonary bypass is the procedure of choice. Surgical closure is associated with an excellent outcome with low rates of mortality and reoperation [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-19
         </a>
         ]. The approach (eg, transatrial, transaortic, right ventriculotomy, apical ventriculotomy) depends upon the type and location of the defect, as well as the preference of the surgeon [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,20
         </a>
         ]. Ventriculotomy is infrequently used in contemporary practice and should be avoided when possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Operative mortality for surgical closure in most centers is &lt;1 percent [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Surgical complications are infrequent and include residual shunts, typically around the patch (which usually are trivial and may resolve spontaneously), and in patients with membranous or inlet defects, there is a risk of right bundle branch block and complete heart block [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. The risks of surgery are increased in children who have elevated PVR. These children must be monitored closely in the postoperative period because PAP is labile. Hypoxia may result in sudden and dramatic changes in resistance with a concomitant decrease in cardiac output.

At our institution, transcatheter VSD closure is offered for patients with defects that are technically challenging to close operatively (eg, remote apical muscular defect, multiple muscular defects ["Swiss cheese" septum]) or for patients unable to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass for various reasons.

          23,24
         </a>

          27

Feeding difficulties and poor weight gain are often the earliest clinical signs of heart failure in young infants and children. Infants should be followed every two weeks initially to assess growth parameters.

          30
         </a>
         ]. There was no operative mortality, and no excess mortality in children with isolated VSDs compared with children without VSDs (overall mortality was 0.3 percent; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.8 [95% CI 0.5 to 1.4]). Long-term cardiac complications observed in this cohort were rare, including arrhythmias (0.5 percent), aortic regurgitation (0.3 percent), endocarditis (0.1 percent), and pulmonary hypertension (&lt;0.1 percent).

          15

         ]. Early surgical repair results in near-normal long-term growth in the vast majority of patients, and most survivors remain asymptomatic and lead normal lives [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-19,31-34

         ]. In a report from a single center of 215 patients with isolated VSD who underwent surgical repair at a median age of 10 months from 2000 to 2006, there were three deaths over a mean follow-up of 2.1 years (one death occurred during surgery) [

In addition, many published case series include both pediatric and adult patients (including patients with post-myocardial infarction VSD) and therefore do not accurately reflect the outcomes of young patients with isolated congenital VSD.

          Newborn follow-up
         </strong>
         – Patients diagnosed as newborns with moderate to large ventricular septal defects (VSDs) need to be closely followed in the first weeks of life, as this is the time period when onset of heart failure is most likely. In our practice, patients who are well appearing are scheduled for follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist after delivery at three to four weeks of age. In the interim, patients are seen by their primary care provider who monitors growth, changes in the cardiac examination, and the development of signs related to heart failure (eg, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, poor weight gain or failure to thrive, and diaphoresis particularly with feeding). Any of these signs or symptoms should prompt an earlier appointment with the pediatric cardiologist. (See

         <strong>
          Management approach
         </strong>
         – The management of VSDs is primarily dependent on the size of the defect, degree of shunting, and the likelihood of spontaneous closure. Our general approach is as follows (

          Surgical versus transcatheter closure
         </strong>
         – Most patients who require VSD closure undergo primary patch surgical closure, which is associated with excellent outcomes (ie, low surgical mortality, low complication rates, and low reoperation rates). Transcatheter closure is generally reserved for patients with defects that are not amenable to surgical repair (eg, multiple muscular defects that may be difficult to visualize at the time of surgery). Transcatheter VSD closure is technically challenging and should be performed only in centers with considerable experience and expertise in interventional catheterization techniques and with surgical backup.

         <a class="local">
          'Surgical repair'

          Long-term management
         </strong>
         – Important aspects of long-term health care maintenance in children with VSDs, particularly those who have not undergone repair, include administering routine childhood vaccinations, monitoring growth parameters, monitoring for symptoms of heart failure, and providing guidance regarding exercise and sports participation. Antibiotic prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         necessary for children with VSDs except during the first six months following repair with prosthetic material or device and/or following repair if there is a residual defect at or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic device. (See
