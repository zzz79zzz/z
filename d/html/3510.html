The initial evaluation of the patient with suspected HF will be reviewed here. Evaluation of the etiology and management of HF and evaluation and treatment of acute decompensated HF are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3485.html" rel="external">"Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3504.html" rel="external">"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3497.html" rel="external">"Approach to diagnosis and evaluation of acute decompensated heart failure in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3454.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121085.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in adults"</a>.) <span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-120053">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-120053" href="/pathway/120053?topicRef=3510&amp;source=see_link">Heart failure: Diagnosis and classification</a>.)</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HF is a complex clinical syndrome identified by presence of current or prior characteristic symptoms, such as dyspnea and fatigue, and evidence of cardiac dysfunction as a cause of these symptoms (eg, abnormal left ventricular [LV] and/or right ventricular [RV] filling and elevated filling pressures) [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. From a hemodynamic perspective, HF is a disorder in which the heart cannot pump blood to the body at a rate commensurate with its needs, or can do so only at the cost of high filling pressures [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Patients with HF may or may not have associated physical signs, such as those related to fluid retention. HF can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or eject blood. (See <a class="local">'Causes and classification'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3485.html" rel="external">"Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3506.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: Hemodynamic alterations and remodeling"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3481.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of heart failure: Neurohumoral adaptations"</a>.)</p><p>There is no single, noninvasive diagnostic test that serves as a gold standard for HF, since it is largely a clinical diagnosis based upon a careful history, physical examination, laboratory and imaging data. While most patients with suspected HF do not require invasive testing for diagnosis, the clinical gold standard for diagnosis of HF is identification of an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at rest or exercise on an invasive hemodynamic exercise test in a patient with symptoms of HF. (See <a class="local">'An approach to diagnosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Hemodynamic exercise test'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical diagnosis of HF is limited to patients with current or prior symptoms of HF (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [ACC/AHA] stages C and D HF) and excludes patients with stage A (at high risk for HF but without structural heart disease or symptoms of HF) or stage B HF (structural heart disease but no symptoms or signs of HF)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120580" href="/d/graphic/120580.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Asymptomatic systolic or diastolic dysfunction are forms of ACC\AHA stage B HF which are not encompassed by the clinical diagnosis of HF but are associated with risk of developing HF. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3485.html" rel="external">"Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy", section on 'Stages in the development of HF'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3479.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of heart failure"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1918663498"><span class="h1">CAUSES AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HF is caused by a number of conditions, including LV dysfunction, RV dysfunction, valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, obstructive lesions in the heart or great vessels, or high-output HF  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130160" href="/d/graphic/130160.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>HF caused by LV dysfunction is commonly categorized according to LV ejection fraction (LVEF):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>HF with LVEF ≤40 percent is known as HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>HF with LVEF of 41 to 49 percent is HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>HF with LVEF ≥50 percent may be caused by HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or a cardiomyopathy (restrictive, hypertrophic, or noncompaction).</p><p></p><p>HF is often referred to as left-sided failure when caused primarily by left heart pathologies (eg, LV, mitral valve, or aortic valve dysfunction). HF is called right-sided when caused by right heart conditions (eg, pulmonary hypertension or RV, pulmonic valve, or tricuspid valve dysfunction). Left HF and right HF may each occur separately or concurrently. Left HF is a common cause of right HF, and most patients with right HF have some element of left HF.</p><p>The functional status of patients with HF is often described using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, with severity of disability ranging from I to IV  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683" href="/d/graphic/52683.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). By definition, all patients with HF have current or prior symptoms of HF. Thus, an asymptomatic patient (NYHA class I) can carry a diagnosis of HF only if symptoms of HF were previously present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3485.html" rel="external">"Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy", section on 'Classification of HF severity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2476024874"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Symptoms and associated conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Identification of symptoms of HF is a key step in diagnosing HF. While a history alone is insufficient to make the diagnosis of HF, a detailed history remains the single best discriminator to determine the acuity, etiology, and rate of progression of HF, and the history often provides important clues to the cause of HF. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3485.html" rel="external">"Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy"</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of HF include those due to excess fluid accumulation (dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, pain from hepatic congestion, and abdominal discomfort due to distention from ascites) and those due to a reduction in cardiac output (fatigue, weakness) that is most pronounced with exertion. Fluid retention in HF is initiated by the fall in cardiac output, leading to alterations in renal function, due in part to activation of the sodium-retaining renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. While left-sided heart failure is a major cause of right-sided failure, right-sided failure also has other causes, including pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid valve and pulmonic valve dysfunction  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130160" href="/d/graphic/130160.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>In a systematic review that included data from 15 studies of patients with suspected HF, dyspnea was the only symptom or sign with high sensitivity (89 percent), but its specificity was low (51 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Other elements of the history had relatively high specificity but low sensitivity: orthopnea (specificity and sensitivity of 89 and 44 percent) and history of myocardial infarction (89 and 26 percent). However, the sensitivity and specificity of these clinical features are likely to vary among different patient populations.</p><p>Important information concerning the acuity of HF is suggested by the presenting symptoms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute and subacute presentations (days to weeks) are characterized primarily by shortness of breath, at rest and/or with exertion. Also common are orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and, with right HF, right upper quadrant discomfort due to acute hepatic congestion, which can be confused with acute cholecystitis. Patients with atrial and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias may complain of palpitations with or without lightheadedness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with acute decompensated HF require prompt diagnosis and management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3497.html" rel="external">"Approach to diagnosis and evaluation of acute decompensated heart failure in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3454.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic presentations (months) differ in that fatigue, anorexia, abdominal distension, and peripheral edema may be more pronounced than dyspnea, as dyspnea may be more subtle and exertional in nature. Because patients developing HF tend to gradually withdraw from physical activity, they are less likely to perceive symptoms. It is therefore important to identify patient activity levels and symptoms during those activities. Over time, pulmonary venous capacitance and lymphatic drainage accommodates to the chronic state of volume overload, leading to less or no fluid accumulation in the alveoli, despite the increase in total lung water and high filling pressures. Patients in this setting present with excessive fatigue and low-output symptoms, and some report dyspnea predominantly with exertion rather than at rest or in the supine position (as with acute HF). Anorexia is secondary to several factors including poor perfusion of the splanchnic circulation, bowel edema, and nausea induced by hepatic congestion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with chronic HF often develop secondary pulmonary hypertension, which can contribute to dyspnea as pulmonary pressures rise with exertion. These patients may also complain of substernal chest pressure, typical of angina. In this setting, elevated RV end-diastolic pressure may cause secondary RV subendocardial ischemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112486.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (group 2 pulmonary hypertension) in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Clinical features such as older age, hypertension, history of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction, history of atrial fibrillation (AF), obesity, and use of a loop diuretic are associated with increased likelihood of HF [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The physical examination can provide evidence of the presence and extent of cardiac filling pressure elevation, right-sided failure, ventricular enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and reduction in cardiac output. Some of the physical examination findings of HF, while not very specific on their own, can be very specific in the setting of typical symptoms of HF, but sensitivity is low, so the absence of physical findings does not exclude HF.</p><p>In a study of primary care patients, a physical finding of a displaced apical impulse had the best combination of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of any physical sign of HF with reduced ejection fraction [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) typically have a nondilated heart, so displacement of the apical impulse is not a helpful finding for diagnosis of HFpEF. Other strong predictors of HF included a gallop rhythm and elevated jugular venous pressure.</p><p>The accuracy of physical signs for the diagnosis of HF was evaluated in the above cited systematic review that included data from 15 studies of patients with suspected HF [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Extra heart sounds were highly specific (99 percent) but had low sensitivity (11 percent). In this population, hepatomegaly was also highly specific (97 percent) but had low sensitivity (17 percent). Greater specificity than sensitivity was also seen for cardiomegaly (85 and 27 percent), lung crepitation (81 and 51 percent), edema (72 and 53 percent), and elevated jugular venous pressure (70 and 52 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Vital signs and appearance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A patient’s general appearance and vital signs may suggest presence of HF, particularly if HF is advanced. An irregularly irregular pulse is suggestive of AF, which frequently accompanies HF. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/977.html" rel="external">"The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with mild or moderate HF may appear completely normal on physical examination, with normal vital signs. However, many patients with normal cardiac output at rest have an inability to augment cardiac output during exercise without excessive increase in filling pressures, resulting in exertional fatigue and intolerance. Right-sided signs with fluid overload are often the presenting sign.</p><p>In contrast, patients with advanced HF may show evidence of decreased tissue perfusion caused by a major decline in cardiac output. Four key findings suggest greater severity of cardiac dysfunction even at steady state: resting sinus tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, diaphoresis, and peripheral vasoconstriction. The last abnormality is manifested as cool, pale, and sometimes cyanotic extremities (due to the combination of decreased perfusion and increased oxygen extraction). Peripheral vasoconstriction may be absent in patients treated with vasodilators. A decrease in cardiac output should be suspected when the pulse pressure is reduced below 25 mmHg or if the proportional pulse pressure (pulse pressure divided by systolic pressure) is less than 20 to 25 percent. Both the cardiac disease itself and the secondary neurohumoral adaptation contribute to the low-output state. Patients compensate for a fall in cardiac output by increasing sympathetic outflow with resultant shunting of the cardiac output to vital organs.</p><p>Pulsus alternans, if present, is virtually pathognomonic of severe LV systolic dysfunction. This phenomenon is characterized by evenly spaced alternating strong and weak peripheral pulses. It is best appreciated by applying light pressure on the peripheral arterial pulse and can be confirmed by measuring the blood pressure. When the cuff pressure is slowly released, phase I Korotkoff sounds are initially heard only during the alternate strong beats; with further release of cuff pressure, the softer sounds of the weak beat also appear. Pulsus alternans can also be appreciated based upon variation in the intensity of the first Korotkoff sound during auscultatory blood pressure assessment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1077.html" rel="external">"Examination of the arterial pulse", section on 'Pulsus alternans'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Volume assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are three major manifestations of volume overload in patients with HF: pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure. Volume overload with right-sided failure can be secondary to left-sided failure, pulmonary hypertension, or valvular disease.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pulmonary congestion that may manifest as rales is more prominent in acute or subacute disease. As noted above, chronic HF is associated with increases in venous capacitance and lymphatic drainage of the lungs, and alterations in the alveolar capillary interface that reduce permeability and fluid transit; as a result, rales (crackles) are often absent even though the pulmonary capillary pressure is elevated. This also explains why evidence of pulmonary edema is often absent on chest radiographs. Continued sodium retention in this setting preferentially accumulates in the periphery, although a chronic elevation in pulmonary venous pressure can lead to pleural effusions. (See <a class="local">'Chest radiograph'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Right-sided failure may be manifested as peripheral edema with swelling of the legs (which is more prominent when the patient has been upright), and ascites, scrotal edema, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In this setting, manual compression of the right upper quadrant to increase venous return may elevate jugular venous pressure above the transient 1 to 3 cm elevations seen in normal individuals. This sign is known as the hepatojugular reflux (also known as the abdominojugular test). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1076.html" rel="external">"Examination of the jugular venous pulse", section on 'Abdominojugular test'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated jugular venous pressure is usually present if peripheral edema is due to HF, since it is the high intracapillary pressure that is responsible for fluid movement into the interstitium. With the patient sitting at 45 degrees, jugular venous pressure can be estimated from the height above the right atrium of venous pulsations in the internal jugular vein. The height of external jugular vein pulsations may also be helpful, but care must be taken to avoid spurious interpretation. In some patients, it is necessary to seat the patient completely upright or at a lower angle to see the meniscus of the jugular venous pressure  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef93791" href="/d/graphic/93791.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1076.html" rel="external">"Examination of the jugular venous pulse"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The accuracy of clinical evaluation of cardiac filling pressures varies among observers, as illustrated by a study of 116 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Signs of elevated right heart filling pressure included increased jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, and ascites. Signs of elevated left heart filling pressure included findings of elevated right heart filling pressure as well as gallops or rales.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Right and left heart filling pressures were accurately estimated by physical examination in 71 and 60 percent of 215 observations. Examination by staff cardiologists was more accurate than by trainees for right heart pressures (82 versus 67 percent) and left heart pressures (71 versus 55 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The use of echocardiography and plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) values did not provide better accuracy than the clinical examination. The accuracy of estimation of right filling pressure by echocardiographic examination of the inferior vena cava (75 percent) was similar to the accuracy of physical examination. The accuracy of estimates of left heart filling pressures by NT-proBNP (67 percent) and by echocardiography E/e’ ratio (60 percent) were also similar to physical examination. (See <a class="local">'NT-proBNP'</a> below and <a class="local">'Echocardiography'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Cardiac examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ventricular chamber size can be estimated by precordial palpation. An apical impulse that is laterally displaced past the midclavicular line is usually indicative of LV enlargement. LV dysfunction can also lead to sustained apical impulse, which may be accompanied by a parasternal lift in the setting of RV hypertrophy or enlargement. The S3 may be palpable in severe ventricular failure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1081.html" rel="external">"Examination of the precordial pulsation"</a>.)</p><p>An S3 (third heart sound) is associated with left atrial pressures exceeding 20 mmHg and increased LV end-diastolic pressures (&gt;15 mmHg). However, there is appreciable interobserver variability in the ability to detect an S3 that cannot be solely explained by the experience of the observer [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. In addition, in a phonocardiographic study of patients who were undergoing cardiac catheterization, an S3 was not very sensitive (40 to 50 percent) for the detection of an elevated LV end-diastolic pressure or a reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF); however, an S3 was highly specific (90 percent) for these parameters and for an elevated serum BNP concentration [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Similarly, an S3 has a low sensitivity (eg, 4 to 11 percent) but high specificity (eg, 99 percent) for clinical diagnosis of HF [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].
