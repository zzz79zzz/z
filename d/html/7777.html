         Approximately 10 percent of the adult population has neck pain at any given time, with a prevalence similar to low back pain. However, few patients with neck pain lose time from work and less than 1 percent develop neurologic deficits.
        </p>
        <p>
         The majority of patients, regardless of the etiology of pain, will recover with conservative therapy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, those with symptoms severe or persistent enough to require medical attention often present a management challenge due to the variability of patient symptoms and physical examination findings, lack of specificity on diagnostic imaging, and a relative lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of neck pain without upper extremity symptoms (radiculopathy) is reviewed here. The evaluation and management of cervical radiculopathy and cervical spondylotic myelopathy are discussed elsewhere. (See

         The goals of any treatment plan are to minimize pain, muscle irritability, and spasm; to reestablish normal cervical lordosis; and to restore maximum function. Initial treatment is individualized and based upon the duration and severity of symptoms, the extent of functional disability, and risk factors for the development of chronic pain and is modified if associated neurologic symptoms or signs develop.
        </p>
        <p>
         We define the duration of neck pain symptoms as follows:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Although degenerative change of the cervical spine is the most common cause of neck pain, there are a number of conditions (eg, cervical strain, discogenic pain, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis [DISH], whiplash syndrome, and myofascial pain) that can also cause neck pain (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7773.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of the adult patient with neck pain", section on 'Musculoskeletal conditions'
         </a>
         ). However, in patients with nonradicular neck pain (neck pain without radiculopathy), initial treatment directed at the specific cause of pain has not been shown to lead to improved outcomes compared with nonspecific treatment. There is, however, a lack of high-quality data supporting management approach for these patients; our strategy is based upon our clinical experience.

         Most mild to moderate cervical strains resolve within the first three weeks with conservative measures (see
         <a class="local">
          'Initial treatment for all patients'
         </a>
         below). Patients with more severe neck pain, and particularly those with whiplash injuries, may have persistent symptoms, including headache, for longer periods of time [

        </p>
        <p>
         The management strategy described below only applies to patients without radicular complaints; if at any point neurologic symptoms or signs develop, the treatment approach will change. (See

         Initial treatment for all patients with acute neck pain (duration less than six weeks) includes patient education, postural (mechanical) modification, early mobilization through participation in a home exercise program, and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy if needed. For patients with resolved neck pain, we encourage adherence with proper posture and sleep position, as well as participation in the home exercise program to prevent a recurrence of symptoms.
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">

         </span>
         <strong>
          Patient education and reassurance
         </strong>
         – The treatment of any patient with neck pain should incorporate education regarding the ubiquity of the condition; the natural history of the condition, including the high likelihood for recovery regardless of anatomic findings; reassurance that the severity of perceived pain is greater the degree of tissue injury; the importance of mental health, physical fitness, proper posture, and ergonomics; and regular, sufficient sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If the patient has already had imaging with "abnormal" findings documented (eg, mild disc herniation, facet osteoarthritis), they should be educated regarding the high prevalence of such abnormal findings even among people without symptoms, and the likelihood that these abnormalities predated symptoms and will persist after symptom improvement. Every effort should be made to help patients avoid fixating on these abnormalities.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         <strong>
          Posture and sleep position modifications
         </strong>
         – Simple posture modifications to correct muscle tension are an essential part of the treatment regimen for neck pain; such modifications include sitting straight with the crown of the head tall, chin minimally tilted down, shoulders down, and the scapula retracted and depressed  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70254" href="/z/d/graphic/70254.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). While doing desk work, the natural tendency is to shrug and round the shoulders forward, crane the neck, and intermittently breath-hold  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57310" href="/z/d/graphic/57310.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). Learning to recognize and adopt a neutral posture and engage in a natural, regular breathing pattern may allow the patient to correct contributors to neck muscle tension.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, pain is greatly influenced by associations and context; while proper posture and ergonomic setup is encouraged, data are sparse to suggest that appropriate ergonomic setup improves pain [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Overemphasis on a single, optimal posture may be misguided. Frequent position adjustments to allow changes in joint position, muscle length, blood flow to spinal structures, and body posture may provide more benefit  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef129197" href="/z/d/graphic/129197.html" rel="external">
          movie 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For these reasons, avoidance of a sustained seated position is beneficial. Patients should limit time spent sitting in front of a computer monitor, prolonged telephone (handset) use, and excessive fine motor handwork [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In addition to maintaining a neutral posture, patients with sedentary jobs should make an effort to stand and walk frequently during the day and perform cervical range of motion exercises while at work.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For those who carry heavy purses or backpacks (particularly ones that are worn over one shoulder), minimization of weight or discontinuation of use may help alleviate acute neck pain.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Mechanical adjustment to sleep position is another important postural correction that can decrease neck pain. While sleeping, the head and neck should be aligned with the body. A preferred sleep position is to have the patient lie flat on their back with thighs elevated on pillows with a relatively small pillow under the head and neck, thereby flattening the long spinal muscles. For side sleepers, use of a slightly larger pillow may help maintain proper cervical spine alignment  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef129198" href="/z/d/graphic/129198.html" rel="external">
          movie 2
         </a>
         ). For patients with cervical foraminal stenosis (due to uncovertebral hypertrophy or foraminal disc herniation), avoidance of cervical extension is particularly helpful.

          Home exercise program
         </strong>
         – Early mobilization with participation in a home exercise program helps patients maintain cervical range of motion and encourages them to become active participants in their own care. Gentle stretching exercises, including shoulder rolls and neck stretches, should be performed on a daily basis as tolerated:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Prior to each exercise session, we encourage patients to warm their neck and upper back muscles in a bathtub or shower, or with a heating pad or warmed, moist towels. The muscles should be gently stretched in sets of 10 to 15 repetitions as tolerated. It is best to perform the exercises at least twice daily: in the morning and just before bedtime. They can be performed up to four times daily if possible. (See
         <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/z/d/html/715.html" rel="external">

         For those patients whose pain has resolved, the home exercise program should be continued to maintain neck range of motion and flexibility. We encourage patients to perform the stretching exercises three times per week. In a meta-analysis of five randomized trials comparing exercise with education only or with no intervention, the odds of a new episode of neck pain was reduced by 49 percent in the exercise group compared with the education and no intervention groups (95% CI 0.31-0.76); however, conclusions are limited by methodologic shortcomings in several of the included studies [

          Topical heat or cold
         </strong>
         – The use of topical heat or cold may help with the short-term pain relief in some patients with acute neck pain. Care should be taken to avoid the application of extreme heat or cold to the skin (eg, if using a heating pad, keep the setting low enough to avoid burning the skin; if using ice, wrap the ice to avoid direct contact with skin) and to limit exposure to 15 minutes at a time. Heat or cold can be applied every two to three hours as needed.

         For patients with acute neck pain and more significant discomfort, we use pharmacologic therapy for additional symptom management. Although nonpharmacologic therapy is generally preferred over pharmacologic therapy, they are commonly used together in clinical practice. The goal of medications is to provide symptomatic relief of pain symptoms while allowing the patient to participate in a home exercise program.

However, consistent with a biopsychosocial approach to chronic pain management, we refer patients with chronic neck for multimodal care, including psychologic and mind-body therapies as well as movement-based treatment. For all patients with chronic neck pain, multimodal care combining exercise with other therapies has most consistently demonstrated benefit [

         For all patients with chronic neck pain (pain that persists beyond 12 weeks) despite the above treatments, we refer for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) if they have not yet been referred. In addition, patients are encouraged to continue to exercise through a physical therapy provider or other appropriate exercise program. Particular exercises that we find beneficial include mind-body exercise therapies, such as Tai Chi, Qigong, and yoga. These therapies are appropriate for patients of all ages and fitness levels and can be performed concurrent with CBT. (See

        <p>
         In addition, for some patients with chronic neck pain, particularly those with pain due to suspected facet joint syndrome, we may refer for an interventional treatment such as cervical medial branch block and, if successful, a percutaneous radiofrequency neurotomy. (See

         Other treatments, including manual therapy and joint mobilization, may be helpful for patients with chronic neck pain due to whiplash injury. In addition, acupuncture and massage treatments may provide additional benefits for some patients with chronic neck pain of any etiology, and trigger point injections may be helpful for chronic neck pain patients with taut bands or significant muscle tightness. Treatment with traditional spinal manipulation may be appropriate for younger patients (under age 55 years old) with chronic neck pain and no evidence of central spinal stenosis. (See

         <a class="local">
          'Adjunctive pharmacologic therapy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         For those patients who are being treated with pharmacologic therapy but are unable to discontinue medications due to significant discomfort, we use continued adjunctive pharmacologic therapy for additional symptom management while continuing nonpharmacologic therapies. Medications are used to minimize functional disability and provide sufficient pain relief to allow patient participation in active therapies.

          Physical therapy
         </strong>
         – Although physical therapy programs can vary widely in their content, components generally include patient education, postural modification, and activities that encourage movement, improve strength, and preserve or increase range of motion. The goal of physical therapy is patient independence with their exercise regimen and avoidance of chronic dependence on other treatments. In addition, physical therapists can also provide insights into worksite and recreational ergonomics.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When prescribing physical therapy, the clinician should include a diagnosis (eg, neck pain), a proposed frequency and duration of sessions (eg, two times a week for six weeks), and any comorbidities that may negatively impact an exercise regimen (eg, poor bone density, evidence of severe stenosis or nerve compression on imaging studies, diminished pain or temperature sensation that may increase the risk of burns from a hot pack, and the presence of implanted metal devices that might be affected by electrical stimulation).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         There are a wide range of different physical therapy techniques, but there is a lack of high-quality data to suggest the superiority of one modality over another. In a meta-analysis of 39 trials in patients with chronic neck pain, resistance and motor control exercises were effective for reducing neck pain and improving disability, when measured at three to five months [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Motor control exercises were most effective for improving disability compared with other exercises. In another meta-analysis including 27 trials, different exercise interventions in people with neck pain were evaluated [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. In patients with chronic neck pain, exercises that included cervical and shoulder strengthening and stabilization had a beneficial effect on pain at intermediate-term follow-up (between 3 to 12 months).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The optimal number of physical therapy sessions is not clear [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ], and the benefit of physical therapy and supervised exercise may differ between settings and between specific subgroups of patients with chronic neck pain. As an example, in a randomized trial of patients with chronic neck pain due to whiplash injury comparing exercise and advice, there was no difference in pain at 12 months between those participating in 20 sessions of a comprehensive exercise program and those receiving only advice [

         In addition, the results of supervised activity for the management of neck pain are mixed. In a randomized trial of 180 female office workers with neck pain greater than six months' duration, strength training and dynamic neck exercise were compared with no intervention for the treatment of neck pain [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

          22

         Manipulation techniques broadly include manual therapy and joint mobilization. Manual therapy and joint mobilization are "hands-on" manipulation techniques typically used by chiropractors, osteopathic clinicians, and physical therapists to increase joint and soft tissue mobility and flexibility. These techniques may be performed at low velocity and not beyond the normal end-range of movement. Spinal manipulation refers to a form of manual therapy that involves the movement of a joint near the end of its clinical range of motion, but it is not limited to low-velocity manipulations. (See

          Manual therapy and joint mobilization
         </strong>
         – Manual therapy with gentle mobilization may be an appropriate adjunctive treatment modality for some patients with acute neck pain (eg, those with more severe pain, whiplash injury, significant functional impairment and kinesiophobia) in combination with physical or movement-based therapy. As an example, in a randomized trial of 94 patients with mechanical neck pain, a combination of manual therapy plus exercise (biweekly for three weeks) led to decreased disability scores at both short and long term, greater pain relief at short term, and increased patient perception of recovery compared with minimal care (advice, mobility exercise, and sham ultrasound) [

          Spinal manipulation
         </strong>
         – In the absence of myelopathy or radiculopathy, spinal manipulation is an option for symptomatic management of patients with subacute and chronic neck pain who fail to improve despite education, home exercise, postural modification, and analgesics. Spinal manipulation may also be used as an adjunctive therapy for the management of acute pain flares in these patients.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We do not refer patients with acute neck pain for traditional high-velocity manipulation of the cervical spine as first-line treatment, given the unproven benefit and the small risk for serious adverse outcomes [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Spinal manipulation may be effective for managing neck pain, but it is no more effective than other forms of therapy including exercise. In one trial of 270 patients with acute or subacute neck pain (2 to 12 weeks' duration) randomly assigned to spinal manipulation, pharmacotherapy, or home exercise, spinal manipulation resulted in decreased neck pain at 52 weeks compared with pharmacotherapy [
         <a href="#rid31">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition, like manual therapy, spinal manipulation is likely of benefit only when performed in conjunction with exercise or physical therapy. In a systematic review of randomized trials, spinal manipulation and/or mobilization for mechanical neck pain were not helpful when done alone but were beneficial when performed in conjunction with exercise [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32

         There are theoretical risks of serious adverse effects associated with cervical spinal manipulation, particularly among those with central spinal stenosis. For example, in a systematic review of patients with neck pain, while there were short-term benefits of cervical spinal manipulation, there was also a very small risk for serious adverse outcomes (5 to 10 per 10 million manipulations), including permanent impairment or death [

         For patients with more severe pain symptoms, particularly those with pain due to whiplash injury, and patients with significant functional impairment and kinesiophobia, we typically refer for physical therapy at approximately four weeks.

          Interventional treatments for chronic neck pain
         </strong>
         – For some patients with chronic neck pain, certain interventional treatments may be beneficial (eg, dry needling and trigger point injections for those with prominent myofascial pain and taut bands; and cervical medial branch block or percutaneous radiofrequency neurotomy for severe or persistent neck pain due to whiplash injury, cervical facet arthropathy, or cervicogenic headaches). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Interventional treatments'
         </a>
         above.)

          Therapies we do not routinely recommend
         </strong>
         – We do not routinely recommend the use of cervical collars, low-level laser light therapy (LLLT), cervical traction, botulinum toxin injections, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), electromagnetic therapy, or surgery for the treatment of nonradicular neck pain. (See
