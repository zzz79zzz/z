Common skin biopsy procedures are reviewed here. Biopsy of the nail apparatus is discussed separately. The elliptical excision technique, Mohs surgery, and the prevention and treatment of skin surgery complications are also discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13709.html" rel="external">"Nail biopsy: Indications and techniques"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13707.html" rel="external">"Fusiform/elliptical excision"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13708.html" rel="external">"Mohs surgery"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17042.html" rel="external">"Skin surgery: Prevention and treatment of complications"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Biopsy is indicated in the following circumstances  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67185" href="/d/graphic/67185.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suspected neoplastic lesions</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bullous disorders</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hair disorders</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To confirm a clinical diagnosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atypical presentation of a skin lesion/eruption</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Skin lesion/eruption for which the clinical differential diagnosis is broad</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To obtain tissue samples for microbiologic cultures</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To evaluate unexpected poor response to therapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To evaluate skin symptoms in the absence of findings</p><p></p><p>Biopsy is primarily performed to establish a diagnosis, but occasionally, it can also serve as the definitive treatment for irritated; inflamed; precancerous; or small, malignant lesions [<a href="#rid2">2,3,6</a>]. However, for malignant lesions, a pathologic report indicating that the biopsy margins are "clear" does not necessarily mean that there has been adequate therapy. Re-excision may be needed for appropriate surgical management.</p><p>Skin biopsy also has an emerging role in the diagnosis of disorders of the peripheral nervous system, including progressive myoclonic epilepsy, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), small fiber neuropathies, and neuroaxonal dystrophy, even in the absence of visible skin changes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5277.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of peripheral nerve and muscle disease", section on 'Skin biopsy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1091.html" rel="external">"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)", section on 'Skin biopsy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14144.html" rel="external">"Skin biopsy for the evaluation of peripheral nerve disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are few absolute contraindications to skin biopsy. It should not usually be performed at an infected site, although occasionally, infection is the indication for the procedure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H274145095"><span class="h1">PREPROCEDURE CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to proceeding to a skin biopsy, patients should be asked about allergies to topical antibiotics, antiseptics, local anesthetics, and reactions to tape. Inquiries should also be made regarding bleeding disorders, bleeding with previous surgery, and use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1315.html" rel="external">"Preoperative assessment of bleeding risk"</a>.)</p><p>Excessive bleeding is rarely a problem in patients taking oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Patients taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> can generally be managed with careful attention to hemostasis and the use of a pressure dressing (see <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below). These medications should generally not be discontinued for simple skin biopsies. Consider referring patients on anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents to a dermatologist or surgeon for biopsies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17042.html" rel="external">"Skin surgery: Prevention and treatment of complications", section on 'Patients on anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with bleeding disorders, we suggest referral to a dermatologist or surgeon for skin biopsies. Similar careful consideration is warranted in patients with severe thrombocytopenia or hematologic malignancies.</p><p>Universal precautions should be observed by wearing gloves and eye guards.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1845132319"><span class="h1">PREPROCEDURE CONSIDERATIONS IN CHILDREN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Skin biopsy in pediatric patients provides unique challenges. Rates of needle phobia in children may be as high as 60 percent [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Understanding the child's prior experiences with medical care is essential to accomplishing the procedure and minimizing anxiety for the patient and parent/caregiver. Other interventions, such as vibratory devices and distraction, may help to decrease pain and anxiety (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6324.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics", section on 'Methods to decrease injection pain'</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. We avoid promising any child that a procedure will be "pain free."</p><p>Though injection of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> or other local anesthesia is essential for adequate procedural pain control, additional use of topical preparations (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9561" href="/d/drug information/9561.html" rel="external">lidocaine-prilocaine</a> cream [eutectic mixture of local anesthetics]) can be offered prior to the procedure to decrease pain. Additional recommendations on minimizing pain with injection of lidocaine are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinicians should be aware of the maximum allowable doses for topical anesthesia in infants and children as well as the maximum dose of intralesional <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9559" href="/d/drug information/9559.html" rel="external">lidocaine-epinephrine</a> based on the child's weight. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6338.html" rel="external">"Clinical use of topical anesthetics in children", section on 'Agents for intact skin'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6324.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics"</a>.)</p><p>Child life specialists, when available, should be utilized for biopsy in children.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infants</strong> – Skin biopsy procedures in infants are otherwise similar to adults, though with the consideration that the infant subcutis may be thinner than in older children or adults. Avoid dressings that could be dislodged and become a choking hazard for the infant. Clinicians with expertise in pediatric dermatology should be involved in skin biopsy of premature infants.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Toddlers and young children</strong> – Most young children will not be able to reason and understand the importance of the procedure. Clinicians should discuss with the parent/guardian options to hold young children safely. Biopsy of some body sites (eg, periocular skin) may not be completed safely in an awake child. Additional sedation with the assistance of a pediatric anesthesiologist may be discussed if a biopsy is essential to patient care. Care should be taken to complete the procedure as quickly as possible, with all medications, instruments, and dressings ready for immediate use. When possible, we find that having a parent/guardian present and holding and comforting the child to be helpful, with additional staff members assisting to ensure the child is still for the duration of the procedure. Some parents/guardians may not feel comfortable participating in this way. Use of distraction and/or vibration devices may improve tolerability of the procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Older children and teenagers</strong> – Depending on the developmental stage of the child, an age-appropriate explanation of the biopsy procedure should be undertaken with older children and teenagers along with consent from the parent/guardian. There is considerable variation in the ability of older children to understand and tolerate painful medical procedures, though techniques involving distraction and vibratory devices can be helpful in most cases. Older children or children with developmental disabilities who are unable to sit still often cannot be safely restrained for a biopsy and may require a sedated procedure if a biopsy is medically essential. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6330.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in children: Approach"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94569.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for the child with autism"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1754403187"><span class="h1">SITE SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Site selection can be critical to diagnosis. The appropriate biopsy site depends upon the type and location of lesion or eruption. The location of biopsy <strong>within</strong> a particular lesion also depends upon the type and size of the lesion. The clinician should identify unadulterated primary lesions for biopsy. Older lesions with secondary changes, such as crusts, fissures, erosions, excoriations, and ulcerations, should be avoided since the primary pathologic process may be obscured. Multiple sites may be biopsied if the differential diagnosis is broad to minimize sampling error.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inflammatory lesions </strong>– For inflammatory lesions, those with characteristic acute, inflammatory changes (eg, erythema) should be biopsied first. Evolutionary changes may take time, so biopsies performed too early and very late lesions may reveal only nonspecific or secondary features [<a href="#rid2">2,5,10-12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vesicobullous lesions</strong> – For blistering diseases, early evolving lesions have more specific histopathology and are preferred for biopsy. Only the newest vesicles and blisters should be biopsied (ideally within 48 hours of their appearance). The specimen should include intact epidermis (normal-appearing skin adjacent to the blister) for examination of the dermal-epidermal junction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13684.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with cutaneous blisters", section on 'Skin biopsy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Vesicles</strong> – When vesicles are biopsied, remove vesicles intact (when possible) with adjacent normal-appearing skin. Disruption makes histologic interpretation more difficult.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Bullae</strong> – Bullae should be biopsied at the edge to include a small part of the blister with adjacent intact skin, keeping the blister roof attached. This technique is important for diagnosis; it allows the pathologist to determine the level of blister formation within the skin (eg, subcorneal, intraepidermal, subepidermal).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonbullous lesions</strong> – For nonbullous lesions, the biopsy should include maximal lesional skin and minimal normal skin. For lesions between 1 and 4 mm in diameter, biopsy the center or excise the entire lesion. For large primary lesions, biopsy the edge, the thickest portion, or the area that is most abnormal in color or texture. These sites will most likely contain the distinctive pathology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lesions on cosmetically sensitive areas </strong>– Cosmetically sensitive areas, such as the face, should be avoided, if possible, when choosing a biopsy site for a generalized process. When there are individual suspicious lesions involving the face or other cosmetically important areas, it may be preferable to refer the patient to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon with expertise in operating in such areas.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Poor healing areas</strong> – Areas with poor healing characteristics, such as distal lower extremities, should be avoided if possible.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3149917073"><span class="h1">SITE IDENTIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is important to identify the biopsy site before performing the definitive surgical treatment to avoid wrong site surgery [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Several methods have been used for the identification of the biopsy site, including recording in medical records an accurate description of the lesion and surrounding anatomic landmarks and/or measurements from at least two fixed landmarks, marking the site with tattoo ink, and taking a photograph of the biopsy site. There is consensus among experts that taking a high-quality photograph of the lesion that includes one or more visible anatomic landmarks at the time of biopsy provides a quick and unequivocal documentation of the biopsy site [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. A photograph on the patient's cell phone can be easily transported to a surgeon for treatment if required. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17042.html" rel="external">"Skin surgery: Prevention and treatment of complications", section on 'Preventing wrong site surgery'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">BIOPSY SITE PREPARATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Antisepsis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Office-based dermatologic procedures are performed under varying degrees of antisepsis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clean technique</strong> – Clean technique involves good hand hygiene, clean gloves, efforts to prevent contamination, and routine cleaning of the site [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Shave and punch biopsies typically use clean, not sterile, technique. Mask, gown, and sterile gloves are not necessary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aseptic technique</strong> – Aseptic technique involves maintaining an environment that prevents infection and use of sterile attire, sterile equipment, antiseptic skin preparations, and environmental controls [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Mask, gown, and sterile gloves are indicated for excisional biopsies and are reasonable for any patient at increased risk of infection [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p>Several studies and a systematic review and meta-analysis have shown no significant difference in infection rates between sterile and clean gloves for simple outpatient dermatologic procedures [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2923907787"><span class="h2">Preparing the patient</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient should be provided with all information necessary to obtain an informed consent. This typically includes the nature of the condition, goals of the biopsy, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure, including the option to refuse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15076.html" rel="external">"Informed procedural consent"</a>.)</p><p>To ensure patient safety, the patient should be placed in a recumbent position in the event of a vasovagal reaction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Preparing the site</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any common skin antiseptic, such as isopropyl alcohol, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9801" href="/d/drug information/9801.html" rel="external">povidone iodine</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate, can be used to prepare the biopsy site [<a href="#rid3">3,10,11</a>]. Mark the intended lesion with a surgical marker since it may be temporarily obliterated following injection of the anesthetic. Marking the outlines for excisional biopsies can also be helpful. For excisions, place a fenestrated surgical drape over the biopsy site after the area is cleansed and anesthetized.</p><p>Round wounds tend to be pulled open along the direction of skin tension lines, known as Langer lines [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. Surgical incisions placed parallel to tension lines will close more easily and cosmetically than those placed at right angles [<a href="#rid6">6,19-21</a>].</p><p>The tension lines can be demonstrated by gently compressing relaxed skin with the thumb and index finger  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79204" href="/d/graphic/79204.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>); on the face, wrinkle lines are another good indicator. On the lower extremities, the biopsy ellipse should be parallel to the long axis of the extremity and not transverse.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most commonly used local anesthetic is 1% or 2% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a>. The combination of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9559" href="/d/drug information/9559.html" rel="external">lidocaine-epinephrine</a> (eg, lidocaine hydrochloride 1% or 2% and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> 1:100,000 or 1:200,000) has several advantages over lidocaine alone: blood vessel constriction, decreased bleeding, prolonged anesthesia, and reduced lidocaine toxicity [<a href="#rid3">3,22</a>].

The two major categories of suture are absorbable and nonabsorbable:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Absorbable sutures</strong> – Absorbable sutures are made from synthetic polymer or mammalian-derived collagen (gut). Common synthetic absorbables include polyglactic acid (Vicryl), polyglycolic acid, and polydioxanone (PDS). Absorbable sutures are usually placed deep in larger wounds to reduce skin tension for the superficial closure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6319.html" rel="external">"Skin laceration repair with sutures"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Nonabsorbable sutures</strong> – Nonabsorbable sutures are used for skin closure and permanent internal placement. Common nonabsorbable sutures include silk, nylon, and polypropylene (Prolene). Silk and nylon sutures can be braided, adding strength and improving knotting potential, but they are more likely to harbor infection. Polypropylene and unbraided nylon are monofilaments and are less likely to harbor infection, but knots are less secure and more difficult to tie [<a href="#rid19">19,45</a>]. Polypropylene should be considered for the scalp, primarily because it is blue and easy to see. Silk and gut, as natural materials, cause considerable tissue inflammation and have been largely replaced by synthetic suture material [<a href="#rid19">19,45</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Suture size is indicated by the code 0: The more 0's, the smaller the suture diameter.

Three types of needle points are common: cutting, tapered, and blunt. Cutting needles allow for easy passage through tough tissue and are ideal for skin.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A code has been developed to denote the purpose of the needle. For skin (FS) and cutting needles (CE) are used on thick skin, while plastic (P), plastic skin (PS), and premium (PRE) are used for cosmetic closures. The size of the needle is ranked by a number, with higher numbers identifying larger needles. Needle curvature is measured in terms of proportion of a circle, with one-quarter, one-half, and three-eighths curves available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most biopsy wounds in thick skin can be closed using an FS-3 or CE-3 needle; P-3 can be used for the face, all with a three-eighths curvature. C-17 needles were developed specifically to close punch biopsies and are less expensive than FS, CE, P, or PRE needles.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is important to reassess the appropriateness of the instruments when wound closing seems more difficult than expected. Needle selection is often a prime factor determining the ease of suturing and final cosmetic result [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. A larger needle may decrease the difficulty of the job. The needle driver must also be appropriate for the size and type of needle.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h3">Closing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common closure technique is a simple, interrupted suture [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To begin, grasp the needle with the needle holder at midpoint or approximately one-third the distance from the eye. This will provide maximum driving force and diminish the likelihood of bending or breaking the needle. A palm grip is recommended to increase the driving force of the needle through the skin. Place the handle of the holder in the palm, wrap the thumb and fingers around the handles, and extend the index finger down over the tip of the holder near the needle. When holding the skin edges with forceps, be careful to squeeze firmly. Skin should be handled only by forceps with teeth, not with blunt, flat forceps.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The needle point is placed perpendicular to the skin surface approximately 2 mm away from the wound edge and is driven down, then up into the center of the wound. A second insertion begins in the center of the wound and exits the skin on the opposite side, 2 mm from the wound edge, perpendicular to the surface. If done properly, the suture will make a flask-shaped loop; the loop beneath the skin surface is farther apart than the entry and exit points on the surface. A needle exit in the middle of the wound is not necessary for small excisional wounds and for most punch wounds but depends upon the size of the needle and the ease that the wound edges can be approximated and everted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To tie the suture, hold the needle holder parallel to the long axis of the wound with the free end and needle end of the suture on either side of the holder. Wrap the needle end of the suture twice around the holder, then grasp the free end of the suture with the holder and pull through, tightening the knot. At this point, the needle end and free end of the suture should have switched sides relative to the beginning. The process is repeated as needed, reversing the position of the free end and needle end of the suture with each knot. "Approximate, don't strangulate" acknowledges the importance of proper tension on the suture. Excessive tension can be recognized by blanching of the wound edges and may indicate the need for subcutaneous sutures or simply less tension on each suture.</p><p></p><p>Placement of sutures for elliptical excisions can be facilitated by following the "rule of halves" [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The wound is divided in half by the initial suture placement, and each half is itself halved by the subsequent placement of sutures  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96327" href="/d/graphic/96327.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). Similar halving continues until all wound edges are approximated. Starting the initial suture at an apex rather than the middle runs the risk of "dog ears" at the opposite apex owing to the creation of uneven wound edges.</p><p>The skin tension can be reduced in large wounds by placing a temporary initial suture at the midpoint of the wound but farther from the edge than usual.

Showering is permitted after 24 hours for sutured wounds, but bathing, swimming, and use of hot tubs are prohibited until the sutures are removed [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h2">Suture removal</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is a balance between the tendency for wound dehiscence or stretching if the sutures are removed too early and the production of suture marks if they remain too long [<a href="#rid19">19,45</a>]. Sutures on the face generally can be removed in three to five days, followed by the application of semipermeable adhesive strips to reduce wound tension [<a href="#rid20">20,45,48</a>]. Sutures on the chest, abdomen, arms, and scalp can be removed in 7 to 10 days, and those on the back and legs can be removed in 12 to 20 days [<a href="#rid20">20,45,48</a>].</p><p>When possible, clinicians should remove sutures from their patients to see the results of their suturing technique on wound healing. Crust should be washed away with wet gauze, then the suture gently lifted near the knot, and one side cut close to the skin surface beneath the knot. The suture is removed by pulling across the wound surface; pulling away from the wound puts tension on the wound and may cause dehiscence [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h1">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The major complications of skin biopsy include scarring, pain, bleeding, infection, wound dehiscence, and allergic (primarily contact dermatitis) reactions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1490599606"><span class="h2">Scarring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Scarring is to be expected with any biopsy that extends into the reticular dermis. Clinicians should try to minimize scar appearance by careful selection of type, orientation, and location of biopsy when possible. Minimizing wound infection and inflammation reduces the potential for abnormal scarring. However, abnormal scarring can occur regardless, particularly on body sites and in patients prone to keloid formation [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. Biopsies in areas of increased skin tension (eg, joints) may result in spread scars.

Skin biopsies may be performed with shave, punch, or excisional techniques. The type of skin lesion and the location of the biopsy are important factors to consider when choosing which procedure to perform. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above and <a class="local">'Site selection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preprocedural considerations</strong> – Prior to proceeding to a skin biopsy, patients should be asked about allergies to topical antibiotics, antiseptics, local anesthetics, and reactions to tape. Inquiries should also be made regarding use of anticoagulants, bleeding disorders, and bleeding with previous surgery. Performing a skin biopsy in children may be challenging and requires special expertise. (See <a class="local">'Preprocedure considerations'</a> above and <a class="local">'Preprocedure considerations in children'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anesthesia</strong> – The most common anesthetic used for skin biopsies is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a>. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9559" href="/d/drug information/9559.html" rel="external">Lidocaine-epinephrine</a> may be used to induce vasoconstriction, which decreases bleeding and prolongs anesthesia. Several techniques are useful for decreasing the pain associated with injection. (See <a class="local">'Anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Biopsy techniques</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Shave biopsy</strong> – Shave biopsies are typically used for lesions for which sampling of the full thickness of the dermis and subcutis is not necessary. Shave biopsies are performed with a number 15 scalpel blade or a razor blade. Aluminum chloride or another topical hemostatic agent is used to control bleeding. (See <a class="local">'Shave biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><strong>Punch biopsy</strong> – Punch biopsies involve the removal of a core-shape piece of tissue and allow sampling of the deep dermis. Punch biopsy wounds can be closed with suture or left to heal by secondary intention. (See <a class="local">'Punch biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Excisional biopsy</strong> – Excisional biopsies are more time consuming than punch or shave biopsies but are useful for biopsies of larger or deeper lesions. Careful technique is necessary to achieve a good cosmetic result and to reduce the risk of complications. (See <a class="local">'Excisional biopsy'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13707.html" rel="external">"Fusiform/elliptical excision"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Excisional biopsy with 1 to 3 mm margins is the preferred procedure for pigmented lesions that are suspicious for melanoma. Only clinicians who are experienced with the deep shave or saucerization biopsy technique should perform this procedure on pigmented lesions. (See <a class="local">'Biopsy of pigmented lesions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathology requisition information</strong> – Clinical information is useful for pathologists as they interpret the findings in skin biopsies. A clinical description of the lesion and brief history should be submitted with a biopsy specimen. (See <a class="local">'Processing the biopsy sample'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postoperative care</strong> – All biopsy wounds should be dressed with a thin film of an occlusive ointment (eg, plain petroleum jelly) to prevent crust formation and then covered with an adhesive bandage. The dressing can be removed in 12 to 24 hours, and the wound should be cleaned with soap and water twice daily. Wounds healing by secondary intention need to be redressed after each cleaning until healed. (See <a class="local">'Postoperative care'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Alguire PC, Mathes BM.
