         Diagnostic classification of sleep disorders is important because it standardizes definitions, improves awareness of the conditions, promotes a broad differential diagnosis, and facilitates a systematic diagnostic approach.
        </p>
        <p>
         The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) is the most widely used classification system for sleep disorders. The text revision of the third edition of the ICSD (ICSD-3-TR) includes seven major categories of sleep disorders [

        <p>
         ICSD-3-TR includes 60 specific diagnoses within the seven major categories, as well as an appendix for classification of sleep disorders associated with medical and neurologic disorders. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM) codes corresponding to each specific diagnosis can be found within the ICSD-3-TR [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. ICD-11-CM will include a separate chapter for sleep-wake disorders, although the timing of its implementation in the United States is not known. ICD-11 codes are also listed in the ICSD-3-TR. Pediatric diagnoses are not distinguished from adult diagnoses within ICSD-3-TR except for sleep-related breathing disorders [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The ICSD-3-TR complements and refers to the regularly updated Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events, published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The text revision of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) also classifies sleep disorders in a manner that largely parallels the ICSD-3-TR system [

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The ICSD-3-TR identifies three distinct types of insomnia: short-term insomnia disorder, chronic insomnia disorder, and other insomnia disorder (when the patient has insomnia symptoms but does not meet criteria for the other two types of insomnia) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Previous editions had subclassified chronic insomnia disorder into primary and comorbid types, but these were eliminated in the ICSD-3 because they did not improve diagnostic accuracy [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         ].

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The ICSD-3-TR consolidates all chronic insomnia diagnoses under a single disorder, chronic insomnia disorder [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Chronic insomnia disorder requires a report of a sleep initiation or sleep maintenance problem, adequate opportunity and circumstances to sleep, and daytime consequences as the result of the insomnia symptoms. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7676.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation and diagnosis of insomnia in adults", section on 'Types of insomnia'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         To meet diagnostic criteria for chronic insomnia disorder, the patient should have symptoms at least three times per week over a duration of three or more months  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117710" href="/z/d/graphic/117710.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). A diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder applies when the insomnia is not solely due to another (comorbid) disorder. However, it is essential that clinicians understand that when insomnia is comorbid with another disorder, it typically becomes independent of, or shares a reciprocal relationship with, the comorbid condition over time. Therefore, independent evaluation and treatment of comorbid insomnia is frequently necessary.

         </span>
         A diagnosis of short-term insomnia disorder must meet the same criteria as chronic insomnia except that the symptoms have been present for less than three months. The development is often temporally related to a significant stressor. To make this diagnosis, the insomnia must be an independent focus for the patient and/or require separate clinical attention. This type of insomnia often resolves when the stressor does, or when the patient develops adequate coping mechanisms or adapts to the stressor [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, in some cases this may evolve into a chronic insomnia disorder.

         Sleep-related breathing disorders are characterized by abnormal respiration during sleep; they occur in both adults and children [

        <p>
         Snoring lies on a continuum between normal and abnormal. Snoring without associated airway compromise, sleep disturbance, or other consequences is essentially normal, whereas heavy snoring is often part of OSA. (See

         Of note, treatment-emergent central sleep apnea (often referred to as complex sleep apnea in the past) was a new addition to the ICSD-3 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The criteria for this disorder include the demonstration of primarily OSA during diagnostic polysomnography. Upon initiation of treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP), there is emergence or persistence of central apneic events despite resolution of obstructive sleep apnea. Symptoms (disturbed sleep, daytime sleepiness, awakening with shortness of breath) are required to establish the diagnosis. These central apneic events also cannot be attributed to another identifiable comorbidity such as Cheyne-Stokes breathing or use of a substance (eg, opioids).
        </p>
        <p>
         Note that some patients may have central apneic events which emerge during initial PAP titration, often when transitioning from wake to sleep. These central events often resolve with implementation of and good adherence to PAP therapy (usually within one month). Verification that these central apneas have resolved can often be made with PAP machine downloads during clinical follow-up. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14911.html" rel="external">

         The OSA disorders include OSA in adults and OSA in children. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6363.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children"

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of OSA in adults is made when there are 15 or more primarily obstructive respiratory events per hour, even in the absence of associated symptoms  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121160" href="/z/d/graphic/121160.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3
         </a>
         ]. In adults, when signs or symptoms (including excessive sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia, or sleep-related impairment in quality of life) are present, the diagnosis of OSA can be made when there are five or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events per hour. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7706.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults", section on 'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although in-laboratory polysomnography has long been used to evaluate for OSA, home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) is an alternative diagnostic test in selected patients  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113434" href="/z/d/graphic/113434.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Many HSAT procedures measure the respiratory disturbance index based on recording time. Thus, it is important to be aware that HSAT may underestimate respiratory event frequency because recording time, and not sleep time, is utilized for the calculation of the index. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7694.html" rel="external">
          "Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pediatric criteria for OSA require that at least one clinical finding (snoring, labored breathing, apnea, daytime sleepiness, hyperactivity, or other findings) is present. Polysomnographic criteria require the presence of one or more obstructive events per hour of sleep or, alternatively, evidence of obstructive hypoventilation (PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         &gt;50 mmHg for &gt;25 percent of sleep time and associated snoring, flattening of nasal airway pressure waveform, or paradoxical thoraco-abdominal movement). (See

Sleep-related laryngospasm and choking are also not considered sleep-related breathing disorders; instead, they are considered medical disorders which may arise from sleep.

        <p>
         In diagnosing central disorders of hypersomnolence, careful evaluation for sleep deprivation (ie, insufficient sleep syndrome) should be carried out, especially in patients who may require longer sleep periods to achieve adequate daytime alertness. Sleep logs and/or actigraphy for at least a week prior to evaluation of objective sleepiness with a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) help verify a regular sleep-wake schedule and adequate sleep time. Diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnolence include MSLT criteria. (See

         Narcolepsy type 1 includes patients with excessive sleepiness plus cataplexy and/or orexin-A (also known as hypocretin-1) deficiency. Narcolepsy type 1 is diagnosed by either cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A deficiency (&lt;110 pg/mL, or less than one-third of the normative values on a standardized assay); or a mean sleep latency of ≤8 minutes and two sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs; within 15 minutes of sleep onset) on an MSLT, accompanied by a history of cataplexy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103709" href="/z/d/graphic/103709.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Excessive sleepiness, cataplexy and single SOREMP on overnight PSG also satisfy the criteria. Note that not all patients with orexin-A deficiency have cataplexy; however, they are still characterized as having narcolepsy type 1. Many will develop cataplexy later in the course of the disorder. Commercial assays for orexin-A determination are now available. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7689.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Narcolepsy type 2 is diagnosed with the same MSLT and SOREMP criteria as described in narcolepsy type 1; however, cataplexy and/or cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A deficiency (if measured) are not present  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103711" href="/z/d/graphic/103711.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). A high rate of false positive MSLTs for narcolepsy type 2 has been described. In all likelihood, many of these false positives are due to inadequate preparation (ie, untreated insufficient sleep and/or altered circadian sleep-wake patterns) prior to testing.

         Idiopathic hypersomnia is diagnosed when the patient has subjective sleepiness with an MSLT showing a mean sleep latency of ≤8 minutes with fewer than two SOREMPs on the MSLT plus the overnight polysomnogram, along with the absence of cataplexy or orexin-A deficiency (if measured).

         In hypersomnia due to a medical disorder or a medication or substance, as well as hypersomnia associated with a psychiatric disorder, the diagnosis can be made without performing an MSLT. Clinical judgment is important in diagnosing all central disorders of hypersomnolence. Furthermore, other sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea or circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders) can give rise to excessive sleep time and hypersomnolence and must be properly diagnosed and treated before the diagnosis of a central disorder of hypersomnolence is made.

         NREM-related parasomnias are disorders of arousal. They include confusional arousals, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and sleep-related eating disorder. (See

         REM-related parasomnias involve the intrusion of the features of REM sleep into wakefulness (eg, sleep paralysis), exaggeration of the features of REM sleep (eg, nightmare disorder), or aberrations of REM sleep physiology (eg, lack of atonia as observed in REM sleep behavior disorder).
        </p>
        <p>
         Diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) requires the presence of repeated episodes of behavior or vocalization during REM sleep. In addition, there must be evidence of REM sleep without atonia during polysomnography. Clinical findings of RBD may also be noted in patients taking certain medications, especially serotonergic antidepressants. In these patients, the diagnosis of RBD is still made (and not parasomnia due to medication or substance) if the diagnostic criteria for RBD are met. A high percentage of patients with the idiopathic variety of RBD will eventually develop an alpha-synucleinopathy, most often Parkinson disease. Therefore, neurological evaluation and follow-up is essential. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Nightmare disorder is characterized by recurrent, highly dysphoric or anxiety-laden dreams that are clearly recalled upon awakening and result in significant distress or impairment. Nightmares are a common element of other disorders, especially post-traumatic stress disorder. This diagnosis is made only when the nightmares become a focus of clinical attention or require independent treatment. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97872.html" rel="external">

         Other parasomnias bear no specific relationship to sleep stage. These include exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, sleep enuresis, parasomnia associated with medical disorders, parasomnia due to a medication or substance, and unspecified parasomnia. (See

         Sleep-related movement disorders are characterized by simple, stereotypic movements that disturb sleep [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </a>
         ]. Patients may or may not be aware of these movements. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms of sleep disturbance (eg, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, fatigue) are required to diagnose a sleep-related movement disorder. Movements that occur during sleep but do not adversely affect sleep or daytime function, or result in distress or injury, are not considered a sleep-related movement disorder. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is also included in this group of disorders; however, dysesthesias during wakefulness are the primary symptom.

         RLS is categorized as a sleep-related movement disorder due to its close association with periodic limb movements and its temporal relationship to sleep onset, even though it does not primarily manifest as simple, stereotypic movements. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4892.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults"

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The ICSD-3-TR diagnostic criteria for RLS include the urge to move the legs and/or the presence of uncomfortable sensations that occur primarily with rest/inactivity. These symptoms are at least partially relieved with movement (as long as the movement persists) and have a circadian aspect in that the symptoms occur primarily in the evening or night [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Also, the ICSD-3-TR criteria require that an associated sleep disorder, distress, or impairment is present. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4892.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults", section on 'Diagnosis'

         Periodic limb movements are frequently noted during polysomnography. For periodic limb movements to be considered a disorder, they must occur on polysomnography more than 15 times per hour in adults or more than 5 times per hour in children. In addition, an individual must report a sleep disturbance or some form of functional impairment that is causally related to the periodic limb movements. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99555.html" rel="external">
          "Polysomnography in the evaluation of abnormal movements during sleep", section on 'Periodic limb movements of sleep'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Periodic limb movement disorder should not be diagnosed with concurrent untreated obstructive sleep apnea, RLS, narcolepsy, or REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), since periodic limb movements are commonly seen with these disorders.

          Insomnia
         </strong>
         – The ICSD-3-TR identifies three distinct types of insomnia: short-term insomnia disorder, chronic insomnia disorder, and other insomnia disorder (when the patient has insomnia symptoms but does not meet criteria for the other two types of insomnia). (See

          Sleep-related breathing disorders
         </strong>
         – Sleep-related breathing disorders are characterized by abnormal respiration during sleep; they occur in both adults and children. There are four major groups of sleep-related breathing disorders: central sleep apnea syndromes, obstructive sleep apnea syndromes, sleep-related hypoventilation disorders, and sleep-related hypoxemia disorder.

          Central disorders of hypersomnolence
         </strong>
         – The central disorders of hypersomnolence include those disorders in which the primary complaint is daytime sleepiness that is not due to another sleep disorder, including disturbed sleep or misaligned circadian rhythms. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders
         </strong>
         – Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are characterized by a chronic or recurrent sleep disturbance or excessive daytime sleepiness due to alteration of the circadian system or misalignment between the environment and an individual's sleep-wake cycle. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders'

          Parasomnias
         </strong>
         – Parasomnias are undesirable physical events (movements, behaviors) or experiences (emotions, perceptions, dreams) that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from sleep. (See

          Sleep-related movement disorders
         </strong>
         – Sleep-related movement disorders are characterized by simple, stereotypic movements that typically disturb sleep. Restless legs syndrome is the most common sleep-related movement disorder, although dysesthesias during wakefulness are the primary symptom. (See
