The importance of intensive glycemic control for protection against microvascular and macrovascular disease in diabetes was demonstrated for type 1 diabetes in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Glycemic targets and the effects of glycemic control on microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 1 diabetes will be reviewed here. Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1760.html" rel="external">"Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mechanism by which lack of glycemic control predisposes to vascular disease is incompletely understood. Two proposed contributing factors are advanced glycation end products and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9940" href="/d/drug information/9940.html" rel="external">sorbitol</a>; protein kinase C and other factors also may contribute  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61356" href="/d/graphic/61356.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). In addition to systemic factors, organ-specific factors also appear to be important. In the kidney, for example, stimulation of mesangial matrix production by hyperglycemia, activation of protein kinase C, and an increasing degree of intraglomerular hypertension may contribute to the glomerular injury.</p><p>Genetic predisposition may be another important factor. This was illustrated in a report from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in which 372 patients and 467 first-degree relatives with diabetes were evaluated [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Severe retinopathy was three times more frequent among the relatives of patients with retinopathy than among relatives of patients who did not have retinopathy. Familial clustering was also noted for diabetic nephropathy. However, genome-wide association and candidate gene association studies generally have been unsuccessful in identifying significant replicable signals for retinopathy or nephropathy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>A more in-depth discussion of the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy can be found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3103.html" rel="external">"Diabetic kidney disease: Pathogenesis and epidemiology", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1756.html" rel="external">"Diabetic retinopathy: Pathogenesis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5279.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of diabetic polyneuropathy", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1480499362"><span class="h1">GLYCEMIC TARGETS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intensive insulin therapy should be attempted in all appropriate patients with type 1 diabetes as early in the course of disease as is safely feasible. Both patient and clinician education and support are required to perform this task safely. Intensive management has been made easier to achieve and safer through advances in the technological aspects of type 1 diabetes management. These include insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), especially when linked in so-called "hybrid closed-loop" devices. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/123060.html" rel="external">"Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1781.html" rel="external">"Glucose monitoring in the ambulatory management of nonpregnant adults with diabetes mellitus", section on 'CGM systems'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1807.html" rel="external">"Measurements of chronic glycemia in diabetes mellitus", section on 'CGM to estimate average glucose'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with type 1 diabetes, lower levels of glycemia result in decreased rates of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy as well as fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and mortality but an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Initiation of intensive therapy as early as possible after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (when there is residual beta cell function) provides the most benefit while reducing the risk of severe hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Microvascular disease'</a> below and <a class="local">'Macrovascular disease'</a> below and <a class="local">'Mortality'</a> below and <a class="local">'Hypoglycemia'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3274419950"><span class="h2">Glycated hemoglobin (A1C)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Selecting an appropriate target glycated hemoglobin (A1C) should be individualized, balancing the anticipated reduction in microvascular and macrovascular complications over time with the immediate risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A reasonable goal of therapy might be an A1C value of &lt;7 percent for most patients (using a Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT]-aligned assay in which the upper limit of normal is 6 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In order to achieve the A1C goal, a fasting glucose of 70 to 120 mg/dL (3.9 to 6.7 mmol/L) and a postprandial glucose (90 to 120 minutes after a meal) less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) were targeted in the DCCT, but higher achieved levels may suffice  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121967" href="/d/graphic/121967.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. If it can be safely achieved, tighter targets, such as &lt;6.5 percent, are reasonable, but there are no clinical trial data to support improved long-term clinical outcomes with tighter targets.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The A1C goal should be set somewhat higher (eg, &lt;7.5 or &lt;8 percent, or higher) for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness, patients with limited life expectancy, very young children or older adults, and individuals with advanced complications or comorbid conditions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129412.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Target for hemoglobin A1c'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing the intensity of glycemic control to achieve A1C levels substantially under the 7 percent threshold is indicated during pregnancy in women with type 1 (and also in type 2 and atypical forms) diabetes since the A1C level in nondiabetic women falls during pregnancy and the demonstrated benefits to the fetus and neonate drive the therapeutic goals. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4802.html" rel="external">"Pregestational (preexisting) diabetes mellitus: Antenatal glycemic control"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The risk of retinopathy in type 1 diabetes does not plateau at an A1C value of 7 percent (using the DCCT assay or its equivalent). The DCCT established a risk gradient between chronic A1C levels and retinopathy such that for every 10 percent lower A1C (for example, 10 to 9 percent or 9 to 8.1 percent), the risk for retinopathy is reduced by 44 percent [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The relationship extends across the entire range of A1C, so that reducing A1C from 7 to 6.3 percent further reduces the risk for retinopathy by 44 percent; however, with lower A1C results, the absolute benefits become progressively smaller  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef129350" href="/d/graphic/129350.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) at the cost of an increased risk of hypoglycemia  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59452" href="/d/graphic/59452.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Similar results have been established for risk of nephropathy. (See <a class="local">'Microvascular disease'</a> below and <a class="local">'Hypoglycemia'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4142583434"><span class="h2">Glycemic variability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The effect of fluctuations in glucose levels within or between days (based on intermittent fingerstick blood glucose determinations or as demonstrated using CGM) on the risk of developing diabetic complications is uncertain. Glucose variability has theoretical clinical implications as it generates free radicals that have been implicated in endothelial damage and the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Control of short-term glycemic variability, in addition to management of chronic hyperglycemia (as measured by A1C), has been hypothesized to potentially protect against microvascular and macrovascular disease [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p>However, analysis of data from the DCCT failed to show that the within-day variability in blood glucose played a role in the development of microvascular complications beyond the influence of the mean glucose [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Additional data are needed to provide convincing evidence for a beneficial effect of reducing short-term glycemic variability on the development and progression of microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications. In a study using CGM, short-term glycemic variability was associated with a higher incidence of hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. It would appear that smoother glycemic control is always a reasonable goal in all patients, ie, avoidance of major spikes or dips in blood glucose where possible.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H357163105"><span class="h1">BENEFITS OF INTENSIVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Microvascular disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prospective Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive therapy aimed at lower levels of glycemia results in decreased rates of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in type 1 diabetes patients [<a href="#rid1">1,10,15</a>]. Similar findings have been noted in subsequent studies and meta-analyses [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>As an example, in a meta-analysis of 12 trials evaluating different glycemic targets in patients with type 1 diabetes, intensive glucose control compared with less rigorous, conventional treatment significantly reduced the risk of developing retinopathy (6.2 versus 23.2 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.27), nephropathy (16.3 versus 28.4 percent, RR 0.56), and neuropathy (4.9 versus 13.9 percent, RR 0.35) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The largest trial in the meta-analysis was the DCCT [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In this trial, patients with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive either conventional therapy or intensive insulin therapy, consisting of multiple daily injections or continuous insulin administration using an insulin pump and guided by frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose. Patients with no retinopathy or nephropathy at baseline were evaluated in the primary prevention study, while those with established disease were evaluated in the secondary intervention study.</p><p>The median A1C values during the 6.5-year DCCT were 7.2 percent with intensive therapy as opposed to 9.1 percent with conventional therapy; the respective mean blood glucose concentrations were 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L) and 235 mg/dL (12.8 mmol/L). The DCCT provided conclusive evidence that strict glycemic control can both delay the onset of microvascular complications (primary prevention) and slow the rate of progression of already-present complications (secondary intervention).</p><p>Following completion of the DCCT in 1993, the conventional treatment group was offered intensive treatment, and 93 percent of DCCT participants (n = 1394) agreed to participate in the observational Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The EDIC follow-up study continues to the present. At the end of the DCCT, the conventional treatment group was taught how to perform intensive therapy and all of the participants were returned to their own health care providers for diabetes care. Differences in A1C levels between the original intensive and conventional treatment groups at the end of the DCCT trial (7.2 and 9.1 percent, respectively) narrowed during follow-up (8.1 and 8.2 percent, respectively, by five years and approximately 7.8 to 7.9 in both original treatment groups for the next 20 years) [<a href="#rid18">18-21</a>].</p><p>The individual microvascular endpoints of the DCCT/EDIC are discussed immediately below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Retinopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Retinopathy has been chosen as the major endpoint in many of the prospective diabetes trials because it is the most common microvascular complication and is relatively easy to quantify and follow. Standard retinal photographs are taken and scored, based upon the number of microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, and other abnormalities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1783.html" rel="external">"Diabetic retinopathy: Classification and clinical features"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1756.html" rel="external">"Diabetic retinopathy: Pathogenesis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary prevention</strong> – The DCCT demonstrated a substantial benefit of intensive insulin therapy in the primary prevention of diabetic retinopathy; at nine years, the incidence of new retinopathy was 12 percent in the intensive therapy group versus 54 percent in the conventional therapy group [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. There was a continuous relation between the degree of glycemic control and the incidence of retinopathy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef129350" href="/d/graphic/129350.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>); the rate of progression increased from 1 per 100 patient-years at a mean A1C value of 5.5 percent up to 9.5 per 100 patient-years at a mean A1C value of 10.5 percent; progressive retinopathy was uncommon at A1C values below 7 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Established retinopathy</strong> – In addition to its efficacy in primary prevention, intensive insulin therapy also slows the rate of progression of mild to moderate retinopathy [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. However, during the first two years of intensive therapy, the DCCT found that retinopathy may worsen  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61305" href="/d/graphic/61305.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>), most commonly in association with an increased number of soft exudates (due to retinal infarcts in the superficial layers) [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. The mechanism leading to worsening retinopathy in the beginning of the trial remains unclear. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1756.html" rel="external">"Diabetic retinopathy: Pathogenesis", section on 'Growth factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This early worsening of retinopathy in the DCCT was transient, largely resolving after 18 to 24 months, and there was clear evidence of benefit from intensive therapy when patients with very mild to moderate nonproliferative retinopathy were followed for nine years [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The incidence of worsening retinopathy in intensively treated patients was higher than in those receiving conventional therapy at one year (7.4 versus 3 percent) but much lower at nine years (25 versus 53 percent)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61305" href="/d/graphic/61305.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Results from the EDIC follow-up study show that intensive insulin therapy for 6.5 years during the DCCT reduced the risk of retinopathy over at least the next 10 years compared with conventional therapy, despite an absence of a difference in A1C values during the post-DCCT trial period [<a href="#rid20">20,25</a>]. This phenomenon has been called "metabolic memory."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advanced retinopathy</strong> – Strict glycemic control is likely of little or no benefit once advanced retinopathy has developed, although high-quality data are lacking. This has been best demonstrated in patients who have undergone pancreas transplantation [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. In one study, for example, 22 transplanted patients (most of whom had advanced retinopathy) were compared with 16 nontransplanted patients with similar disease severity [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Despite the attainment and maintenance of normoglycemia in the transplant group, there was no difference between the groups in the rates of progression of retinopathy or visual loss at two years. There was some suggestion of less deterioration at three years in the transplanted patients.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1002199"><span class="h3">Ocular surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to the benefits of intensive insulin therapy in preventing the development and slowing the progression of retinopathy, intensive insulin therapy during the DCCT (6.5 years) resulted in a reduction in the incidence of diabetes-related ocular surgery (cataract extraction; vitrectomy, retinal-detachment surgery, or both; glaucoma-related surgery; cornea- or lens-related surgery; or enucleation) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Over a median total follow-up of 23 years, significantly fewer patients assigned to intensive therapy required diabetes-related ocular surgery (8.9 versus 13.4 percent of patients in the conventional group; risk reduction 48 percent, 95% CI 29-63 percent). The risk reduction with intensive therapy was eliminated after adjustment for A1C level, indicating that the difference in glycemic control explained essentially all of the benefit of intensive therapy in reducing the need for ocular surgery. Although more patients with than without established retinopathy at baseline required ocular surgeries (107 versus 52 patients in the primary prevention group), the RR reduction with intensive insulin therapy was similar for both cohorts (51 and 45 percent risk reduction for established retinopathy and primary prevention groups, respectively) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Nephropathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of renal failure in developed countries, although the proportion of patients with type 1 diabetes who progress to end-stage kidney disease has declined compared with previous estimates of 30 to 40 percent. There has also been a reduction in the risk of developing albuminuria and in the progression of diabetic nephropathy in general with optimal medical care for blood pressure, glycemic control, lipid management, and the use of agents that block the renin-angiotensin system. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3103.html" rel="external">"Diabetic kidney disease: Pathogenesis and epidemiology", section on 'Incidence and prevalence'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3110.html" rel="external">"Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3052.html" rel="external">"Treatment of diabetic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>Lower levels of glycemia can reduce the incidence of new-onset albuminuria and slow the rate of its progression [<a href="#rid1">1,16</a>]. Intensive insulin therapy, by lowering mean plasma glucose, may act in part by reversing the early glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertrophy that are thought to be risk factors for glomerular injury.

This represented a 42 percent decrease in any of the designated cardiovascular events (95% CI 9-63 percent).</p><p>The difference in levels of glycemic control between the treatment groups, as measured by the A1C during the DCCT, accounted for most of the difference in cardiovascular events between the two groups. Microalbuminuria and albuminuria were also independently associated with cardiovascular outcome, but differences in outcome between the two treatment groups remained after correction for these renal factors. The results indicate that a sustained period of glycemic control (6.5 years in the DCCT study) may have lasting benefit ("metabolic memory") in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in type 1 diabetes. The patients being followed in EDIC, however, were not necessarily on their original randomized treatment (as reflected by the substantial narrowing in the A1C difference between the groups by one year) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Therefore, other long-term health behaviors may have also played a role.</p><p>Mechanisms postulated to account for a benefit of reduced glycemia on cardiovascular events include decreased exposure to advanced glycosylation end products or a secondary consequence of decreased renal disease and autonomic neuropathy that have been implicated in CVD risk. An earlier report from the EDIC study showed that progression of carotid intima-media thickness, a measure of atherosclerosis, was significantly less in those who had received intensive therapy during the DCCT compared with those who had received conventional therapy (progression of intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery 0.032 versus 0.046 mm, respectively) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].

The most common causes of death were CVD (22.4 percent), cancer (19.6 percent), acute diabetes complications (hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; 17.8 percent), and accidents or suicide (19.6 percent). All-cause mortality was higher in patients with higher mean A1C levels and in those with renal disease.

Compared with individuals without diabetes, the risk of mortality was higher in those with type 1 diabetes [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Although the risk was highest in those with the highest A1C values (A1C ≥9.7 percent, HR for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 8.51 and 10.46, respectively), patients with an A1C ≤6.9 percent also had elevated risk (HR 2.36 and 2.92 for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively). However, these findings are tempered by the incomplete assessment of A1C levels for many patients during the eight years of observation, making it difficult to determine if there is still an excess risk of death in patients with consistently good glycemic control from time of diagnosis onward.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2312442538"><span class="h1">POTENTIAL OBSTACLES TO INTENSIVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Hypoglycemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The major adverse event associated with intensive glycemic control is hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].
