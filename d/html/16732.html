Optimal outcomes for these patients require a multidisciplinary approach with oversight by the general or trauma surgeon and care from other specialists including orthopedic, vascular, and plastic surgeons and rehabilitation specialists. In most instances, a course of limb salvage can be attempted even if the patient has a mangled extremity; however, occasionally, the lower extremity injury is so severe that primary amputation at the initial operation is required to save the patient's life. Complications of surgical treatment for lower severe extremity injury are common; early recognition and treatment are important to minimize morbidity and mortality. </p><p>The surgical management of severe lower extremity injuries will be reviewed here. The initial management of severe extremity injury is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15150.html" rel="external">"Severe lower extremity injury in the adult patient"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15121.html" rel="external">"Surgical reconstruction of the lower extremity"</a>.)</p><p>Clinical evaluation and management of upper extremity injuries are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15235.html" rel="external">"Severe upper extremity injury in the adult patient"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120669.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of severe upper extremity injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16527.html" rel="external">"Surgical reconstruction of the upper extremity"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H909592418"><span class="h1">EXTREMITY EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of the lower extremity should include all four functional components of the extremity (nerves, vessels, bones, soft tissues). Injury to three of these four elements constitutes a "mangled extremity." The evaluation and radiologic evaluation of the severely injured extremity is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15150.html" rel="external">"Severe lower extremity injury in the adult patient", section on 'Initial evaluation and management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15150.html" rel="external">"Severe lower extremity injury in the adult patient", section on 'Lower extremity evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H909587619"><span class="h1">LOWER EXTREMITY ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Knowledge of lower extremity anatomy and functional physiology is important for proper preoperative and postoperative extremity assessment.</p><p>The bony structures of the lower extremity include the femur, tibia, and fibula. The musculature is contained within defined compartments including the anterior, posterior, and medial compartments of the thigh  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56894" href="/z/d/graphic/56894.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) and the anterior, lateral, posterior, and deep posterior compartments of the leg  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629" href="/z/d/graphic/68629.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). </p><p>The nerves of the lower extremity are derived from the lumbar plexus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76701" href="/z/d/graphic/76701.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) and include the sciatic, femoral, saphenous, tibial, and peroneal (fibular) nerves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72523" href="/z/d/graphic/72523.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The femoral nerve (L2 through L4)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66562" href="/z/d/graphic/66562.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) is lateral to the common femoral artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51298" href="/z/d/graphic/51298.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). The femoral nerve provides motor branches to the hip and knee extensors and sensation to the anterior thigh, femur, knee joint, and medial leg. The saphenous nerve is the extension of the femoral nerve and is purely sensory.</p><p>The sciatic nerve (L4 through S3)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77473" href="/z/d/graphic/77473.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>) runs posteriorly down the thigh, continuing below the knee after dividing into the tibial and common fibular nerves. It supplies the hip flexors, motor function of the lower leg, and nearly all the sensory function of the lower extremity  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419" href="/z/d/graphic/50419.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). The superficial and deep peroneal (fibular) nerves are derived from the common fibular nerve. The deep peroneal (fibular) nerve passes distally with the anterior tibial artery while the tibial nerve accompanies the posterior tibial artery.</p><p>The lower extremity is perfused by the common femoral artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51298" href="/z/d/graphic/51298.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). The common femoral artery branches into the superficial and deep femoral (ie, profunda femoris) vessels. The superficial femoral artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956" href="/z/d/graphic/72956.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>) runs anteriorly down the thigh between the adductor and quadriceps muscles within the anterior compartment. In the distal third of the femur, the superficial femoral artery is in close proximity to the femur and passes through the adductor canal to become the popliteal artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77245" href="/z/d/graphic/77245.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), which divides at the level of the tibial tuberosity into the anterior tibial artery and tibioperoneal trunk  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54800 graphicRef65590" href="/z/d/graphic/54800.html" rel="external">figure 10A-B</a>), which further divides into the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries. The anterior tibial artery accompanies the deep peroneal (fibular) nerve along the posterior margin of the tibia. The peroneal artery passes adjacent the medial margin of the fibula throughout its course distally. The posterior tibial artery is accompanied by the tibial nerve within the deep posterior compartment. </p><p>The collateral circulation in the lower extremity is derived from the deep femoral artery (profunda femoris)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956" href="/z/d/graphic/72956.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>). Collaterals are poorly developed in younger patients who tend to develop severe acute ischemia with arterial disruption. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H909592820"><span class="h1">LIMB SALVAGE VERSUS AMPUTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to salvage a limb or proceed with primary amputation is difficult. A management algorithm from the Western Trauma Association illustrates the complexity of this decision as well as the lack of high-quality evidence to guide it  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef95992" href="/z/d/graphic/95992.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Machine learning models show some promise in predicting failed limb salvage; however, these prognostic tools should not replace clinical judgement and shared decision making [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>If limb salvage can be accomplished at the index operation without threatening the patient's life, we suggest making the effort even if the patient has multiple risk factors for limb loss. This strategy allows time for the patient and family or other caregivers to accept amputation if it becomes necessary. Provided there is some chance for functional recovery of the limb, initial limb salvage is cost effective [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The downsides of attempting limb salvage include a higher risk of acute kidney injury and possible longer length of stay, although mortality rates are similar [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p>Patients with a severely crushed extremity, traumatic amputation or near-amputation who have destruction of the tissues distal to the injury, mangled stump, excess intervening tissue loss, or in whom the amputated extremity is missing, should undergo a formalized amputation when stable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16695.html" rel="external">"Lower extremity amputation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15186.html" rel="external">"Techniques for lower extremity amputation"</a>.)</p><p>If there is a fracture in the same extremity proximal to the amputation, stabilizing the fracture preserves residual limb length, which may improve the ability to ambulate [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Other generally accepted principles of open fracture management should be followed. (See <a class="local">'Fracture management'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H909588543"><span class="h1">SURGICAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of surgical management is salvaging the limb in a manner that results in optimal function  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121753" href="/z/d/graphic/121753.html" rel="external">figure 11</a>). Patients with life-threatening injuries should undergo a damage control approach, and a small number of patients with devastating injuries will require amputation. (See <a class="local">'Limb salvage versus amputation'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H909588550"><span class="h2">Damage control surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When emergency surgery is indicated to control life-threatening bleeding in the abdomen or chest, lower extremity fractures should be quickly reduced and stabilized with splinting or in-line traction. Damage control chest or abdominal surgery takes priority as long as sites of extremity bleeding remain controlled. Tourniquets and dressings may need to remain in place on the extremity until life-threatening hemorrhage is controlled. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15148.html" rel="external">"Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury"</a>.)</p><p>After life-threatening torso injuries are addressed, the extremity injury can be reassessed. Priorities include definitive control of bleeding sites with vascular ligation or placement of a vascular shunt, debridement of devitalized or grossly contaminated tissue, and quick stabilization of fractures, if possible. Following these measures, soft tissue wounds can be managed with temporary closure using gauze dressings or negative pressure wound dressings. Once the patient has been stabilized in the intensive care unit, plans are made for definitive management.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H909588557"><span class="h3">Vascular ligation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, ligation (arterial or venous) is best tolerated with distal or minor vascular injuries. There is some degree of redundancy of circulation in the lower leg. Ligation of any one of the three vessels (anterior tibial, peroneal, posterior tibial) is a damage control option provided alternative in-line flow to the foot is present.</p><p>Whenever possible, we prefer vascular shunting over arterial ligation as a damage control technique for managing injuries to more proximal arterial structures. Arterial ligation of major vessels should be undertaken with caution only after options for reconstruction have been carefully considered since ligation risks the development of limb-threatening ischemia. If the vascular injury needs to be ligated, the patient should be closely monitored in the postoperative period for evidence of progressive ischemia that may indicate a need for revascularization or amputation depending upon the patient's other injuries and clinical status. </p><p>Similarly, ligation of major veins can cause venous hypertension. This can increase the rate of arterial graft failure in the acute setting and can also increase the incidence of long-term complications such as limb swelling and skin breakdown from venous stasis. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H909588564"><span class="h3">Vascular shunting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A less morbid damage control approach (compared with ligation) for patients with extremity vascular injury is vascular shunting, a technique that has been used for over 50 years [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. A vascular shunt is a synthetic tube that is inserted into the vessel and secured proximally and distally to allow temporary vascular flow past the area of injury. </p><p>Vascular shunts are typically used for proximal arteries and veins (eg, femoral, popliteal) [<a href="#rid7">7-11</a>]. Ischemia in proximal vessels is associated with increased morbidity due to a greater burden of tissue ischemia compared with more distal vessels. Traditionally, an ischemic threshold of six hours was standard, but evidence suggests that in the setting of shock the time to ischemia may be as soon as one hour [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. In these cases, shunting can expedite reperfusion and improve nerve and muscle recovery. Vascular shunting may also be more crucial for injuries in which collateral circulation has been disrupted, such as sizable soft tissue wounds.</p><p>The effectiveness of temporary vascular shunting in patients with severe extremity injury has been demonstrated in studies of combat casualties and in high-volume civilian practices [<a href="#rid7">7-9,14</a>]. In one retrospective review, the use of temporary intravascular shunts in 786 patients treated over a 10-year period was reviewed [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Shunts were placed in the context of damage control to allow stabilization of Gustilo IIIc fractures  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110486" href="/z/d/graphic/110486.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) or limb replantation. In this series of patients at high risk for limb loss, the limb salvage rate was 82 percent. In a later multicenter study using the PROspective Vascular Injury Treatment (PROOVIT) registry, shunts expedited limb perfusion and lowered amputation rates during the early phase of care [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Temporary vascular shunting is preferred in the following clinical circumstances:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Life-threatening non-extremity injuries </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hemodynamic instability, coagulopathy, acidosis, hypothermia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unstable skeleton</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Major wound contamination/infection or wound deficits that preclude soft tissue coverage</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vascular injury requiring a complicated repair</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Resource-limited environment </p><p></p><p>Definitive vascular reconstruction should be performed as soon as the patient is sufficiently stable to undergo the procedure. Systemic anticoagulation is not typically used to maintain shunt patency due to the potential for bleeding from other injuries. (See <a class="local">'Revascularization'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H327021642"><span class="h2">Infection control</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2168429027"><span class="h3">Antibiotics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of infection increases with injury severity (see <a class="local">'Wound complications'</a> below). Early use (within six hours) of antimicrobial agents for open fractures is well established to decrease the incidence of osteomyelitis. The choice of antibiotic depends on Gustilo-Anderson grade of the fracture  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110486" href="/z/d/graphic/110486.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126266" href="/z/d/graphic/126266.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and associated contamination. The duration of therapy depends on fracture grade and timing of soft tissue coverage. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7659.html" rel="external">"Osteomyelitis associated with open fractures in adults", section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>For isolated soft tissue injury, recommendations for antibiotic usage are less clear. Guidelines for combat-related extremity injuries include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9214" href="/z/d/drug information/9214.html" rel="external">cefazolin</a> given within three hours of injury and continued for one to three days [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Antibiotic selection should be as narrow as possible. A review of antibiotic use in military trauma patients with soft tissue injuries compared narrow antibiotic use (cefazolin or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9275" href="/z/d/drug information/9275.html" rel="external">clindamycin</a>) with narrow and expanded gram-negative coverage, based on provider judgement [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. There was no benefit to expanded coverage, and the proportion of resistant gram-negative organisms increased in those who received expanded coverage. </p><p>Antibiotics should be redosed after large-volume blood resuscitation (more than 1.5 to 2 L) is given. A tetanus booster should be given to patients with contaminated wounds who are more than five years out from their last dose, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9983" href="/z/d/drug information/9983.html" rel="external">tetanus immune globulin</a> should be given to unimmunized patients [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H909588585"><span class="h3">Debridement and irrigation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At initial operation, devitalized tissue and foreign material are surgically debrided from the wound. The location and extent of any soft tissue injury and its communication with the skeletal injury are evaluated. Serial debridement of extensive soft tissue injury is often necessary, especially with high-energy injury mechanisms where tissue viability may not be clinically apparent on initial debridement.</p><p>Wounds should be copiously irrigated. The FLOW trial (Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds) demonstrated that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> was superior to a soap solution, and low-pressure was superior to high-pressure lavage in outcomes for open fracture wounds [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. High-pressure irrigation such as pulse lavage should be avoided, as it may displace bacteria deeper into the soft tissues. </p><p>Low-pressure <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> irrigation is an acceptable, low-cost strategy for the irrigation of open fractures and extensive soft tissue injuries. A bulb syringe can be used, and for extensive wounds, cystoscopy irrigation systems are efficient methods for delivering large volumes of irrigation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3066436524"><span class="h3">Antibiotic-impregnated local wound adjuncts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Meticulous debridement remains the mainstay of infection control for traumatic wounds, and no antibiotic regimen or antimicrobial adjunct can replace clinical judgement.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is ongoing interest in local delivery of antibiotics to wounds via implanted substances. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement, mixed with antibiotic powder, can be formed into a chain of beads and left in the wound bed. However, these are most often used as adjuncts to systemic antibiotic therapy. A randomized trial comparing systemic antibiotics alone with antibiotic PMMA beads alone showed no significant difference in infection rates [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Formulations of biodegradable material, such as calcium sulfate, can also be impregnated with antibiotics and will dissolve over time, but high-quality evidence on their efficacy is lacking [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].

This same study demonstrated that the presence of hemorrhagic shock worsens this time-dependent limb salvage curve, further shortening the ischemic threshold of the extremity.

However, if the peroneal artery is the only intact vessel, perfusion of the foot through collaterals may be inadequate and distal bypass to the anterior or posterior tibial artery should be performed if the foot is in jeopardy. One study confirmed this selective approach, emphasizing the importance of Doppler examination in deciding which distal vascular injuries could be safely ligated and which required reconstruction [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

Rates of heterotopic ossification (HO) increase with severity of injury. Civilian trauma-related amputations develop HO at rates of 10 to 30 percent, while military trauma injuries develop HO in 60 to nearly 100 percent of patients. Other risk factors for HO include neurologic injury (brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves), tissue ischemia, and high bioburden of contamination [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. </p><p>Prophylaxis against HO includes radiation therapy, which is often used in civilian trauma patients, to whom it can be administered early (first 72 hours after injury). The bisphosphonate <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8426" href="/z/d/drug information/8426.html" rel="external">etidronate</a> is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for HO prophylaxis; however, HO often progresses after treatment is stopped. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce rates of HO formation, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are often used for both pain control and HO prophylaxis.

Excision of HO should be done in a delayed fashion (at least six months postinjury), to permit maturation of the cortex and reduce the risk of recurrence [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H909590774"><span class="h1">AMPUTATION AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The presence of extremity injury is a significant determinant in the patient's long-term functional recovery after major trauma [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. In one longitudinal study of patients with severe lower extremity trauma, 50 percent had persistent severe disability over the seven-year study period [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. Patient characteristics associated with poorer outcomes include older age, female sex, lower education level, living in a poor household, current or previous smoking, and poor health status before the injury [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. In a retrospective review of popliteal injuries, preoperative factors associated with a higher risk of amputation included shock, associated orthopedic injury, and lack of preoperative Doppler signals; postoperative factors included a lack of Doppler signals postoperatively, no antiplatelet therapy, and loss of primary patency [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. Functional recovery depends greatly on the social and economic resources available to the patient, which can be more of a factor than the severity of the initial injury [<a href="#rid71">71-73</a>].</p><p>Blunt extremity injuries are associated with a higher rate of amputation [<a href="#rid74">74-76</a>]. In one review, the amputation rate was 18 percent [<a href="#rid74">74</a>], compared with 3 percent in another review of mostly penetrating femoral artery injuries [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. Popliteal artery injuries have a 10 to 15 percent rate of limb loss, the highest of any lower extremity vascular injury location. In an outcomes study of lower extremity arterial trauma from the United States and United Kingdom trauma registries, most injuries sustained during the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars were from explosive mechanisms that negatively affected the tibial vasculature [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. At a mean follow-up of more than five years, long-term limb salvage was worse following blast injury compared with firearm or gunshot wounding. The mortality associated with limb salvage attempts was low and delayed secondary amputations occurred in the weeks and months after injury allowing the patient to be involved in the recovering and amputation decision process. </p><p>In below-knee arterial injuries, the number and location of affected vessels impact the likelihood of amputation. In a registry review, amputation rates were higher for blunt compared with penetrating injury (26.8 percent versus 7.5 percent), but the amputation rate was not associated with Injury Severity Score (ISS), sex, or age [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. The amputation rate increased with the number of tibial vessels injured. For all three tibial vessels injured, the amputation rate was 50 percent; for two vessels, it was 29 percent, and for one vessel, it was 17.6 percent. Injury to the anterior tibial artery was associated with the highest amputation rate at 35.3 percent. A similar review showed amputation rates increased with number of tibial arteries injured [<a href="#rid78">78</a>].</p><p>Functional recovery is more likely with an isolated amputation. In a review of 395 patients, 59 percent had isolated lower extremity amputations. Following amputation, 17 percent returned to military duty, the majority of whom had a single extremity amputation [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. </p><p>Comparing outcomes for different levels of lower extremity amputation, a systematic review evaluated 3105 patients and found significantly lower physical component scores for progressively shorter residual limb lengths (below-knee, through-knee, and above-knee amputation) [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. A significantly greater proportion of patients with a below-knee (72 versus 55 percent) or through-knee amputation (78 versus 55 percent) were able to walk 500 meters compared with an above-knee amputation or bilateral amputations (72 and 78 versus 50 percent, respectively). However, patients with a through-knee amputation wore their prosthesis less and had significantly more pain (85 versus 58 percent) compared with those with an above-knee amputation.</p><p>There is no single risk factor that increases the likelihood of delayed amputation [<a href="#rid40">40</a>], but the combination of complex pain symptoms and neurologic dysfunction appears to increase the risk, particularly if the initial injury was a severe hindfoot injury or distal tibial fracture [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. In civilian studies, long-term functional outcomes for severe extremity injuries are not significantly different in patients with limb salvage versus amputation, although most patients prefer limb salvage initially.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective review of 93 civilian patients with open lower extremity fractures from blunt trauma from 1994 to 2012 included seven patients who underwent primary amputation and four patients who expired within one month of injury [<a href="#rid82">82</a>]. Of the remaining 82 patients, 10 (12 percent) underwent secondary amputation after a median follow-up of 22 months. Factors that were significantly different between the limb salvage group and the secondary amputation group were Gustilo-Anderson fracture grade, high-energy injury mechanism, mangled extremity severity score, AO fracture classification, vascular injury, and fasciotomy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective comparison of 850 civilian and 115 military open tibia fractures found a higher overall injury severity and limb injury severity in combat casualties [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]. There were 45 amputations in the civilian group (5.3 percent) and 24 amputations in 21 military patients (18.3 percent). There was no difference in the civilian versus military amputation rate for Gustilo-Anderson grade I through IIIA fractures (1.2 versus 0 percent) or Gustilo-Anderson grade IIIB fractures (6.9 versus 10 percent). However, amputation rates were significantly higher in the military population (28.8 percent versus 69 percent). In both groups, limb ischemia was predictive of failed limb salvage, although many patients with ischemia on initial evaluation had successful limb salvage. In this study, follow-up was limited to the index hospital stay for the civilian group and up to 60 days in the military group.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a detailed review of 104 distal combat-related lower extremity injuries, 80 percent of patients did not require revascularization [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. The overall amputation rate (primary and secondary) was similar (23 versus 19 percent) between revascularized and nonrevascularized patients. There was a trend toward less chronic pain in the bypass group (10 versus 30 percent). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an outcomes assessment that evaluated 569 patients after limb salvage (n = 384) or primary/early secondary (within three months) amputation (n = 161) [<a href="#rid84">84</a>].

Of 330 limb salvage patients with 24 months of follow-up, 4 percent underwent late secondary amputation (after three months). </p><p></p><p>Ultimately, limb salvage commits the patient to a prolonged recovery with an increased risk of complications and, potentially, additional surgery. The patient and his/her social supports often experience significant stress, which may lead the patient who initially preferred limb salvage to opt for amputation [<a href="#rid85">85</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H909590781"><span class="h1">MORTALITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In blunt civilian extremity injury, mortality ranges from 5 to 10 percent and is greater with blunt compared with penetrating injuries [<a href="#rid74">74,86</a>]. Mortality is a reflection of the severity of extremity injury, overall injury severity, and the development of complications (eg, venous thromboembolism). Mortality correlates to the volume of blood lost as a result of the extremity injury, which can be significant with junctional vascular injuries [<a href="#rid87">87</a>].

For patients with severe lower extremity injury, a brief lower extremity examination is performed during the initial trauma assessment but should be repeated in detail once life-threatening injuries have been addressed. Injury to three of the four functional elements (nerves, vessels, bones, soft tissues) constitutes a "mangled extremity" (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/16746.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Extremity evaluation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15150.html" rel="external">"Severe lower extremity injury in the adult patient", section on 'Initial evaluation and management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15150.html" rel="external">"Severe lower extremity injury in the adult patient", section on 'Lower extremity evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Damage control</strong> – Damage control techniques are used to manage patients with concomitant life-threatening torso or head injuries. Damage control torso surgery takes priority over the extremity injury as long as sites of extremity bleeding remain controlled. Fractures are managed with traction, splinting, or external fixation; vascular injuries with shunting of larger injured vessels or ligation of smaller vessels; injured nerves are rapidly identified and tagged if time permits; and soft tissues are irrigated and debrided to remove gross contamination, foreign material, and devitalized soft tissues. (See <a class="local">'Damage control surgery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgical reconstruction</strong> – Achieving an optimal outcome in patients with severe lower extremity injuries requires a multidisciplinary approach with oversight by the general or trauma surgeon and commitment from other specialist surgeons. Definitive treatment includes internal fixation with intramedullary nailing of long bones, arterial and venous reconstruction with autologous vein interposition graft(s), decompression or repair of peripheral nerves, and immediate or interval coverage of soft tissues. (See <a class="local">'Fracture management'</a> above and <a class="local">'Revascularization'</a> above and <a class="local">'Nerve repair'</a> above and <a class="local">'Wound care and coverage'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Perioperative care</strong> – The postoperative course for patients with lower extremity injury is highly variable depending on the nature and severity of the injury, associated injuries, and the patient's comorbidities. Patients should receive mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism as soon as is feasible given the high risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in this population. The risk of thromboembolic complications rises sharply if pharmacologic prophylaxis is delayed beyond three days. (See <a class="local">'VTE prophylaxis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Venous thromboembolism'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – Complications from severe lower extremity injury are common and can be life- or limb-threatening, and, thus, early recognition and treatment are important to minimize morbidity and mortality. Complications include wound complications (wound breakdown, infection), venous thromboembolism, rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria (crush injury, ischemia-reperfusion, extremity compartment syndrome), and heterotopic ossification. The threshold for performing extremity fasciotomy is low in patients with severe extremity injury. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> above and <a class="local">'Extremity fasciotomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Functional</strong> <strong>outcomes</strong> – In civilian studies, functional outcomes for severe lower extremity injuries are not significantly different for patients who have undergone limb salvage compared with amputation, although most patients prefer limb salvage initially. Long-term functionality depends more on patient social factors than the severity of the injury. Mortality for civilian extremity injury ranges from 5 to 10 percent.
