         The incidence of anthrax in humans has decreased during the past century, and it is now very rare in developed countries, including the United States. However, anthrax remains a concern in the developed world because of its potential as an agent of bioterrorism.

         The prevention of anthrax will be reviewed here. The microbiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of anthrax are discussed separately. (See

         If the vaccination schedule is interrupted or delayed, it can be restarted without repeating any doses.
        </p>
        <p>
         For ongoing maintenance vaccination in people at high risk, an annual booster injection is recommended. For individuals who have received the priming series and two initial booster doses and are not at high risk for
         <em>
          B. anthracis
         </em>
         exposure but want to maintain protection (eg, emergency workers who had voluntarily undergone anthrax vaccination), subsequent booster injections can be given every three years (instead of annually).
        </p>
        <p>
         Individuals may work in high-risk areas of exposure once they have completed the priming series. If an individual has completed the priming and initial booster doses but has not received a booster dose in the past year, prior to entering a high-risk area of inhalation exposure, that individuals should receive an additional booster dose and delay entry into the high-risk area until two weeks later; if immediate entry is required, antimicrobials should be given for two weeks following vaccination (see
         <a class="local">
          'Antimicrobial regimen selection'
         </a>
         below). The approach to individuals who have not completed the priming and initial booster doses but who have a potential inhalation exposure or plan to enter a high-risk area is discussed elsewhere (see
         <a class="local">
          'PEP for previously vaccinated individuals'
         </a>
         below). Appropriate personal protective equipment is also essential for individuals in high-risk areas. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Infection control'

         below.)

A midpoint analysis of the first 1005 participants who received the first four doses of vaccine through month 7 showed that immunogenicity at month 7 was noninferior for groups receiving either three (zero, four weeks, and six months) or four (zero, two, four weeks, and six months) intramuscular injections. At month 43, immunogenicity was greater with the intramuscularly administered schedules compared with the subcutaneously administered schedule [

         Evidence that post-exposure antimicrobial prophylaxis combined with active immunization provides effective protection against the development of inhalation anthrax is mainly from primate studies. Early studies of experimental inhalation anthrax in monkeys showed that treatment with penicillin beginning one day after aerosol exposure to
         <em>
          B. anthracis
         </em>
         spores was protective during the 5 to 10 days of drug therapy; however, the animals died when penicillin was discontinued [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequent studies demonstrated that adding vaccination to the antimicrobial regimen improved survival after the antimicrobials were discontinued. In an experimental inhalation anthrax trial, monkeys were challenged with aerosolized
         <em>
          B. anthracis
         </em>
         spores [
         <a href="#rid14">

         A third study in monkeys showed that PEP with a 14-day course of

         As these are prolonged courses of antimicrobials, clinicians should remain alert to the possibility of nonadherence to prescribed regimens, which can be very high in this setting [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although expert organizations do not recommend antimicrobial prophylaxis for more than 60 days because of the lack of data, the optimal duration is uncertain, and we suggest extending the duration to three to four months in patients who are immunocompromised or remain unvaccinated, as long as they are tolerating the antibiotic well. The recommended durations listed above were based on experimental studies using small numbers of animals and successful uncontrolled clinical experience involving unknown numbers of exposed people. However, in animal studies, some monkeys can harbor viable spores up to 100 days after exposure [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Thus, it is possible that a small proportion of individuals, particularly the immunocompromised or unvaccinated, may still be at risk beyond 60 days.
