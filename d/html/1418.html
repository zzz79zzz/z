Diagnosis is important, as timely ASD repair improves outcomes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1417.html" rel="external">"Management of atrial septal defects in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The anatomy, pathophysiology, natural history, clinical features, diagnosis, and assessment of ASDs in adults will be reviewed here [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>The management of ASDs in adults and issues related to ASDs in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1417.html" rel="external">"Management of atrial septal defects in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5779.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Management and outcome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H256131897"><span class="h1">EMBRYOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ASDs result from lack of sufficient tissue to completely septate the atria and are classified according to their location in the atrial septum, as described in the following sections  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77749" href="/d/graphic/77749.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106" href="/d/graphic/52106.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The location of the defect in relation to adjacent cardiac structures defines the anomalies associated with the ASD and impacts the natural history and requirements for repair.</p><p>Atrial septation begins as early as the fifth week of gestation. The septum primum arises from the superior portion of the common atrium and grows caudally to the endocardial cushions located between the atria and ventricles, eventually closing the orifice (ostium primum) between the atria  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77749" href="/d/graphic/77749.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). A second orifice (the ostium secundum) develops in the septum primum; this orifice is covered by another septum (the septum secundum) that arises on the right atrial side of the septum primum. The septum secundum grows caudally and covers the ostium secundum. However, the septum secundum does not completely divide the atria, but leaves an oval orifice (the foramen ovale) that is covered but not sealed on the left side by the flexible flap of the septum primum  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77749" href="/d/graphic/77749.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Flow through the foramen ovale is essential for fetal circulation. The foramen ovale closes spontaneously within the first two years of life in 70 percent of children. However, in a significant proportion (20 to 30 percent) of the population, the septa do not fuse, leading to a patent foramen ovale, which is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1420.html" rel="external">"Patent foramen ovale"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Secundum ASD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Secundum ASD accounts for 70 to 75 percent of all ASDs. Secundum ASD is a defect in the septum primum resulting from poor growth of the secundum septum or excessive absorption of the septum  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106" href="/d/graphic/52106.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79348" href="/d/graphic/79348.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>). Although most secundum ASDs are isolated defects, familial forms exist, some of which are associated with other congenital cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities. The best described genetic disorder associated with secundum ASD is the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omim.org%2Fentry%2F142900&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl%2Fz7sFYR8Q1aXDxBReNYTLBTBwCTC26RgAwHxUoGPy3pJ1ICi&amp;TOPIC_ID=1418" target="_blank">Holt-Oram syndrome</a> (also known as heart-hand syndrome) which is caused by various mutations, most commonly mutations in the <em>TBX5</em> gene.

These syndromes typically present in childhood or adolescence and are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Genetic disorders'</a>.)</p><p>Secundum ASDs are occasionally associated with partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection and/or pulmonary stenosis. The rare combination of an ASD with rheumatic mitral stenosis is known as Lutembacher syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8173.html" rel="external">"Rheumatic mitral stenosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13612.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Primum ASD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primum ASD accounts for 15 to 20 percent of ASDs. A primum ASD is a defect in the septum secundum caused by failure of the primum septum to fuse with the endocardial cushions at the base of the interatrial septum  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106" href="/d/graphic/52106.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). This results from maldevelopment/malalignment of the ventricular septum due to malformation of the endocardial cushions rather than a decrease in atrial septal tissue [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Primum ASDs are nearly always associated with anomalies of the atrioventricular (AV) valves, particularly a cleft in the anterior mitral valve leaflet, with or without a contiguous defect in the inlet ventricular septum. When the combination of the primum ASD, cleft mitral valve, and an inlet ventricular septal defect are seen, this is called a partial AV septal defect (AVSD). The most severe form of AVSD (or endocardial cushion defect) is the complete AV septal (or canal) defect, in which a primum ASD and inlet ventricular septal defect are present along with a common AV valve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85595.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects", section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>Discrete subaortic stenosis as well as elongation (often referred to as a "goose-neck deformity") of the left ventricular outflow tract are often seen in association with endocardial cushion defects. Endocardial cushion defects are often noted in patients with Trisomy 21.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Sinus venosus defect</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sinus venosus defects account for 5 to 10 percent of ASDs and are located in the venoatrial portion of the atrial septum. Sinus venosus defects represent an abnormality in the insertion of the superior or inferior vena cava, which overrides the interatrial septum; the interatrial communication is then formed within the mouth of the overriding vein and is outside the area of the fossa ovalis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106" href="/d/graphic/52106.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Thus, sinus venosus defects are technically not ASDs since the defect is within the sinus venosus septum. An anomalous connection involving one or more pulmonary veins is present in most patients with sinus venosus ASD (eg, 112 of 115 patients undergoing surgical repair) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Sinus venosus defects are of two types [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Superior sinus venosus defects are located immediately below the orifice of the superior vena cava. The right upper lobe and middle lobe pulmonary veins often connect to the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium or on the superior vena cava, resulting in a partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5764.html" rel="external">"Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inferior sinus venosus defects, also known as inferior vena caval defects, are much less common. They are located immediately above the orifice of the inferior vena cava. These defects are also often associated with partial anomalous connection of the right pulmonary veins to the junction of the right atrium and inferior vena cava.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Unroofed coronary sinus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unroofed coronary sinus (also known as coronary sinus defect) is caused by absence of part or all of the common wall between the coronary sinus and the left atrium. This defect accounts for less than 1 percent of ASDs and is commonly associated with a persistent left superior vena cava.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H53131366"><span class="h1">GENETIC FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most ASDs occur sporadically, though familial transmission has also been identified. Gene mutations causing ASDs have been identified among patients with familial or sporadic disease, including mutations of <em>NKX2.5</em>, causing an autosomal dominant syndrome of ASD with or without conduction defect [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Genetic syndromes with skeletal abnormalities associated with ASD include a variety of heart-hand syndromes, which also have autosomal dominant transmission. Holt-Oram syndrome (caused by mutations in the <em>TBX5</em> gene) is the best known of these heart-hand syndromes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H256132242"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ASDs in adults are associated with left-to-right shunt causing volume overload of the right heart chambers  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72533" href="/d/graphic/72533.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80448" href="/d/graphic/80448.html" rel="external">movie 2A</a>). The severity of the shunt is determined by the size of the defect and atrial and ventricular compliance and pressure. The left-to-right shunting occurs primarily in late ventricular systole and early diastole, with some augmentation during atrial systole. The shunt flow due to an ASD moves from the left to the right atrium, right ventricle (RV), pulmonary circulation, back to the left atrium, and through the defect back to the right atrium. This leads to volume overload of the right heart chambers and pulmonary arteries with possible late development of progressive pulmonary vascular obstructive disease and pulmonary hypertension when the degree of shunting is substantial and, more commonly, in sinus venosus defects and primum ASDs. (See <a class="local">'Pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105507.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension with congenital heart disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>In addition, there is transient right-to-left shunting at the onset of ventricular contraction, particularly under conditions of bradycardia and/or decreased intrathoracic pressure [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. This explains the possibility of paradoxical embolism in the setting of ASD. Significant right-to-left shunting can develop later in life if severe pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid regurgitation develops.</p><p>Left atrial enlargement is also seen in adults with ASDs, particularly in patients older than 50 years, with atrial fibrillation, with diastolic dysfunction with elevated left heart filling pressure, or with a primum defect associated with cleft mitral valve and mitral regurgitation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h1">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The natural course of isolated ASDs varies from spontaneous closure in secundum ASDs to asymptomatic right ventricular enlargement and to increasing symptoms with age. Spontaneous closure of ASDs, noted in approximately 40 percent of secundum ASDs, mostly occurs when ASDs are small, usually less than 8 mm in diameter, and in childhood. Secundum ASDs ≥8 mm in diameter and those in adults do not typically close spontaneously. Primum ASDs, sinus venosus defects, and coronary sinus defects do not close spontaneously. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Natural history'</a>.)</p><p>Increases in left-to-right shunting with age (due to relative increases in the left versus right ventricular end-diastolic pressures), development of systemic hypertension, and other acquired heart disease leading to increased left ventricular end diastolic and/or left atrial pressure, especially in patients with moderate to large ASDs, increase the likelihood of developing symptoms and complications as described in the next section. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4231473900"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most ASDs occur sporadically, although familial transmission has been observed in a minority of cases. Because of the possibility of familial occurrence, a careful family history should be taken in patients with ASD.</p><p>The right-sided volume overload in isolated ASDs is usually well tolerated for years despite right heart chamber enlargement (seen on echocardiography and chest radiograph). It is estimated that most patients with an ASD and significant shunt flow (ie, pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio [Qp:Qs] ≥1.5:1) will become symptomatic and require surgical correction or percutaneous repair by the age of 40 years [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, some patients do not report symptoms until later, likely due to some degree of adaptability to their limitations. In addition, initial symptoms might be mild and nonspecific and therefore ignored [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. Exercise intolerance, fatigue, and dyspnea are common clinical manifestations of ASDs in adults; some patients develop overt heart failure.</p><p>In a series of 481 patients with a secundum ASD who were seen between 1957 and 1976 and who underwent surgery before the age of 40, more than one-half had symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. These symptoms improve after ASD repair [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h2">Physical findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The classic physical findings of an isolated ASD are related to the size and location of the defect, the size of the shunt at atrial level, and the pulmonary arterial pressure.</p><p>A small minority of patients develop signs of central cyanosis (with blueish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes) due to various causes, as described below. (See <a class="local">'Cyanosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Eisenmenger syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22"><span class="h3">Precordial palpation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dilation of the right atrium and RV may initially be undetectable on physical examination. The larger the shunt, the higher the likelihood it will be manifested by one or more of the following findings (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1081.html" rel="external">"Examination of the precordial pulsation", section on 'Palpation'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An enlarged and hyperdynamic RV can produce a right ventricular heave that is most pronounced along the left sternal border and in the subxiphoid area.

This may be more pronounced in patients with pulmonary hypertension.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h3">Auscultation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1147780849"><span class="h4">General ASD findings</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heart sounds</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The characteristic auscultatory finding in ASDs with large left-to-right shunts and normal pulmonary artery pressure is wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound (S2), in contrast to the normal variation in splitting during the respiratory cycle. The second sound should be evaluated when the patient is sitting or standing because splitting may be relatively wide but not fixed in the supine position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Fixed splitting is thought to result from altered characteristics of the pulmonary vascular bed associated with increased pulmonary blood flow. In all individuals, the aortic and pulmonic closure sounds (A2 and P2) occur shortly after (but not instantly after) ventricular pressure falls below arterial pressure. The delay between the ventricular pressure drop and valve closure is referred to as the "hangout time" and is the delay due to pressure recoil from the arterial bed. In the systemic arterial circulation, the hangout time is short because of high aortic impedance and rapid pressure recoil; it does not vary with respiration. In contrast, the pulmonary hangout time is longer, because of the greater compliance of the pulmonary vascular bed, and is prolonged by inspiration, which increases pulmonary capacitance. As a result, P2 normally occurs after A2, and this separation ("splitting") of S2 increases with inspiration. With an ASD, the capacitance of the pulmonary bed is increased throughout the respiratory cycle without much respiratory variation. The increased and constant capacitance results in an increased and fixed hangout time, with wide splitting between the first and second components of the S2 and little respiratory variation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds", section on 'Splitting of S2'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The intensities of the pulmonic and aortic components of S2 are equal in most patients with an uncomplicated ASD. Patients with pulmonary hypertension usually have an accentuated pulmonic component of S2. A similar finding is occasionally seen with normal pulmonary pressures because of the proximity of the dilated pulmonary artery to the chest wall. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds", section on 'Factors determining the intensity of S2'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The first heart sound (S1), which is heard best at the apex and lower left sternal border, is often split, and the second component (tricuspid closure) is intensified in patients with an ASD. An explanation for this increase in intensity is that the large volume of diastolic blood flow from right atrium to RV presses the tricuspid leaflets toward the right ventricular wall and the forceful right ventricular contraction causes the tricuspid leaflets to move abruptly cephalad during systole.
