         When heart valve replacement is warranted, a choice is made between transcatheter valve replacement and surgical valve replacement with a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve.

         Choice of prosthesis for surgical valve replacement will be reviewed here. The discussion will focus on aortic or mitral valve replacement. The indications for valve replacement, assessment of risk of valve surgery, complications of prosthetic valves, management of patients with prosthetic valves, and choice of valve intervention prior to pregnancy are discussed separately.

         Surgical valve replacement is performed with mechanical or bioprosthetic valves. For most patients, a choice is made between a mechanical valve or a stented bioprosthesis [

         Current mechanical options include bileaflet (eg, St. Jude, Carbomedics, and On-X valves) and low thrombogenicity single tilting disc valves (eg, Medtronic Hall)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98560" href="/z/d/graphic/98560.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Some earlier mechanical valve types were associated with greater risk of complications. Some studies have suggested that earlier tilting disc valve types (eg, Omniscience, Lillehei-Kaster, Bjork-Shiley Monostrut) were associated with increased risk of thromboembolism [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The earlier Bjork-Shiley convexo-concave single tilting disc valve was withdrawn from the market in 1986 due to reports of outlet strut fractures. The older caged ball valve (eg, Starr-Edwards) had unfavorable hemodynamic qualities and posed a high risk of thromboembolism and is no longer implanted.

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Bioprosthetic valve options include pericardial and xenograft (ie, from a different species; eg, porcine, bovine, or equine) valves  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef120105" href="/z/d/graphic/120105.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Pericardial and xenograft valves may be stented or stentless. Bioprosthetic aortic valve options also include aortic homografts (ie, a section of aorta with its aortic valve intact from a human donor) and the Ross procedure (pulmonary autograft [the patient's own pulmonic valve] in the aortic position to replace a diseased aortic valve; the pulmonic valve is replaced with a pulmonary homograft). Stented bioprosthetic valves are the most common bioprosthetic option. (See

         The choice of valve intervention (including a transcatheter versus surgical approach and valve repair or replacement) as well as the choice of type of prosthetic heart valve for surgical replacement should be a shared decision-making process with full disclosure of the indications for and risks of anticoagulant therapy and the potential need for and risk of reoperation and should account for the patient’s values and preferences [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ]. The heart valve team (including cardiologists and cardiac surgeons) should consider the following factors which relate to valve durability, risk of thromboembolic and bleeding complications, and risk of mortality following valve replacement. (See

         Life expectancy in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing valve replacement is generally limited (eg, two-year survival rate of 39.7 percent [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. In patients with end-stage kidney disease, we favor bioprosthetic valves since these are associated with fewer valve-related complications than mechanical valves in this population [
         <a href="#rid4">

         ].

         Systematic reviews of observational studies have found no significant difference in survival in patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving bioprosthetic versus mechanical valves [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>

         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. However, a systematic review found that bleeding and thromboembolic events, which occur predominantly in patients receiving mechanical valves, occur much more frequently in this population than structural deterioration of bioprosthetic valves (bleeding in 0.9 percent, thromboembolism in 0.5 percent, and structural bioprosthetic deterioration in 0.07 percent) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         Choice of prosthetic valve for a patient requiring valve surgery prior to possible future pregnancy is discussed separately. In brief, the factors to be considered are the risk of pregnancy-related thromboembolic complications, the risk of anticoagulant therapy with mechanical valves, and the limited durability of bioprosthetic valves.

         </span>
         One challenge to applying available evidence to clinical practice is that long-term outcome data are not available for newer prosthetic valves (including most valves currently implanted), operative techniques, and transcatheter valve intervention. Comparisons of bioprosthetic valve series suggest that second generation porcine valves and pericardial valves are more durable than first generation porcine valves; newer models may yield even greater durability but data are limited [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Advances in cardiac surgery and perioperative care may reduce the risk of valve reoperation. The potential impact of future transcatheter replacement and valve-in-valve options as alternatives to reoperation to treat patients with structural valve degeneration is uncertain.

A study of 25,445 patients undergoing surgical prosthetic valve replacement in California from 1996 to 2013 found that 30-day mortality rates were similar for recipients of aortic bioprosthetic and mechanical valves (2.4 and 1.6 percent for patients aged 45 to 54 years; 1.6 and 1.7 percent for patients aged 55 to 64 years) [

Thirty-day mortality rates were also similar for recipients of mitral bioprosthetic and mechanical valves in the older age groups (4.0 and 3.7 percent for patients aged 50 to 69 and 7.2 and 8.1 percent for patients aged 70 to 79), but mortality rates were higher with bioprosthetic valves compared with mechanical valves in the 40 to 49 year age group (5.6 versus 2.2 percent; odds ratio 2.62, 95% CI 1.28-5.38). This study included an internal validation study to determine the accuracy of procedure codes; patient groups with high rates of misclassification were excluded.

         The available randomized trial data are for valves that are now obsolete, patient numbers were limited, and results were not stratified by age. In a randomized trial including 575 patients (of which &gt;90 percent of patients were ≤70 years old) undergoing valve replacement between 1977 and 1982, survival at 15 years was higher with a mechanical aortic valve than with a bioprosthetic aortic valve (34 versus 21 percent); by contrast, survival was similar after mechanical or bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement (19 versus 21 percent) [

Bioprosthetic structural valve degeneration leads to significantly higher rates of reoperation in patients receiving these valves. While structural valve degeneration is the major reason for prosthetic valve reoperation, rates of valve reoperation do not fully capture the risk of structural valve degeneration since some patients with significant structural valve deterioration are not deemed candidates for reoperation due to high risk [

The lower rate of valve failure requiring valve reoperation in older adults is due at least in part to decreased activity in older patients.

         As a consequence of the age-dependent risk of bioprosthetic structural valve deterioration, the incidence of prosthetic valve reoperation is significantly higher for bioprosthetic valves compared with mechanical valves, and younger patients require reoperation sooner than older patients. As an example, in an observational study, the cumulative rates of reoperation at 15 years for patients aged 45 to 54 years with aortic bioprosthetic valves and mechanical valves were approximately 21 and 8 percent [
         <a href="#rid12">

         ]. The cumulative rates of reoperation for patients aged 55 to 64 years at 15 years with aortic bioprosthetic valves and mechanical valves were approximately 17 and 7 percent. Significantly higher rates of reoperation with bioprosthetic valves compared with mechanical valves were also seen with mitral prostheses, particularly among younger patients.

         Surgical replacement of a prosthetic valve is associated with significant risk of early mortality (eg, 30-day mortality risk of 7 percent after aortic valve reoperation and 14 percent after mitral valve reoperation [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]). The individualized risk of a reoperation should be considered. The morbidity and mortality associated with valve reoperation is higher in some patient populations, such as those with coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). Retrospective data indicate that operative mortality rates are higher for aortic or mitral valve replacement with pre-existing CABG and are also higher than for combined valve replacement and CABG [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25-27
         </a>
         ]. In a patient with a patent internal mammary artery (IMA) graft, valve surgery poses a potential risk of IMA graft injury and myocardial infarction [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The increased risk associated with valve reoperation in a patient following CABG may favor implantation of a mechanical valve in patients requiring concurrent valve replacement and CABG. However, the emerging use of treating bioprosthetic valve degeneration with a transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure may offer patients an alternative to repeat surgical valve replacement. Currently, there are limited data on the long-term durability of this approach, so strong recommendations are not possible. However, this potential option to treat possible later bioprosthetic valve structural valve deterioration should be taken into consideration when deciding on the type of surgical valve, in conjunction with other factors, including patient age and preferences.

By contrast, anticoagulation is suggested for patients with mitral or aortic bioprosthetic valves for only the first three months following valve replacement, unless there is an additional risk factor such as atrial fibrillation.

         Homograft aortic valves are most often used for treatment of native valve or prosthetic valve endocarditis because the homograft is supplied as a composite valve, aortic root, and part of the anterior mitral leaflet. This additional tissue may be used to reconstruct the areas adjacent to the valve, which is helpful if the infection has extended into the annulus, basal septum, or base of the mitral valve. A disadvantage of homograft valves is the greater technical difficulty of implantation. In addition, fibrosis (involving the adjacent pulmonary artery) and calcification (frequently involving the coronary button reattachment) of the composite root and valve make it more difficult to perform repeat surgical intervention, which may be required on long-term follow-up.

          46,47

         Given its limitations, the pulmonic autograft procedure is predominantly performed in children, as the autograft aortic annulus and valve may have the capacity to grow.

         Some biological aortic valve options are technically more challenging than others (Ross procedure &gt;aortic homografts &gt;stentless aortic valve replacement [AVR] &gt;stented AVR).

         PPM appears to be more likely with bioprosthetic valves. This was illustrated in a review of 1400 consecutive patients who underwent bioprosthetic or mechanical AVR [

         , was present in 51 percent of patients with bioprosthetic valves compared with 11 percent in those with mechanical valves. Stented tissue valves are generally associated with smaller EOAs, due to the space occupied by the supporting stents. This may be particularly important in patients with a small aortic annulus who are at risk for patient-prosthesis mismatch [
         <a href="#rid55">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         PPM was associated with adverse early- and long-term outcomes in some studies but multivariate analyses of long-term outcomes have yielded conflicting results [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52,56-60
         </a>
         ]. PPM was an independent predictor of risk of late mortality in some studies [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56-58
         </a>
         ], but not in others [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59,60
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a study of 3343 patients undergoing AVR found that survival was significantly worse among those with severe PPM as compared with those with no PPM (22.1 percent versus 38.1 percent at 15 years) [

         Potential explanations for discrepancies among studies on the impact of PPM on outcomes include differing criteria for PPM as well as a variety of clinical factors that may influence the effect of PPM on outcomes. These factors include:

         Age – Severe PPM was associated with increased mortality in younger patients (&lt;60 or &lt;70 years old) but not in older patients in two series [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54,61

         Body size – PPM identified by EOA indexed to BSA is associated with increased mortality in average-sized patients but not in patients with obesity or small body size. One potential explanation for the lack of apparent impact of PPM in large and small patients is that the indexed EOA (EOA divided by BSA) may not accurately reflect the degree of mismatch in these patients.

         Every effort should be made to minimize the likelihood of severe PPM. The risk of PPM is reduced by selecting a prosthetic valve with an adequate indexed orifice area given the patient’s annular dimension and body size. Protocols have been suggested to attain an EOA at rest of &gt;0.75 to 0.85 cm

         While stentless valves generally provide larger EOAs than stented valves, they are used selectively when needed since stentless valves are more technically challenging to implant.

         Contemporary mechanical heart valves include bileaflet and tilting disc valves. Types of surgical bioprosthetic heart valves include stented valves (porcine and pericardial), stentless valves (porcine, bovine, and equine), as well as aortic homografts and human autografts (Ross procedure). Transcatheter bioprosthetic valves also are an option for valve-in-valve procedures to treat bioprosthetic structural valve failure and for transcatheter intervention to treat native aortic valve disease.

         The choice of valve intervention (including a transcatheter versus surgical approach and valve repair or replacement) as well as choice of the type of prosthetic heart valve for surgical replacement should be a shared decision-making process with full disclosure of the indications for and risks of anticoagulant therapy and the potential need for and risk of reoperation and should account for the patient’s values and preferences.

          'Late mortality rates'
         </a>
         above.)

         In older patients, long-term survival with a bioprosthetic valve may be similar to or slightly better than that with a mechanical valve. (See

         Life expectancy in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing valve replacement is generally limited and choice of mechanical versus bioprosthetic valve does not affect survival. In patients with end-stage kidney disease, we favor bioprosthetic valves since these are associated with fewer valve-related complications than mechanical valves in this population. (See
         <a class="local">
          'End-stage kidney disease'

         Prosthetic valve-patient mismatch (PPM) was an independent predictor of mortality in some studies, but not in others. Since it can cause clinically significant obstruction, every effort should be made to minimize the likelihood of severe PPM. Strategies for patients with small aortic roots include aortic root enlargement or use of a stentless valve root conduit. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prosthetic valve-patient mismatch'
