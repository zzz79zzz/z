         Testicular cancer has become one of the most curable solid neoplasms. Factors that have likely contributed to the declining mortality rate for testicular cancer over time include the development and use of effective chemotherapy, a trend toward earlier stage disease at presentation, and an increasing proportion of tumors that are pure seminomas [

         The term "advanced" is used differently for GCTs compared with most other cancers, and it refers to stage IS, II, and III disease, based on the 2017 joint staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 graphicRef110732" href="/z/d/graphic/110731.html" rel="external">
          table 1A-B
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is used with curative intent to treat advanced disease in several scenarios:

         "Advanced" or "disseminated" testicular GCTs typically are those that have metastasized to retroperitoneal lymph nodes or beyond. In most cases, advanced GCTs are either stage III or stage IIb to IIc  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 graphicRef110732" href="/z/d/graphic/110731.html" rel="external">
          table 1A-B
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Men with stage IS nonseminomas (abnormal tumor markers without radiographic evidence of metastases) are treated the same as stage III because they are assumed to have occult metastases. Stage IS seminomas are extremely rare, and management should be individualized.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In addition, other groups treated for advanced disease include some men with stage IIa seminoma (if they are not treated with radiation therapy) and some with stage IIa nonseminoma (if they are not managed with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection).
        </p>
        <p>

         Patients with primary mediastinal or retroperitoneal GCTs are generally treated as having advanced-stage disease, even in the absence of metastatic lesions.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a delicate balance between too little and too much therapy in men with GCTs:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Inadequate therapy can cause a missed opportunity for cure and an unnecessary patient death. It can also result in the need for more aggressive subsequent therapy, and consequently, increased side effects and complications.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         By contrast, overtreatment (or unnecessarily aggressive treatment) can result in potentially serious acute and delayed toxicities. Whenever possible, men with advanced testicular GCTs should be referred to centers with expertise in the management of such tumors. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2955.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment-related toxicity in testicular germ cell tumors"

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of advanced GCTs is guided by risk stratification that is based on the following variables: histology (seminoma versus nonseminoma), the presence or absence of metastatic lesions to organs other than the lungs, serum tumor marker levels, and the location of the primary tumor (testis or retroperitoneum versus mediastinum).

          DEFINITION OF RISK

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         The 2017 joint staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 graphicRef110732" href="/z/d/graphic/110731.html" rel="external">
          table 1A-B
         </a>
         ) is used to stage men with testicular cancer [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. For men with advanced disease, it is supplemented with a validated prognostic model that was developed by the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the IGCCCG prognostic classification system, patients with disseminated disease (stages IS and II to III) are divided into good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups for both progression-free and overall survival  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61906" href="/z/d/graphic/61906.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4
         </a>
         ]. It is based upon the histology of the tumor (seminoma versus nonseminoma), primary site of the GCT, metastatic sites of involvement, and levels of serum tumor markers (drawn on day 1 of the first cycle, prior to initiation of chemotherapy, and after radical orchiectomy has been performed for patients with testicular primaries).
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk stratification system is important for the identification of appropriate treatment for men with GCTs. Risk stratification differs for seminomas and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs).

          Seminomas

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Metastatic seminomas are classified as either good or intermediate risk. There is no poor-risk classification for pure seminomas.
        </p>
        <p>
         Historically, the distinction between good- and intermediate-risk metastatic seminoma has been based upon whether or not metastases to organs other than the lungs or lymph nodes are present  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61906" href="/z/d/graphic/61906.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Additionally, we treat men with metastatic good-risk seminoma and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) using an approach similar to those with intermediate-risk seminoma; however, there is no consensus on whether treatment should be intensified in such patients. In one study of 2451 men with metastatic seminoma, elevation of LDH greater than 2.5 times ULN was independently associated with worse prognosis [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The authors of this study did not advocate changing the risk-stratification schema to include LDH elevation as a criterion for intermediate-risk disease but rather suggested distinguishing two different groups of good-risk patients based on LDH levels. Serum levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and LDH were not used in assigning risk status to patients with seminoma, although one or both are often elevated. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Seminoma'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Serum beta-hCG and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are not listed as prognostic factors for metastatic seminoma. The diagnosis of seminoma is precluded by elevation of AFP or highly elevated beta-hCG. More specifically, beta-hCG levels are rarely elevated above 1000 ng/mL in pure seminomas: a beta-hCG above 5000 international units/L (the cut-off separating good- from intermediate-risk disease for NSGCT) would generally be interpreted as representing the presence of choriocarcinoma or embryonal carcinoma and hence a diagnosis of NSGCT. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because seminomas do not produce AFP, an elevated AFP indicates the presence of NSGCT unless another explanation for the AFP elevation is obvious. Trivial elevations of serum AFP (&lt;30 ng/mL) should be interpreted cautiously, and for the purposes of classifying GCTs, any AFP less than 20 ng/mL should generally be considered normal, regardless of the reporting laboratory's normal range. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors'
         </a>
         below.)

        <p>
         Criteria used to define good and intermediate risk for men with advanced seminoma are described below:

         Although published staging and risk-stratification tables list an LDH cutoff of 1.5 times ULN, we use a cutoff of three times ULN because LDH is not specific to GCTs or malignancy and can be elevated for many different reasons. Many GCT experts would not intensify a patient’s treatment from good risk to intermediate risk if the only adverse prognostic factor were an LDH between 1.5 and 3 times ULN.

For men at increased risk for pulmonary toxicity from bleomycin and for men over the age of 50, we prefer EP. If BEP is used, three cycles should be given. If EP is administered, four cycles must be given.

         Men with metastatic seminoma with metastases limited to the lungs and/or lymph nodes and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were previously considered to have good-risk disease. However, one analysis reported that such men had outcomes similar to men with metastases to organs other than the lungs and lymph nodes, providing a rationale to treat such men as having intermediate-risk disease, rather than good-risk disease [

         Three cycles of standard BEP result in similar activity and less toxicity compared with four cycles of BEP [

         </a>
         ]. The largest study, conducted by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), randomized 812 subjects to either three or four cycles of BEP. With a median follow-up of 25 months, it reported that two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 90.4 percent with three cycles and 89.4 percent with four cycles [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>

         For men receiving BEP, dose intensity should be maintained throughout treatment because lowered chemotherapy doses are associated with worse outcomes. In a trial sponsored by the Australian and New Zealand Germ Cell Trial Group, 166 men were randomly assigned treatment using three cycles of standard BEP  (

         – In a trial conducted by the Groupe d'Etude des Tumeurs Uro-Genital (GETUG), 257 men were randomly assigned to BEP for three cycles or EP for four cycles (using standard doses) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The overall response rate was equivalent between EP and BEP (97 versus 96 percent, respectively). At a median follow-up of 53 months, EP had a numerically lower four-year event-free survival rate (86 versus 91 percent) and a higher mortality rate (12 men treated with EP died versus 5 men treated with BEP), though neither result was statistically significant.

        <p>

         These studies suggest that EP (four cycles) results in similar, but possibly slightly inferior, outcomes in the treatment of good-risk testicular GCTs. We (and others [

         For men with good-risk disease, cisplatin-based chemotherapy is generally well tolerated, although both acute and late toxicities are a significant concern. (See

         Full doses should be administered at the scheduled time, regardless of the white blood cell count on day 1 of each cycle, to maximize the chances for cure. The risk of neutropenic fever and fatal infections is low in patients with good-risk disease. Therefore, for good-risk patients, we recommend use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) only if the prior cycle was complicated by febrile neutropenia.
        </p>
        <p>
         When the prior cycle is complicated by febrile neutropenia or some other significant clinical event, a delay in treatment is recommended if necessary to allow the patient to recover. For example, for a patient with febrile neutropenia, additional chemotherapy should be delayed until the neutropenia has resolved and any identified infection is under control.

There was a statistically significant improvement with the experimental regimen in five-year PFS compared with standard BEP for patients with an unfavorable decline in serum tumor markers (60 versus 47 percent, HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.97). However, the difference in OS at five years was not statistically significant (70 versus 61 percent, HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.43-1.11). This regimen is complex and is associated with increased toxicity, and we do not recommend it for routine use in these patients.

         A subsequent observational study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database evaluated 321 men with metastatic seminomas and 803 with metastatic nonseminomas treated between 2004 and 2015 in the United States. For patients with good- and intermediate-risk seminomas, five-year OS was 87 and 78 percent, respectively [

        </p>
        <p>
         In another observational study of 2451 men with metastatic seminoma, both OS and PFS improved over time among patients with good-risk disease (five-year OS 86 to 95 percent; five-year PFS 82 to 89 percent) and intermediate-risk patients (five-year OS 72 to 88 percent; five-year PFS 67 to 79 percent) [
         <a href="#rid5">

         </a>
         ]. Additionally, among patients with good-risk disease, elevation of LDH &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was independently associated with worse prognosis. In this study, among patients with good-risk disease, both OS and PFS was higher for those with LDH ≤2.5 times ULN versus those with LDH &gt;2.5 times ULN (three-year OS 97 versus 92 percent; three-year PFS 92 versus 80 percent). For patients with intermediate-risk disease, three-year OS and PFS were 93 and 78 percent, respectively.

         Men with metastatic GCTs are generally followed on a surveillance schedule for at least five years after treatment. A large majority of patients relapse within the first two years of treatment completion. Not surprisingly, men who have a favorable response to first-line chemotherapy are less likely to relapse. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Data suggest that men who live for two years after diagnosis without relapsing have a high probability of being cured and a very low risk of dying of their cancer. In an analysis of 942 patients with metastatic testicular GCTs treated at five tertiary cancer centers between 1990 and 2012, the conditional OS rates were calculated for patients who were alive and disease-free at 24 months after diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. Within the study population, 26 percent of patients had seminoma, and 74 percent had nonseminomatous NSGCTs. For patients in the good-risk group, the two-year conditional OS rate improved from 97 percent at baseline to 99 percent at 24 months. In the intermediate-risk group, the two-year conditional OS rate increased from 94 to 99 percent at 24 months, and for those with high-risk disease, the two-year conditional OS rate increased from 71 to 93 percent.

          Prognosis for testicular cancer
         </strong>
         – Testicular cancers, 95 percent of which are germ cell tumors (GCTs), have become one of the most curable solid neoplasms because of remarkable treatment advances, with an expected five-year survival rate over 95 percent. (See

          Risk stratification

         – For all patients with advanced GCTs, stratification into good-, intermediate-, or poor-risk categories based upon their histology, primary tumor site, anatomic staging, and levels of serum markers following orchiectomy is necessary prior to treatment  (
