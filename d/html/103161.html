         Mastocytosis describes a group of disorders in which there is pathologic accumulation of mast cells in tissues. These diseases can be limited to the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis [CM]) or involve other tissues and organs in addition to the skin (systemic mastocytosis [SM]). In infants and prepubescent children, CM accounts for the majority of cases. The clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis of the different forms of CM and SM in infants and children are reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, evaluation and diagnosis in adults and the treatment and prognosis of mastocytosis in children and adults are discussed separately:

         Mastocytosis, in all its forms, is a rare disorder. The prevalence has been estimated at 1 per 10,000 persons [

          2
         </a>
         ]. After puberty, more females are affected. The onset of mastocytosis in children follows a bimodal distribution with a peak in the first three years of life, a subsequent drop, and a second, much smaller peak after the age of 15 years [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         The most common form of mastocytosis in children is CM, which accounts for approximately 90 percent of mastocytosis cases in patients under the age of 18 years. In cutaneous disease, pathologic numbers of mast cells accumulate in the skin, causing cutaneous and systemic symptoms, but do not infiltrate other organs. Most affected children develop skin findings in the first year of life, although lesions can be present at birth. The diagnosis is usually made before the age of two years.

         The most prevalent form of CM is maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM), also called urticaria pigmentosa (UP) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         ]. MPCM/UP accounts for 70 to 90 percent of all pediatric cases of CM [

         SM accounts for less than 10 percent of pediatric mastocytosis cases and involves the abnormal accumulation of mast cells in the skin and multiple organs. In systemic disease, the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, and/or lymph nodes may be involved [

         </span>
         There are important differences between the natural histories of pediatric and adult mastocytosis. Pediatric mastocytosis is confined to the skin in most cases, and, although symptoms can be challenging to manage and occasionally associated with significant morbidity, the majority of children have a benign course and experience spontaneous improvement or resolution around the time of puberty [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,6,11
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, adults more often have systemic disease that persists throughout life. Prognosis in children is discussed in more detail separately. (See

         mutations have been identified in children with maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM), none of which predict an association with systemic disease. In this way, pediatric and adult mastocytosis are similar. However, the pathogenesis of mastocytosis in infants and children may differ from that in adults in important ways. Based on research in mice, it has been proposed that mammalian mast cells may originate from at least two distinct sources during embryonic development and that the mast cells present in the skin at birth are gradually replaced by a different population as the individual matures [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The presence of a defect in the population of mast cells that originates from the embryonic yolk sack and predominates in the neonatal period, but not in the population that is subsequently produced in the bone marrow, may explain the mechanism of resolution of the disease in most children.

         The most frequent presentation of CM in children is the presence of polymorphic lesions of maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis/urticaria pigmentosa (MPCM/UP), often located on the trunk, extremities, scalp, or neck. Lesions on the palms and soles are uncommon but do occur. Many children with skin lesions have minimal or no systemic symptoms. However, others may experience episodes of flushing, nausea/vomiting, or diarrhea. Infants may have episodic blistering. Nodular lesions, diffuse skin involvement, and mastocytomas are rare presentations. (See

         The rare infant or child with SM usually presents with numerous MPCM/UP lesions that are monomorphic and resemble the lesions seen in adults. Skin findings are accompanied by episodes of flushing, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. In older children, systemic disease may present as persistence of anaphylaxis-like symptoms and increasing numbers of skin lesions over time. In systemic disease, hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests, or hematologic abnormalities are indicative of infiltration of organs by abnormal mast cells. (See

         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Three or fewer lesions are considered mastocytomas, while more than three lesions are classified as MPCM [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Some mastocytomas have a yellow to orange coloration [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Bullae may be present, with typical localization in the extremities, axillae or groin, or areas where the skin is rubbed or scratched. Pruritus is variable. Individual mastocytomas may grow or change in shape or appearance. Spontaneous involution is frequently observed by preadolescence. Flushing or even hypotension may also occur after physical irritation of the lesion, so mastocytomas should not be purposefully rubbed. Instead, the patient or caregiver can usually provide the history that flushing occurs if the lesions are disturbed. Extracutaneous mastocytosis are rare, and one case has been described in the skull of a 13-year-old boy who presented a large osteolytic lesion [

          Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis

         – Children with DCM generally present at birth or in the first year of life. They do not have individually discernible lesions but rather a diffuse thickening (
         <em>
          peau d'orange
         </em>
         ) and slight darkening of the skin  (

         ). Involvement of the whole skin, rather than discrete areas, is characteristic. Some have prominent dermatographism. Two subtypes of DCM have been proposed: one in which larger bullae form on deeply erythematous skin and a second characterized by yellow-orange skin infiltration with minimal small blisters [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

         Children with DCM may or may not experience itching but are prone to severe systemic symptoms (eg, anaphylaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulopathy), which can result in significant morbidity, especially if mast cell-activating medications are administered before the condition is recognized [

Eruptions can be spontaneous or triggered by physical triggers (eg, rubbing), infections, medications that activate mast cells (such as opioids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], or

         Acute mast cell activation presents as apparent "allergic" reactions and anaphylaxis. In over two-thirds of children with MPCM/UP, release of mast cell mediators may lead to episodes of multisystem symptoms, even when disease is limited to the skin. Acute release of mast cell mediators can result in episodes of flushing, pruritus, vasodilation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and headache  (

         Infants and children tend not to have hypotension and syncopal episodes, which is a characteristic symptom in adults with SM. However, severe episodes of mast cell activation are seen in children with extensive skin involvement, increased basal serum tryptase values, and extensive blistering [

         Anaphylaxis can be observed in both CM and SM and can result from either immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated allergy or nonspecific activation of mast cells. Adults can present with severe hypotension following insect stings, which is rare in infants and children. (See

         Chronic mediator release can lead to gastrointestinal dysfunction, especially bloating and abdominal pain. Infants and children are often "picky eaters." In older children, diarrhea, reflux symptoms, and peptic ulcer disease are more typical problems. Gastrointestinal symptoms can be precipitated by spicy or strongly flavored foods and many of the same triggers that cause systemic symptoms  (

In contrast, the respiratory, endocrine, and genitourinary systems are seldom involved in SM, although patients with SM may have concomitant asthma at rates similar to the general population.

         </span>
         The evaluation of a child with skin lesions suggestive of mastocytosis involves history and physical examination, measurement of serum total tryptase, laboratory tests to detect involvement of other organs, and biopsy of lesional skin (unless the clinician is experienced enough to diagnose mastocytosis skin lesions without a biopsy). Note that patients can have systemic symptoms due to mediator release from cutaneous mast cells, so it is often difficult to tell if the patient has systemic disease or disease limited to the skin based on systemic symptoms alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because pediatric mastocytosis is usually limited to the skin and spontaneously improves, most infants and children will not require a bone marrow biopsy. However, children can have systemic disease, and a small minority will have aggressive forms of SM with poor prognoses. These children are usually detected by the presence of hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests, or cytopenias.
        </p>
        <p>
         If systemic symptoms are mild, there is no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy on physical examination, and routine laboratories are normal, then no additional evaluation is needed initially, and the child may be monitored. Further evaluation for systemic disease is indicated in children who have baseline levels of total tryptase &gt;20 ng/mL on at least two occasions, hepatosplenomegaly, or persistent and significant abnormalities of the complete blood count with differential.

         ]. If lesions of maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis/urticaria pigmentosa (MPCM/UP) are detected, then the examiner may lightly rub, scratch, or stroke a small area of the affected skin. The development of erythema, swelling, or urticaria over/around the lesion within a few minutes (Darier's sign) is pathognomonic for the presence of mast cells within the lesion. However, lesions consistent with mastocytomas should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be rubbed or scratched, as this may lead to significant mast cell-mediator release that can result in generalized flushing and hives. Instead, the caretaker can usually report that these symptoms occur if the lesion is disturbed. In addition, pictures of the lesions at the time of flares are recommended to document Darier's sign.

         </span>
         A level of serum total tryptase should be obtained when the patient is in a baseline state (ie, not immediately following an episode of symptoms). Tryptase is a protease produced predominantly in mast cells, although a small amount is made by basophils and myeloid precursors as well. Total serum tryptase can be measured with a commercially available assay (ImmunoCAP tryptase), which is performed at many laboratories. Normal levels are between 1 and 11.4 ng/mL. (Some laboratories consider 15 ng/mL to be the upper limit of normal.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Tryptase is usually normal in children with CM and elevated in those with SM. The presence of serum tryptase &gt;20 ng/mL is one of the minor criteria for the diagnosis of SM  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82827" href="/z/d/graphic/82827.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. However, tryptase can be elevated in CM when the skin is diffusely involved, such as in diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) or very extensive MPCM/UP, even in the absence of systemic disease [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,18,43-45
         </a>
         ]. Levels in excess of 100 ng/mL are not uncommon in the early stages of DCM, with gradual lowering over time [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,16,31
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 105 children with mastocytosis, tryptase levels were higher in patients with indolent SM and DCM compared with those with MPCM/UP [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Tryptase can also be elevated in patients with hereditary alpha tryptasemia (HaT), which can be present in patients with or without mastocytosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         An elevated tryptase in isolation does not correlate with the presence of systemic symptoms or bone marrow involvement [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Elevated tryptase values without other signs of systemic disease should be monitored every six months or yearly to assure that the level is stable or decreasing over time. In contrast, elevated tryptase in combination with organomegaly, should prompt further evaluation (ie,
         <em>
          KIT
         </em>
         mutational analysis of peripheral blood or a bone marrow biopsy) [

         In contrast, SM should be strongly suspected in patients with baseline levels of total tryptase &gt;20 ng/mL on at least two occasions (provided HaT has been excluded), liver or spleen enlargement, or abnormalities of the complete blood count with differential [

         The level of tryptase that is considered elevated is evolving. The World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for SM specifies a level of approximately 20 ng/mL as a minor criterion for SM. Different commercial laboratories set the upper limit of normal at either 11.4 or 15 ng/mL, as mentioned above. Individuals with HaT have levels above 7.5 or 8 ng/mL and as high as 60 ng/mL. The inclusion of individuals with HaT in the general population may have skewed the previous definitions of normal upwards. However, since most individuals with HaT are asymptomatic, a consensus paper recommended that baseline tryptase levels greater than 15 ng/mL be considered elevated [

         In most cases, cutaneous forms of mastocytosis are recognizable by inspection of the skin, and skin biopsy is not essential, particularly if the clinician is familiar with the appearance of CM. However, a 3 mm punch biopsy of lesional skin should be performed when the diagnosis of CM is in doubt. Skin biopsy does

        <p>
         Patients who are not already taking an H1 antihistamine regularly should take a dose prior to biopsy to reduce the effects of mediator release during the procedure. Specimens should be fixed in formalin and undergo histopathologic staining with Giemsa and/or immunohistochemical staining for tryptase and KIT (the receptor for stem cell factor, also called CD117). These stains identify both normal and abnormal mast cells. Degranulated mast cells can be difficult to identify without these specialized stains. Techniques for identifying mast cells in tissues are presented in more detail separately. (See

Mutational assays using D816V allele-specific PCR primers have the highest sensitivity of detection and usually can detect &lt;0.1 percent of the mutated allele in a sample, whereas sequencing-based techniques have poor sensitivity and should not be used for routine mutational analysis. Therefore, while a positive result on peripheral blood is helpful and may strengthen the need for bone marrow biopsy, a negative result does not exclude the possibility that an abnormal

         Pediatricians and dermatologists should perform a history and physical examination (with careful attention to the skin), obtain the initial laboratories mentioned above if possible, and obtain a biopsy of suggestive skin lesions if possible. Further evaluation usually requires specialty referral. When feasible, the following patients should be referred to an allergy/immunology or hematology expert with knowledge of mast cell disorders:

         One clinical scenario that can cause concern is the child with typical maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis/urticaria pigmentosa (MPCM/UP) who has an unexpectedly elevated tryptase.
         <em>
         </em>
         This is not common, because most children with MPCM/UP have disease limited to the skin and tryptase levels in the normal range. The finding of an elevated tryptase without other signs of organ infiltration or cytopenias can be followed for a few years. If no other concerning symptoms for SM develop aside from the elevated tryptase and the skin lesions are stable or improving, then the child likely has cutaneous disease that will regress gradually. During this period of monitoring, additional testing may be reassuring. The authors' approach in a patient with increasing or persistently high tryptase level whose skin lesions have persisted into adolescence or a patient showing new symptoms such as recurrent anaphylaxis
         <em>
         </em>
         is to consider (through shared decision making with the patient and caregivers) testing for hereditary alpha tryptasemia (HaT), which could explain the elevation in tryptase but may not be reimbursed by third-party payors. If HaT is not present or testing is not feasible, high-sensitivity allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutational analysis of
         <em>
          KIT
         </em>
         in the peripheral blood could be performed, although it is not as informative as a full bone marrow evaluation.
         <em>
         </em>
         Still, if there is a desire to avoid subjecting the child to a bone marrow analysis, then this strategy is often adequate and reassuring. The authors' approach is depicted in the algorithm  (

If tryptase trends downward over time, and skin lesions are regressing, then a bone marrow examination is not necessary.

         The bone marrow examination includes an evaluation of the histology of the core sample and of aspirated cells. Both types of samples should be examined for morphologically abnormal mast cells (eg, spindle-shaped, hypogranular forms). The components of bone marrow analysis are discussed in detail separately.

          Definitions and epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Mastocytosis is a group of disorders caused by excessive mast cell proliferation and accumulation in tissues. Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) describes disease limited to the skin. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) involves extracutaneous organ infiltration, with or without skin involvement. In children, cutaneous forms of disease account for approximately 90 percent of cases. Most affected children develop skin findings in the first year of life, although lesions can be present at birth. SM is uncommon in children, and aggressive forms of SM are rare. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Natural history
         </strong>
         – Mastocytosis in children is confined to the skin in most cases, and, although symptoms can be challenging to manage and occasionally associated with significant morbidity, the majority of children have a benign course and experience spontaneous improvement or resolution around the time of puberty. In contrast, adults more often have systemic disease that persists throughout life. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Natural history'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – CM and SM have characteristic presentations in infants and children:

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         The most frequent presentation of CM in children is the presence of characteristic accumulations of mast cells in the skin on the trunk, extremities, scalp, or neck. Most children have lesions that vary in size and shape (polymorphic) and are called maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis or urticaria pigmentosa (MPCM/UP). Polymorphic MPCM/UP is shown in images A to G  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105581" href="/z/d/graphic/105581.html" rel="external">
          picture 5
         </a>
         ). Two other variants of CM include mastocytomas  (

          picture 1A

         ) and diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM)  (

          picture 6A
         </a>
         ). Many children with skin lesions have minimal or no systemic symptoms, while others experience episodes of pruritus, flushing, nausea/vomiting, or diarrhea. Infants may have episodic blistering  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63556" href="/z/d/graphic/63556.html" rel="external">

         An infant or child with SM usually presents with numerous MPCM/UP lesions that are uniform in size and shape (monomorphic) and resemble the lesions seen in adult-onset mastocytosis. Monomorphic MPCM/UP is shown in images H and I  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105581" href="/z/d/graphic/105581.html" rel="external">
          picture 5
         </a>
         ). Skin findings are often accompanied by episodes of flushing, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Aggressive forms of SM are rare and present with hepato- or splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, similar to other hematologic malignancies. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Usual presentations'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Note that children with either CM or SM can have episodes of systemic symptoms (eg, pruritus, flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea) resulting from the release of mediators from mast cells, so the presence of systemic symptoms does not distinguish between cutaneous and systemic disease  (

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – The evaluation of a child with suspected mastocytosis begins with a skin examination for characteristic lesions. Darier's sign is the development of localized urticaria and erythema (within approximately five minutes) following rubbing, scratching, or stroking skin or skin lesions that are heavily infiltrated with mast cells [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Note that, although Darier's sign can be seen in MPCM/UP, DCM, and mastocytomas, mastocytomas and DCM s
         <strong>
          hould not
         </strong>
         be purposefully rubbed, as this can precipitate severe symptoms. All patients should also be assessed for lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, which indicate the possible presence of systemic disease. (See

          Initial laboratory studies

         – A complete blood count with differential, liver function tests, and a baseline serum tryptase should be obtained. Patients with persistent and unexplained abnormalities in any of these initial tests should be evaluated further for systemic forms of mastocytosis. If there is any doubt about whether skin lesions are consistent with CM, a punch biopsy should be obtained and analyzed with specific histopathologic stains. (See

         – Generalists should perform a history and physical examination, obtain the basic laboratories mentioned above if possible, and obtain a biopsy of suggestive skin lesions if needed. Further evaluation usually requires referral to either an allergy/immunology or hematology specialist with experience in mastocytosis. (See

          Further evaluation for systemic disease
         </strong>
         – The small minority of children with hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy on physical examination or abnormalities in initial laboratories (eg, unexplained cytopenias or liver function abnormalities, persistently elevated tryptase &gt;20 ng/mL) should be evaluated further for systemic disease. This evaluation consists of imaging studies that may include an abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (for hepatosplenomegaly) and a bone marrow biopsy  (
