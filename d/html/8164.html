         Aortic valve stenosis is the most common cause of left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction in children and adults; less common causes are subvalvular or supravalvular disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51024" href="/z/d/graphic/51024.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         The classic clinical manifestations of AS are heart failure (HF), syncope, and angina. However, these "classic" manifestations reflect end-stage disease. Now, with earlier diagnosis by echocardiography and prospective follow-up of patients, the following are the most common presenting symptoms (see early symptoms in  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83004" href="/z/d/graphic/83004.html" rel="external">

         )):

         <span class="glyph">

         Exertional angina
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These three "early symptoms" are nonspecific. Care must be taken in attributing these symptoms to AS since most patients with these symptoms do not have AS. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The patient with AS typically is asymptomatic for a prolonged period despite the obstruction and increased pressure load on the LV. There is wide variability in the degree of outflow obstruction that causes symptoms, depending in part upon patient size and level of physical activity. As a result, there is no single value of maximum aortic transvalvular velocity, mean transvalvular gradient, or aortic valve area that identifies when symptoms will occur  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630" href="/z/d/graphic/95630.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). In most patients with AS and normal LV systolic function, symptoms are uncommon until stenosis is severe (defined as a valve area ≤1.0 cm
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         , an aortic velocity 4.0 m/s or higher, and/or a mean transvalvular gradient ≥40 mmHg). Conversely, many patients who meet this definition of severe AS are not symptomatic because this definition was chosen to have a high sensitivity (not specificity) for identification of patients who might benefit from relief of outflow obstruction.
        </p>
        <p>
         In adults with moderate AS, care should be taken to avoid attributing symptoms caused by other disease processes (noncardiac or cardiac) to AS: dyspnea may be due to deconditioning or lung disease, ankle edema has many causes other than HF, and nonanginal chest or shoulder pain is not a symptom of AS.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, when severe AS is present, even mild cardiac symptoms require prompt intervention because average survival without valve replacement is only two to three years, with a high risk of sudden death  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83004" href="/z/d/graphic/83004.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Care is required to identify the cause of cardiac symptoms in patients with AS with concurrent cardiac conditions such as coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8165.html" rel="external">

         The most common symptom of AS is dyspnea, usually with exertion. Two factors can contribute: diastolic dysfunction with an increase in LV filling pressures with exercise and an inability of the LV to increase the cardiac output during exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
         Systolic LV dysfunction is uncommon, and overt HF is a late, often end-stage finding, usually in patients who have not received regular medical care. Once overt HF occurs, the patient may complain of shortness of breath, easy fatigability, debilitation, and other signs and symptoms of a low cardiac output state. Patients with severe low-gradient AS with either reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) or normal LVEF may present with HF, angina, and/or syncope [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in adults with severe AS and may precipitate onset of symptoms. (See

         Syncope occurs as a presenting symptom in approximately 10 percent of patients with symptomatic severe AS (or approximately 3 percent of all patients with severe AS) [

         Angina with effort is another symptom in patients with severe AS [

          5-7

         ]. Approximately one-half of these patients have underlying coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is also seen in a minority of patients with severe AS without angina. (See

         The physical examination often provides the first clue to the presence of AS. The physical examination correlates with the severity of AS, though no combination of physical findings has both a high sensitivity and high specificity for excluding severe AS, particularly in asymptomatic patients [

         A review of clinical studies evaluated the published evidence on the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination for abnormal systolic murmurs; most studies used cardiology examiners [

          10-12

         The quality of the arterial pulse in AS reflects the obstruction to blood flow into the peripheral arterial circulation. The arterial pulse has been described as "parvus and tardus," (ie, it is low volume and slow rising). This is best appreciated in the carotid artery where the pulse is reduced in amplitude and delayed in occurrence. However, the amplitude of the carotid upstroke may be preserved in older patients with AS due to vascular changes. The delay can be appreciated by simultaneous palpation of the apex (point of maximum impulse) and the carotid artery. There may also be an associated carotid artery thrill or coarse vibration ("shuddering") due to the marked turbulence of blood flow across the stenotic valve. (See

In addition, a systolic thrill may be felt at the base of the heart (right intercostal space) or at the sternal notch, especially during full expiration with the patient leaning forward.

         Stenosis of the aortic leaflets is associated with reduced mobility and delayed closure. This leads to the following constellation of heart sounds (see

         The second heart sound (S2) is soft and single since the aortic component of the second heart sound (A2), which is due to aortic valve closure, is delayed and tends to occur simultaneously with the pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2), which is due to pulmonic valve closure. The S2 may become paradoxically split when the stenosis is severe and associated with LV dysfunction  (

         ). With increasingly severe, fixed AS, the A2 closing sound may disappear. The presence of a normal split S2 is the most reliable finding to exclude severe AS in adults.

         The first heart sound (S1) is usually normal. However, an aortic ejection click, which is more commonly heard with a congenital bicuspid valve, may be heard after S1 early in AS when the leaflets are stiff but still somewhat compliant and mobile  (

         The murmur associated with AS is described as a systolic "ejection" murmur. It is typically heard best at the base of the heart in the "aortic" area (right intercostal space) where it has a harsh quality  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77091" href="/z/d/graphic/77091.html" rel="external">

          movie 4
         </a>
         ). The murmur is transmitted well and equally to the carotid arteries. Diminished intensity in one carotid artery may indicate the presence of a stenosis in that vessel. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1078.html" rel="external">
          "Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults", section on 'Valvular aortic stenosis'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The murmur generally begins after S1 and ends before S2. The intensity of the murmur reflects the amount and velocity of blood flow across the valve and the turbulence produced by the stenosis. A loud murmur (grade 4 or greater) has a high specificity for severe AS. However, most patients with severe stenosis have a grade 3 murmur, and many have only a grade 1 or 2 murmur. In patients with low flow low gradient AS, the murmur may be soft and almost inaudible. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8114.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient severe aortic stenosis", section on 'Symptoms and signs'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The timing of the murmur also correlates with the severity of the stenosis, similar to the timing of the carotid pulse. An early-peaking murmur is typical for mild to moderate AS, while a late-peaking murmur is consistent with severe AS. However, evaluation of the timing of the murmur is not reproducible among examiners and is therefore of limited clinical utility.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The murmur may also radiate to the apex of the heart, where it may have a different quality (musical due to high frequency vibrations) and may be louder, suggesting that the patient also has mitral regurgitation. This is known as the Gallavardin phenomenon. Another finding that has led to the misperception of two murmurs with different etiologies is that the murmur is often softer or even inaudible in the chest area between the apex and base.

         AS is often associated with a small degree of aortic regurgitation since the stiff, calcified, and rigid aortic valve leaflets may not coapt normally  (

         AS is usually diagnosed when physical examination (including a typical systolic ejection murmur) suggests AS or when AS is detected on a point-of-care ultrasound exam or on a diagnostic echocardiogram performed for other indications [

         With the increasing availability of point-of-care ultrasound, primary care providers may choose to incorporate limited imaging to detect aortic valve disease when symptoms or signs suggestive of AS are present, particularly in patients over age 65 years. Key findings on parasternal long-axis images include increased brightness/thickness of the aortic valve leaflets and reduced leaflet motion. LV hypertrophy is also a marker of AS. When point-of-care ultrasound is used, the provider should have a low threshold for proceeding to a diagnostic echocardiography study. Images showing thin aortic leaflets with normal systolic excursion, a normal aortic root, and normal LV wall thickness and systolic function suggest absence of significant AS. If AS is clinically suspected and AS is not excluded by identification of these normal findings, a complete diagnostic echocardiographic study is indicated [

         A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is indicated to diagnose and evaluate AS in patients with signs or symptoms of AS. The echocardiographic exam in patients with AS includes evaluation of valve anatomy and structure, valve hemodynamics, hemodynamic consequences (LV size and function and pulmonary artery pressure), and concomitant aortic regurgitation and other valve disease.

        <p>
         In patients with AS, the aortic leaflets are generally thickened and calcified with reduced systolic motion and a small aortic orifice during systole  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80369 graphicRef61369 graphicRef59344 graphicRef59538" href="/z/d/graphic/80369.html" rel="external">

         ). By contrast, in children or young adults with congenital AS, systolic motion of the leaflet bases ("doming") is seen despite a restricted orifice at the leaflet tips (see

          "Valvar aortic stenosis in children"

         ). Patients with concurrent aortic valve disease and primary LV systolic dysfunction may have reduced leaflet excursion, even when AS is not severe. The approach to distinguishing severe AS from mild-moderate AS with LV dysfunction is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         When a bicuspid aortic valve is present, systolic images show the two leaflets (and two commissures) of the open valve. A bicuspid valve may appear trileaflet on diastolic images if a raphe is present. In patients with bicuspid aortic valve, the risk of associated aortic root involvement may be related to the specific bicuspid valve phenotype (congenital fusion of the right and left versus the right and noncoronary cusps)  (

         The LV chamber is usually normal in size with normal systolic function. However, the LV wall is concentrically or uniformly hypertrophied  (

         ].

        <p>
         Mitral regurgitation is also common due to mitral annular calcification and leaflet thickening. The severity of mitral regurgitation is usually mild to moderate and may be exacerbated by the high systolic LV pressure resulting from the outflow obstruction. Echocardiography also allows evaluation of pulmonary hypertension.
        </p>
        <p>
         TTE typically is adequate for evaluation of AS and generally provides a broader selection of acoustic windows for measurement of aortic valve gradients than transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). However, TEE may be helpful in selected cases as it provides better images of aortic valve anatomy, providing better definition of the number of valve leaflets and degree of leaflet opening, and is more accurate for diagnosis of a sub- or supra-aortic membrane. TEE 3D imaging can also enable measurement of valve area, particularly for congenital AS.

         Body size should be considered in assessing valve area in smaller patients because a small valve area may be normal for body size in smaller individuals. However, indexing by body surface area is not recommended in overweight or obese adults. The most reliable measure of AS severity is aortic velocity (or gradient) alone when LV systolic function is normal. Valve area measurements are generally important only in patients with a low forward stroke volume due to a low ejection fraction or a small LV chamber size. (See

         An electrocardiogram (ECG) is not indicated for diagnosis for AS but is generally performed as a component of the initial evaluation.

         Asymptomatic patients with AS with normal LV function should be evaluated serially by history (to assess for development of symptoms including change in exercise tolerance), physical examination, and echocardiography to assess for evidence of progression. If exercise tolerance is uncertain, exercise testing is recommended. (See

         Exercise testing is suggested in selected patients with asymptomatic severe AS (maximum aortic valve velocity of ≥4.0 m/s or mean aortic valve pressure gradient ≥40 mmHg) who are sedentary to confirm asymptomatic status. Such evaluation is particularly helpful when a patient's level of physical activity is unclear or low. Standard maximum treadmill exercise (without echocardiography) is adequate, with key diagnostic parameters being exercise capacity (compared with age- and sex-matched individuals without cardiac disease), symptoms with exercise, and the blood pressure response to exercise. Patients with severe AS who develop typical symptoms of AS (eg, exertional dyspnea) during exercise testing should be considered symptomatic even if the clinical history is uncertain [

         For patients with equivocal symptoms (ie, symptoms that may or may not be caused by AS) and severe AS, natriuretic peptide (eg, plasma B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-BNP [NT-proBNP]) levels may be helpful; an elevated BNP or NT-proBNP level suggests that symptoms may be due to AS or other causes of high cardiac filling pressures.

         In a prospective study of 1953 patients with at least moderate AS with mean 3.8-year follow-up, a BNP ratio (measured BNP/maximal normal BNP value specific to age and sex) &gt;1 was defined as BNP clinical activation [

          24

         ]. BNP clinical activation independently predicted excess long-term mortality in the population as a whole (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.91, 95% CI 1.55-2.35) as well as in asymptomatic patients with normal LVEF (adjusted HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.57-3.56). Aortic valve replacement was associated with similar improvement in survival in patients with BNP ratio of &lt;2 (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89) or BNP ratio of ≥2 (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47-0.66).

         CMR is not used routinely for clinical evaluation of AS, and its availability is limited but may be an emerging approach as it enables evaluation of several features of AS. CMR provides accurate measurements of the size and shape of the aortic sinuses and ascending aorta, as well as 4D flow patterns, particularly in patients with AS due to bicuspid aortic valve disease. CMR also may show myocardial fibrosis and increased extracellular myocardial volumes, although the role of these findings in clinical decision-making has not yet been defined [

         Most patients with AS have LV hypertrophy with normal systolic function. However, some studies suggest that alterations in ventricular function are present as evidenced by reduced global longitudinal strain [

          37,38
         </a>
         ]. Diastolic dysfunction, secondary to hypertrophy and fibrosis, is common and often persists after valve replacement. These patients may present with HF with preserved ejection fraction. A subset of patients presents with LV systolic dysfunction due to the high afterload imposed by the stenotic valve (eg, afterload mismatch) resulting in a low ejection fraction and symptoms of HF with reduced ejection fraction. Ventricular dysfunction due to valve obstruction improves rapidly after valve replacement.

         Symptomatic severe AS is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death. In patients with severe AS but no reported symptoms, the annual incidence of sudden death is approximately 1 percent [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,41
         </a>
         ]. In adults with symptoms due to severe AS, the annual incidence of sudden death has been reported to range from 8 to 34 percent in observational studies [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. However, in a small (n = 145) randomized clinical trial of early aortic valve replacement for asymptomatic severe AS, death from any cause occurred in five patients in the early-surgery group (7 percent) and in 15 patients in the conservative-care group (21 percent) (hazard ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.90). In the conservative-care group, the cumulative incidence of sudden death was 4 percent at four years and 14 percent at eight years [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. However, many of these patients had very severe AS and thus were candidates for aortic valve replacement even if asymptomatic.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanism of sudden death has not been established. A potential cause is activation of ventricular baroreceptors resulting in paradoxical bradycardia, decreased contractility, and hypotension (Bezold-Jarisch reflex). Another possible cause is ventricular tachyarrhythmias, although an association between ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in patients with AS has not been established.
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of sudden death is reduced by valve replacement, so prompt valve replacement is generally recommended for symptomatic AS. Valve replacement is not recommended in asymptomatic adults with severe AS and normal LV systolic function, although a small randomized, controlled trial from Japan suggested that early aortic valve replacement might be beneficial in patients with a low surgical risk [

         Intraventricular or atrioventricular conduction abnormalities are uncommon and, when present, may be due to severe hypertrophy, extension of calcium from the valve and valve ring into the interventricular septum, or concomitant heart disease.

         Atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncommon in adults with mild to moderate AS (seen in 5 to 6 percent [

         <a href="#rid45">
          45

         <a href="#rid44">
          44,46
         </a>

         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. New-onset AF can precipitate symptom onset in adults with severe AS because the loss of atrial contraction and the rapid heart rate both limit diastolic filling of the small, stiff LV. (See

         In the above cited series of patients with mild to moderate AS, longstanding AF compared with no AF at baseline was associated with a 4.1-fold higher risk of HF (CI 1.2-13.8) and a 4.8-fold higher risk of nonhemorrhagic stroke (CI 1.7-13.6) [

         Infective endocarditis (IE) can occur in patients with AS, particularly those with a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve. In a series of 2401 patients with congenital heart lesions who were followed prospectively, those with AS developed IE at a rate of 0.27 percent per year [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. A higher peak gradient across the aortic valve was associated with a greater risk of IE. Although definitive data are lacking, clinical experience suggests that the risk of IE is lower in older patients with heavily calcified valves than in younger patients with less severe abnormalities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2007 American Heart Association guidelines on IE revised prior recommendations for patients with acquired valvular disease, including those with AS [

         recommended when patients with AS undergo dental or other invasive procedures that produce significant bacteremia with organisms associated with endocarditis.

         Patients with AS have an increased risk of bleeding, including chronic gastrointestinal bleeding that is often due to angiodysplasia (also known as arteriovenous malformation) and bleeding at skin and mucosal sites. The association between chronic gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia and calcific AS has been termed Heyde syndrome [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         The increased risk of bleeding appears to be due to an acquired von Willebrand syndrome, which has been described in 67 to 92 percent of patients with severe AS [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. This abnormality is thought to result from mechanical disruption of von Willebrand multimers during turbulent passage through the narrowed valve and from a von Willebrand factor interaction with platelets that triggers platelet clearance [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50,51
         </a>
         ]. The severity of the von Willebrand factor abnormality is directly related to the severity of the AS, as measured by the mean transvalvular gradient [

         The most likely explanation for the association of AS with angiodysplasia is that patients with AS have an increased bleeding tendency, leading to the identification of angiodysplasia. This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Symptoms of severe AS overlap symptoms of other causes of HF, angina, and syncope or presyncope. Therefore, other causes for these symptoms should be considered, such as cardiomyopathy as a cause of HF and coronary artery disease as a cause of angina. As noted above, in adults with moderate AS, care should be taken to avoid attributing symptoms caused by other disease processes to AS. Approaches to the diagnostic evaluation of suspected HF, chest pain, and syncope are discussed separately. (See

         Symptoms of dyspnea on exertion may be due to noncardiac causes in adults with AS, and it can be challenging to distinguish the cause of symptoms in many patients. Pulmonary disease is common in AS patients; standard pulmonary function tests are recommended when this is a concern. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can also provide objective evidence of whether exertional limitation is due to cardiac or pulmonary disease. (See

         In a patient with AS with new onset symptoms, it is mandatory to consider other causes for these symptoms, particularly when symptoms seem out of proportion to the severity of outflow obstruction. Complete history, physical examination, and laboratory testing are recommended to evaluate for other prevalent conditions (eg, anemia, cancer, and depression). However, when a thorough evaluation does not show any other significant comorbid conditions to account for symptoms, it is likely that symptoms are due to AS, and the patient should be considered for aortic valve replacement.

         Subvalvular AS can result from a variety of fixed lesions. These include a thin membrane (the most common lesion), thick fibromuscular ridge, diffuse tunnel-like obstruction, abnormal mitral valve attachments, and occasionally, accessory endocardial cushion tissue. (See

          Symptoms
         </strong>
         – The patient with AS is generally asymptomatic for a prolonged period. There is wide variability in the degree of outflow obstruction that causes symptoms, depending in part upon patient size and level of physical activity. As a result, there are no hemodynamic values that identify when symptoms will occur  (

         ). (See

         The classic symptoms of aortic stenosis (AS) are heart failure, angina, and syncope. However, the most common symptoms in patients who are followed prospectively are often nonspecific (eg, decreased exercise tolerance, dyspnea on exertion, and dizziness), so care must be taken in attributing these symptoms to AS. Prompt attention is required when even mild symptoms develop in a patient with severe AS given the poor prognosis with medical management  (

          Signs
         </strong>
         – Typical signs of AS are a low volume and slow-rising carotid pulse, a mid- to late-peaking systolic murmur in the right intercostal space  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77091" href="/z/d/graphic/77091.html" rel="external">

          movie 4
         </a>
         ), and a single second heart sound. Although the physical examination may suggest the presence and severity of AS, no single finding or combination of findings on physical examination has both high sensitivity and high specificity for excluding severe AS, particularly in asymptomatic patients.

         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – AS is usually diagnosed when physical examination (including a typical systolic ejection murmur) suggests AS or when AS is detected on an echocardiogram performed for other indications. Echocardiography is the primary test in diagnosis and evaluation of AS. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis and evaluation'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When AS severity is uncertain, additional testing may include exercise stress testing, computed tomography for quantitation of valve calcification, transesophageal echocardiography for better visualization of valve anatomy, or serum markers such as B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Cardiac catheterization rarely is needed for diagnosis.

          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The differential diagnosis of exertional dyspnea in an older adult is broad, mandating echocardiography if a murmur is present. The differential diagnosis of systolic ejection murmur includes other causes of left ventricular outflow obstruction, including aortic sclerosis without significant stenosis and subvalvular AS (due to a fixed lesion or due to dynamic obstruction as seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and supravalvular AS.

          Evaluation of AS stages
         </strong>
         – The stages of AS are defined according to valve anatomy, valve hemodynamics, hemodynamic consequences of AS, and symptoms  (
