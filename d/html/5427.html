         Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a nonsteroidal estrogen first synthesized in 1938. It was initially used for postpartum lactation suppression and treatment of postmenopausal symptoms but quickly became an accepted intervention for prevention of miscarriage, preterm delivery, and other obstetric problems. DES exposure is associated with increased risks of cervical and vaginal cancer, congenital anomalies of the female and male genitourinary tracts, and adverse effects on fertility and reproductive function.
        </p>
        <p>
         DES remains the only firmly established transplacental carcinogen in humans. Because of this risk, it is important to continue to monitor exposed offspring and their mothers for long-term health effects. Patients who took DES during pregnancy should inform their health care providers and their offspring. Offspring should also inform their health care providers of in utero exposure. We generally agree with the American Cancer Society and National Cancer Institute (NCI) recommendations for follow-up of DES-exposed individuals [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. These recommendations reflect expert opinion based on the data described above. Where the recommendations are vague, we have provided our approach to these patients.
        </p>

         The outcomes and care of DES-exposed individuals are reviewed here. Other issues related to female reproductive tract anomalies or vaginal or cervical cancer are discussed separately. (See

         It is estimated that five million pregnant patients worldwide received DES to improve pregnancy outcome. Use of DES in pregnant patients to prevent miscarriage began in approximately 1938, but use did not become common until the late 1940s, and it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication in 1947 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Although clinical trials in the 1950s demonstrated that it was ineffective for prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], it remained in use until 1971 in the United States and until the early 1980s in some other countries (eg, France stopped use in 1977 [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]). The peak years of DES use were approximately 1952 to 1954, and the range was approximately 1945 to 1971. In 1971, in utero exposure to DES was linked to the occurrence of vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) in female offspring [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], which prompted the FDA to advise against its use in pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. DES is no longer commercially available for human use in North America.

         DES readily crosses the placenta. Exposure to DES during a critical period of organogenesis disorganizes the developing uterine muscle layers; causes maldevelopment of the uterotubal junction; and prevents stratification of the vaginal epithelium and resorption of vaginal glands, resulting in vaginal adenosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In murine studies, the mechanism for DES-induced adenosis is blocked expression of Trp63 in müllerian duct epithelium at epithelial estrogen receptor alpha [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. DES has also been shown to alter normal programming of the gene families Hox and Wnt, which affect differentiation of the reproductive tract [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         DES is also important as the model agent for endocrine-disrupting chemicals and their effects on fetal development and adult health [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. Aberrant DNA methylation has been proposed as a molecular mechanism whereby endocrine disruptors such as DES regulate developmental programming [
         <a href="#rid16">

         Most patients who received DES were of higher socioeconomic status and thus very few very young (&lt;20 years old) patients would have been exposed. Therefore, in 2020, the most common age range for DES mothers would be 87 to 107 years (many are deceased), with the very youngest mothers being approximately 69 years of age.

         As in all patients, recommendations for initiation, method, and frequency of breast cancer screening should be based on patient-specific composite risk factors, including DES exposure. In the absence of any other risk factors for breast cancer, the lifetime risk of breast cancer in DES mothers is estimated to be approximately 17 percent, which is considered mildly to moderately elevated (where low risk is &lt;15 percent and high risk is &gt;20 to 25 percent lifetime risk). A detailed discussion of initiation, frequency, and modalities for breast cancer screening based on patient-specific factors can be found separately.

          17-22

         ]. Patients who took DES had a small increased risk of breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.07-1.52); looked at in another way, their lifetime risk of breast cancer increased from one in eight (approximately 12 percent) to one in six (approximately 17 percent). There was no evidence of an interaction between the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy and DES in relation to breast cancer risk, and the risk did not increase over time. The higher risk did not appear to be due to inherent characteristics of the patients who were given DES (ie, patients with pregnancy problems) [

          Screening for cervical and vaginal cancer

         – Historically, DES-exposed daughters were advised to have an annual gynecologic examination with screening for cervical and/or vaginal cancer, and no stopping age has been determined. However, most guidelines from major expert groups (eg, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology [ASCCP]) do not specifically address cervical and vaginal cancer screening in such patients.

         During speculum examination, we rotate the speculum to allow inspection of the entire epithelial surface of the vagina and cervix. Adenosis may appear red and granular, while squamous metaplasia may be indistinguishable from normal squamous epithelium without iodine staining. Clear cell carcinoma of the cervix or vagina usually presents as a polypoid mass, but findings may vary and any raised, hard, or fleshy lesions should be evaluated further. Vaginal neoplasms most often occur on the anterior wall.

         Bimanual pelvic and rectal examinations include palpation of the entire length of the vagina, including the fornices, and a thorough digital examination of the cervix. This is essential for detection of CCA and may be the only way to identify these lesions; cytology will be negative if tumor cells have not penetrated the vaginal epithelium. Areas of thickening or induration or nodules should raise suspicion for CCA and should be biopsied.

         We continue annual screening as long as the patient is a candidate for intervention if cancer is diagnosed. However, the age at which to discontinue screening is unknown. No studies have evaluated when screening can be discontinued in such patients, and there are no recommendations from expert groups regarding an upper age limit.

         DES daughters have a greatly increased risk of vaginal or cervical CCA, but the absolute number of cases of this disease remains low.

         DES daughters have a 40-fold increase in risk of CCA of the vagina and cervix compared with unexposed patients [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>
         ]. However, the cumulative lifetime incidence of CCA is very low, estimated to be 1 case per 1000 to 2000 DES-exposed daughters. A registry established to track cases of cervical and vaginal CCA worldwide included 775 cases as of 2015; approximately two-thirds of these cases were patients exposed to DES in utero [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,30-32
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients in the registry, overall survival at five years was approximately 80 percent, but slightly higher in DES daughters than other patients (86 versus 81 percent), and at 20 years was approximately 70 percent [
         <a href="#rid32">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most cases of DES-associated CCA have been diagnosed among females in their late teens and 20s, with a range of 7 to 48 years [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. By comparison, most cases of CCA among nonexposed patients occur postmenopausally, although early and late age peaks have been reported in nonexposed patients [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no data to allow clear conclusions about the upper age limit for the diagnosis of DES-associated CCA, especially regarding late risk in DES daughters after menopause. Although there is no firm evidence, a possible increase in incidence of DES-associated CCA at age ≥40 years has been suggested [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26

        <p>
         Oncogenic HPVs are unlikely to be a cofactor in the development of CCA of the vagina or cervix; however, if there is an association, it is less than that reported for squamous or non-CCAs [

         Adenosis of the vagina or cervix is defined as the development of columnar epithelium of the ectocervix and vagina rather than normal squamous epithelium. The columnar epithelium may cover the surface or form glands within the stromal wall. As a result, the squamocolumnar junction, which is normally near the external os or in the endocervical canal, can be in the vagina. DES is one cause but not the only cause of adenosis; it may be related to other hormones or environmental chemicals (endocrine disrupters) [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a large cohort study of DES-exposed patients (the National Cooperative Diethylstilbestrol Adenosis [DESAD] project), one-third of these patients had vaginal and cervical adenosis [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence of adenosis in DES daughters has been reported as high as 91 percent in some studies compared with 4 percent in non-DES-exposed controls [

        </p>
        <p>
         Adenosis often regresses over time; in the DESAD cohort, the majority of patients with vaginal adenosis underwent vaginal epithelial changes, and the lesions appeared to regress [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37

         The risk of high-grade CIN was increased almost twofold in DES-exposed daughters (cumulative risk to age 55 years: CIN2 or higher [CIN2+] was 5.3 versus 2.6 percent in controls; hazard ratio [HR] 2.10, 95% CI 1.41-3.13) [
         <a href="#rid41">

         A study from the Netherlands reported an increased risk of CIN1 among approximately 12,000 DES-exposed daughters compared with expected rates from the general population, but no overall increase in CIN2, 3, or invasive cervical cancer was found. An increased risk of CIN2 was found among DES-exposed daughters with vaginal/cervical epithelial changes, but the authors speculated that this increase, as well as the increase in CIN1, was likely due to increased screening in these daughters. DES exposure was originally ascertained by self-report as opposed to medical records [

         An increased risk in female patients ≥40 years of age exposed to DES in utero was observed in a prospective cohort study from the United States (3.9 versus 2.2 percent, HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.04-3.18) [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43

However, a subsequent study suggested that the increased risk in exposed female patients has attenuated as the cohort has aged, with an overall HR for prenatal DES exposure compared with no exposure of 1.07 for all ages combined, and a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.17 (95% CI 1.01-1.36) [

         The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised against DES use in pregnant patients in 1971. Exposure may have continued in some United States patients and in other countries through the 1980s. At some point, all of these patients will be postmenopausal, and reproductive impacts will no longer be part of clinical care, as noted above.

         The majority of patients exposed to DES in utero do not have difficulty becoming pregnant, but DES exposure did appear to confer a higher risk of subfertility. The largest comprehensive study of 3769 DES-exposed and 1654 unexposed patients found that DES-exposed patients were more than twice as likely to experience infertility (attempting but failing to conceive over a period of ≥12 months) compared with unexposed patients (cumulative risk to age 45 years: 33.3 versus 15.5 percent; HR 2.37, 95% CI 2.05-2.75) [

         Patients exposed to DES in utero also experienced higher risks of miscarriage and premature birth, possibly related to the structural abnormalities of the cervix/uterus seen in DES daughters.

Medical records were obtained for approximately 60 percent of reported CVD outcomes and were validated in 78 percent. When the analysis was restricted to verified outcomes, including CVD deaths from linkage with the National Death Index, the association between prenatal DES exposure and CVD persisted, with a 74 percent (HR 1.74, 95% CI 0.82-3.68) increase in coronary artery disease risk and 163 percent (HR 2.63, 95% CI 0.90-7.74) increase in myocardial infarction.

         The role of DES in the development of testicular cancer is a controversial subject. Cryptorchidism (a risk factor for testicular cancer) has been reported in the sons of patients exposed to DES or oral estrogens during pregnancy, and some studies reported an association between DES or other exogenous hormone exposure during pregnancy and testicular cancer [

The number of cases analyzed was small, further limiting the power of the studies. In the only cohort study with medical record confirmation of exposure status, the testicular cancer incidence rate in exposed sons was approximately three times that of the unexposed but was based on only six exposed and two unexposed cases [

         The terms third-generation DES daughter or son refer to a child of a DES daughter (ie, a female exposed to DES in utero). Few human studies on the transgenerational effects of DES have been published. Adverse effects are suggested by some data, but further study is needed. Epigenetic alterations are the proposed mechanism of third-generation effects [

         A prospective cohort study assessed menstrual and reproductive outcomes with baseline and follow-up questionnaires. A total of 796 females with a mother exposed to DES in utero and 469 females with an unexposed mother were included in the baseline survey [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91
         </a>
         ]. Based on follow-up data from a total of 381 exposed and 280 unexposed included in this cohort, third-generation DES daughters had a slightly increased prevalence of irregular menses (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.32, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, 25 versus 19 percent), amenorrhea (PR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.49, 18 versus 15 percent), and preterm delivery (PR 1.54, 95% CI 1.35-1.75, 12 versus 8 percent). There was little difference in age at menarche. An analysis within a subset of females whose mothers had vaginal epithelial changes found that the prevalence of amenorrhea was slightly higher among third-generation DES-exposed compared with unexposed.

         No clear increase in cancer risk in third-generation males and females has been demonstrated. A possible increase in ovarian tumors in third-generation females was observed; however, this was based upon only three cases in the exposed group and is thus uncertain [

ADHD among offspring was reported by 8 percent of exposed versus 5 percent of unexposed mothers (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.1-1.67). When the analysis was stratified by trimester of DES exposure, the association was highest for offspring of mothers who had been exposed to DES during the first trimester (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.18-2.25). There was little evidence for effect modification by sex of the offspring, although ADHD was more common among male offspring, as expected.
