It accounts for approximately 5 to 10 percent of cases of diabetes in the United States, Canada, and Europe (whereas type 2 diabetes accounts for over 90 percent). Although type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, it also presents in adulthood when it is sometimes misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes. In general, the younger the age of diagnosis and the longer the duration of type 1 diabetes, the greater the likelihood that the individual will have absolute insulin deficiency with undetectable C-peptide levels.</p><p>This topic will review the management of blood glucose in nonpregnant adults with type 1 diabetes. Management of type 1 diabetes in children, adolescents, and during pregnancy is reviewed separately.

Intensive insulin therapy is the standard of care for people with type 1 diabetes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17221387"><span class="h2">Glycemic targets</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and glucose monitoring are critical for directing therapy. For some populations, for example African Americans, the relationship between A1C and mean glucose derived from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may be different from that in White Americans. However, there is even greater variation in this relationship within races than between them [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1807.html" rel="external">"Measurements of chronic glycemia in diabetes mellitus", section on 'Racial/ethnic differences'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Glycated hemoglobin</strong> – A1C goals in people with diabetes should be tailored to the individual, balancing the demonstrated benefits with regard to prevention and delay of micro- and macrovascular complications with the risk of hypoglycemia. For most adults with type 1 diabetes, we aim for an A1C value of ≤7 percent (using an assay aligned to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT] in which the upper limit of normal is 6 percent). A1C goals may be higher in people in whom the risks of tighter glycemic management outweigh the benefits. Data from the T1D Exchange Clinic Registry and from a United States electronic health record database suggest that the majority of adults with type 1 diabetes do not achieve an A1C goal of &lt;7 percent, with the highest mean A1C levels observed in adolescents and young adults  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119046" href="/z/d/graphic/119046.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood glucose</strong> – In general, for healthy, young and middle-aged adults, the target glucose range is 70 to 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10 mmol/L), while minimizing time in hypoglycemia (&lt;70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) and hyperglycemia (&gt;180 mg/dL [10 mmol/L]) and avoiding glucose readings of &lt;54 mg/dL (3 mmol/L) and &gt;250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Based on blood glucose monitoring (BGM; using fingersticks and glucose meter) in individuals with type 1 diabetes, the approximate mean blood glucose levels associated with A1C levels of 6.50 to 6.99 percent have been reported as 144, 140, and 154 mg/dL for fasting, pre-meals, and pre-bed, respectively [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, studies using CGM have shown considerable between-person variability in mean glucose for any given A1C level [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interstitial glucose</strong> – CGM measures interstitial glucose levels every one to five minutes. Interstitial glucose concentrations correlate well with blood glucose results. CGM metrics are being increasingly used to assess chronic glycemia. A time in range [70 to 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10 mmol/L)] of 70 percent has been associated with an estimated A1C of approximately 7 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Additional important metrics include percent time in hypoglycemia, coefficient of variation (CV; a measure of glucose variability), and the "glucose management indicator" (GMI), which is based on mean CGM glucose [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring blood glucose'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Glycemic targets (A1C goals) are generally set higher (eg, &lt;7.5 or &lt;8 percent, or higher) for older adults and those with a history of severe hypoglycemia, impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, comorbidities, or a limited life expectancy [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. In older adults with type 1 diabetes, high glucose variability predicts increased risk of hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid8">8,11</a>], underscoring the importance of minimizing glucose variability in addition to achieving A1C targets.</p><p>More stringent glycemic goals may be indicated for selected motivated individuals with type 1 diabetes and during pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4802.html" rel="external">"Pregestational (preexisting) diabetes mellitus: Antenatal glycemic control"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1751.html" rel="external">"Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Glycemic targets'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17221493"><span class="h2">Insulin replacement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For people with type 1 diabetes, the goal of insulin therapy is to provide a physiologic profile of insulin by administration of a basal insulin (delivered by daily or twice-daily injections of an intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin preparation or continuous subcutaneous delivery of a rapid-acting insulin preparation via a pump) plus mealtime (prandial) boluses of a rapid-acting, ultra rapid-acting, or short-acting insulin  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130874" href="/z/d/graphic/130874.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The dose of the pre-meal bolus is determined by the ambient blood glucose level before the meal, the size and composition of the meal, anticipated activity levels, and trending glucose levels (when available) from CGM. (See <a class="local">'Insulin regimens'</a> below.)</p><p>This physiologic replacement of insulin with "basal-bolus" insulin therapy should be started as early as possible following the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Simpler regimens (eg, twice-daily injections of short-acting [regular] and intermediate-acting [NPH] insulin mixed together in the same syringe and given in fixed amounts before breakfast and dinner) are not recommended unless the person cannot or will not adhere to multiple injections or an insulin pump. (See <a class="local">'Choice of insulin delivery'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1752.html" rel="external">"General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus", section on 'Insulin preparations'</a>.)</p><p>The DCCT and its long-term Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) follow-up study showed that, compared with a simple insulin regimen, early aggressive insulin therapy substantially and uniformly decreased the complications that accompany type 1 diabetes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The DCCT and other smaller studies demonstrated that improved glycemia with intensive insulin therapy in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus led to reductions in relatively early stages of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy by 35 to 76 percent  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61305" href="/z/d/graphic/61305.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73143" href="/z/d/graphic/73143.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The EDIC follow-up study from the DCCT demonstrated that improved glycemia with intensive insulin therapy also reduces more advanced stages of microvascular disease, as well as cardiovascular disease and mortality [<a href="#rid14">14-18</a>].</p><p></p><p>In addition, in the DCCT, early aggressive insulin therapy helped to sustain endogenous insulin secretion, which was associated with a lower A1C and a lower risk for severe hypoglycemia, defined as an episode of biochemical hypoglycemia that required assistance from another to treat [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>What was considered "intensive therapy" in the DCCT is now considered to be standard therapy for management of type 1 diabetes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1751.html" rel="external">"Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p>Optimal insulin therapy requires an understanding of insulin pharmacokinetics  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130874" href="/z/d/graphic/130874.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). A number of factors influence the pharmacokinetics of insulin, including the insulin preparation, size of subcutaneous depot, injection technique, site of injection, alterations in subcutaneous blood flow, and, potentially, the presence and titer of anti-insulin antibodies. These issues are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1752.html" rel="external">"General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17221653"><span class="h2">Monitoring blood glucose</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monitoring blood glucose is an integral part of intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes as it is necessary to direct insulin dosing.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>BGM</strong> – BGM, previously called self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), requires intermittent capillary blood sampling and the use of a glucose meter. Ideally, individuals who use BGM (rather than continuous glucose monitoring [CGM]) should test their blood glucose at least four times daily, before meals and at bedtime. Additional testing may be indicated two to three hours after meals and occasionally at 3 AM (for safety), as well as before and after exercise, before driving, and whenever hypoglycemia is suspected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1781.html" rel="external">"Glucose monitoring in the ambulatory management of nonpregnant adults with diabetes mellitus", section on 'BGM systems'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CGM</strong> – When available and affordable, CGM should be offered to all adults with type 1 diabetes, and it is especially useful for those who are having frequent or severe hypoglycemia and those who have developed impaired hypoglycemic awareness. Several generations of devices that sample glucose continuously from interstitial fluid are available, with further development in progress. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1781.html" rel="external">"Glucose monitoring in the ambulatory management of nonpregnant adults with diabetes mellitus", section on 'Benefits of CGM'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Real-time CGM devices measure and automatically transmit glucose values to a receiver every five minutes. They also can alert (alarm) for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. There are CGM systems that transmit glucose data to mobile phones and allow users to "share" their data with family members, friends, and caregivers; others require the use of device-specific receivers. The immediate feedback of glucose results allows timely intervention for high, low, or trending glucose levels to aid management and avert serious hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events. Some CGM devices provide feedback to insulin pumps, allowing automatic adjustments of basal rate infusions for low or falling glucose levels (low glucose suspend) and high or rising glucose levels (automated increases in basal infusion). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/123060.html" rel="external">"Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump)", section on 'Types of insulin pumps'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition to the real-time CGM devices, a "flash" or "intermittent scanning" CGM device is commercially available. This device does not require calibration. Users must pass the reader (or their smartphone) over the sensor/transmitter to visualize the glucose readings, which are measured every minute and recorded every 15 minutes. Scanning must occur at least every eight hours for data to be recorded. The first model of this device does not alarm, but a subsequent model can provide real-time alarms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because of reliability and availability issues and the need for calibration for some of the older devices, CGM does not eliminate the need for at least occasional fingerstick glucose checks (BGM).

All people with type 1 diabetes require intensive initial as well as ongoing self-management education and support in order to manage their diabetes safely and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. It is important to understand the effects of diet, physical activity, and stress on blood glucose; proper use of glucose and ketone monitoring; proper insulin injection techniques and use of insulin pump (when applicable); sick day rules; recognition, treatment, and prevention of hypoglycemia; foot care; and strategies for the prevention and management of complications.

Matching insulin delivery to insulin needs requires understanding the anticipated glucose excursion with meals and selecting a dose of rapid-acting, ultra rapid-acting, or short-acting insulin that will control these postprandial blood glucose excursions. Use of insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios can avoid the need to eat a fixed amount of carbohydrate at certain meals. If individuals plan to eat less carbohydrate at a meal, they simply decrease the dose of prandial insulin accordingly. Mobile apps are available to help individuals estimate the carbohydrate content of their meals.</p><p>People with diabetes vary considerably in how much insulin they need to cover a set amount of carbohydrate. Some adults need a different "insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio" at different meals. In addition, meals with higher fat and protein content may require different insulin delivery profiles and higher insulin doses to prevent late postprandial hyperglycemia [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>].

Routine physical activity also has cardiovascular and other benefits. We encourage healthy adults with diabetes to perform at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity on most days of the week. To increase adherence, the clinician should advise choosing a type of activity or exercise the individual will enjoy and offer regular encouragement and suggestions for overcoming barriers to exercise.</p><p>Four aspects of exercise are important to consider:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The effect of exercise on blood glucose varies with the time of day and whether the person is relatively hypoinsulinemic or hyperinsulinemic at that time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Late hypoglycemia can occur several hours after vigorous aerobic exercise, due to repletion of muscle glycogen stores.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The type (aerobic versus weightbearing), intensity, and duration of the exercise can affect glycemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exercise may change the profile of insulin absorption with more rapid absorption from an exercising limb.</p><p></p><p>Adjustments to the insulin regimen before, during, and after exercise are reviewed separately.

Regardless of the mode of insulin delivery (MDI versus CSII), clinical trials in adults with type 1 diabetes have reported improved glycemic outcomes with the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), with similar or lower A1C levels, less frequent hypoglycemia, and greater time in the target range. Some insulin pumps, which integrate with CGM systems, have features that can reduce hypoglycemia by temporarily suspending insulin infusion ("low glucose suspend" feature); newer pumps that communicate with CGMs provide automated basal insulin delivery as well as autocorrection insulin doses for hyperglycemia, improving time in range and reducing hypoglycemia.

In addition, CSII may allow more flexibility in the timing of meals (a relative advantage that may be shared with MDI regimens that use insulin analogs instead of NPH).</p><p>CSII can deliver insulin accurately in fractions of units, which can be a benefit for adults who are very insulin sensitive. Doses as low as 0.05 units can be accurately delivered with CSII, whereas non-pump insulin delivery can only provide insulin in 0.5- to 1-unit increments.

Device removal for one hour or less does not usually lead to deterioration of glycemia. For longer periods (such as overnight), the individual should transition to an intermediate-acting or long-acting basal insulin. The "patch" pump, which is controlled wirelessly, is preferred by some adults who desire a tubeless option.

For some adults use of hybrid closed-loop systems may reduce fear of nocturnal hypoglycemia, thereby decreasing anxiety and improving duration of sleep. The next generation of fully automated insulin delivery systems are being designed to reduce the burden of self-care associated with type 1 diabetes.

In general, nonpregnant adults with type 1 diabetes are seen every three months, although stable patients who are safely meeting their glycemic goals can be seen less frequently. During adjustments of therapy and if individuals are not meeting glycemic goals, they may need to be seen more frequently. For some individuals, many day-to-day problems can be solved over the telephone or via televisits or email, especially if data from devices (glucose meter, insulin pump, continuous glucose monitors [CGM]) have been uploaded and/or blood glucose levels have been faxed or emailed prior to the conversation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessment of glucose patterns and insulin adjustment</strong> – At clinic visits, all devices (glucose meters, CGM, pumps) should be downloaded and the glucose and insulin data reviewed. The insulin regimen is adjusted based on glucose patterns, with a focus on reducing hypoglycemia while achieving target glucose and A1C levels. There should be ongoing discussion and agreement on individualized target glucose and A1C levels, determined by the person's age, comorbidities, history of hypoglycemia, and preference.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is useful to review the patient's blood glucose monitoring (BGM) technique, insulin injection timing and technique, and food records. The results obtained should be discussed so that the patient can learn how to interpret the findings and how to make appropriate adjustments in dietary intake and insulin dose. Improving chronic glycemia over the long term requires a major effort to prevent complacency and to avoid burnout.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A number of different patterns and problems can be identified during this initial period. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1797.html" rel="external">"Cases illustrating problems with insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Postprandial hyperglycemia</strong> – If postprandial rises in blood glucose are too high, options include modifying the content of the diet (including more high fiber, slowly absorbed carbohydrate, and/or reducing the amount of carbohydrate), altering the time between when the insulin is given and the meal is started, and/or adjusting the preprandial insulin dose. Postprandial hyperglycemia also may be attenuated by using a rapid-acting insulin analog rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">regular insulin</a>, as rapid-acting insulin is absorbed and therefore acts more rapidly than regular insulin, resulting in lower postprandial blood glucose values [<a href="#rid75">75</a>].

Basal insulin should keep glucose readings at target when the individual is not eating, exercising, or under stress. Assessment of the basal insulin dose should be based on glucose profiles at least three to four hours after the last meal or snack and any related insulin bolus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Blood glucose values at 3 AM also may be helpful for assessing basal insulin dosing, but overnight glycemic patterns may not solely reflect basal insulin dosing. When addressing nocturnal and fasting hyperglycemia, the patient should be queried about evening snacking and bedtime insulin bolusing for food and/or correction of hyperglycemia. Evening or night-time snacking with insufficient coverage with rapid-acting insulin can cause fasting hyperglycemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>No discernible pattern</strong> – If the blood glucose records show no consistent pattern, the problem may be an erratic lifestyle and eating pattern. If the patient is consistent in the content and timing of meals, the site and timing of insulin injections, and the timing and frequency of exercise, it is easier to interpret blood glucose patterns and adjust the regimen appropriately. Compared with previous nonphysiologic, fixed-dose regimens, current regimens allow somewhat more flexibility in timing of meals, meal size, and composition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Some women need to alter their insulin dosing a few days prior to menses.

Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia becomes more prevalent with longer duration of type 1 diabetes and in adults with recurrent hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. It is important to screen for and address hypoglycemia unawareness and to ensure that the individual's family or partner is well equipped to deal with hypoglycemia. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8493" href="/z/d/drug information/8493.html" rel="external">Glucagon</a> (nasal, intramuscular, or subcutaneous) should be available for emergency use.

Poor adherence may subsequently be a problem in people who intentionally omit insulin injections to lose weight or avoid weight gain. The use of newer insulin analogs and CGM, as well as careful attention to insulin dosing (avoiding too much basal insulin) may help prevent excessive weight gain [<a href="#rid44">44,76,77</a>]. Attention should also be paid to caloric intake and exercise to avoid or limit the weight gain that commonly accompanies intensive insulin administration. (See <a class="local">'Diabetes education'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Adults randomly assigned to intensive insulin therapy in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) gained significantly more weight than those who received conventional therapy (5.1 versus 2.4 kg) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Higher baseline A1C values and greater decrements in A1C during intensive therapy were both associated with greater weight gain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The potential importance of these findings is illustrated in a subsequent analysis of the DCCT, in which adults were divided into quartiles based upon weight gain, from no weight gain (first quartile) to maximal weight gain (fourth quartile) [<a href="#rid78">78</a>]. The mean body mass index (BMI) in the fourth quartile was 31 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, placing these people in the obesity range. The following results were observed:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intensive insulin therapy resulted in similar glycemic management at follow-up (mean 6.1 years) in all the weight gain quartiles.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>People in the first quartile (no weight gain) had decreases in serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations compared with baseline, reflecting the benefits of improved glycemia on serum lipid concentrations in the absence of weight gain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>People in the fourth quartile had a significant elevation in serum concentrations of these lipids and in blood pressure compared with baseline.

Such patients are predisposed to develop coronary atherosclerosis, although it is unproven whether mitigation of weight gain could help reduce the risk of macrovascular complications in patients receiving intensive insulin therapy. Excessive weight gain might detract from the demonstrated large benefit of insulin therapy on macrovascular complications demonstrated by the DCCT/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Notably, insulin analogs were not used in the DCCT, so it is possible that additional snacks needed to prevent or treat hypoglycemia contributed to the observed weight gain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sick-day rules</strong> – Sick-day management is directed towards preventing hypoglycemia, significant hyperglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">During an illness, BGM should be performed more frequently, eg, every two to three hours including during the night; this may be increased to every one to two hours if necessary. Alternatively, use of a CGM, if available, can be particularly helpful for sick-day management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">People with type 1 diabetes should be instructed to measure capillary or urinary ketones if the blood glucose concentration is above 250 to 300 mg/dL (13.9 to 16.7 mmol/L) for unexplained reasons, especially if the person feels generally unwell at the time. Ketones should be monitored during periods of illness or stress or if there are symptoms compatible with ketoacidosis, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Home testing of blood for beta-hydroxybutyrate is available, but it is used infrequently in adults, at least in the United States. This method permits earlier and a more quantitative detection of ketosis compared with tests for urinary ketones, which measure acetone and acetoacetate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The presence of ketones in the urine does not always mean that the person has impending ketoacidosis. Ketonuria indicates that the person is in a catabolic state and is breaking down fat, and it can occur in anyone who has a negative caloric balance while dieting. However, in type 1 diabetes, the presence of urine ketones along with hyperglycemia is presumptive evidence of a pathologic catabolic state more serious than hyperglycemia alone. Under these circumstances, the person should be advised to retest every two to three hours, take measures to keep well hydrated, and take extra insulin if indicated.

For adults with type 1 diabetes, we aim for an A1C value of ≤7 percent (using an assay aligned to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT] in which the upper limit of normal is 6 percent) in people in whom the benefits outweigh the risks. Higher targets may be appropriate for certain adults such as those who are older and those who have a history of severe hypoglycemia or serious comorbidities.

The dose of the pre-meal insulin bolus is determined by the ambient blood glucose level before the meal, the size and composition of the meal, anticipated activity levels, and glucose trends (if using continuous glucose monitoring [CGM]). (See <a class="local">'Insulin replacement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Glucose monitoring</strong> – A1C should be tested every three to six months to assess chronic glycemia. Measurements of instantaneous glucose levels (monitoring of blood glucose [with fingersticks and a glucose meter] and real-time CGM) are used to manage diabetes from hour to hour and from day to day, to aid in dose selection in insulin-treated patients, and for safety. CGM is especially useful for those who are having frequent or severe hypoglycemia and those who have developed impaired awareness of hypoglycemia. In the absence of CGM, blood glucose monitoring (BGM) using fingersticks, test strips, and a glucose meter should be performed at least four times daily before meals and bed. Additional testing may be indicated two to three hours after meals and occasionally at 3 AM, as well as before and after exercise, before driving, and when hypoglycemia is suspected.
