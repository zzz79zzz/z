Catabolism of the nucleic acids to uric acid leads to hyperuricemia; the marked increase in uric acid excretion can result in the precipitation of uric acid in the renal tubules and renal vasoconstriction, impaired autoregulation, decreased renal flow, oxidation, and inflammation, resulting in acute kidney injury. Hyperphosphatemia with calcium phosphate deposition in the renal tubules can also cause acute kidney injury. High concentrations of both uric acid and phosphate potentiate the risk of acute kidney injury because uric acid precipitates more readily in the presence of calcium phosphate and vice versa. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1154.html" rel="external">"Tumor lysis syndrome: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, definition, etiology and risk factors", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>TLS is defined both by laboratory criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59424" href="/z/d/graphic/59424.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and by clinical features  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72208" href="/z/d/graphic/72208.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1154.html" rel="external">"Tumor lysis syndrome: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, definition, etiology and risk factors", section on 'Risk stratification'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical impact of TLS during treatment was addressed in a retrospective series of 772 consecutive patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. TLS occurred in 130 patients (17 percent), of whom 38 (5 percent) had clinical TLS and 92 (12 percent), laboratory TLS. Clinical (but not laboratory) TLS was associated with a significantly higher risk of death during induction therapy (79 percent [30 of 38 patients] versus 23 percent in those without evidence of clinical TLS).

In addition to an increase in mortality, the development of TLS is also associated with higher rates of treatment-related complications and costs, as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an analysis of data from the Health Care Utilization project on 600,000 patients treated for a hematologic malignancy, patients who developed acute renal failure requiring dialysis had a significantly longer hospital stay (21 versus 7 days) and fivefold higher total cost per discharge than did those who did not develop renal failure [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similar findings were noted in a multicenter European analysis of 788 patients undergoing induction treatment for newly diagnosed or recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), AML, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The costs incurred by patients who had hyperuricemia and TLS were significantly higher than those of patients who had hyperuricemia but without TLS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A separate European analysis demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of preventing hyperuricemia and TLS with prophylactic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10189" href="/z/d/drug information/10189.html" rel="external">rasburicase</a> [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The incremental cost of prevention was divided by the average number of life-years saved to produce the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which represents the estimated cost per life-year saved. For pediatric patients, who have high life expectancies, the ICER per life-year saved ranged from 425 to 3054 Euros, depending on the country. For adults, the ICER ranged from 23,794 to 41,383 Euros with NHL or ALL to close to 100,000 Euros with AML, largely due to the limited life expectancy of these patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a retrospective cohort study of administrative data using the Cerner Health Facts database, which captured patient data from more than 400 United States hospitals, clinical and economic outcomes were compared between 26 rasburicase-treated patients and 104 propensity score matched allopurinol-treated controls receiving treatment for cancer between 2005 and 2009 [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10189" href="/z/d/drug information/10189.html" rel="external">Rasburicase</a> treatment was associated with a significant 5.3 mg/dL greater reduction in uric acid within two days of treatment initiation (p&lt;0.0001), a shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit (by 2.5 days, p&lt;0.0001), a shorter total length of hospital stay (by five days, p = 0.02), and lower total health care costs per patient per hospitalization (by $20,038, p&lt;0.02) as compared with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8439" href="/z/d/drug information/8439.html" rel="external">allopurinol</a> treatment.</p><p></p><p>These data provide support for routine prophylaxis of TLS in patients at intermediate or high risk for this complication.

(See <a class="local">'Treatment of established tumor lysis syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>The main prophylactic strategies are intravenous (IV) hydration and the use of hypouricemic agents, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8439" href="/z/d/drug information/8439.html" rel="external">allopurinol</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10189" href="/z/d/drug information/10189.html" rel="external">rasburicase</a>. The specific type of prophylaxis is generally selected based on the estimated risk of TLS, which depends on the disease, the disease burden, and the specific treatment to be administered. A risk stratification strategy, along with treatment guidelines, is outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57607" href="/z/d/graphic/57607.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21712044"><span class="h2">Intravenous hydration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aggressive IV hydration is the cornerstone of preventing TLS and is recommended prior to therapy in all patients at intermediate or high risk for TLS  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57607" href="/z/d/graphic/57607.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The goal of IV hydration is to improve renal perfusion and glomerular filtration, and induce a high urine output to minimize the likelihood of uric acid or calcium phosphate precipitation in the tubules. However, IV hydration can lead to potentially dangerous fluid overload in patients with underlying acute kidney injury or cardiac dysfunction (particularly if the patient is in an edematous state). In this setting, close monitoring of vital signs and urine output is mandatory, transfusion (if needed) should be given slowly and in low volume, and diuretics can be given to maintain urine output (see below). Monitoring in an intensive care unit (ICU) may be required. Prior to initiation of IV hydration, reversible forms of acute kidney injury (eg, urinary tract obstruction) should be corrected.</p><p>A 2008 International Expert Panel on TLS recommended that both children and adults at risk for TLS initially receive 2 to 3 L/m<sup>2</sup> per day of IV fluid (or 200 mL/kg per day in children weighing ≤10 kg) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Urine output should be monitored closely and maintained within a range of 80 to 100 mL/m<sup>2</sup> per hour (2 mL/kg per hour for both children and adults, 4 to 6 mL/kg per hour if ≤10 kg). Diuretics can be used to maintain the urine output, if necessary, but should not be required in patients with relatively normal renal and cardiac function. Use of diuretics is contraindicated in patients with hypovolemia or obstructive uropathy. The best diuretic for patients with TLS is unknown; loop diuretics such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8482" href="/z/d/drug information/8482.html" rel="external">furosemide</a> appear preferable because they not only induce diuresis, but may also increase potassium secretion.</p><p>The choice of hydration fluid depends on the clinical circumstances. The expert panel suggests the initial use of 5 percent dextrose one-quarter normal (isotonic) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>, probably because acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients receive steroid during remission induction, which can cause sodium retention and hypertension [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In patients with hyponatremia or volume depletion, isotonic saline should be the initial hydration fluid. Due to the risk of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia with calcium phosphate precipitation once tumor breakdown begins, potassium and calcium should be withheld from the hydration fluids, at least initially.</p><p>There are no guidelines that address the optimal duration of hydration, which should depend on the tumor burden, the type of chemotherapy used (some regimens induce TLS several days later), the drug sensitivity of the tumor, the patient's ability to drink, and renal function. IV hydration should be continued at least until tumor burden (as indicated by blast cell count as well as liver and spleen size in patients with leukemia, and serum lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] level or tumor size in those with solid tumors) is largely resolved, there is no evidence of significant tumor lysis (as indicated by serum uric acid and phosphorus level), and patient can drink adequately with good urine output.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21712051"><span class="h2">Urinary alkalinization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The role of urinary alkalinization with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9268" href="/z/d/drug information/9268.html" rel="external">acetazolamide</a> and/or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9928" href="/z/d/drug information/9928.html" rel="external">sodium bicarbonate</a> is unclear and controversial. In the past, alkalinization to a urine pH of 6.5 to 7 or even higher was recommended to increase uric acid solubility, thereby diminishing the likelihood of uric acid precipitation in the tubules.</p><p>However, this approach has fallen out of favor for the following reasons:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There are no data demonstrating the efficacy of this approach. In addition, the only available experimental study suggested that hydration with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> alone is as effective as alkalinization in minimizing uric acid precipitation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alkalinization of the urine has the potential disadvantage of promoting calcium phosphate deposition in the kidney, heart, and other organs in patients who develop marked hyperphosphatemia once tumor breakdown begins.</p><p></p><p>Based on these observations, the expert panel concluded that use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9928" href="/z/d/drug information/9928.html" rel="external">sodium bicarbonate</a> was only indicated in patients with metabolic acidosis [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].

If alkalinization is used, it should be initiated when the serum uric acid level is high and discontinued when hyperphosphatemia develops.

Overall, the pooled response rate to single-dose therapy (at doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.20 mg/kg) was not significantly different from that of daily administration (0.2 mg/kg/day), 88 versus 90 percent, and single-dose administration generated significant cost savings, approximately $4500 versus $36,000 for drug treatment.</p><p>The optimal single <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10189" href="/z/d/drug information/10189.html" rel="external">rasburicase</a> dose for both adults and children was addressed in a meta-analysis of 15 adult studies (14 retrospective and 1 randomized trial) and 4 observational studies in children [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Single doses of 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, and 7.5 mg, and weight-based single doses of 0.05 and 0.15 mg/kg were compared. The primary outcomes were the response rate at 24 hours after initial rasburicase dose (defined as the ratio of subjects who had a uric acid level &lt;8 mg/dL within 24 hours postdose without receiving additional doses or renal replacement therapy) and the incidence of clinical TLS. For adults, the response rates for the 6 and 7.5 mg and 0.15 mg/kg single doses were 90, 98.6, and 93 percent, respectively, and were higher than for other dosing regimens tested. The single doses of 6 mg and 0.15 mg/kg decreased uric acid levels more than did other regimens; the power of rasburicase to quickly decrease uric acid level was not significantly better with 7.5 as compared with 6 mg. Insufficient information was available to compare the incidence of clinical TLS among the groups. For children, the 1.5 mg and 0.15 mg/kg single-dose regimens were sufficient to manage TLS. However, it should be noted that the sample size was small in each of the pediatric clinical trials (4, 7, 28, and 53 patients, respectively).</p><p>Although the impact of baseline uric acid on response was not part of the systematic review, the authors observed that the 3 mg dose also achieved a good response rate (84 percent), although it was lower than in other groups.

On the other hand, the group receiving the 4.5 mg single dose had the lowest response rate (68 percent), but it also had the highest baseline uric acid level (14.84 mg/dL). The authors concluded that a single dose of 6 mg rasburicase is sufficient to normalize and sustain uric acid level in adults, and that the 3 or 4.5 mg single-dose regimen could be considered in a patient with a uric acid level &lt;12 mg/dL as long as close monitoring for TLS is done.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21712086"><span class="h4">Contraindications and restrictions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10189" href="/z/d/drug information/10189.html" rel="external">rasburicase</a> label carries a Boxed Warning about the risks of hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, methemoglobinemia, interference with serum uric acid measurements, and anaphylaxis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10189" href="/z/d/drug information/10189.html" rel="external">Rasburicase</a> should <strong>not</strong> be given to patients with G6PD deficiency because hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of uric acid breakdown, can cause severe hemolysis in this setting [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].
