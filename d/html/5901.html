Severely malnourished children are often identified when brought to medical attention for an acute issue, such as diarrhea or fever, but should also be sought through community-wide screenings of vulnerable children in high-risk settings. In some cases, SAM is precipitated by political disruptions like war or natural disasters like drought, which interfere with the food supply. However, more often, SAM is simply a disease of pervasive poverty and poor hygienic conditions, compounded by socioeconomic disparities [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], seasonal shortages of food, and spikes in illnesses such as malaria or infectious diarrhea.</p><p>This topic review will discuss treatment of children with <strong>complicated SAM</strong> (eg, with concomitant dehydration or severe infections). Affected children are treated as inpatients in hospitals or feeding centers, using protocols promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the past, this approach was used for most children with SAM. However, experience over the last 20 years has demonstrated that children with <strong>uncomplicated SAM</strong>, constituting the vast majority of malnourished children, can and should be treated at home with support from outpatient feeding programs. This community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) approach appears to produce equal or better recovery and case fatality rates, and to widen population coverage, and has been successfully implemented worldwide by governments and relief organizations. As a result, CMAM has become the international standard of care for uncomplicated cases of severe malnutrition [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p>Other UpToDate topic reviews with related content are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5883.html" rel="external">"Malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings: Clinical assessment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117772.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113959.html" rel="external">"Management of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5360.html" rel="external">"Micronutrient deficiencies associated with protein-energy malnutrition in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The treatment of malnourished children from resource-abundant settings is discussed separately. Although the principles of treatment of malnourished children from resource-abundant settings are similar to those from resource-limited settings, the specific details vary based on local customs and resources. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2874.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children younger than two years in resource-abundant settings: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION BY AGE AND SEVERITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed changes in nomenclature, such that severe acute malnutrition (SAM) will be termed "severe wasting and/or nutritional edema" [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) will be termed "moderate wasting."</p><p>Pending widespread adoption of this terminology, we will continue to use the traditional terms SAM and MAM for simplicity and consistency with the historical literature. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H875429829"><span class="h2">Children 6 to 59 months</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SAM can occur in people of all ages but has its highest incidence and is best studied in children between 6 and 59 months of age. Therefore, protocols for diagnosis and triage focus on this age group, as outlined in the following sections.</p><p>The WHO international growth standards should be used to identify and classify the degree of acute malnutrition in developmentally normal children [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. These criteria are based on the degree of wasting and the presence of edema, where wasting is identified by measuring mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) or determining the weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ). Children should be classified based on whichever criterion deviates most from normal; for example, if a child is moderately malnourished by MUAC but severely malnourished by WHZ, the child should be classified as severely malnourished. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5883.html" rel="external">"Malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings: Clinical assessment", section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic criteria for acute malnutrition are  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60869" href="/z/d/graphic/60869.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM):</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>MUAC 11.5 to 12.4 cm (115 to 124 mm), <strong>or</strong></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>WHZ -2 to -3 (ie, weight-for-length between 2 and 3 standard deviations [SD] below the median)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severe acute malnutrition (SAM):</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>MUAC &lt;11.5 cm (&lt;115 mm), <strong>or</strong></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>WHZ &lt;-3 (ie, weight-for-length more than 3 SD below the median), <strong>or</strong></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bilateral pitting edema</p><p></p><p>Note that the presence of bilateral pitting edema is diagnostic of kwashiorkor (edematous malnutrition); due to the profound physiologic perturbations associated with kwashiorkor, children with any degree of symmetric pitting edema should be considered severely malnourished, regardless of WHZ or MUAC. Such edema begins in the most gravitationally dependent areas of the body and is classified as 1<sup>+</sup> if in the feet and lower legs only, 2<sup>+</sup> if it extends to the upper body or arms, or 3<sup>+</sup> if it extends to the face.</p><p>Most children with acute malnutrition also have evidence of stunting (impaired linear growth), which traditionally is considered a marker of chronic malnutrition. This distinction between "acute" and "chronic" malnutrition is useful for clinical management but does not reflect a true physiologic difference and is potentially misleading as the two often coexist. Moderate stunting is defined by height- or length-for-age Z-score between -2 and -3. Management of acute malnutrition is similar regardless of whether there is underlying chronic malnutrition, although obviously, the most stunted children will have the highest risk of failing to respond to therapy, for relapse, and for mortality.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1348440055"><span class="h2">Infants &lt;6 months</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For infants under six months of age, any of the following criteria may be used to define SAM [<a href="#rid8">8-11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) &lt;-3 SD</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ) &lt;-3 SD</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>MUAC &lt;11 cm (for ages 6 weeks to 6 months)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of edema</p><p></p><p>The threshold for admitting these infants to inpatient care is necessarily lower than for older children.

Severe malnutrition in these children necessitates a search for a severe underlying infection. In endemic areas, older children with kwashiorkor often have tuberculosis as their underlying diagnosis, while those with marasmus may be infected with tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), visceral leishmaniasis, or a combination. Congestive heart failure from congenital or acquired disease (such as rheumatic fever) or nephrotic syndrome can also present with edema and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of kwashiorkor.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">TRIAGE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children between 6 and 59 months of age with severe malnutrition (marasmus and/or kwashiorkor) should be referred to a treatment center for a thorough clinical assessment to identify any medical complications. The first step is immediate assessment and attention to respiratory distress, altered mental status, dehydration, and other danger signs [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The treatment setting, nutritional intervention, and other medical management depends on the presence or absence of complications  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113987" href="/z/d/graphic/113987.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Uncomplicated SAM</strong> – The vast majority of children will have uncomplicated SAM, characterized by a good appetite and no significant, clinically evident medical complications; these children usually should be treated as outpatients in a supervised community-based feeding program, with regular follow-up. Their management is discussed in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113959.html" rel="external">"Management of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complicated SAM</strong> – A small minority of children with severe malnutrition will have complicated SAM, characterized by medical complications such as sepsis, diarrhea with severe dehydration, significant skin breakdown with open ulceration, and/or a poor appetite. These children should generally be hospitalized and receive specific therapies for their acute illness(es) while nutritional rehabilitation is initiated; their care is complicated and resource intense, but good outcomes can be expected if they are managed with a sound systematic approach. The appetite is determined by an "appetite test," wherein they demonstrate an ability to successfully eat a moderate amount of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) under direct supervision; from a practical standpoint, this is the most useful criterion in determining whether a child can be treated at home. (See <a class="local">'Ready-to-use therapeutic food appetite test'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Other children who may need to be hospitalized include (but are not limited to) those who have not recovered after a trial of outpatient therapy, those with untreated HIV or tuberculosis infection that need to initiate definitive therapy, and those with challenging social situations (eg, those with challenges in accessing an outpatient therapeutic site reliably or those without caretakers able to provide frequent supervised feedings at home) [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>].</p><p>For infants &lt;6 months, the threshold for admission to inpatient care is necessarily lower than for older children, especially if the inpatient center can offer intensive counseling and assistance in resuming exclusive breastfeeding [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Although specific clinical trial evidence is lacking, the general approach to treatment is to provide closely supervised feedings with commercial infant formula or diluted F-100 formula (see <a class="local">'F-75 and F-100 formula diets'</a> below), with attempts at reinstituting or optimizing exclusive breastfeeding [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. These infants have relatively high rates of morbidity and mortality as there are often a number of severe underlying social and biologic factors that have led to SAM at such a young age [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Outcomes for this population remain suboptimal due to these complexities, warranting particularly increased attention to this high-risk population [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Infants &lt;6 months'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF INPATIENT MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The protocol for management of <strong>complicated</strong> SAM consists of three major overlapping phases: initial stabilization, rehabilitation, and follow-up. The approach is based on the disrupted physiology of the malnourished child  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77579" href="/z/d/graphic/77579.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Most notably, the malnourished child has profoundly damaged gut function with decreased absorptive capacity, aberrant inflammation, and decreased protective barrier function that predisposes to bacterial and toxin translocation [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. Other physiologic changes conserve energy (known as "reductive adaptation") by reducing physical activity and growth, reducing the functional reserves of organs, and reducing inflammatory and immune responses.</p><p>The management approach has evolved over decades of trial and error to become an international standard of care endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>]. Most of these recommendations reflect common practice and expert opinion and are not necessarily informed by randomized trial evidence [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Nevertheless, a systematic and organized approach to the care of these children will maximize the chances for recovery. In inpatient settings, the use of a specially designed checklist that improves adherence to the various elements of care helps to improve recovery rates [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. These checklists should be developed and adapted to each local setting. An example of such a checklist is available <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tandfonline.com%2Fdoi%2Fsuppl%2F10.1080%2F16549716.2018.1503785%2Fsuppl_file%2Fzgha_a_1503785_sm9365.pdf&amp;token=d8xyVWGgfrEsfpLLCUxLzct%2Bqxa7YAxIjVfCa2fHmnCi3yFBYIlBN02bD40BS4FTNQU1k%2BbwaDkc68aBqGBBE4yFzFfw8RzNPLvj9PpdrT1jF7woGUYS6SucZ043WEsU&amp;TOPIC_ID=5901" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial stabilization</strong> – The initial phase is a critical time with an emphasis on the acute recognition and treatment of life-threatening conditions, especially hypoglycemia, hypothermia, dehydration, and infection. Feedings are begun immediately and advanced as the rehabilitation phase begins. Modern therapeutic feeding products generally contain all necessary electrolytes and vitamins to correct most deficiencies and do not require specific supplementation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rehabilitation</strong> – With the advent and widespread availability of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), the inpatient rehabilitation phase has been dramatically shortened for most children. Malnourished children usually can be discharged home within a week of admission, once steady weight gain and/or decreasing edema is observed, to complete rehabilitation with close outpatient follow-up. During the inpatient rehabilitation phase, the child's caretaker is trained to continue care at home and any social problems are addressed. Emotional and sensory stimulation of the child are continued throughout the initial and rehabilitation phases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up</strong> – In the follow-up phase, the physical, mental, and emotional development of the child are monitored after discharge.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">INITIAL STABILIZATION PHASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial stabilization phase is a critical time that emphasizes treatment of life-threatening conditions, including hypoglycemia, hypothermia, dehydration, and infection.</p><p>Treatment priorities include respiratory support, temperature control (warming), empiric antibiotics for infection, and rehydration. Feedings are begun in this period as soon as clinically safe. They are advanced as the child's appetite returns, which typically occurs during the first few days of refeeding.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4161709031"><span class="h2">Hypoglycemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypoglycemia and hypothermia may occur with fasting of as short as four to six hours' duration in a malnourished child or can be precipitated by a serious systemic infection. These conditions may be associated with apnea. These disorders usually respond to early and frequent feedings and temperature control. Blood glucose levels should be checked if any concerning clinical signs are present, including hypothermia, apnea, anorexia, listlessness, or lethargy. Treatment for hypoglycemia should be initiated if the blood glucose is less than 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) [<a href="#rid12">12,25</a>], as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the child is conscious, administer 50 mL of 10% glucose or sucrose solution (eg, one rounded teaspoon of sugar in three tablespoons of water) orally or by nasogastric tube, followed by feeding as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the child is unconscious, administer 10% dextrose or glucose solution, 5 mL/kg intravenously (IV; or by nasogastric tube if IV access is not possible).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If oral, IV, or nasogastric administration is not possible, administer sublingually one teaspoon of sugar moistened with one to two drops of water, taking care to avoid aspiration. Repeat every 20 minutes to avoid relapse.</p><p></p><p>Hypokalemia and other electrolyte deficiencies often occur among severely malnourished children. However, specific serum measurements are rarely available in resource-limited settings. Moreover, specific supplementation generally is not necessary, because Rehydration Solution for Malnutrition (ReSoMal), oral rehydration solution (ORS) with or without potassium supplementation, and the therapeutic feeding products used for treatment of malnutrition will usually correct these deficiencies gradually and safely.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Hypothermia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the body temperature is &lt;35.5°C (96°F), the child should be warmed. This can be accomplished using a warm blanket or with an incandescent lamp directed on, but not touching, the child's body. If these options are not available, the child can be warmed by close contact with the caregiver's body. Hypothermia may be a sign of sepsis or may be caused by fasting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Infection</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4039363873"><span class="h3">Empiric antibiotics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All malnourished children in inpatient care should be treated empirically with a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics because many children with severe malnutrition have systemic infections, including bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia [<a href="#rid5">5,26,27</a>], often without classic clinical signs such as fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea.

If a severely malnourished child has been given a total of 30 mL/kg of IV fluids and reassessment suggests persistent dehydration, blood transfusion should be provided next.

The rapid increase in nutrient intake results in a switch from a catabolic state to an anabolic state. The ensuing surge in insulin secretion can result in hypoglycemia and influx of extracellular electrolytes into the intracellular space, which can lead to dangerously low extracellular concentrations of potassium, phosphate, and magnesium. In low-resource settings, it may be difficult to measure concentrations of electrolytes [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. The electrolyte and mineral abnormalities may manifest clinically as lethargy, seizures, and muscle weakness, generally in the first few days of nutritional rehabilitation. Very rarely, well into the recovery period (eg, several weeks), impaired cardiac function, cardiomyopathy, and ultimately respiratory failure can occur.

No clinical trials have been conducted to specifically test this hypothesis. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of refeeding syndrome and late-onset cardiomyopathy but do not need to preemptively alter the standard feeding recommendations outlined above.

If one of these therapeutic feeding products is not available, a modified rehabilitation feed, which can be formulated from whole milk, can be made  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68248" href="/z/d/graphic/68248.html" rel="external">table 10</a>). If the child successfully feeds on F-100, the RUTF appetite test should be repeated every one to two days, and feeds should be transitioned to RUTF as soon as the child passes the appetite test.</p><p>In settings where RUTF is not available and rehabilitation must be completed using F-100, a transition to traditional home diets can begin while the child is still hospitalized. This is done by gradually reducing and then stopping F-100, while adding or increasing the mixed diet until the child is eating a diet similar to what will be eaten at home.</p><p>The approaches described above are best established for children 6 through 59 months of age. For older children, specific therapeutic feeding regimens have not been clearly defined, but it is reasonable to use the protocols used for younger children, including rapid advancement to the standard RUTF as tolerated. Another formulation of RUTF, known as BP-100, comes in the form of a biscuit/bar that is especially well suited to older children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113959.html" rel="external">"Management of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings", section on 'Ready-to-use therapeutic food'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1001776423"><span class="h3">Infants &lt;6 months</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The general medical care for severely malnourished infants younger than six months is very similar to that of older children. The main exception is that the overall goal is to return the child to a state of full exclusive breastfeeding whenever possible [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. If breast milk production is insufficient, attempts should be made to increase (or restart) milk production using the supplementary suckling technique  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114199" href="/z/d/graphic/114199.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), which has been demonstrated to be effective in stimulating enough milk production to achieve sufficient nutrition [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p>Nutritional therapy begins with as much breastfeeding as possible, supplemented with expressed breast milk, commercial infant formula, or F-75 as needed to ensure the infant gains weight every day.</p><p>Once clinically stable, the feeding can be advanced to either full breast milk feeds (if the child is able to gain weight steadily on breast milk alone), commercial infant formula, or diluted F-100 (prepared by diluting F-100 with an additional 30 percent water). Undiluted F-100 should not be given to young infants, because of its high renal solute load [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Unlike older children who can be fed RUTF at home following discharge from the inpatient facility, infants under six months of age should not be discharged home until they demonstrate sufficient weight gain on breastfeeding alone or with supplementation with commercial infant formula. An adequate supply of commercial formula at home should be ensured, as well as a plan to continue to resupply formula and prepare formula using clean water. The safety of RUTF or other therapeutic foods in children under six months of age has not been studied.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Vitamin and mineral supplementation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>F-75, F-100, and RUTF all contain substantial amounts of supplemental vitamins and minerals needed for nutritional rehabilitation by most children, including sufficient phosphorus, zinc, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12883" href="/z/d/drug information/12883.html" rel="external">vitamin A</a> to treat these common deficiencies. These vitamins and minerals are also contained in the World Health Organization (WHO) vitamin mix and mineral mix  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71032" href="/z/d/graphic/71032.html" rel="external">table 11</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61359" href="/z/d/graphic/61359.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). Providing additional supplementation beyond that contained in these therapeutic feeding products is not generally recommended, with the exception of iron (see below). Some observational evidence is emerging that children who clinically recover from SAM may still be left deficient in certain micronutrients, such as iron, vitamin A, vitamin B1 (thiamine), and vitamin B12 (cobalamin), but there are relatively few clinical data to support additional micronutrient supplementation at this time.</p><p>In particular, sufficient zinc is included in Rehydration Solution for Malnutrition (ReSoMal) and therapeutic foods used for severe malnutrition in amounts that exceed the 10 to 20 mg of zinc per day that is recommended for children with diarrhea [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Additional zinc dosing beyond what is already included in these formulas is thus generally considered unnecessary based on available evidence [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5354.html" rel="external">"Zinc deficiency and supplementation in children", section on 'Treatment of acute or persistent diarrhea'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Iron</strong> – Although most severely malnourished children have some degree of iron-deficiency anemia, additional iron supplementation is <strong>not</strong> needed during the stabilization phase while the child is receiving F-75, during the first few days of F-100, and any time the child is receiving RUTF. Indeed, iron supplements may be dangerous to the child since transferrin levels are usually reduced, leading to toxicity and potentially increasing the risk of infection [<a href="#rid17">17,20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">During the rehabilitation phase, children receiving F-100 <strong>should</strong> be supplemented with iron at a dose of approximately 3 mg/kg/day divided into two daily doses. This should generally be continued for two weeks. Children who switch to RUTF during the rehabilitation phase do not need additional iron supplementation.</p><p></p><p>Additional supplements beyond those contained in therapeutic foods are appropriate under the following circumstances:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12883" href="/z/d/drug information/12883.html" rel="external">Vitamin A</a> – High-dose supplementation of vitamin A (50,000 international units, 100,000 international units, or 200,000 international units, depending on age) is recommended for children with clinical evidence of overt vitamin A deficiency or recent measles or for those who will not receive therapeutic foods that are fortified as recommended in WHO specifications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2571.html" rel="external">"Overview of vitamin A", section on 'Targeted supplementation for disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thiamine</strong> – In certain parts of Southeast Asia, high rates of vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency have been observed among children born to mothers on traditional diets, which are low in thiamine. In this setting, a malnourished infant who appears to have septic shock may actually have beriberi and will clinically improve quite rapidly with thiamine [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Thiamine deficiency may also contribute to refeeding syndrome [<a href="#rid56">56</a>] and failure to recover from SAM generally. In settings with high rates of thiamine deficiency, additional supplementation of thiamine (eg, 50 to 100 mg daily) may thus be considered [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. This may also be a significant problem in sub-Saharan Africa, but data from this location are relatively sparse [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5367.html" rel="external">"Overview of water-soluble vitamins", section on 'Infantile beriberi'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h1">FAILURE TO RESPOND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When systematic treatment guidelines are followed, most severely malnourished children should show definite signs of improvement within a few days, followed by continued progress [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Children who fail to respond to treatment either fail to achieve the initial anticipated rate of improvement (primary failure) or deteriorate after an initial satisfactory response (secondary failure). When a patient fails to respond to treatment, care practices should be reviewed and the child should be reevaluated [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The objective is to identify a specific cause and to correct the problem.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2075157325"><span class="h2">Causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Failure to respond may be due to the treatment environment or individual patient factors:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treatment environment – Hospitals in high-burden settings unfortunately often provide a suboptimal environment for malnourished children. As examples, staff may be insufficient or inadequately trained, scales may be inaccurate, feedings may be incorrectly prepared, the risk of nosocomial infection is high, and the child's caretakers are often burdened with many round-the-clock nursing tasks that they are unprepared to manage for prolonged periods. Moreover, even with optimal hospital care, many children will not make an optimal recovery [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. This is part of the rationale to advance feedings to ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and discharge children as soon as possible to complete their recovery at home.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Insufficient nutrition – Patients may fail to respond because they are fed insufficient food or have a vitamin or mineral deficiency [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. Malabsorption of nutrients or rumination may contribute to lack of improvement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infection – Children who fail to respond to nutritional treatment should be investigated for infection [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Malnutrition leads to increased susceptibility to infection because nutritional deficiency results in immunosuppression and often occurs in the setting of a home environment with poor sanitation. The most frequent infections include diarrhea, dysentery (with hematochezia), pneumonia, urinary tract infection, otitis media, skin infections, and tuberculosis. In endemic settings, tuberculosis, notably, can have its first and only manifestation as severe malnutrition, without the classic localized pulmonary or lymph node disease. Other infections include intestinal helminths, malaria, leishmaniasis, and HIV infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5878.html" rel="external">"Persistent diarrhea in children in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Undiagnosed medical conditions – Children may fail to respond to treatment because they have a serious underlying condition. Malnutrition may result from a variety of conditions including unrecognized congenital abnormalities, inborn errors of metabolism, malignancies, immunologic diseases, and other diseases of the major organs.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h2">Review of rehabilitation failure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Optimal practices should result in a case fatality rate of less than 10 percent [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. To assess and optimize clinical practice at a health care facility, it is important to keep accurate records of all children who fail to respond to treatment and of all deaths. Data should include the child's age, sex, date of admission, weight-for-height (or -length) on admission, principal diagnoses, and treatment. If the child died, the date and time of death and apparent cause should be noted. These records should be reviewed periodically to identify areas for improvement. The timing of treatment failure or death can be helpful. As an example, deaths that occur within the first two days often are caused by hypoglycemia, unrecognized or mismanaged septic shock, or serious infection, whereas deaths that occur later often are caused by heart failure related to improper fluid management.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h1">COGNITIVE AND FAMILY REHABILITATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Severe malnutrition can result in delayed mental and behavioral development [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. This delay likely is caused by significantly reduced brain growth, as reflected in reduced head circumference in malnourished compared with well-nourished children [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. The effect on cognition and behavior is the most serious long-term result of malnutrition.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2009703849"><span class="h2">Environmental stimulation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Play programs that provide emotional and physical stimulation should start during rehabilitation and continue after discharge. These programs may reduce the risk of the child having some permanent intellectual disability and emotional impairment, although the direct evidence for this is relatively lacking [<a href="#rid61">61,62</a>].</p><p>Sensory deprivation should be avoided [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The child should be able to see and hear what is happening around him or her, and the face should not be covered. The child should never be restrained unless there is a risk of self-harm (eg, by pulling out a nasogastric tube or intravenous [IV] cannula). The mother or an alternate caregiver should stay with the child in the hospital and during rehabilitation. She should be encouraged to feed, hold, comfort, and play with her child as much as possible.</p><p>Children undergoing treatment for malnutrition should receive care in a cheerful environment. Toys should be available that are appropriate for the child's age and level of development. Play with other children is an important component of rehabilitation. Mothers or other caregivers should be encouraged to participate and can be trained to supervise play sessions.</p><p>Physical activity should be encouraged to promote the development of essential motor skills and enhance growth. Patients who are unable to move may benefit from passive motion of the limbs. As the child's nutritional status and general condition improve, the duration and intensity of physical activities should increase.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22"><span class="h2">Parent education</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Parents or other primary caregivers should receive education regarding the causes of malnutrition and its prevention. Breastfeeding is a particularly important and practical measure to prevent malnutrition, so all mothers should be educated to exclusively breastfeed infants for the first six months and to continue breastfeeding for at least the first two years of life. Parents should also be given education about an appropriate diet and sanitary feeding techniques, strategies to stimulate the child's mental and emotional development, and other parenting skills. Teaching should begin well before discharge. The mother should spend as much time as possible at the nutrition rehabilitation center with her child and should provide care, including food preparation, for her child under supervision. She should be taught how to treat or obtain treatment for diarrhea and other infections and to understand the importance of regular treatment for intestinal parasites.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h1">DISCHARGE PHASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During rehabilitation, preparations should be made to ensure that the child is fully reintegrated into the family and community after discharge. The family must be prepared to prevent recurrence of severe malnutrition. If possible, the home should be evaluated by a social worker or nurse before discharge to ensure an adequate environment. If the child is abandoned or conditions at the home are unsuitable, a foster home should be sought [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H87026751"><span class="h2">Transfer to outpatient care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Where quality outpatient care for malnutrition is available, children should be transferred from inpatient to outpatient care when medical complications including edema are resolving and the child appears clinically well and has a good appetite for ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The target intake for RUTF is 150 to 200 kcal/kg/day, and the child should be consistently taking at least 75 percent of this target before discharge. In the past, criteria for transfer to outpatient care depended on specific anthropometric variables [<a href="#rid7">7,52,63</a>], but these standards are no longer needed where specialized outpatient care for severe malnutrition is available.</p><p>For infants younger than six months, it is reasonable to transfer to outpatient care when weight gain on exclusive breastfeeding or replacement feeding is satisfactory (eg, weight gain more than 5 g/kg/day for at least three days) and the caregiver is linked with needed community-based outpatient care.

Empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted because of the high rates of underlying infections in severely malnourished children and because clinical symptoms and signs of infection are often absent. In our practice, we treat with a 7- to 10-day course of antibiotics, which are given IV in hospitalized patients, and transition to oral antibiotics when the patient is transferred to outpatient care.
