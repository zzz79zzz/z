While stress testing can be performed in a variety of ways, the most commonly used and widely available stress testing modalities are exercise electrocardiography (ECG; non-imaging) and exercise or pharmacologic stress combined with imaging (stress echocardiography or stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging [MPI]). A main objective of stress testing is to assess the functional or physiological consequences of anatomic coronary artery disease (CAD). The traditional gold standard test for the diagnosis of CAD is invasive coronary angiography via cardiac catheterization. Anatomic CAD may also be assessed noninvasively with cardiac CT. (See <a class="local">'Anatomic assessment of coronary artery disease'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5308.html" rel="external">"Cardiac imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance in the adult"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5297.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery calcium scoring (CAC): Overview and clinical utilization"</a>.)</p><p>The choice of stress testing modality depends on many factors, including but not limited to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ability to perform adequate exercise</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Resting ECG</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical indication for performing the test</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient's body habitus</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of prior coronary revascularization</p><p></p><p>The majority of this topic will review the indications for stress testing and the choice of stress testing modality with emphasis on considerations for the type of stress (exercise versus pharmacologic) and the assessment of response (ECG, echocardiography, or radionuclide imaging). The technique and efficacy of these procedures, as well as cardiopulmonary exercise testing for other indications, are discussed in detail separately. There is also a brief discussion on cardiac CT for anatomic evaluation of CAD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5328.html" rel="external">"Overview of stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1534.html" rel="external">"Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1548.html" rel="external">"Prognostic features of stress testing in patients with known or suspected coronary disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H458218799"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR STRESS TESTING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with symptoms suggesting coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiac stress testing is most often indicated to aid in making the diagnosis of and assessing risk related to CHD. In some patients with known CHD and prior coronary revascularization or a change in clinical status, stress testing is indicated for the diagnosis of new or progressive disease and/or for risk stratification. In addition to symptomatic patients with known or suspected CHD, patients with heart failure, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, or planned non-cardiac surgery may be candidates for stress testing. In contrast, cardiac stress testing as a screening test for CHD in asymptomatic patients is rarely indicated.</p><p>Guidelines for stress testing have been proposed by several professional societies, and our approach is generally consistent with these guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with symptoms suggesting angina – Patients who have symptoms suggestive of angina and who have an intermediate or high pre-test likelihood of CHD are generally appropriate for stress testing. One exception to this is patients with ongoing or unstable symptoms, in which case stress testing should not be performed prior to relief of symptoms. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with acute chest pain – Patients presenting with acute chest pain or suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may also undergo stress testing for the diagnosis of possible CHD. Stress testing in such patients should only be performed following the relief of symptoms and following the evaluation for ACS or infarction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with a recent ACS – In patients with a prior ACS who were treated conservatively without coronary angiography, or in patients with incomplete revascularization at the time of ACS, stress testing may be used for risk assessment within three months post-ACS, assuming that the patient is stable without further symptoms [<a href="#rid1">1,2,6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with known CHD and new or worsening symptoms – Cardiac stress testing may be appropriate for patients with known CHD if there has been a clinical change (ie, new or worsening symptoms) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with prior coronary revascularization – In the absence of new or changing symptoms &lt;5 years after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or &lt;2 years after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stress testing is rarely appropriate. However, for patients ≥5 years after CABG or ≥2 years after PCI, stress testing may be appropriate on a one-time basis for the asymptomatic patient [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with valvular heart disease – Stress echocardiography may be performed to evaluate valvular heart disease, such as severe mitral stenosis without symptoms, moderate mitral stenosis with symptoms, severe mitral or aortic regurgitation (when left ventricular size and function do not meet surgical criteria), and equivocal aortic stenosis in the setting of low-cardiac output or left ventricular systolic dysfunction [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The exercise electrocardiography (ECG) without imaging may also be used to assess exercise capacity and need for valvular intervention in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5310.html" rel="external">"Overview of stress echocardiography", section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with newly diagnosed heart failure or cardiomyopathy – Stress testing is indicated and appropriate to evaluate for ischemic heart disease as the cause for heart failure or a cardiomyopathy of uncertain etiology, assuming that coronary angiography has not already been planned or performed. Even if angiography has already been performed, stress testing may still be indicated to determine whether the myocardium is viable and to plan the revascularization.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction and CHD who are candidates for revascularization – Stress testing with imaging can identify myocardial ischemia and regions of viable myocardium. This information may be helpful in the discussion of planned revascularization and may help predict contractile recovery and outcomes following revascularization. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1474.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of hibernating myocardium"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1473.html" rel="external">"Assessment of myocardial viability by nuclear imaging in coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with select arrhythmias – Exercise stress testing can be helpful in the identification of chronotropic incompetence, determining the appropriate setting in patients with rate-adaptive pacemakers, evaluation of patients with congenital complete heart block considering increased physical activity, evaluation of patients with known or suspected exercise-induced arrhythmia (eg, congenital long QT syndrome and other channelopathies), and evaluation of the efficacy of therapy in patients with exercise-induced arrhythmia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75011" href="/d/graphic/75011.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery – Patients requiring emergency noncardiac surgery should undergo surgery without delay, and postoperative risk stratification and management should be performed. For preoperative evaluation of patients prior to elective noncardiac surgery, patients with active cardiac conditions should undergo evaluation and treatment prior to the planned surgery [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The approach to stress testing and risk assessment prior to noncardiac surgery is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In contrast to its use in the above symptomatic patients, cardiac stress testing for screening of asymptomatic low-risk patients is generally <strong>not</strong> indicated or appropriate. Rare exceptions are patients with multiple risk factors and those in high-risk occupations (eg, airline pilots). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1519.html" rel="external">"Screening for coronary heart disease"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H688183934"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH TO CHOOSING THE OPTIMAL STRESS TEST</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients in whom a stress test is indicated, more than one type of stress test may provide clinically useful information  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef87155" href="/d/graphic/87155.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Our approach to arriving at the optimal stress test for an individual patient is as follows:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H688184828"><span class="h2">Clinical factors to consider</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to choose a particular stress test over other testing options should be made by incorporating clinical data, potential side effects, costs, and test availability. The choice of an imaging modality, when indicated, also depends on a variety of factors, including local availability, local expertise, cost, the patient's body habitus (eg, morbid obesity), limited acoustic windows for echocardiography (only if neither traditional nor contrast-enhanced echocardiographic imaging is adequate), radiation exposure, and the need for concomitant assessment of hemodynamics or valvular disease. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Can the patient exercise to a satisfactory workload?</strong> – The ability to exercise directly impacts the choice of stress modality. In addition to being able to exercise, patients should be able to exercise to an adequate workload as defined by one or more of several possible variables, including exercise duration, peak heart rate, peak double product, and/or symptoms. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There is not consensus on what constitutes a "satisfactory workload" using individual dichotomous variables for peak exercise heart rate, peak double product, exercise duration, or subjective measures such as perceived exertion and symptoms. In addition, what may constitute a satisfactory workload can differ on the basis of using the exercise test as a diagnostic or prognostic tool in the evaluation of CHD. The most well-recognized stress test value for constituting a satisfactory workload or exercise test end point has been 85 percent of the age-predicted maximum heart rate; however, using this target heart rate approach has significant limitations given the wide variability of an individual's true maximal heart rate, including those with intrinsic heart rate impairment, the use of AV nodal blocking agents, and conversely those with an exaggerated heart rate response to exercise. Our approach has been to perform a symptom-limited study paying close attention to exertional symptoms and perceived exertion (ideally at least a 17 on the Borg scale), while integrating the purpose of the study with objective findings, such as exercise duration and peak heart rate.      </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nearly all patients who are anticipated to exercise to a satisfactory workload should undergo an exercise stress test rather than a pharmacologic stress test. However, patients who can exercise may also benefit from an imaging modality depending on the clinical scenario. (See <a class="local">'Patient can exercise and has a normal ECG'</a> below and <a class="local">'Patient can exercise and has abnormal baseline ECG (except LBBB or ventricular pacing)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients who are unable to exercise to a satisfactory workload should undergo a pharmacologic stress test with imaging.

ECG abnormalities that interfere with the ECG diagnosis of ischemia include (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1494.html" rel="external">"Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results", section on 'Limitations to exercise ECG testing'</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ventricular preexcitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ventricular paced rhythm</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Left bundle branch block (LBBB)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Greater than 1 mm ST depression at rest</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">Digoxin</a> use with associated ST-T abnormalities</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Does the patient need an assessment of myocardial viability?</strong> – Patients with documented significant multivessel coronary heart disease and previous myocardial infarction (MI), in whom a revascularization strategy is being developed, may require an assessment of myocardial viability to determine the optimal approach to revascularization.

While stress testing can be performed in a variety of ways, the most commonly used and widely available stress testing modalities are exercise electrocardiography (ECG; non-imaging) and stress imaging with echocardiography or radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with symptoms suggesting CHD, cardiac stress testing is most often indicated to aid in making the diagnosis of CHD and for risk stratification. In some patients with known CHD and prior coronary revascularization or a change in clinical status, cardiac stress testing can be indicated for the diagnosis of new or progressive disease and/or for risk stratification. In addition to symptomatic patients with known or suspected CHD, patients with heart failure, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, or planned non-cardiac surgery may be candidates for stress testing. (See <a class="local">'Indications for stress testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptom-limited exercise is generally the preferred form of stress for patients who can exercise because it provides the most information concerning symptoms, exercise capacity, and the hemodynamic response during exercise. Pharmacologic stress testing is typically performed when a patient is unable to exercise. (See <a class="local">'Exercise'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pharmacologic'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) should be the initial test for the majority of patients who can exercise adequately  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef87155" href="/d/graphic/87155.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), who have an interpretable ECG, and who do not have certain conditions (eg, left bundle branch block, paced ventricular rhythm, ventricular pre-excitation, etc). While stress testing with imaging has several advantages over the standard exercise ECG treadmill test, there is insufficient evidence to recommend stress testing with imaging in all patients. (See <a class="local">'Our approach to choosing the optimal stress test'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Gibbons RJ, Balady GJ, Bricker JT, et al.
