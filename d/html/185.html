         Inflight medical events are increasing due to the steadily rising number of air travelers, the aging of the United States and European populations, and the increasing mobility of people with acute and chronic illnesses [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Traveling physicians and other medical providers may suddenly find themselves in a difficult environment, in front of many onlookers, managing conditions they do not normally treat, with unfamiliar equipment. There are no universal guidelines for managing inflight medical events, but there are aspects of the aircraft environment and resources of which the treating clinician should be aware. This topic will review the following:

          EPIDEMIOLOGY

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Worldwide air passenger numbers have continued to rise, exceeding 4.3 billion in 2018 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Inflight medical events (IFMEs) have been reported to occur at a rate of approximately 15 to 100 per million passengers, with a death rate of 0.1 to 1 per million [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-8
         </a>
         ]. The precise incidence of IFMEs is unknown because there is no mandatory reporting system and no consistent or widely accepted definition of what constitutes an IFME. Flight crews do not routinely report minor inflight medical incidents that do not require ground-based medical support (GBMS) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,9
         </a>
         ]. Given the rising numbers of travelers, it has been estimated that as many as 260 to 1420 IFMEs occur daily worldwide [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The advent of GBMS has substantially changed the way IFMEs are handled. GBMS is now used by most large international carriers and by virtually all United States based airlines. GBMS is usually provided by practicing emergency physicians who receive additional instruction about the aviation environment and operations. A medical event record is created each time a flight contacts GBMS. The threshold for using GBMS and the means of contact differ among airlines and over time. Variables include the communication capabilities of the aircraft (eg, radio only, satellite phone, specific telemedicine device) as well as the airline's culture.
        </p>
        <p>
         One study found that 9 percent of inflight incidents prompted a call for GBMS advice [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ], while a review of five major airlines reported that 11,920 calls for medical assistance were made over approximately three years, during which 744 million passengers traveled [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. These data suggest that most IFMEs are not serious and are handled adequately by airline crews alone, as it is more likely that crewmembers would use GBMS for more serious events and true medical emergencies, unless that were not possible due to logistical obstacles (eg, immediate landing, communication black spots). Medical diversions (ie, premature landings for medical reasons) occur in approximately 4 percent of flights requiring assistance from GBMS [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of studies have attempted to examine airline emergencies in greater detail. Airport-based studies suggest an incidence of 16 to 25 emergencies per million passengers, which translates into approximately one medical emergency every 604 flights [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7,12-14
         </a>
         ]. The fatality rate was approximately 0.1 to 0.3 deaths per million passengers. Other studies have examined all inflight events that occurred with a particular airline, or that generated a call from the airplane to GBMS. A few early studies of this type suggested that severe emergencies were increasing in number [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,7,9,15
         </a>
         ]. The Air France study, mentioned above, which covered the years from 1989 to 1999, noted that 35 percent of all calls recorded over the 10-year period were made in the final two years [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. However, available data are limited and should be interpreted with caution. A medical professional is present for 40 to 70 percent of inflight medical emergencies, and a doctor is present in 30 to 60 percent [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,17-19
         </a>
         ]. These numbers may be higher; fear of liability prevents some clinicians from intervening [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Liability and legal protection for Good Samaritans'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Two additional factors may be contributing to a rise in IFMEs: the proliferation of low-cost airlines and the growth of "medical tourism," which may involve individuals with severe illness travelling to obtain low cost, quality health care [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. However, in general, the flying population mirrors the general population, and the incidence of serious medical events simply reflects the increased number of people participating in commercial air travel. Thus, the number of IFMEs will rise as the number of air travelers continues to increase, even if the relative rate of serious medical events remains unchanged.

         Neurologic, respiratory, and cardiac complaints comprise the most serious emergencies, as determined by aircraft diversion or the use of GBMS [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,6,7,16-18,22,23
         </a>
         ]. Among these, cardiac emergencies account for the highest rate of flight diversions and deaths [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,23,24
         </a>
         ]. Nearly all such cases involve adults.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, although obstetrical and pediatric emergencies during commercial air flights are rare, they do occur. According to one review, approximately 7500 IFMEs involving children aboard commercial airlines were reported to GBMS between 2010 and 2013 [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Ten cases (0.13 percent) resulted in death, and nine involved children under the age of 2 (median age of 3.5 months). Two children were noted to be travelling to receive care for a severe pre-existing medical condition. A subsequent review of 75,587 IFMEs requiring GBMS found that 11,719 (15.5 percent) involved children, of which the great majority resolved in flight; 16.5 percent required further medical care after landing; 14 percent involved infants; and 0.5 percent led to aircraft diversion [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. The most common issues were nausea and vomiting (33.9 percent) and fever (22.2 percent).

          CABIN ENVIRONMENT

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Inflight medical events may be precipitated by the unique physiologic stresses of air travel, including the conditions within the aircraft cabin. These factors most often exacerbate a passenger's chronic disease, or elicit an existing but heretofore unrecognized medical condition. Rarely, they may cause a novel medical problem in cases of an injury or in-flight transmission of a communicable disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The contemporary in-flight cabin environment is extremely well-tolerated by otherwise healthy passengers, and it is unlikely that the cabin environment per se would cause a medical emergency in the absence of a significant pre-existing condition. One possible exception is injuries related to unexpected, severe turbulence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, the cabin environment combined with other stresses from long-distance travel (eg, sleep deprivation, anxiety, disruption of medication schedule, transporting heavy luggage) may cause clinical decompensation in predisposed individuals. For patients with such predisposing conditions, appropriate assessment and education is important. (See

         Commercial aircraft are pressurized during flight because passengers could not survive the low atmospheric pressure at the usual cruising altitude, which is commonly maintained between 30,000 to 40,000 feet (approximately 9100 to 12,200 m). It is impractical to maintain cabin pressure at sea level pressure (by flying at lower altitudes) because of aircraft weight and fuel economy, as more fuel is needed when flying at lower altitudes [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. In addition, there is a maximum pressure gradient the aircraft fuselage can sustain without damage due to the increased wall tension. Thus, the aircraft cabin typically is pressurized to the equivalent of approximately 4000 to 8000 feet (approximately 1400 to 2500 m) above sea level, and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) specifies that an 8000-foot environment be maintained even at the highest operating altitude  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77616" href="/z/d/graphic/77616.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. During shorter flights (&lt;750 miles, or 1200 km), cabins are pressurized to the equivalent of lower altitudes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1448.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of patients for supplemental oxygen during air travel"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Cabin pressure is a function of the aircraft's actual altitude, and is automatically set through the aircraft's environmental control system. Different generations and types of aircraft have different rates of pressurization and ascending profiles. As an example, if permitted by air traffic control, smaller, lighter aircraft reach cruising altitude faster than larger, heavier ones, which need to burn fuel, thereby decreasing their weight, before reaching maximum altitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The barometric pressure inside the aircraft cabin drops from a normal sea level value of 760 mmHg to approximately 560 mmHg during flight. As a result, the PaO2 in normal individuals drops from a baseline of around 70 to 95 mmHg at sea level to a PaO2 of 50 to 60 mmHg inside a cabin pressurized at 8000 feet (2500 m) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. In one study, the oxygen saturations of healthy passengers were measured and showed a decline from 99 percent before takeoff to 94 percent during flight [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. This drop in arterial blood oxygen saturation occurs along the flat portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve and is usually not noticeable to healthy adults at rest during a flight. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1647.html" rel="external">
          "Measures of oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Passengers may respond to this relatively hypoxic environment by increasing their heart rate, cardiac output, respiratory rate, and respiratory volume. Some may experience mild fatigue. However, in individuals with cardiopulmonary disease compensation can be insufficient. For them, a relatively small drop in oxygen saturation can occur on the steep part of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, severely compromising their cardiopulmonary reserves and precipitating a medical emergency, such as cardiac ischemia or respiratory distress [

         Boyle's Law (P x V = P' x V') explains how a set amount of air trapped in a container or hollow viscus will expand to occupy more space at a lower barometric pressure. The diminished air pressure during flight at 8000 feet (2500 m) can lead to the expansion of gas volume up to 30 percent compared with sea level [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,33
         </a>
         ]. A medical emergency can ensue if the expanding gas is constrained within a confined space such as the pleural cavity, the middle ear, sinuses, a medical device, or another body cavity after surgery [

         Most passengers have experienced discomfort due to expanded air in the middle ear that develops when the aircraft climbs rapidly after takeoff to achieve cruising altitude or during descent prior to landing. Usually, such discomfort is self-limited as air spontaneously moves to or from the middle-ear via the Eustachian tube, re-equilibrating internal and external pressures across the tympanic membrane. Travelers can help equilibrate pressures by yawning or by performing a Frenzel or mild Valsalva maneuver. Chewing gum and frequent swallowing, or for infants a bottle or pacifier to suck on, during ascent and descent can limit discomfort [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Failure to equilibrate pressures in the middle ear (barotitis media) or paranasal sinuses (barosinusitis) can cause pain, tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss, and rupture of the tympanic membrane. The change in barometric pressure can also cause a toothache (barodontalgia) in those with dental disease. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Pneumothorax is a less common but more dangerous potential complication of changes in air pressure. Expansion of trapped gas in the lungs can cause a pneumothorax during flight, especially in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or recent thoracic surgery. A small untreated pneumothorax can expand substantially at altitude. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6705.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Increased pressure can develop within hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract and may cause abdominal distention, pain, and nausea. Expanding intestinal gas may cause dehiscence of surgical wounds, hemorrhage, or bowel perforation in air travelers with recent abdominal surgery complicated by ileus or those with small or large bowel obstruction. In addition, passengers with recent central nervous system or ophthalmologic surgery may be susceptible to problems associated with the expansion of trapped gas [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. As an example, following retinal surgery gas is injected into the ocular globe, and sight-threatening complications may ensue from increased intraocular pressure should such gas expand to a sufficient degree [

         Gas expansion can also affect medical devices with pneumatic components, for example, urinary catheters, feeding tubes, pneumatic splints, and the air-filled cuffs of tracheostomy tubes. Instilling

         <a href="#rid36">
          36,37

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,29
         </a>

         A commercial aircraft's air conditioning and ventilation system (using high-efficiency particulate air filters) is able to maintain low bacteria, fungi, and viral counts in the cabin. However, there are reports of individuals possibly contracting a number of infectious diseases through airborne transmission during commercial flights, including tuberculosis, influenza, measles, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,41-43
         </a>
         ]. Risk of infection appears to be greatest on flights longer than eight hours and among passengers seated within two rows of the infected passenger [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>

         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. It is possible that transmission may have occurred before or after the flight when passengers may be close to one other while on line for boarding, using the bathroom, or awaiting security or immigration checks. Rarely, if ever, do such infections create acute management problems during flight, as the incubation period is longer than the duration of the trip. (See

         Aside from cabin air, the general environment of an aircraft during flight can contribute to a number of medical issues. Airplanes are noisy and subject passengers to significant vibration and turbulence. Turbulence in turn can precipitate motion sickness, and falling overhead items can cause significant head trauma and other injuries [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>

         Prolonged immobility in a seated position increases the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) during air travel, although some studies report that obesity, extremes of height, use of oral contraceptives, and coagulopathies are more likely to account for air travel-related VTE [

          44,45

        <p>
         Regardless of the source of medical support, the captain remains the ultimate decision maker for any commercial aircraft under all circumstances. Any medical advice, whether from ground or on-board medical professionals, is exactly that — advice. In making decisions, the captain must consider a host of factors, including weather conditions, turbulence, air traffic, approach charts, runway length, landing weight of the airplane, and proximity to appropriate ground medical facilities. Even under ideal conditions, the captain and crew require at least 20 minutes to land an aircraft.
        </p>
        <p>
         The role of the volunteer medical professional is to assist the flight crew with the medical problem, not to take control. Ideally, the clinician and GBMS personnel work together to manage problems. GBMS staff are knowledgeable about the resources available to manage inflight emergencies and can make informed recommendations about aircraft diversion [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. However, such interactions may of necessity be indirect, as it is not always possible to establish direct communications in aircraft where communication lines are limited to the cockpit, to which access is restricted out of security concerns. In some airlines, ground communication is available in the passenger cabin. Using GBMS frequently alleviates the pressure felt by a volunteer clinician trying to manage a passenger in unfamiliar and sometimes difficult circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many inflight medical problems are relatively minor, and do not require major interventions or changes in the flight plan. In addition, GBMS is available for virtually all major United States airlines and most international airlines.

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         First Aid Kit (FAK) – The number of FAKs required is proportional to the number of seats in the aircraft. The standard ratio is one FAK for every 100 seats. Although the contents of the FAK are primarily for wound care, some countries include non-prescription medications as well.

         Emergency Medical Kit (EMK) –The recommended practice of the ICAO is for aircraft authorized to transport more than 100 passengers for flights over two hours to carry a medical kit for the use of medical doctors or other qualified persons in treating in-flight medical emergencies. The EMK contains medications and is opened under the responsibility of a qualified health care practitioner.

        <p>
         The medications listed by ICAO for inclusion in the EMK are not standard or recommended practice, but guidelines only. Each ICAO member state may regulate the contents of the EMK. In addition, individual airlines are at liberty to enhance the medical resources available on their aircraft. As a result, there is significant variation in the content of medical kits across the airline industry worldwide [

        <p>
         According to the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): "Flight attendants should grant access to the equipment only to trained crewmembers or to other persons qualified and trained in the use of emergency medical equipment. The decision to allow passengers to assist another passenger and have access to medical equipment is up to the air carrier and its agents." The FAA does not define the various medical specialties because this might deny access to the only person available to assist with a medical emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
         The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) states that the captain should control access to the EMK. Drugs should be administered by medical doctors, qualified nurses and physician assistants, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, or other qualified health care practitioners. However, medical students, paramedic students, emergency medical technician students, and nurse aids may administer drugs if no other qualified health care professional is aboard the flight and appropriate advice has been received from GBMS. Even so, according to EASA, oral medications should not be denied in medical emergencies even if no medically qualified persons are present.
        </p>
        <p>
         The FAA requires passenger-carrying aircraft weighing more than 7500 pounds (3400 kg) maximum capacity with at least one flight attendant to carry an enhanced EMK with specified contents. This is in addition to a basic first aid kit, which contains bandages, compresses, antiseptic swabs, arm and leg splints, tape and scissors, and ammonia inhalants [

         The FAA requires a pediatric size oral airway, and a CPR mask and bag-valve mask of pediatric size. However, infant size equipment is not required and is unlikely to be available. Specific pediatric medications, such as 10% dextrose IV solution, are not required, and it is unclear whether the medication information cards included with the EMK include pediatric dosages, or if IV catheters sized for small children and infants are available. No specific equipment or medications for obstetrical emergencies are included in the EMK, including a bulb suction device.

         Most countries do not require that commercial aircraft carry automated external defibrillators (AED), but most large international carriers do, and the FAA requires them on domestic aircraft [

          2

         ]. A large proportion of episodes of sudden cardiac arrest in out-of-hospital public settings are caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF). VF can only be treated effectively with defibrillation, and time is critical [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some models of AEDs can be used for cardiac monitoring in addition to defibrillation. In one report of inflight AED use, the device was used in 40 of 169 cases to treat cardiac arrest with the remainder for cardiac monitoring [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. AED performance during flight conditions should be considered when selecting a model for purchase. Some AEDs designed for ground use were found not to perform well during simulated ground taxi vibration and in-flight turbulence [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53

        </p>
        <p>
         Large prospective observational studies have shown that defibrillation with an AED substantially improves the chances of survival to discharge compared with CPR alone. If a cardiac arrest occurs during flight, at least 20 minutes will pass until defibrillation is possible, unless AEDs are available aboard the aircraft. An observational study that examined the use of AEDs in one airline over two years found that AEDs successfully shocked 13 of 14 patients in VF, of whom 40 percent survived to hospital discharge. Another study documented defibrillation in 9 of 10 patients whose initial rhythm was VF or unstable ventricular tachycardia, of whom five survived [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. Another research group extrapolated arrest and resuscitation rates to worldwide air travel and estimated that of the 452 passengers who would sustain VF arrests inflight, 93 would live (21 percent) if an AED were available and used appropriately [

         Supplemental oxygen is available for inflight medical emergencies but often is limited to flow rates between 2 and 4 L per minute. Most air carriers will provide oxygen for a fee to passengers with stable medical conditions who require low-flow oxygen. Guidance about traveling with oxygen is provided separately. (See

         . Passengers traveling with a POC should be advised that the demand for oxygen is higher inflight due to the lower oxygen pressure within the cabin. Therefore, a higher flow rate is needed for the POC. Not every flight makes electric outlets available so it is prudent for the patient to bring an appropriate number of spare batteries based on travel plans, including reserves in the case of unforeseen delays.

         All crew members are required to be trained in the operation of the emergency medical equipment available on board.

         The GBMS available to commercial aircraft generally takes one of three possible forms. Most airlines contract with a third party that provides physician access [

          5,16

         ]. However, this model has become less common, and has virtually disappeared in the United States. In all situations, the physicians available have training and experience in emergency medicine, aviation physiology, understand the resources available and the constraints involved in managing medical conditions during flight, and can advise the flight crew or a physician passenger.

         Cardiac complaints comprise about 10 to 30 percent of inflight medical events (IFMEs), and in most studies, they are the most common cause of aircraft diversion (about 20 to 46 percent) and passenger death (more than 60 percent) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7,13,17,18,55,56
         </a>
         ]. One observational study found that of 40 passengers subsequently admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) following an inflight medical emergency, 27 were for cardiac causes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,5,18,55,56
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         Diagnostic tools available aboard aircraft include a stethoscope and a sphygmomanometer. However, regardless of the quality of the device, stethoscopes are generally of limited use for auscultating the heart during flight due to the background noise of the engines. A health care practitioner can attempt to measure the blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer but may be forced to approximate the blood pressure using palpation, although the accuracy of this method is limited.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some international aircraft have electronic blood pressure cuffs, pulse oximeters, and glucometers in their emergency medical kits (EMKs), and some carry advanced automated external defibrillators (AEDs) with a screen that can be used to determine the cardiac rhythm. However, this is an "off label" use of the AED. In addition, the decision to use disposable electrodes for this purpose should be weighed carefully as these electrodes may be needed in the case of a true cardiac arrest. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1042.html" rel="external">
          "Automated external defibrillators"

        </p>
        <p>
         A few airlines carry more sophisticated monitoring devices capable of transmitting medical data from the aircraft to ground-based support physicians. Such devices usually include an electronic sphygmomanometer, pulse oximeter, digital thermometer, capnometer, glucometer, and 12-lead electrocardiogram. The ability to obtain ECGs makes the management of chest pain consistent with other pre-hospital environments.

         Inflight sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is particularly challenging. In contrast to cases of SCA that occur in airports, where ventricular fibrillation is the presenting arrhythmia for the majority of cases (87 percent in one small sample [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]), approximately 25 percent of inflight cases present with a shockable arrhythmia [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. The most likely explanation is slower recognition because the passenger's collapse is unwitnessed during flight (occurs while the passenger is seated or in the lavatory), delaying recognition and intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
         The best approach to managing a SCA inflight is to follow the protocols of basic life support (BLS). Most aircraft lack the equipment, medications, and medical support to provide complete advanced life support, although such measures should be performed as indicated when possible. Immediate defibrillation as indicated and excellent chest compressions with minimal interruption should take precedence in the large majority of cases involving adult victims. An AED is available on most international carriers and on all domestic and international flights for United States-based airlines. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In cases where no shock is advised or where the patient is refractory to attempts at defibrillation, it is reasonable to consider early parenteral

        </p>
        <p>
         If return of spontaneous circulation is achieved, the AED should be kept attached and turned on to minimize delays in delivering subsequent shocks as needed. In one case, a passenger survived to hospital discharge after receiving more than 20 shocks [

         Syncope is most frequently related to a vasovagal episode, which can be precipitated by a myriad of flight-related factors alone or in combination, including prolonged sitting, anxiety or fear of flying, and alcohol consumption. A careful history and focused physical examination. On occasion, an AED monitor may be useful for determining the patient's cardiac rhythm, particularly if a central pulse cannot be palpated reliably. (See

         Treatment is generally supportive: laying the person in the recovery position; providing low-flow oxygen to improve unrecognized hypoxia; providing food and drink to treat hypoglycemia [

         Specific treatment of an inflight seizure is possible on airlines that equip their EMKs with an injectable benzodiazepine, such as those operating under EASA rules. However, neither benzodiazepines nor any other sedative or antiepileptic is currently required by the FAA [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A few United States-based airlines carry
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9345" href="/z/d/drug information/9345.html" rel="external">
          diazepam
         </a>
         in their EMKs. Medications carried by other passengers, or potentially in the patient's own carry-on luggage, may be used in cases of status epilepticus when alternative treatments are not available. Some travelers may be carrying diazepam or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9573" href="/z/d/drug information/9573.html" rel="external">
          lorazepam
         </a>
         , which can be crushed and given as a suppository. A known epileptic passenger having a seizure and recovering uneventfully is generally best handled by providing an additional dose of the medication the passenger currently takes. Dextrose is available to treat a seizure or altered mental status precipitated by hypoglycemia. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Status epilepticus is an indication for immediate hospital admission, and therefore typically a reason for medical diversion of the flight. Supportive care, such as keeping the airway open, head and neck protection, and aspiration precautions, should be provided. Oxygen may be provided.

         Strokes, while less common, are an important concern. The initial assessment of stroke is reviewed separately. Of note, on rare occasions, the inflight environment has been associated with facial nerve (Bell's) palsy that may be mistaken for stroke [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66

         When verbal deescalation techniques fail, a physician may be asked to help sedate a violent or disruptive passenger with parenteral medicines, if available in the EMK [

         Infectious diseases create difficult challenges for commercial airlines. Care must be provided for symptomatic persons while the risks posed to flight crew and other passengers must be managed. New and reemerging infectious diseases can be spread internationally via air transport. It is not unusual for travelers to try to return to their home country, and to disguise their condition, if an infectious disease is discovered while they are abroad. (See

         During flight, contact with passengers who may pose a risk of transmitting a serious infection should be restricted to the greatest extent possible as soon as the risk is identified. This may involve moving surrounding passengers to other seats and using standard precautions, such as gloves and masks. Commercial airlines carry a Universal Precaution Kit (UPK) that contains the equipment used for basic "universal" precautions, including gowns, goggles, masks, and sanitizers. The captain of the aircraft should always be informed about the presence of a reportable condition as he is required to convey that information to the receiving country. (See

         Fear of liability has been cited as a reason preventing trained medical personnel traveling as passengers from assisting during medical emergencies [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,73
         </a>
         ]. The exact impact of this fear is unclear. Fifty-two resident and attending physicians in New York City were asked specifically if they would volunteer on an airplane if help were requested by the crew. Not one physician surveyed admitted they would refuse to render care, nor did any cite fear of legal liability as a deterrent [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, a 2002 review of air medical emergencies states that no litigation has been brought against a physician providing aid during an inflight emergency [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, there are rare instances when litigation was brought against a physician acting as a good samaritan when assisting a passenger with a medical problem inflight [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. Knowledge of Good Samaritan legislation can reassure the physician volunteer and ultimately help in the rare instances when it happens.

         Determining which country's laws apply on international flights can be a challenge. The laws of the country from which the aircraft departed, toward which it is traveling, or in which its airline is based may all apply. British and Canadian laws are similar to those of the United States discussed above. A major difference is found in countries that regulate air travel under civil law (eg, France and Germany, among many countries in the European Union). They impose an obligation on physicians to render aid; if aid is not provided, the physician can be punished by a fine or imprisonment [

         – The number of inflight medical emergencies and non-emergency events is increasing in proportion with the general increase in air travel worldwide, although the precise incidence is unknown. Cardiac, neurologic, and respiratory complaints comprise the more serious emergencies, as defined by aircraft diversion or use of ground-based medical support (GBMS) assistance. Of these, cardiac emergencies are most common. Most medical events during flight are not emergencies. (See

         – The aircraft cabin is pressurized typically to the equivalent of 4000 to 8000 feet (1400 to 2500 m) above sea level. In individuals with cardiopulmonary disease, the ability to compensate for this relatively hypoxic environment may be insufficient. For them, a relatively small drop in oxygen saturation may occur on the steep part of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, severely compromising their cardiopulmonary reserves, and precipitating a medical emergency such as cardiac ischemia. (See

         <strong>
          Cabin reduced air pressure
         </strong>
         – Diminished cabin air pressure during flight can lead to the expansion of gas volume up to 30 percent compared with sea level. A medical emergency can ensue if the expanding gas is constrained within a confined space such as the pleural cavity (pneumothorax), the middle ear (tympanic membrane rupture), or another body cavity after surgery. Gas expansion can also create problems with inflated medical devices, such as tracheostomy cuffs, gastric feeding tubes, bladder catheters, and insulin pumps. (See

          'Reduced ambient pressure and potential complications'

         <strong>
          Other cabin factors
         </strong>
         – The low humidity of cabin air can exacerbate pulmonary problems such as asthma and may predispose some passengers to dehydration. Turbulence can cause head trauma and other injuries. (See

          Airline medical protocols

          Resources on board an aircraft
         </strong>
         – Major commercial aircraft carry three types of kits: a First Aid Kit (FAK), a Universal Precaution Kit (UPK), and the Emergency Medical Kit (EMK). The EMK contains specified equipment (eg, sphygmomanometer, stethoscope) and medications (eg,

         ). Most international airlines carry automated external defibrillators (AED), and oxygen is available. GBMS from physicians with expertise in managing inflight medical emergencies is readily available on most flights. The sick passenger or other passengers aboard may have useful medications and medical equipment, although medications from the EMK are preferred. (See

          Trauma and behavioral problems
         </strong>
         – Minor trauma and behavioral problems occurs with some frequency aboard commercial air flights. Management options include applying basic first aid, immobilizing the cervical spine when necessary, controlling bleeding with direct pressure or a makeshift tourniquet, and immobilizing fractures with splints, slings, or bandages. When verbal de-escalation techniques fail, a physician may be asked to help sedate a violent or disruptive passenger with parenteral medicines, if available in the EMK, but a medical condition such as hypoglycemia or hypoxia must be ruled out first.

          Mitigating spread of infectious disease
         </strong>
         – During flight, contact with passengers who may pose a risk of transmitting a serious infection should be restricted to the greatest extent possible as soon as the risk is identified. Passengers with fever (temperature 38°C/100°F or greater) associated with other concerning clinical findings represent reportable cases in most countries. (See

         </strong>
         – Clinicians who come to the assistance of passengers aboard aircraft are protected from liability in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain by Good Samaritan legislation. According to the laws of France, Germany, and other European nations, physicians are obligated to provide aid when it is requested by the crew. Guidelines to help avoid legal pitfalls are included above. (See
