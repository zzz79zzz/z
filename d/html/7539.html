Scleroderma is the hallmark feature of systemic sclerosis (SSc).</p><p>SSc is a chronic multisystem disease characterized by widespread vascular dysfunction and progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The diagnosis of SSc and related disorders is based primarily upon the presence of characteristic clinical findings and supported by specific serologic abnormalities.</p><p>SSc is a heterogeneous disease, which is reflected by a broad range of organ involvement, disease progression and severity, and outcomes.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of SSc in adults.

The different disease subtypes are also associated with different patterns of organ involvement and disease evolution.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis</strong> – Patients typically present with puffy fingers distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP) and ultimately develop skin sclerosis distal to the elbows and knees, and, to a lesser extent, the face and neck, while the trunk and proximal extremities are spared. These patients generally have prominent vascular manifestations, including severe Raynaud phenomenon (RP) and mucocutaneous telangiectasia, sometimes followed by a later onset of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Many patients with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) have manifestations of the CREST syndrome (<strong>c</strong>alcinosis cutis, <strong>R</strong>aynaud phenomenon, <strong>e</strong>sophageal dysmotility, <strong>s</strong>clerodactyly, and <strong>t</strong>elangiectasia).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis</strong> – Patients typically present with puffy hands and develop skin thickening that extends proximally to the upper arms, thighs, and/or trunk. Analysis of a large patient cohort indicates that many patients with SSc cannot readily be classified into lcSSc or diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), and multiple distinct additional disease subsets with shared features may exist [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with dcSSc are more likely to have a rapid progression of skin thickening with early development of lung fibrosis and an increased risk of renal crisis and cardiac involvement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma</strong> – A small subset of patients have no detectable skin involvement but have clinical features such as RP, digital ulcers, and PAH, along with autoantibodies specific for SSc.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Systemic sclerosis with overlap syndrome</strong> – Patients with SSc (of any of the above subsets) may have overlap or features of another systemic rheumatic disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, or Sjögren's disease.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H336426356"><span class="h2">Epidemiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The reported incidence and prevalence rates of SSc vary widely across studies. This may be due in part to the differences in disease classification as well as possibly true temporal and geographic differences. The overall incidence rates range globally from 8 to 56 new cases per million persons per year, and the prevalence rates fall between 38 and 341 cases per million persons [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients with SSc are female, with the female to male ratio ranging from 3:1 to 8:1. There are sex-based differences in disease presentation, with women trending towards more limited disease, younger age of onset, and increased frequency of peripheral vascular disease and risk for PAH. Men have an increased risk of diffuse cutaneous disease, more frequent interstitial lung disease (ILD), cardiac involvement, and renal crisis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Moreover, the interval from first onset of RP to diagnosis of SSc tends to be longer in women than men [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>African American patients tend to have earlier-onset disease and more severe disease phenotypes with increased risk of pulmonary fibrosis and scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3899918791"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to the major organ involvement discussed in detail below, patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) often experience pain and fatigue [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The level of fatigue that has been described is comparable to that in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or cancer patients in active treatment [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The presence of fatigue has been associated with poorer physical function and greater pain [<a href="#rid7">7,9</a>]. Causes of pain include skin-related discomfort, joint pain, Raynaud phenomenon (RP), and ischemic digital ulcers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3945701406"><span class="h2">Major organ involvement</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3585704745"><span class="h3">Cutaneous manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Skin involvement is a nearly universal feature of SSc. It is characterized by variable extent and severity of skin thickening and hardening. The fingers, hands, and face are generally the earliest involved areas of the body. Edematous swelling and erythema may precede skin induration  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96749" href="/d/graphic/96749.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Progressive skin fibrosis has been associated with worsening lung function in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Other prominent skin manifestations include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pruritus in the early stages</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Edema in the early stages</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Skin hyperpigmentation or depigmentation ("salt and pepper")</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of appendicular hair</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dry skin</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Capillary changes at the nail beds</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lipoatrophy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ulcerations over the distal interphalangeal joints (DIP) and proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP) related to repetitive microtrauma over tightened skin</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Digital tip ulcers and/or pitting at the fingertips</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Telangiectasia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Degos-like lesions [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Calcinosis cutis  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97989" href="/d/graphic/97989.html" rel="external">image 1</a>)</p><p></p><p>The skin distribution forms the basis for the widely used binary classification system of SSc into limited and diffuse forms of the disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80559" href="/d/graphic/80559.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>A small subset of patients with SSc have no skin induration (termed SSc <em>sine</em> scleroderma) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Although there is no clinically evident skin sclerosis, these patients have characteristic vascular and/or fibrotic features of SSc, including RP, nailfold capillary alterations, gastrointestinal involvement, renal crisis, pulmonary hypertension, and/or interstitial lung disease (ILD).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1364864056"><span class="h3">Digital vasculopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>RP is virtually always present in patients with SSc and can predate other disease symptoms by years, particularly in limited SSc. RP is classically viewed as reversible vasospasm due to functional changes in the digital arteries of the hands and feet. However, over time, many patients with SSc develop progressive structural changes in the small blood vessels, with permanently impaired flow. In such patients, episodes of RP may be prolonged, lasting 30 minutes or even longer, and can result in ischemic pain, digital ulceration, trophic changes, and in extreme cases, refractory or progressive ischemia and infarction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7543.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Raynaud phenomenon"</a>.)</p><p>Ischemic digital ulcers ultimately develop in up to 50 percent of patients. In general, digital ulcers are associated with a worse disease course. The early occurrence of digital ulcerations is more commonly seen in patients with diffuse disease and in patients who are positive for anti-topoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. A history of ischemic digital ulcers at presentation has also been associated with cardiovascular worsening and decreased survival [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Digital ischemia can result in infection, gangrene, and amputation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10040153"><span class="h3">Musculoskeletal manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The musculoskeletal manifestations of SSc are diverse and include arthralgia, arthritis, tendinitis, tendon friction rubs, and small and large joint contractures. For patients with dcSSc, swelling and stiffness of the fingers, arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue are among the earliest disease manifestations.</p><p>Joint pain, immobility, and contractures of both small and large joints develop as the result of fibrosis around tendons and other periarticular structures. Contractures of the fingers are common, but large joint contractures involving the wrists, elbows, and ankles may also occur. The process is sometimes associated with palpable and/or audible deep tendon friction rubs, characteristically in patients with dcSSc. The most common sites of involvement are the extensor and flexor tendons of the fingers and wrist, tendons over the elbow (triceps), knee (patellar), and ankle (anterior and posterior tibial, peroneal and Achilles).</p><p>Frank inflammatory arthritis is uncommon in SSc. When present, it is usually accompanied by joint contractures and tendon friction rubs and is more likely to occur in patients with dcSSc [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Analysis of synovial fluid generally reveals a mildly inflammatory fluid, and synovial biopsy may show inflammation in the absence of pannus formation. The pattern of arthritis is most commonly polyarticular, but oligoarticular and monoarticular patterns can also be observed. In some patients, an erosive polyarticular arthritis of the small joints, particularly the metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists, can be seen. The distal interphalangeal joints are generally not affected. The pattern of articular involvement in the hands is similar to that in rheumatoid arthritis, and some patients have an overlap of SSc and rheumatoid arthritis, with positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies. In such cases, it can be difficult to distinguish an overlap syndrome from an SSc-related primary arthropathy.</p><p>Several studies suggest that the presence of tendon friction rubs in patients with SSc is a marker for aggressive disease and increased risk of internal organ involvement including renal crisis [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. Destructive small joint involvement in a patient with SSc may suggest an overlap syndrome with rheumatoid arthritis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1831.html" rel="external">"Undifferentiated systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) diseases and overlap syndromes"</a>.)</p><p>Radiographs of the hands may reveal calcifications in the skin (calcinosis cutis)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97989" href="/d/graphic/97989.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) and other soft tissues, as well as resorption of the distal phalangeal tufts (acro-osteolysis). Articular erosions, joint space narrowing, and demineralization are less common radiographic findings [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H772587442"><span class="h3">Gastrointestinal involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nearly 90 percent of patients with either subtype of SSc (dcSSc or limited cutaneous SSc [lcSSc]) have evidence of gastrointestinal involvement [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Nearly half of these patients may have no symptoms. Although the esophagus is the most frequently affected part of the gastrointestinal tract, any part of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved.</p><p>Common symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement include dysphagia and choking, heartburn, hoarseness, cough after swallowing, early satiety, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea, episodic pseudo-obstruction and bacterial small bowel overgrowth with malabsorption, and fecal incontinence. Chronic gastroesophageal reflux and recurrent episodes of microaspiration may contribute to the development or progression of ILD [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Vascular ectasia (angiodysplasia) in the antrum of the stomach ("watermelon stomach") is frequent and may be a cause of chronic unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. The gastrointestinal manifestations of SSc are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7548.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1964927008"><span class="h3">Pulmonary involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some degree of pulmonary involvement is present in more than 80 percent of patients with SSc. The two principal clinical manifestations are ILD (also called fibrosing alveolitis or pulmonary fibrosis) and pulmonary vascular disease, leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62662" href="/d/graphic/62662.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). These issues are discussed in detail separately but will be briefly reviewed here. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4377.html" rel="external">"Overview of pulmonary complications of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4368.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8251.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma): Definition, risk factors, and screening"</a>.)</p><p>The most common symptoms of pulmonary involvement in SSc are breathlessness on exertion (which may progress to dyspnea at rest) and a nonproductive cough. However, patients may have evidence of radiologic alveolitis and early pulmonary fibrosis in the absence of respiratory symptoms or physical findings of functional abnormalities on pulmonary function testing (PFT). Chest pain is infrequent and hemoptysis is rare. In advanced disease, auscultation over the lungs reveals "velcro" rales most prominent at the lung bases.</p><p>Pulmonary vascular disease, primarily PAH, occurs in 10 to 40 percent of patients with SSc. It is common in patients with longstanding limited cutaneous disease without associated ILD. It can also happen secondary to ILD, particularly in those with diffuse SSc. Dyspnea with exertion and diminished exercise tolerance are the most common initial symptoms, but are commonly absent until the disease is fairly advanced.</p><p>PAH is typically progressive and, if severe, can lead to cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure. Thrombosis of the pulmonary vessels is a common late-stage complication and is a frequent cause of death. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8262.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxemia (group 3 pulmonary hypertension): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic evaluation in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2368480640"><span class="h3">Cardiac involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cardiac involvement is frequent in SSc but can be entirely asymptomatic. All anatomic domains of the heart can be affected in patients with SSc, including the myocardium, pericardium, and conduction system. Cardiac complications of SSc can be primary, but can also occur secondary to PAH, ILD, or scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). A detailed discussion of the cardiac manifestations of SSc can be found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120198.html" rel="external">"Cardiac manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2025522684"><span class="h3">Kidney involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Autopsy studies suggest that 60 to 80 percent of patients with dcSSc show pathologic evidence of kidney damage. In patients who have not developed SRC, kidney biopsy may show vascular fibrosis and interstitial collagen accumulation.

Validation of the predictive value of these preliminary criteria for progression to full-blown SSc and guidelines for appropriate monitoring and management of these patients are still needed.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is related to the predominant clinical features of the particular patient. In some cases, the differential includes conditions with scleroderma-like skin changes, whereas in others, the differential of Raynaud phenomenon (RP), interstitial lung disease (ILD), or pulmonary hypertension may need to be considered.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Causes of scleroderma-like skin changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Indurated skin (scleroderma) may be a manifestation of conditions other than SSc. These include exposures to certain drugs, toxins, or environmental factors. Some endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism), renal disease, and amyloidosis and other infiltrative disorders can also cause scleroderma-like skin changes.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Scleredema</strong> – Scleredema can be idiopathic or associated with diabetes or infection. It is characterized by prominent symmetrical skin thickening predominantly on the trunk, particularly the nape, shoulders, and upper back. The face may also be affected, while the fingers are spared. In severe cases, mobility of the shoulders and chest is markedly impaired. Patients with longstanding insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus may develop a type of scleredema called scleredema of Buschke (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7606.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous manifestations of internal malignancy", section on 'Scleredema'</a>). RP, nailfold microvascular changes, and autoantibodies are not present in these patients, and ILD and other forms of internal organ involvement are rare.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Scleromyxedema</strong> – Scleromyxedema, also called papular mucinosis, is characterized by waxy, yellow-red papules on the head, neck, arms, and upper trunk, commonly occurring over thickened and indurated skin. Middle-aged adults are most commonly affected. The presence of a monoclonal protein, often immunoglobulin G (IgG) lambda, detected in the serum or urine by immunofixation supports the diagnosis of scleromyxedema. Skin biopsy is frequently diagnostic. Scleromyxedema may be associated with, and even be the presenting features of, immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis and multiple myeloma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7606.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous manifestations of internal malignancy", section on 'Scleromyxedema'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Endocrine disorders</strong> – Diabetes mellitus and myxedema due to hypothyroidism can be accompanied by skin induration. Endocrine disorders may also occur in some patients with monoclonal gammopathies, for example, in the POEMS syndrome (<strong>p</strong>olyneuropathy, <strong>o</strong>rganomegaly, <strong>e</strong>ndocrinopathy, <strong>m</strong>onoclonal gammopathy, and <strong>s</strong>kin changes). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6662.html" rel="external">"POEMS syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Sclerodactyly due to diabetes mellitus ("diabetic cheiroarthropathy") occurs in individuals with longstanding type I diabetes. It is characterized by thickening and waxiness of the skin, mostly marked on the dorsa of the fingers. Diabetic cheiroarthropathy is often associated with limited mobility and flexion contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joints. RP, ischemic ulceration, calcinosis cutis, and tapering of the digits are absent, and autoantibodies are not detected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5126.html" rel="external">"Overview of the musculoskeletal complications of diabetes mellitus", section on 'Diabetic sclerodactyly'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Myxedema is seen in hypothyroidism and is characterized by thickening and coarseness of the skin (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7846.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism", section on 'Skin'</a>). The increased incidence of hypothyroidism in SSc complicates the differential diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis</strong> – Among patients with advanced renal failure (dialysis-dependent or estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL/min), the administration of gadolinium-containing contrast media for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (previously called nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy). Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin overlying the extremities and trunk. On histologic examination, there is marked expansion and fibrosis of the dermis with accumulation of CD34-positive fibroblasts. The clinical appearance of the affected limbs resembles eosinophilic fasciitis, but is distinguished by involvement of hands and feet, which are typically spared in eosinophilic fasciitis. Internal organ fibrosis may also occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1955.html" rel="external">"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Amyloidosis</strong> – Amyloid infiltration of the skin may produce thickening and stiffness. This is characteristic of AL amyloid, due to a plasma cell disorder. Skin biopsy reveals accumulation of amyloid with characteristic staining properties, and polarizing microscopic examination of Congo red-stained skin or subcutaneous fat reveals apple-green birefringence. Immunofixation of serum or urine reveals a monoclonal component. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5589.html" rel="external">"Overview of amyloidosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Eosinophilic fasciitis</strong> – Eosinophilic fasciitis (diffuse fasciitis with eosinophilia) leads to adherence of skin to underlying thickened fascia. Skin changes are prominent proximal to the wrists and ankles and usually spare the hands and feet. The disorder is associated with transient peripheral blood eosinophilia and a variable degree of inflammatory cell infiltration in the fascia. Skin changes suggestive of eosinophilic fasciitis are an orange peel (peau d'orange) appearance and the groove sign (visible collapse of the superficial veins when the limb is elevated). In order to observe the characteristic changes in the fascia, a surgical excisional biopsy of skin, including subcutaneous tissue and fascia, is necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7547.html" rel="external">"Eosinophilic fasciitis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic graft-versus-host disease</strong> – Both localized and generalized scleroderma-like skin changes can occur in chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This disorder typically follows allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation but may also occur following transfusions in immunosuppressed hosts. Autoantibodies, particularly antinucleolar and antimitochondrial antibodies, may be present. RP is generally absent. Characteristic findings on skin biopsy may help in differentiating chronic GVHD from scleroderma.

Most patients with SSc can generally be classified based on the extent of skin involvement and the accompanying pattern of internal organ involvement, as well as the presence of overlapping features with other systemic rheumatic diseases. The major subsets of SSc include limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc), diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), SSc sine scleroderma, and SSc overlap syndrome. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Major disease subsets'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> – Major clinical manifestations of SSc include the following (see <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cutaneous manifestations</strong> – Skin involvement is a nearly universal feature of SSc and is characterized by variable extent and severity of skin thickening and hardening. The fingers, hands, and face are generally the earliest areas of the body involved. (See <a class="local">'Cutaneous manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Digital vasculopathy</strong> – Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is essentially universally present in patients with SSc. RP is classically viewed as reversible vasospasm due to functional changes in the digital arteries of the hands and feet. However, over time, many patients with SSc develop progressive structural changes in the small blood vessels, with permanently impaired flow resulting in digital ulcers and tissue loss. (See <a class="local">'Digital vasculopathy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Musculoskeletal manifestations</strong> – The musculoskeletal manifestations of SSc are diverse and include arthritis, tendinitis, and joint contractures. (See <a class="local">'Musculoskeletal manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> <strong>involvement</strong> – Nearly 90 percent of patients with SSc have evidence of gastrointestinal involvement. Nearly half of these patients may have no symptoms. Although the esophagus is the most frequently affected part of the gastrointestinal tract, any part of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved. Common symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement include dysphagia and choking, heartburn, hoarseness, cough after swallowing, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea, pseudo-obstruction and bacterial small bowel overgrowth with malabsorption, and fecal incontinence. (See <a class="local">'Gastrointestinal involvement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pulmonary involvement</strong> – Evidence for pulmonary involvement is observed in more than 70 percent of patients with SSc. The two principal clinical manifestations are interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary vascular disease, leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). (See <a class="local">'Pulmonary involvement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cardiac involvement</strong> – All anatomic domains of the heart can be affected in patients with SSc, including the myocardium, pericardium, and conduction system. Primary cardiac involvement is frequent and can be asymptomatic. Cardiac manifestations can also occur secondary to PAH, ILD, or scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). (See <a class="local">'Cardiac involvement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Kidney involvement</strong> – Clinical kidney disease is observed in up to half of patients. Findings may include albuminuria, a mild elevation in the plasma creatinine concentration, and/or hypertension. SRC, the most serious kidney complication, occurs in up to 10 to 15 percent of patients, generally among those with early-stage disease and diffuse cutaneous involvement, and is associated with a poor prognosis. (See <a class="local">'Kidney involvement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Neuromuscular involvement</strong> – Myopathy is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Other neurologic abnormalities in SSc that are less common include central, peripheral, and autonomic neuropathies. (See <a class="local">'Neuromuscular involvement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Genitourinary involvement</strong> – SSc in men is very commonly associated with erectile dysfunction, which can be an early and even initial manifestation of disease. Women with SSc may also have sexual dysfunction. (See <a class="local">'Genitourinary involvement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – The diagnosis of SSc should be suspected in patients with skin thickening, puffy or swollen fingers, RP, hand stiffness, and/or painful distal finger ulcers. Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux are often present. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation for suspected systemic sclerosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory testing</strong> – We obtain the following routine laboratory tests in patients with suspected SSc, some of which may provide information about specific organ involvement (see <a class="local">'Laboratory testing'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Complete blood count and differential, which may reveal anemia due to malabsorption of iron or gastrointestinal blood loss</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Serum creatinine level, which may indicate renal dysfunction</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Creatine kinase (CK), which may be elevated in patients with myopathy or myositis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Urinalysis</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We also perform the following serologic tests  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95574" href="/d/graphic/95574.html" rel="external">table 4</a>), which may support the diagnosis if positive:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Antinuclear antibody (ANA)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anti-topoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70) antibody</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anticentromere antibody (ACA)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anti-RNA polymerase III antibody</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anti-Th/To antibody</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional studies</strong> – Additional studies focusing on specific organ involvement are useful for confirmation of the diagnosis and determining the extent of extracutaneous involvement (see <a class="local">'Additional studies'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>All patients with suspected SSc should be evaluated for ILD and pulmonary hypertension, which are the most frequent types of lung involvement in SSc patients.
