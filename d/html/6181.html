         The muscular dystrophies are an inherited group of progressive myopathic disorders resulting from defects in a number of genes required for normal muscle function [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene and are therefore named dystrophinopathies. Weakness is the principal symptom as muscle fiber degeneration is the primary pathologic process.
        </p>
        <p>
         The dystrophinopathies are inherited as X-linked recessive traits and have varying clinical characteristics. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is associated with the most severe clinical symptoms. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) has a similar presentation to DMD but a relatively milder clinical course.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management and prognosis of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy will be discussed in this review. Other aspects of DMD and BMD are reviewed separately. (See

         Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for DMD because of their beneficial effects for improving motor function and pulmonary function, reducing the risk of scoliosis, delaying the loss of ambulation, and possibly for delaying progression of cardiomyopathy and improving survival. The use of glucocorticoids is discussed in detail separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Novel disease-modifying therapies offer the potential to ameliorate the genetic basis of these disorders by increasing the production of functional dystrophin. (See

         In addition to muscle weakness, common problems associated with DMD and BMD include cardiac, pulmonary, orthopedic, nutritional, growth, and weight abnormalities. Pain is also a frequent symptom [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Intellectual, behavioral, and neuropsychiatric problems may impair development, learning, and socialization. The anticipation and early detection of these problems is important for optimal therapy, and a multidisciplinary care plan is essential to ensure access to appropriate specialists (

         Patients should receive physical therapy to encourage mobility and to prevent or reduce the risk of contractures. The mainstays of physical therapy are passive stretching exercises at the ankles, knees and hips, four to six times a week, to prevent contractures of the Achilles tendons, iliotibial bands, and flexors of the hip [

         Orthopedic evaluations should monitor for scoliosis and other complications and surgical interventions should be utilized as needed. Visual inspection of the spine to assess for scoliosis should be done every year in the ambulatory stage and every six months once patients become nonambulatory [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Spine radiography should be obtained if visual inspection reveals a curve or if visual inspection is problematic. In the nonambulatory stage, spine radiography should be performed every six months to one year if a curve is present, depending upon skeletal maturity. Patients with a curve &gt;20 should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon. Spine surgery to stabilize or correct scoliosis may improve motor function, patient comfort, sitting balance and tolerance, quality of life, and possibly respiratory function [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         Boys with DMD who are ambulatory or in the early non-ambulatory stage should participate in regular submaximum (ie, gentle), aerobic exercise to avoid disuse muscle atrophy, immobility, excessive weight gain, and social isolation [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Suggested exercises include swimming and cycling, continued in the nonambulatory phase if medically safe. Assisted cycling and robotic-assisted movement are also options in the nonambulatory stage. Low-resistance strength training and optimization of upper body function may provide additional benefits. However, activity should be reduced if patients develop significant muscle pain or myoglobinuria within the 24-hour period after a specific activity, as these may indicate overexertion and contraction-induced muscle injury. Overexertion, eccentric muscle exercises, and high-resistance strength training or activities should be avoided because of the possible adverse effects on fragile muscles in dystrophinopathy. A study of 20 ambulatory boys with DMD showed that a 10-minute standardized calf massage was safe and associated with increased muscle length and decreased stiffness; gait function remained stable [

         Depending upon circumstances and treatment (eg, glucocorticoids), patients with DMD can be at risk of malnutrition and/or underweight or overweight for age. Consensus guidelines recommend evaluation with a dietician/nutritionist at every clinic visit, beginning at baseline [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The goals of nutritional care are to prevent overweight/obesity, underweight/malnutrition, and promote a healthy diet with optimum intake of calories, protein, fluid, and micronutrients, particularly Vitamin D and calcium. Height and weight should be routinely monitored. (See
         <a class="local">

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest dietary calcium and vitamin D intake in the form of dairy products, other foods rich in calcium and vitamin D, and sunshine exposure. Calcium supplementation (500 to 1000 mg/day) is suggested for children with diminished intake of calcium-containing foods (eg, for children who do not like milk and dairy products) or whose calcium intake is less than the recommended dietary allowance [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         Endocrine problems related to DMD and glucocorticoid treatment include decreased linear growth, delayed puberty, and adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, standing height and a nonstanding growth measure (eg, arm span, ulnar length, tibia length, knee height) should be measured every six months, beginning in the ambulatory phase; nonstanding measures allow growth assessment once ambulation is lost [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>

         Consensus guidelines recommend a baseline assessment of cardiac function at the time of diagnosis of DMD, including electrocardiogram, noninvasive imaging with echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and consultation with a cardiologist [

         The cardiac evaluation, including electrocardiogram and noninvasive imaging, should be repeated at least annually for asymptomatic individuals [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The frequency of monitoring should be increased, as directed by the cardiologist, with the onset of heart failure symptoms or the appearance of abnormalities on cardiac imaging, such as myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular enlargement, or left ventricular dysfunction. The risk of cardiac arrhythmia is increased with disease progression, and surveillance in late nonambulatory stage should include periodic 24-hour Holter monitoring as directed by the cardiologist.
        </p>
        <p>
         The choice of noninvasive imaging modality is usually made by the cardiologist following the patient. Echocardiography is often preferred for noninvasive imaging up until approximately the age of 15 years, when the degree of scoliosis may limit acoustic windows. Echocardiography is sufficiently informative for measuring the left ventricular ejection fraction, does not require sedation, and costs far less than cardiac MRI. The consensus guidelines consider cardiac MRI as the noninvasive imaging method of choice, but acknowledge that the need for sedation may limit its utility for younger children. The guidelines recommend echocardiography up until the age of six to seven years and cardiac MRI for older children, who are less likely to need sedation.

         (2 to 4 mg/day) or placebo. There was no difference in LVEF at three years. All of the children were then treated with open-label perindopril for up to 10 years. Although the mean LVEF was still not different (58.6 versus 56.0 percent with placebo), an LVEF less than 45 percent was noted in only one of the 27 patients originally treated with perindopril compared with 8 of the 29 treated with placebo. After an additional year, there were three deaths in the placebo group, all among the eight patients with an LVEF &lt;45 percent. After 10 years of follow-up, survival status was available for all patients, and survival for the original perindopril and placebo groups was 93 and 66 percent, respectively [

         The decision to consider tracheostomy is mainly dependent upon individual preference and clinical course. Our approach is to counsel patients, families, and caregivers together with the pulmonary and palliative care teams and support whatever decision they make. We emphasize that the decision regarding tracheostomy is best made early while the patient is stable on noninvasive ventilation and not during an emergency or medical crisis. Most patients do not choose tracheostomy. Consensus guidelines endorse the use of noninvasive ventilation, and note that clinical experience supports noninvasive assisted ventilation for up to 24 hours a day [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         </span>
         Patients with DMD may experience some improvement between three and six years of age. However, this is followed by gradual but relentless deterioration. Most patients lose ambulation before the age of 12 years and require noninvasive ventilation (NIV) by late teenage years. In our clinical experience, most patients initially use NIV during nighttime sleep, followed by NIV during daytime and nighttime sleep, and later by NIV throughout the day and night, a progression that generally occurs over 5 to 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Life expectancy is shortened with DMD, but survival into adulthood is now common [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31
         </a>
         ]. In the earlier literature, most patients with DMD died in their late teens or early twenties from respiratory insufficiency (most commonly) or arrhythmia secondary to cardiomyopathy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Survival, neuromuscular function, and quality of life in DMD are improving due to longer-term treatment with glucocorticoids, advances in cardiac and respiratory care, and increased utilization of assisted NIV [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,31-38
         </a>
         ]. However, despite these advances, survival beyond the fourth decade is uncommon. In one meta-analysis, patients with DMD born after 1990 had a median life expectancy of approximately 28 years [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Another meta-analysis found that patients who received ventilatory support (introduced in most settings in the 1990s) had a median life expectancy of approximately 30 years [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with BMD typically have a milder clinical course than those with DMD, and remain ambulatory beyond the age of 16 years and into adult life; they usually survive beyond the age of 30 years and have a mean age of death in the mid-40s [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,39,40
         </a>
         ]. The most common cause of death with BMD is heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy, which also causes considerable morbidity in these patients despite their milder skeletal muscle involvement [

          Rehabilitation
         </strong>
         – Patients with DMD requires multidisciplinary care to coordinate the multiple specialized assessments and interventions needed to maximize function and quality of life for affected individuals (

         </a>
         ). Orthopedic interventions are specifically aimed at maintaining function and preventing contractures. For boys with DMD who are ambulatory or in the early nonambulatory stage of the disorder, we suggest regular submaximum (ie, gentle) exercise to avoid disuse muscle atrophy and other complications of inactivity.

          Health maintenance
         </strong>
         – Attention to nutrition, bone health, fracture and fall prevention, growth and endocrine management, and routine immunizations is important for optimizing function and quality of life for patients with DMD. (See

         <strong>
          Nutrition
         </strong>
         – Weight and growth should be monitored, and evaluation by a dietician/nutritionist is indicated at diagnosis and at every clinic visit. For all patients with DMD, we suggest dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation in the form of dairy products, other foods rich in calcium and vitamin D, and sunshine exposure (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). For children with diminished intake of calcium-containing foods, we suggest calcium supplementation (500 to 1000 mg/day). Children with a serum concentration of vitamin D &lt;30 ng/mL should receive vitamin D supplementation. (See

         – A decrease in growth trajectory, an annual height velocity of &lt;4 cm year, or height less than the third percentile should prompt referral to an endocrinologist. Lack of pubertal development by age 14 years for boys should also trigger referral to an endocrinologist. (See

         <strong>
          Bone health
         </strong>
         – Patients with DMD often have risk factors for poor bone health that may include decreased mobility, muscle weakness, and side effects of glucocorticoid therapy. The approach to monitoring bone health focuses on identifying the earliest signs of bone fragility with periodic spine imaging and measurement of bone mineral density. Proactive guidance and home environment assessment and modification may reduce the risk of vertebral and long bone fractures (

         <strong>
          Cardiac management
         </strong>
         – For patients with DMD, a baseline assessment of cardiac function, including electrocardiogram and noninvasive cardiac imaging, is recommended at the time of diagnosis and at least annually thereafter. Female DMD carriers should have a baseline cardiac assessment in early adulthood. For boys with DMD, we recommend initiation of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) beginning by age 10 years (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B

         <strong>
          Respiratory management
         </strong>
         – This is a critical component of DMD care. Serial monitoring of vital capacity should begin when the individual is five to six years of age and followed yearly during the ambulatory stage. When patients become nonambulatory, more extensive monitoring should occur at least every six months. The core respiratory therapies for DMD are lung volume recruitment, assisted coughing, nocturnally assisted ventilation, and subsequent daytime ventilation. In most cases, the need for these interventions arises after loss of ambulation. Detailed indications are listed above. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Psychosocial care
         </strong>
         – For DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), psychosocial care includes routine assessment of the mental health of the patient and family at every clinic visit, with ongoing support and referrals to a psychiatrist or psychologist if needed (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116908" href="/z/d/graphic/116908.html" rel="external">
          table 3

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Clinicians should sensitively engage patients, families, and caregivers in discussions about treatment options, advanced care planning, advanced directives, palliative care, and other end-of-life issues, as guided by patient values and preferences. (See
         <a class="local">

          Surgery and anesthesia
         </strong>
         – Patients with DMD have a high risk of complications when they undergo surgery or procedures requiring anesthesia or sedation, and should have preoperative evaluations by pulmonary, anesthesia, and cardiac specialists prior to any surgery. Total intravenous anesthesia is indicated for patients with DMD.
