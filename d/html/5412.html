Some of the disorders causing these lesions are limited to the vulva, while others also involve skin or mucocutaneous membranes elsewhere on the body. This topic provides a morphology-based classification system that can help clinicians with the differential diagnosis of these lesions after performing a history and physical examination. This classification system is also useful for guiding the choice of diagnostic tests and procedures.</p><p>This topic will focus on the differential diagnosis of vesicles, bullae, erosions, and ulcerative vulvar lesions. Discussions of other pigmented lesions are presented in related content.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128406.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis of red lesions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128407.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis of white lesions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128409.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis of yellow, skin-colored, and edematous lesions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128408.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis of pigmented (black, brown, blue) lesions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The pertinent history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests and procedures used to evaluate patients with vulvar lesions are described separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5450.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lesions: Diagnostic evaluation"</a>). Treatment is also discussed separately in topic reviews on these disorders.</p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender diverse individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3138823285"><span class="h1">MORPHOLOGIC DEFINITIONS FOR MUCOCUTANEOUS VULVAR LESIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mucocutaneous vulvar lesions can be classified using the morphologic definitions described in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95851" href="/z/d/graphic/95851.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4194473553"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H184639298"><span class="h2">Practical tips</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Based on the authors' experience, clinicians should be aware of the following points when evaluating dermatologic lesions of the vulva:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alternate appearance of vulvar lesions</strong> – Many skin conditions may appear differently on the vulva than on other parts of the skin as the vulva is so moist and the area is commonly subject to friction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Concomitant conditions</strong> – Concomitant conditions to consider with vulvar lesions include infections, other dermatoses, and neoplasia/ cancer. For example, irritant contact dermatitis from the use of caustic soaps or over washing is commonly seen in individuals with vulvar lichen sclerosus. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Impact of topical therapies</strong> – Vulvar conditions may be significantly altered by the use of topical treatments. The authors ask patients about use of prescription, over-the-counter, compounded, and alternative topical preparations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Role of biopsy</strong> – Be prepared to perform a biopsy, especially if a vulvar lesion is atypical, bleeding, the patient is immunocompromised, the lesion is not responding to appropriate treatment, or there is concern for a malignancy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For any lesions with variable or irregular areas, more than one biopsy may be needed. At times, the biopsy results can be inconclusive. If there are ever concerns or questions about the biopsy report, it is important to speak with the pathologist. Sending a clinical photograph to the pathologist can also aid the diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Consider possibility of systemic disease</strong> – Vulvar lesions can represent diseases that commonly present on the vulva (eg, herpes simplex virus) or systemic diseases that manifest in multiple sites including the vulva (eg, psoriasis). Providers are encouraged to ask patients with vulvar lesions about generalized symptoms and presence of lesions or skin changes on other body parts.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specialist referral</strong> – Patients whose symptoms do not respond, or worsen, despite usual treatment should be referred to a gynecologist, dermatologist, family medicine physician, or other health care providers who specialize in vulvar skin disorders.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H111014189"><span class="h2">How to use this topic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After a history, physical examination, and morphologic classification  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95851" href="/z/d/graphic/95851.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) have been performed, the information in this topic can be used to begin a differential diagnosis of the lesion. Diagnostic entities are listed for each morphologic classification and often listed under more than one morphologic classification since many lesions have more than one presentation (morphologic type, color). The complete description of the diagnostic entity is provided only once; for morphologic variants, the entity is noted and linked to its descriptive section.</p><p>This topic is an overview of vesicles, bullae, erosions, and ulcers of the vulva. Detailed text specific to each type of vulvar lesion is available separately, and links are provided throughout the text where available. Brief summaries of pertinent history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests and procedures are provided in this topic. Discussions of the presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of vulvar lesions are described in detail separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5450.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lesions: Diagnostic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6838.html" rel="external">"Approach to the clinical dermatologic diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5577.html" rel="external">"Skin biopsy techniques"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27977538"><span class="h1">VESICLES AND BULLAE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vesicles are small (&lt;1 cm) fluid-filled blisters while bullae are large (&gt;1 cm) fluid-filled blisters  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95851" href="/z/d/graphic/95851.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Both typically contain clear fluid. A differential diagnosis for vesicles and bullae specific to the vulva is presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95995" href="/z/d/graphic/95995.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

Diagnosis is typically made with a combination of patient history and physical examination, although clinical testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) may be needed for definitive confirmation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27977544"><span class="h3">Herpes simplex virus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A detailed discussion of the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of genital HSV is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection"</a>.)</p><p>A brief summary follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong> – Genital HSV can present in either of two ways. The rarely encountered primary episode occurs with widespread genital vesicles, pustules, and/or erosions in a patient who is also experiencing fever, malaise, and dysuria  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61107" href="/z/d/graphic/61107.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The much more common recurrent form of genital herpes presents with 5 to 15 small (1 to 5 mm) vesicles that rapidly become pustular and contain clear then yellow fluid  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58485" href="/z/d/graphic/58485.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). These are clustered over an area of approximately 2 to 5 cm. The vesicles/pustules quickly break, forming superficial, well-demarcated, round erosions on the skin, mucous membranes, and modified mucous membranes of the vulva. Swelling of the underlying skin is variable. A typical prodrome of localized itching, burning, or tingling supports the diagnosis. Eighty percent of individuals with herpes are unaware of their diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A clinical diagnosis of eroded genital herpes is usually possible based on the presence of collar-like scale around the circumference of the erosions, tight grouping of the erosions, a gyrate (ie, wavy) border if the erosions have become confluent, and a history of preceding, similar lesions at the same site. However, if this is the first outbreak, confirmation of the clinical diagnosis should be obtained.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic tests</strong> – Confirmation is most commonly achieved by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique-based testing. Viral cell culture and immunofluorescence testing are other test methods. The material is gently swabbed or scraped from the base of the erosion and spread onto a microscope slide; however, the sensitivity of viral culture is low, especially with recurrent HSV. HSV tests become negative approximately five days after the erosions have developed. Confirmation of HSV in erosions older than five days is difficult, if not impossible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Herpes zoster vesicles are almost identical in appearance to those of HSV. However, the clusters of vesicles and pustules are usually arranged in a dermatomal pattern and usually appear for the first time in older individuals. Appreciable pain occurring in the involved dermatome is also regularly present and usually precedes the outbreak of lesions by several days.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See <a class="local">'Herpes zoster'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8327.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of herpes zoster"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Candidiasis is more superficial, the lesions are pustules rather than vesicles, and the lesions are smaller in size and more numerous than those seen with HSV outbreaks. The broken pustules can be scattered or become confluent, forming a desquamating border. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128406.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis of red lesions", section on 'Candidiasis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bullous impetigo is more superficial, with vesicles and bullae that break and form desquamating edges and honey-colored crusted lesions. (See <a class="local">'Bullous impetigo'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HSV in immunosuppressed patients</strong> – HSV is the most common cause of vulvar ulcers in immunosuppressed patients. A diagnosis of HSV should be considered in all immunosuppressed women with nonhealing, usually painful, at times raw or necrotic-based ulcers with crusted edges (especially if a gyrate configuration is present); there may not be a history of a vesicular stage. In some instances, there is no appreciable pain. Because of the inability to muster a suitable immune response, the ulcers may persist for weeks to months and can gradually spread peripherally. The typical vesiculopustular, herpetiform, grouped HSV lesions may be seen at the edge of the expanding ulcers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8347.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection", section on 'Immunosuppressed patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>If diagnostic studies are negative, serologic tests for syphilis should be obtained, and biopsy should be performed to rule out aphthous ulcers, chancroid, pyoderma gangrenosum, and ulcerated malignancy. (See <a class="local">'Acute vulvar aphthous ulcers'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7582.html" rel="external">"Chancroid"</a> and <a class="local">'Rare'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27977550"><span class="h3">Herpes zoster</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Herpes zoster is a vesicular skin eruption caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8327.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of herpes zoster"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8293.html" rel="external">"Treatment of herpes zoster"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Briefly:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong> – A burning- or tingling-type of pain is the first sign of herpes zoster. It starts in one area and spreads, usually unilaterally, along the involved dermatome(s). Systemically, there may be fever and malaise. On the skin, herpes zoster presents as round-to-oval edematous pink plaques unilaterally along a dermatome, with varying degrees of pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52440" href="/z/d/graphic/52440.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65213" href="/z/d/graphic/65213.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Within a day or two, groups of one to five vesicles appear on the surface of the red plaques  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58282" href="/z/d/graphic/58282.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>). These can become pustular. Groups of lesions erupt over several days. The vesicles often coalesce into larger bullae that may be purpuric. In the anogenital region, the blisters usually extend unilaterally along the buttocks to the labia majora and minora. The blister roofs break down quickly and easily, leaving painful, open, grouped erosions (3 to 7 mm). There can be loose scale (collarette or collar-like scale) at the periphery of the erosions. Occasionally, the lesions become confluent, leaving larger erosions possessing a gyrate configuration. The erosions crust over then heal. There can be ulceration and scarring. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8327.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of herpes zoster", section on 'Common findings'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – A diagnosis can usually be established clinically based on the morphology. However, viral culture, immunofluorescent, or PCR-based identification may be desirable, considering that approximately 10 percent of the patients with the above morphology turn out to have HSV infection, rather than VZV infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8327.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of herpes zoster", section on 'Approach to diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnoses include HSV, bullous impetigo, and bullous pemphigoid. HSV is usually more limited and often crosses the midline, while herpes zoster is classically unilateral along a dermatome. Bullous impetigo has thin-walled vesicles and bullae, which are culture positive for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Bullous pemphigoid has firm, thick-walled bullae. Neither condition is as painful as herpes zoster.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27977556"><span class="h3">Bullous impetigo</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection; the bullous type is usually caused by <em>S. aureus</em> and less often by streptococcal species. The lesions initially consist of thin-walled, fragile vesicles and bullae. These break down quickly, leaving round erosions with collarettes of scale and variable honey-colored crusting  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96269" href="/z/d/graphic/96269.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). Anogenital impetigo occurs on the keratinized skin of the labia, labiocrural folds, upper inner thighs, and mons pubis. Occasionally, the vesicles and bullae remain intact for several days, and when this occurs, the gradual accumulation of white blood cells results in yellow-white blister fluid. In addition to vesicles and bullae, one or more follicular red papules or pustules (bacterial folliculitis) are also often present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7655.html" rel="external">"Impetigo", section on 'Bullous impetigo'</a>.)</p><p>Bullous impetigo can be confused with blistering diseases since the erosions in all of these diseases have well-demarcated, superficial peeling edges. Diagnosis is made through the recovery of <em>S. aureus</em> or streptococcal species on culture from the blister fluid or from the surface of the erosion that occurs after the blister roof is gone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7655.html" rel="external">"Impetigo"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3577531126"><span class="h2">Less common etiologies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While the diseases below present with varying frequency, they are less common causes of vulvar vesicles and bullae  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95995" href="/z/d/graphic/95995.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27977592"><span class="h3">Erythema multiforme</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Erythema multiforme is an immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction of the skin that can result from infections such as HSV or medication.

Typically, these lesions are seen on hands and feet and spread to the trunk. There are red macules that become raised, forming plaques that darken in the center and blister and crust over in two to three days. They are target-like with three zones: center dusky red that can blister and erode; swollen and pink middle ring; and the red outer edge. These lesions may coalesce to form generalized redness, covering up to 10 percent of the skin surface. Vesicles and bullae develop, as described, on the reddened skin as well as on all mucosal surfaces, including the vulva and vagina. These blisters break down very quickly to form painful erosions with serous and hemorrhagic crusting. The mucosal erosions frequently heal with scarring. The diagnosis is made by the typical clinical presentation of the prodrome, the pattern of the skin eruption, and the disorder's rapid progression.

(See <a class="local">'Morphologic definitions for mucocutaneous vulvar lesions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical points</strong> – Based on the authors' experience, clinicians should be aware of alternate appearances of vulvar lesions, concomitant conditions, topical therapies, role of biopsy, and possibility of systemic disease when evaluating dermatologic lesions of the vulva (see <a class="local">'Practical tips'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients whose symptoms do not respond, or worsen, despite usual treatment should be referred to a gynecologist, dermatologist, family medicine physician, or other health care providers who specialize in vulvar skin disorders.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vesicles and bullae</strong> – Vesicles are small (&lt;1 cm) fluid-filled blisters while bullae are large (&gt;1 cm) fluid-filled blisters  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95851" href="/z/d/graphic/95851.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Both typically contain clear fluid. A differential diagnosis for vesicles and bullae of the vulva is presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95995" href="/z/d/graphic/95995.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).
