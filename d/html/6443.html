Lack of blanching is often best appreciated by diascopy, which involves the use of a clear glass slide or drinking glass to apply pressure to the skin. They arise from bleeding into the skin from small capillaries. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Infection and thrombocytopenia are important causes of petechiae, although they may arise in other conditions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Purpura</strong> – Purpura are hemorrhagic lesions that are larger than petechiae and result from bleeding within the skin or mucous membranes from capillaries and other small blood vessels. Purpura can appear as non-blanchable dark red to dark purple macules, papules, patches, or plaques  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101339 graphicRef94772" href="/z/d/graphic/101339.html" rel="external">picture 2A-B</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52107" href="/z/d/graphic/52107.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53920" href="/z/d/graphic/53920.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>).

A well-appearing child with petechiae and or purpura and normal vital signs can be approached with less urgency but still requires timely evaluation to identify the underlying cause.

Von Willebrand is autosomal dominant and is seen with equal frequency in males and females.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – Serious infection is an important cause of petechiae and purpura in children and is usually, but not always, associated with fever.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptom onset</strong> – The patient's recent and past medical history should be reviewed carefully with the parents/primary caregiver and child. Acute onset of purpuric skin lesions after a recent viral illness or immunization is consistent with an acquired disorder such as ITP. Recurrent purpura since infancy, however, suggests an inherited abnormality of platelets or clotting factors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type of lesions and presence of bleeding</strong> – The site and type of bleeding manifestation may be helpful in establishing the alteration in the hemostatic mechanisms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834" href="/z/d/graphic/77834.html" rel="external">table 2</a>): </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Petechiae are most commonly seen in patients with thrombocytopenia and platelet disorders</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Mucosal bleeding (heavy menstrual bleeding, epistaxis) is common in platelet disorders and von Willebrand disease</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Soft tissue bruising and bleeding into the joints (hemarthroses) or muscles is common in patients with hemophilia or other clotting factor deficiencies</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prior bleeding history</strong> – Prior bleeding during past surgeries (including circumcision), dental extractions, or significant trauma and the site of bleeding points to an alteration in hemostasis. Conversely, the absence of bleeding under these conditions would be unusual in most inherited disorders of even moderate severity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Family history of bleeding</strong> – The family history should be reviewed for purpura or bleeding disorders. A positive family history in male relatives on the maternal side suggests factor VIII or factor IX deficiency. A history of bleeding or bruising in numerous male and female family members suggests a condition with dominant inheritance such as von Willebrand disease. However, a negative family history does <strong>not</strong> exclude the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease or hemophilia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1310.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1307.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recent medications</strong> – The clinician should note exposure to <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12829" href="/z/d/drug information/12829.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and other drugs known to affect platelet function. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Drug-induced vasculitis may be caused by numerous drugs including sulfonamides, penicillins, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12702" href="/z/d/drug information/12702.html" rel="external">phenytoin</a> [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. It usually develops within 7 to 21 days of starting the drug. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/141392.html" rel="external">"Purpuric skin lesions (petechiae, purpura, and ecchymoses) in children: Causes", section on 'Drug-induced vasculitis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prescription anticoagulant or rat poison (</strong><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12886" href="/z/d/drug information/12886.html" rel="external">warfarin</a><strong> or superwarfarin) poisoning</strong> – In general, oral intake of small amounts of rat poison (eg, single handful of superwarfarin product) or prescription anticoagulant would be unlikely to result in purpuric skin lesions or bleeding. Thus, patients with purpura in whom these ingestions are confirmed have likely had a large ingestion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1324.html" rel="external">"Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR", section on 'Superwarfarin poisoning'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/100310.html" rel="external">"Anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/141392.html" rel="external">"Purpuric skin lesions (petechiae, purpura, and ecchymoses) in children: Causes", section on 'Vitamin K deficiency'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dietary history</strong> – Patients with severe malnutrition or restricted diets including patients with autism or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder may be at risk for scurvy or vitamin K deficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Past medical history</strong> – Patients with underlying conditions such as uremia, hepatic disease, congenital heart disease, cancer or malabsorption may develop alterations in hemostasis (thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction or coagulopathy) that may present with purpura or bleeding.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H35"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with purpuric skin lesions require a complete physical examination. Areas of particular focus include [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General examination</strong> – The overall appearance of a child will help guide further management. Patients who have purpuric skin lesions and are ill-appearing and/or hemodynamically unstable need to be rapidly assessed treated for presumed sepsis, especially children with fever  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141375" href="/z/d/graphic/141375.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Initial stabilization'</a> above and <a class="local">'Ill-appearing'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – Infection is also an important consideration for all febrile children with purpuric skin lesions and requires further evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Ill-appearing'</a> below and <a class="local">'Febrile'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Skin</strong> – The child should be examined carefully to assist in the diagnosis of the specific bleeding disorder and to evaluate hidden areas of hemorrhage. For petechiae and purpura, lack of blanching is often best appreciated by diascopy which involves the use of a clear glass slide or drinking glass to apply pressure to the skin.

Purpura localized to the lower body (buttocks, legs, ankles), with or without joint swelling in the hands or feet, suggests immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Schönlein purpura [HSP]). The face, trunk, and upper extremities may be involved in non-ambulatory children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6406.html" rel="external">"IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations in children'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Ecchymoses (Bruises) </strong>– Non-painful, palpable (lumpy) bruises are often seen in children with severe hemophilia.
