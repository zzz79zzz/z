Long-term neurotoxicity is an important issue for the growing number of cancer survivors, with the highest number of affected patients having been treated for breast and/or colon cancer. CIPN may also adversely affect oncologic outcomes by forcing dose modifications and/or premature treatment discontinuation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/754.html" rel="external">"Overview of long-term complications of therapy in breast cancer survivors and patterns of relapse", section on 'Neurologic morbidity'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14230.html" rel="external">"Approach to the long-term survivor of colorectal cancer", section on 'Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of CIPN varies according to the chemotherapeutic agent, dose, duration of exposure, and method of assessment. The agents with the highest incidence are the platinum drugs, especially <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a>, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8509" href="/z/d/drug information/8509.html" rel="external">bortezomib</a>. The incidence, risk factors, pathogenetic mechanisms, and clinical characteristics of CIPN from these classes of agents as well as other chemotherapeutic drugs are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2826.html" rel="external">"Overview of neurologic complications of platinum-based chemotherapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2836.html" rel="external">"Overview of neurologic complications of conventional non-platinum cancer chemotherapy"</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will cover approaches to prevention and treatment of CIPN focusing mainly on platinum drugs, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8509" href="/z/d/drug information/8509.html" rel="external">bortezomib</a>. An overview of neurologic complications with platinum and non-platinum chemotherapy drugs, and recommendations for dose modification for platinum and non-platinum chemotherapeutic drugs when neuropathy develops during therapy are provided elsewhere.

An exception is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10095" href="/z/d/drug information/10095.html" rel="external">thalidomide</a>, which is associated with weakness and tremor in 30 to 40 percent. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">Paclitaxel</a> can also be associated with motor neuropathy (mainly proximal) in up to 14 percent of patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67516" href="/z/d/graphic/67516.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2836.html" rel="external">"Overview of neurologic complications of conventional non-platinum cancer chemotherapy", section on 'Thalidomide and related agents'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2836.html" rel="external">"Overview of neurologic complications of conventional non-platinum cancer chemotherapy", section on 'Clinical features, incidence, and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Autonomic neuropathy is rare with the exception of the vinca alkaloids, particularly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/z/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a>, which commonly cause constipation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67516" href="/z/d/graphic/67516.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2836.html" rel="external">"Overview of neurologic complications of conventional non-platinum cancer chemotherapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In many cases, the natural history of CIPN is gradual improvement over time after chemotherapy is stopped, although it may continue to worsen over a few months with some drugs (most notably <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a>) before it starts to improve. This has been labeled as being a "coasting phenomenon." As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Even if the drug is discontinued, cisplatin- and oxaliplatin-related CIPN, on average, continues to worsen for approximately three months. While it has been claimed that neuropathy may even begin after therapy is discontinued, a close look at this phenomenon illustrates that the slope of worsening neuropathy is the same in the two to three months before the chemotherapy is stopped as it is in the two to three months after it has been stopped. This is consistent with the conclusion that the full manifestation of CIPN, after a dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a>, takes two to three months [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. CIPN eventually improves in most patients, although recovery is often incomplete. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2826.html" rel="external">"Overview of neurologic complications of platinum-based chemotherapy", section on 'Clinical and electrophysiologic manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>With <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a>, after completing treatment, approximately one-half of patients improve over a period of four to six months [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. However, severe neuropathy can persist. In one study, up to 80 percent of patients still had neuropathic symptoms up to two years after completing treatment; approximately 25 percent reported severe symptoms of numbness and/or discomfort in their hands and feet [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. While some patients report that CIPN worsens for a while after paclitaxel is stopped, on average, paclitaxel CIPN begins to improve in the first two to three months after it is stopped, in contrast to what occurs with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a> [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

While it classically has been thought that this acute neuropathy completely resolves after a few days, data support the view that it does not completely resolve between <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a> doses, at least with repeat dosing every two weeks. Patients with the most severe acute symptoms are at higher risk to develop more severe chronic neuropathy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2826.html" rel="external">"Overview of neurologic complications of platinum-based chemotherapy", section on 'Acute neurotoxicity'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> can develop an acute pain syndrome. The timing is similar to that seen with oxaliplatin-induced acute neuropathy. This syndrome, in the distant past had classically been termed as paclitaxel-associated arthralgias and myalgias, but data first published in 2012 support the view that this is a form of an acute neuropathy, as opposed to a disorder of joints and/or muscles [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. This problem is much more prominent in patients receiving higher doses on an every-three-week schedule than with lower weekly doses. This phenomenon also occurs with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a>, although less commonly. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2836.html" rel="external">"Overview of neurologic complications of conventional non-platinum cancer chemotherapy", section on 'Clinical features, incidence, and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H523404533"><span class="h1">PREVENTIVE APPROACHES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no established agents that can be recommended for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in patients with cancer undergoing treatment with potentially neurotoxic agents. This position is consistent with updated year 2020 guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) for prevention and management of CIPN [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], and joint guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology/European Oncology Nursing Society/European Association of Neuro-Oncology (ESMO/EONS/EANO) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. For patients receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a>, we suggest interspersing a non-oxaliplatin-containing "maintenance" chemotherapy regimen with the oxaliplatin regimen when appropriate in the clinical setting (palliative chemotherapy). For patients receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8509" href="/z/d/drug information/8509.html" rel="external">bortezomib</a>, weekly rather than twice weekly treatment schedules and subcutaneous as compared with intravenous administration of bortezomib are preferred, as they are associated with less frequent and less severe neurotoxicity.</p><p>Given the absence of effective preventive agents, clinicians should carefully assess the benefits of agents known to cause CIPN against the risks of developing long-term irreversible neuropathy, especially among patients with underlying neuropathy and with conditions that predispose to neuropathy (eg, diabetes mellitus and/or a personal or family history of hereditary neuropathies).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H605590385"><span class="h2">Pharmacologic agents and physical strategies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite CIPN being relatively distinct from other neuropathies, many of the interventions chosen to undergo evaluation for prevention (and treatment) of CIPN are those with demonstrated efficacy in other common neuropathic pain conditions (eg, painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia). Nearly all of these studies have been conducted in patients receiving platinum drugs (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a>), taxanes, and/or vinca alkaloids.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3547698188"><span class="h3">Interventions with potential but unproven benefit</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although proof of benefit has not been established, available data suggest that exercise, cryotherapy, and compression therapy with or without cryotherapy may in part prevent symptoms of CIPN, and appear to reasonably safe, although clinicians should be aware of frostbite risk. Ganglioside-monosialic acid (GM1) was reported to be effective in one Chinese study but confirmation in larger trials and other ethnic groups is needed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H941412546"><span class="h4">Cryotherapy, compression therapy, or both</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients receiving weekly therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> (and some patients receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a>), cryotherapy (eg, by using frozen socks and gloves before, during, and after drug infusion) may be useful to diminish objective and subjective symptoms of CIPN. However, as the data are less than robust, confirmation in additional larger studies is needed before this approach can be recommended. This conclusion is consistent with the updated ASCO and joint ESMO/EONS/EANO guidelines on prevention and treatment of CIPN [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p>The role of compression therapy, either with or without cryotherapy, remains uncertain. The following data are available:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cryotherapy alone</strong> – A few uncontrolled reports suggested potential utility for frozen gloves/socks worn during drug infusion to prevent/mitigate neurotoxicity related to weekly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> in women with breast cancer [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>].Benefit was further supported by data from a prospective trial in which 40 women with breast cancer receiving weekly paclitaxel wore frozen gloves and socks on their dominant side before, during, and after each infusion (90 minutes total); symptoms on the treated side were compared with the untreated (nondominant) side [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The main endpoint was any decline in tactile sensation as assessed by the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test, an outcome measure that is routinely used for diabetic neuropathy  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68612" href="/z/d/graphic/68612.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), at a cumulative dose of 960 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; secondary outcome measures included clinician-rated thermosensory deficits using a thermal stimulator at 3 and 48°C, vibration perception using a 128 Hz tuning fork, performance speed as assessed by a grooved pegboard test, abnormal electrophysiologic signs as assessed by electrophysiologic testing of the median nerve, and current perception thresholds using a neurometer. Subjective symptoms were also assessed using a patient neuropathy questionnaire in which individual items were scored as A (no neuropathy), B (mild neuropathy), C (moderate neuropathy not interfering with activities of daily living [ADL]), D (moderate neuropathy that interferes with ADL), or E (severe neuropathy). Grades D and E were scored as severe neuropathy.

Neurofeedback consisted of 20 sessions in which the participants watched and responded to their own EEGs while playing a game for 45 minutes per session; when they maintained their EEG waveform amplitude over a chosen threshold and inhibited less desirable waveforms, they were given rewarding feedback with a picture and a beep; the game paused when the participant did not match the thresholds preprogrammed into the software, and no auditory or visual feedback was given. Over time, the group completing the neurofeedback experienced significant improvements in pain scores when compared with the waitlist control group, and there were also improvements in numbness, symptom interference, physical functioning, and fatigue; these benefits persisted four months after treatment was completed.

Given the low potential for harm, a trial of acupuncture, acupressure, or reflexology is reasonable for patients who desire it. Similarly, although the data are conflicting, a trial of scrambler therapy, where available, is reasonable for patients with refractory symptoms who desire it. Exercise is also reasonable to recommend, based on preliminary evidence of benefit and its beneficial effects on other aspects of health.
