         Pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries are the result of sustained force on soft tissue typically overlying bony prominences, which leads to hypoxia, ischemia, and eventual necrosis. These injuries are common, estimated by the United States Joint Commission on Patient Safety to occur in 2.5 million patients in US acute care facilities annually and result in 60,000 deaths each year [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The total annual cost of pressure injuries in the US was estimated to be USD $11 billion in 2006 and $26.8 billion in 2016, with a median treatment cost of $27,000 per single pressure-induced injury (range of $10,000 to $86,000) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. In Canada, a prevalence as high as 26 percent across all health care settings has been reported, with an estimated monthly cost of CAD $4750 per person with a spinal cord injury receiving care for a pressure-induced injury [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Increased awareness, improved preventive measures, and earlier diagnosis resulted in a decline in pressure injuries between 2012 and 2016 according to an international pressure ulcer prevalence survey; however, the prevalence of severe pressure injuries, and therefore those who usually require surgical management, has remained the same [

         The management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury depends on the clinical stage  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62903" href="/z/d/graphic/62903.html" rel="external">
          table 1

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The management of stage I and II pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries is generally conservative with appropriate wound care and elimination of causative factors that led to the initial injury. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2887.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical staging and general management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Stage III and IV injuries involve a level of injury that will almost always require surgical management to obtain wound closure [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Surgical closure of stage III or IV pressure-induced wounds significantly improved mean quality-of-life scores in a review of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury [

        </p>
        <p>
         Apart from higher injury stage, other indications for surgical management include significant necrosis in the wound, osteomyelitis, wounds causing systemic infection as well as deterioration in the patient's functional status, and persistent nonhealing wounds [

         A multidisciplinary approach is important in all phases of care for the patient with pressure-induced injury; the team managing these patients consists of nurses, nutritionists, wound care specialists, internists, infectious disease consultants, plastic and reconstructive surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, anesthetists, rehabilitation specialists (physiatrists, occupational and physical therapists), and social workers [
         <a href="#rid10">

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         Perioperative planning is of equal, if not greater, importance than the surgery itself in the context of pressure-induced injury care [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Patients with severe pressure-induced injuries rarely present without serious comorbidities, and special attention must be applied to optimizing the condition of the patient preoperatively to reduce surgical risk and maximize the likelihood of satisfactory postoperative wound healing and recovery. The operative plan may entail multiple individual procedures and be associated with a long recuperation period and significant complications including bleeding, infection, wound recurrence, dehiscence, and flap loss. With the use of muscle flaps to reconstruct defects, especially in ambulatory patients, weakness or functional loss must be considered. All potential intraoperative and postoperative complications need to be explained to the patient to obtain informed consent; this is more likely to ensure compliance to the strategy of care that is chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to the surgical plan, the disposition and rehabilitation plans should be discussed well in advance, and preferably reflect a streamlined systematic approach, adapted to the factors unique to each patient. This reduces prolonged acute hospital length of stays and complications and optimizes wound healing and functional rehabilitation. The long recovery and special postoperative rehabilitation requirements after surgical reconstruction of pressure-induced injury may result in the need for modification of lifestyle and interruptions in livelihood. These considerations are of tremendous importance to patients and must, if possible, be anticipated and addressed adequately prior to embarking on the reconstructive course.

          —
         </span>
         Cardiorespiratory function must be carefully assessed and optimized to minimize perioperative complications. Most patients with pressure-induced injuries are classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class III to IV, requiring special anesthesia care, and are more likely to have intraoperative and postoperative complications. As an example, patients with high spinal cord injuries can manifest features of autonomic dysreflexia, an abnormal hemodynamic response to certain stimuli, which may result in life-threatening blood pressure disturbances, cardiac dysrhythmias, and excess bleeding [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite this recognition, there is a dearth of specific recommendations for anesthetic management of patients undergoing surgery for pressure-induced injuries [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Options for anesthesia include general and regional modalities, with or without sedation. The ultimate anesthetic choice is based on the patient's general condition and preference, surgical positioning that is required, anticipated duration of the procedure, and anticipated airway management. Intraoperative positioning during surgery must be carefully considered to avoid the development of new pressure-induced injuries or exacerbation of pre-existing wounds. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94593.html" rel="external">
          "Patient positioning for surgery and anesthesia in adults"

        </p>
        <p>
         To the extent that is possible, debridement of wounds and flap coverage should be undertaken on an elective operating schedule at an academic center as part of a protocolized system of care. The only exception to this rule would be the emergency debridement of an infected wound in the context of sepsis. The need for postoperative intensive care monitoring and appropriate nursing should be considered in either context.

         All surgical patients should undergo preoperative nutrition assessment [

        <p>
         Patients with chronic wounds such as pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries are frequently malnourished. Wound healing in this context is severely impaired, necessitating prompt intervention by a nutritional specialist, and may require that definitive surgery be delayed if circumstances allow. Guidelines have been published jointly by the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel and European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel for nutritional assessment and optimization of patients with pressure injuries [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One study found that while serum prealbumin and albumin levels were low in all enrolled older patients, they were lowest in patients with pressure-induced injuries, likely as a result of malnutrition and catabolism [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. In a study comparing 100 patients with pressure injuries with 213 healthy controls, patients with pressure-induced injuries have also been shown to have elevated markers of oxidative stress [
         <a href="#rid19">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There may be some circumstances in which a staged approach may be favored, whereby the wound is debrided first, nutrition is then optimized, and subsequently surgical reconstruction is undertaken electively. No controlled studies have formally compared these two approaches. However, the approach supported by evidence is that debridement, which converts a chronic wound into an acute wound, and later reconstruction improves anemia, serum proteins, and inflammatory marker levels by removing the stimulus for chronic inflammation associated with long-standing wounds [

         Prior to surgical management of pressure-induced injuries, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated preoperatively and continued postoperatively, directed by clinical assessment and wound culture results. Pressure injuries are inevitably contaminated at the time of closure in spite of topical wound care strategies [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. While swabs are commonly taken, the ideal samples (soft tissue, bone) to be cultured are deep tissues taken during surgical debridement [

          19,20

        <p>
         Osteomyelitis is not an uncommon occurrence with deep pressure injuries and is often suspected on imaging studies (eg, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging) during preoperative workup but requires bone biopsy and culture to confirm the diagnosis. Osteomyelitis requires debridement of devitalized tissue and prolonged antibiotic coverage of several weeks (in the authors' practice, the protocol is six weeks of intravenous antibiotics) prior to definitive reconstruction. The presence of osteomyelitis may entail considerations such as insertion of central venous access for long-term antibiotics, long-term inpatient stays, or well-organized home or community support for appropriate treatment. Failure to adequately diagnose or treat acute osteomyelitis is associated with increased recurrence rates after surgical reconstruction [

         All necrotic tissue should be aggressively debrided as a first step in the wound healing process [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Deep tissue samples from surgically cleaned and debrided wounds can be obtained and are the standard for wound cultures to help guide antimicrobial therapy. For those with deep pressure-induced injury involving the bone, bone biopsies are necessary for the definitive diagnosis of osteomyelitis to determine the responsible pathogens and guide antimicrobial therapy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,20
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Antimicrobial therapy'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         While bedside debridement may be performed in the context of selected small pressure-induced injuries with a clearly delineated eschar, it is not recommended for larger or deeper wounds due to patient discomfort and pain, less effective hemostasis, and a suboptimal view of the extent of the wound and the adequacy of debridement. Formal operative debridement of larger and deeper skin pressure-induced injuries is a safer and more thorough approach that also allows for planning of surgical closure options available. The amount of necrotic tissue is frequently underestimated on initial bedside examination, and debridement usually results in a larger defect than originally anticipated [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal of debridement is to achieve a viable wound bed devoid of necrotic, ischemic, and infected tissue that will impede wound healing and increase the risk of wound recurrence. The importance of adequate hemostasis cannot be overstated, as these wounds have a propensity to bleed, leading to significant blood loss in a short period of time. A graduated out-to-in approach usually works best, facilitating exposure and thorough debridement, starting with the skin edge circumferentially and potentially ending with debridement of bone. Each circumference should be completed before moving inward, while achieving adequate hemostasis along the way.

         Following debridement, definitive reconstruction of the skin and soft tissue defect may be performed in the same surgery or in a subsequent procedure, depending on amounts of necrotic tissue, ability to achieve an adequate debridement, patient nutritional status and general condition, and surgeon's discretion. There is a paucity of evidence to favor a single-stage over multiple-stage approach to pressure-induced injury debridement and reconstruction; no randomized trials have been conducted comparing the two approaches for complications and recurrence rates [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. There are advocates for each approach. Proponents of a single-stage approach cite fewer anesthetic and surgical procedures and potentially shorter hospital stays, with quicker initiation of rehabilitation as advantages [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39,40
         </a>
         ], while the latter advocate that the multiple-stage approach allows for more meticulous ultimate debridement, shorter individual procedure times, and more appropriate antibiotic coverage due to availability of culture results in time for the reconstructive stage of the procedure [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. In addition, for staged reconstruction, urinary/fecal diversion procedures may be performed immediately after debridement, prior to definitive reconstruction, in order to obtain the maximum benefit [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In well-organized multidisciplinary systems of care, there is more likely to be a single surgery rather than multi-stage approach, as the patient is generally better prepared from a general health and nutritional perspective in these settings.

         Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) merits special mention in the wound management of pressure-induced injuries. NPWT improves the local wound environment through both direct and indirect effects, accelerating healing and reducing time to wound closure. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2881.html" rel="external">
          "Negative pressure wound therapy", section on 'Mechanism of action'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As a dressing, NPWT provides the advantages of less frequent changes and therefore reduced pain, while facilitating the removal of secretions, reducing contamination from urine and stool, some degree of splinting to control pain, and arguably, reduction of defect size. These beneficial effects culminate in reduced healing times, length of hospital stays, while minimizing personnel time [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. NPWT modalities also enable the delivery of antiseptics (ie, instillation) to the wound bed. Furthermore, foams of various densities give practitioners the ability to protect sections of the wound or augment debridement and the rapid generation of granulation in others. Foams with large pores have also been observed to clearly demarcate viable areas from areas requiring further sharp debridement, as viable areas will granulate more rapidly with this foam than others [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,41-45
         </a>
         ]
         <em>
          .
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         As destination therapy, NPWT may provide a feasible option to help in granulation and gradual healing of some smaller, less complex defects without exposure of vital structures, and may be considered in frail and older patients who are incapable of tolerating definitive surgical interventions, as well as patients who have a paucity of local reconstructive options in the context of multiple pressure injuries, or failure of previous reconstructions [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The caveat to implementing NPWT is that a secure dressing seal is imperative for the function of the dressing, particularly when instillation is desired, and to avoid exacerbation of infection; this may prove challenging to maintain due to the location of the wounds (eg, proximity to genitalia and anus), as well as skin maceration, moisture and shear.

         Patients with long-standing and deep sacral and ischial pressure sores may benefit from fecal and sometimes urinary diversion to minimize or eliminate wound soiling. In discussions with the patient and during the consent process, it must be conveyed that surgical fecal/urinary diversion may become permanent. (See

         Advantages to diversion have long been cited to offer more rapid healing times, shorter hospital stays, and fewer total surgeries in patients who are diverted as compared with those who are not diverted [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47,48

         Temporary nonsurgical fecal diversion devices are also available, including commercial soft tubing products designed for placement in the rectum with an inflatable 40 cc balloon that can be used for up to one month. For this strategy to support the surgical plan, the bowel contents are generally softened or liquefied by way of a bowel regime of laxatives. Alternatively, selected patients may benefit from a short constipating regimen rather than a liquefying one.

         Following thorough debridement and wound bed preparation, fundamental to successful reconstruction of pressure-induced injuries is padding of pressure points with full thickness, well-vascularized skin, and tension-free closure. The requisite bulk, padding, and wound coverage needed for closure of pressure-induced induced injuries are best provided by soft tissue flaps [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,51
         </a>

         Surgeons involved in the care of patients with pressure-induced injuries should ideally be comfortable with several flap options, tailored to each patient and their wound, and each option should also have a "back-up" or second-line option  (

          table 2

         ). Traditionally, musculocutaneous flaps were favored for reconstruction of pressure-induced injuries because of their bulk and ability to conform to large deep defects, in addition to their reliable blood supply from consistent dominant blood vessels. This philosophy has been challenged with an improved understanding of the angiosome theory of skin perfusion. (See

         Reported outcomes of different flaps used for pressure-induced injury sites are variable with a wide range of follow-up times, which has made it difficult to draw conclusions about the efficacy and complications of individual approaches. The literature consists primarily of case series of the use of different flaps for pressure-induced injuries; there are no randomized data comparing various techniques [

          41,53

         Free tissue transfer for reconstruction of pressure-induced injuries is usually reserved for the rare case of ambulatory patients who have had locoregional flap failure with few remaining local reconstructive options for large defects. Free flaps are not sensate. Even if the flap contains a sensory nerve, there is a prolonged duration before any sensation returns, if it returns at all. Free flaps described for this purpose include fasciocutaneous or musculocutaneous options, and include latissimus dorsi, serratus anterior, anterolateral thigh, and tensor fascia lata (TFL) flaps, among others [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. Recipient vessels are commonly the gluteal vessels dissected through a muscle-splitting technique. The deep femoral vessels and their perforators, posterior intercostals, or mobilized inferior epigastric vessels can also be used [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57-59
         </a>
         ]. Some reports describe vein grafts as a solution for short pedicle lengths to reach the defect [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57,59
         </a>
         ]; however, this strategy has higher associated complication rates and is best avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is generally accepted that latissimus dorsi free flaps should not be used as a free flap in patients who are paraplegic, as this patient population depends heavily on upper body strength for mobilization [

However, transferring a partial ("split") latissimus dorsi free flap may be a reasonable alternative to preserve function provided that the defect is not too large for the bulk provided by the partial muscle flap.

          1,56,69,70

          11,71
         </a>
         ]. It is advisable, where possible, to overlap tissue layers by de-epithelializing the leading edge of at least one of the flaps to avoid a single weak suture line between skin and areas of bony debridement [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. These areas will require a longer healing time and possibly further surgery in the case of wound complications. Our preference is to make use of large fasciocutaneous V-to-Y advancements as a first-line option to reduce tension on closure, and also allows for readvancement in the case of recurrence or alternatively a smaller flap within the large flap can be used.

         Musculocutaneous or muscle flaps may be used for large and deep sacral defects for thin patients where fasciocutaneous flaps may be too thin to provide adequate wound coverage or padding or in the case of failure of fasciocutaneous flaps. Muscle flap options include gluteus maximus rotation, advancement, islanding, or transverse-splitting partial gluteal flaps. The latter is preferable in ambulatory patients, as some gluteal function is preserved. All gluteus maximus musculocutaneous/muscle flaps are based on one or both of its dominant vessels, the superior gluteal or inferior gluteal vessels [

         The heel is particularly predisposed to pressure-induced injuries in patients who must stay in bed. The plantar surface of the heel is composed of thick skin, adipose tissue for padding, and layers of connective tissue imparting strength and resistance to pressure and friction. By contrast, the posterior surface of the heel has thinner skin, with little fat overlying the calcaneus to facilitate ankle mobility.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pressure-induced heel injuries are commonly recognized at stage I or II and treated conservatively by pressure off-loading with specially designed boots and attentive wound care. Factors that contribute to formation of deeper heel pressure injuries that may necessitate surgical intervention are prolonged immobilization, diabetes mellitus, overall poor physiological condition, and reduced perfusion (ie, ischemia) of the lower extremity [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76
         </a>
         ]. In an observational study of 155 patients with pressure-induced heel injuries, 83 percent had evidence of peripheral artery disease on noninvasive vascular testing [
         <a href="#rid77">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It is therefore imperative to consider the vascularity of the limb when considering reconstruction of heel ulcers. Wound healing is suboptimal in poorly vascularized limbs, which may lead to wound dehiscence and rapid recurrence of soft tissue defects despite the best efforts of the reconstructive team. Moreover, attempting a free flap reconstruction on an ischemic lower extremity may have serious consequences that include not only flap necrosis, but possibly limb ischemia distal to the site of anastomosis. Thus, we advocate noninvasive vascular mapping of all lower limbs considered for microsurgical reconstruction to evaluate the patency and quality of recipient vessels, and vascular surgery referral, as necessary. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The preoperative evaluation for significant pressure-induced heel injuries must also include radiographic imaging to exclude osteomyelitis. The first step in active surgical treatment is debridement (including calcaneal bone if required). In cases of extensive bony involvement, a partial or complete calcanectomy may be warranted [

         Coverage options for heel wounds include locoregional flaps such as medial plantar artery flaps, reverse sural artery flaps, perforator propeller flaps, and occasionally transposition flaps from surrounding tissues [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78-80
         </a>
         ]. Distal lower extremity flap defects may not be amenable to locoregional reconstruction, and like other traumatic injuries, microsurgical flap coverage is a more frequently indicated reconstructive option for this region compared with other anatomic regions. (See

         Occasionally, an occipital pressure-induced injury is extensive enough to warrant acute surgical intervention. This may consist of debridement followed by appropriate wound care for smaller or less complex injuries, or debridement with flap coverage for larger and more complex wounds. Skin grafts may be used in the presence of a viable soft tissue bed after debridement, especially if the patient is ambulatory. Deeper pressure injuries that expose cranial bone or that are complicated by underlying osteomyelitis will require debridement and coverage with flaps, including locoregional transposition or rotation scalp flaps.

Incisional (prophylactic) negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on a setting of -75 mmHg offers an excellent bolstering effect without applying too much pressure on the suture line. NPWT can be applied using a double-sided hydrogel tape to protect the skin and then covered with NPWT foam cut to size; several commercial incisional NPWT devices are also available for this purpose. Thereafter, the suture line can be cleaned daily with

         We place closed suction drains of 1/4 to 1/2 cm diameter caliber prior to wound closure. These may require routine milking to prevent occlusion. Drains can usually be removed at about two weeks postoperatively, or earlier if drainage is minimal. We generally use a layered closure with a braided absorbable suture, followed by interrupted nylon sutures to the skin. For areas where eversion of skin edges is easy to obtain, staples may also be used, but the leading edge of the flap is almost always closed with everting simple uninterrupted or combination horizontal/vertical mattress sutures (to obtain epidermal and dermal approximation). Wounds are never closed under tension. Sutures or staples are usually left in place for two to three weeks; every other suture/staple can be removed initially, with the remainder removed a few days later.

         For proper wound healing following reconstruction of pressure-induced injury, the inciting pressure should be eliminated from the reconstructed area. This is managed by vigilant attention to patient positioning and frequent repositioning, and mobility limitations to avoid tension on suture lines and flap pedicles. Most surgeons advocate an initial period of complete bed rest followed by gradual mobilization. Evidence is lacking for exact time frames for immobilization, and this is usually left to the surgeon's discretion, but it is usually for about two to four weeks. Much like immobilization, solid evidence for time frames as to when and over what period to initiate reseating is lacking, although it is agreed that it should be undertaken gradually and progressively [

         Pressure-relieving air fluidized or low air loss mattresses have been adopted in many institutions to prevent pressure-induced injury recurrence, but high-quality evidence for their efficacy is still lacking [

          13
         </a>
         ]. Some advocate for managing the patient prone for a period to eliminate pressure during the initial period, but this is difficult for feeding, and its success also depends on the spinal cord level in patients who are paraplegic as well as patient tolerance and compliance. For patients who rely on using a wheelchair, it is also important to adapt a patient's cushioned seat to provide adequate pressure relief, considering the new suture lines and high-risk areas. Frequent evaluation of wounds, pressure areas, and suture lines at the initial mobilization/seating stage is critically important to intervene and prevent complications before their escalation into major concerns, recurrence, and potentially the need for further surgery. The efficacy of various support surfaces and therapies to redistribute pressure is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Prior to surgical management of pressure sores, it is preferable to have a plan as to the ideal rehabilitation program for the patient based on all considerations, including age, socioeconomic factors, family or other support, baseline level of function and employment, domestic circumstances, comorbid factors, and underlying spinal cord level, if applicable. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The patient should be transferred to a facility accustomed to managing their postoperative needs as the focus from acute postoperative care to rehabilitation changes. The multidisciplinary team involved in the perioperative care should remain involved during the rehabilitation process, and follow-up should continue for several months to years postoperatively. Should the focus be too heavily on the acute phase of care, patients can become deconditioned very quickly, prolonging the rehabilitation phase and increasing the risk for complications.

         Reconstructive surgery for pressure-induced injuries is well known for its high complication rates due to patient demographic factors, the presence of multiple comorbidities, significant mobility limitations, and previous failed surgeries. The data below emphasize the need for careful selection of informed and compliant surgical candidates in the context of a well-organized multidisciplinary system where the surgical team is adequately supported to provide surgical closure that has a reasonable chance of durable success. (See

         Different studies cite various complication rates, ranging from 0 to 80 percent with respect to hematoma, wound dehiscence, infection, sepsis, seroma, and partial or total flap loss [

         ]. In a review of 421 flaps performed for 352 patients with ischial, pelvic, sacral, trochanteric, and lower limb pressure sores, the complication rate was 21 percent. The most frequent complication was suture line dehiscence, typically associated with dead space within the wound and shear forces applied to the closure [

          Pressure-induced injuries
         </strong>
         – Pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries are the result of sustained force on soft tissue typically overlying bony prominences, which leads to tissue hypoxia, ischemia, and eventual necrosis. They are common, potentially life-threatening and debilitating complications of severe acute or chronic illness or spinal cord injury. (See

          Stage-based management
         </strong>
         – The management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury depends on the clinical stage  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62903" href="/z/d/graphic/62903.html" rel="external">

         ). Apart from higher injury stage, other indications for surgical management include significant necrosis in the wound, osteomyelitis, wounds causing systemic infection as well as deterioration in the patient's functional status, and persistent nonhealing wounds. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for surgery'

         For stage I and II pressure-induced injuries, treatment is generally conservative with appropriate wound care and elimination of causative factors that led to the initial injury.

         <strong>
          Surgical management
         </strong>
         – Surgical management begins with wound debridement to achieve a viable wound bed devoid of necrotic, ischemic, and infected tissue that will impede healing and increase the risk of wound recurrence. Bedside debridement can be used for selected small pressure-induced injuries that have a clearly delineated eschar. Operative debridement of larger pressure-induced injuries has many advantages, is more thorough, and allows for adequate planning of potential surgical closure options. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Debridement'

          Fecal or urinary diversion
         </strong>
         – Patients with long-standing and deep sacral and ischial pressure-induced injuries may benefit from fecal and sometimes urinary diversion to minimize wound soiling. Diversion improves healing times, hospital stays, and required number of surgeries. For some patients with pressure-induced injuries (eg, paraplegia, incontinence), permanent fecal diversion may facilitate care and potentially improve patient quality of life. Temporary nonsurgical diversion may be an option for some patients. (See

         <strong>
          Negative pressure wound therapy
         </strong>
         – Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a useful adjunct and improves the local wound environment through direct and indirect effects that accelerate healing and reduce time to wound closure. A caveat to implementing NPWT for pressure-induced injuries is potential difficulties ensuring a seal in some anatomical locations (eg, proximity to genitalia and anus). (See

         <strong>
          Reconstruction
         </strong>
         – Definitive reconstruction of pressure-induced injury usually involves creation of a flap. Flap reconstruction can be performed during the same surgery following debridement or in a subsequent procedure depending upon the amount of tissue loss, completeness of debridement, presence of infection (cellulitis, osteomyelitis), the nutritional status and general condition of the patient, and surgeon discretion. Adjunctive orthopedic procedures may be needed in selected populations. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Surgical wound closure'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Adjunctive orthopedic procedures'

         </span>
         The use of locoregional flaps is the standard technique for closure of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129239" href="/z/d/graphic/129239.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Most plastic surgeons favor fasciocutaneous flaps as the initial option for wound coverage. While there are few contraindications in selecting the type of flap, to preserve upper body strength, full muscle latissimus dorsi flaps should not be used in patients who are paraplegic. Specific flap closure techniques for the commonly reported sites for pressure-induced injury (ischium, sacrum, trochanter, heel) are described above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Surgical wound closure'

         While reconstructive surgery offers tremendous benefits when successful, it is well-known for its high rate of complications. Recurrence rates vary widely, likely reflecting patient demographics and comorbidities and the many pressure-induced injury sites. Complications can be reduced with careful perioperative care and rehabilitation within a coordinated multidisciplinary system at centers accustomed to managing these difficult wounds. (See

         <strong>
          Preventing future injury
         </strong>
         – For optimal long-term success following flap reconstruction of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries, it is imperative that inciting sources of pressure are eliminated from the reconstructed area. Most surgeons advocate an initial period of complete bed rest followed by gradual mobilization. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pressure care'
