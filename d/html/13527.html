Over the past few decades, professional allergy societies in the United States have made attempts to reduce variations in practice and identify best approaches. Practice parameters for SCIT have been published, and the approach described in this topic review is consistent with the American guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10981157"><span class="h2">Terminology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An allergen immunotherapy extract is a solution of one or more allergens that is used for immunotherapy. This topic review will use the term "allergen immunotherapy extract" or "allergen extract," although other terms in use include "allergy serum," "allergen vaccine," "allergen solution," and "allergen product" [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The preparation of allergen extracts for use in SCIT, including effective doses, types of extracts, mixing of different allergens, training of compounding personnel, storage and stability, and recording of prescriptions for allergen immunotherapy will be discussed in this topic review. Administration techniques, schedules, and choice of allergens, as well as an overview of the manufacture of allergen extracts are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13526.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous aeroallergen immunotherapy: Accelerated schedules (cluster and rush)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/363.html" rel="external">"Allergen extracts: Composition, manufacture, and labeling"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24981640"><span class="h1">TYPES OF ALLERGEN EXTRACTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several types of allergen stock solutions are available from commercial sources in the United States. The allergen may be in an aqueous solution, a solution containing 50 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8959" href="/d/drug information/8959.html" rel="external">glycerin</a>, in an alum-precipitated form, or lyophilized. The manufacture of allergen extracts is reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/363.html" rel="external">"Allergen extracts: Composition, manufacture, and labeling"</a> and <a class="local">'Dilutions and diluents'</a> below.)</p><p>A specific allergen may only be available in a limited number of forms. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most pollens are available in either aqueous solutions or 50 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8959" href="/d/drug information/8959.html" rel="external">glycerin</a> solutions. Glycerin is a stabilizing and bacteriostatic agent, but it can cause pain at the injection site in a dose-dependent manner. The standardized extracts of house dust mites, cat dander, and grasses are only available in 50 percent glycerin. Some pollens are also available in an alum-precipitated formulation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fungal (mold), fire ant, and cockroach extracts are often available in aqueous or 50 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8959" href="/d/drug information/8959.html" rel="external">glycerin</a> solutions, but only the 50 percent glycerin should be used because solutions containing less glycerin are prone to autodigestion due to the relative abundance of proteolytic enzymes that naturally occur in these substances [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is only one line of alum-precipitated extracts approved in the United States and only pollen extracts are available in this line. Alum-precipitated extracts are less prone to cause systemic reactions due to retarded systemic absorption from the injection site. The disadvantage of the available alum-precipitated extracts is that they contain less allergen than concentrated aqueous or glycerinated pollen extracts, thus limiting the number of extracts that can be combined in an allergen immunotherapy extract and still deliver an optimal dose.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dog extracts exist in aqueous and glycerinated forms, although only the acetone-precipitated (AP dog) (glycerinated) product has been shown to be sufficiently potent to deliver an adequate immunotherapy dose [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The only lyophilized products are the Hymenoptera venoms.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the exceptions mentioned above (AP dog and alum-precipitated pollen extracts), there is no compelling scientific reason to favor one company over another as a source of allergen extracts.</p><p>Glycerinated, aqueous, and alum-precipitated extracts can be mixed, provided there are no compatibility issues. (See <a class="local">'Compatibility of allergen extracts'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2162192"><span class="h2">Standardized</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Standardized extracts are preferred over nonstandardized extracts, although standardized extracts are not available for all allergens. Standardization refers to the way in which an allergen extract is produced and takes into account multiple factors, such as selection and collection of raw materials, extract preparation, storage, validation of assays, and reagents for batch-to-batch control. Standardization is intended to minimize variations in the composition and quality of allergen in the final product. The processes involved in standardization are reviewed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/363.html" rel="external">"Allergen extracts: Composition, manufacture, and labeling", section on 'Standardization of allergen extracts'</a>.)</p><p>Standardized extracts offer the advantage over nonstandardized extracts of more consistent potency, although a certain degree of variability is allowed. However, although they are consistent in content of major allergen or overall allergenicity (depending on which was the basis for standardization), there is no attempt to ensure consistency in the relative contents of minor allergens. Despite these limitations, standardized extracts are preferred over nonstandardized extracts.</p><p>At the time of this review, the available standardized extracts are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cat hair or pelt</strong> (expressed as bioequivalent allergy units [BAU]/mL), which is standardized by the content of the major allergen, Fel d 1.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong><em>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</em></strong><strong> and </strong><strong><em>D. farinae</em></strong> (expressed as allergy units [AU]/mL), which were initially standardized by quantitative skin testing in highly allergic subjects and subsequently standardized to the reference extract by in vitro methods.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Short ragweed</strong> (expressed as weight of extracted material divided by amount of extracting fluid [w/v], but with the content of the major allergen, Amb a 1, listed on the label expressed as FDA units). A concentration of 350 FDA units/mL has been determined to be equivalent to 100,000 AU/mL [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bermuda grass and northern pasture grasses</strong> (Timothy, Kentucky Blue, Perennial Rye, Orchard, Meadow Fescue, Redtop, and Sweet Vernal) expressed as BAU/mL, which were initially standardized by quantitative skin testing in highly allergic subjects and subsequently standardized to the reference extract by in vitro methods.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hymenoptera venoms</strong> (yellow jacket, honey bee, wasp, yellow hornet, and white-faced hornet) are expressed as micrograms of venom protein/mL and standardized on the basis of a venom protein content of 100 mcg/mL for individual species and 300 mcg/mL for the mixed vespids.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H624134685"><span class="h2">Nonstandardized</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The remaining pollens (ie, all tree pollens, weed pollens except short ragweed), animal dander (except cat), insect (eg, cockroach and imported fire ant), and fungal extracts are not standardized. The potency of nonstandardized extracts is expressed as w/v or in terms of protein nitrogen units (PNU). These expressions of potency have been shown to have little or no relationship to allergenic potency. Hence, nonstandardized extracts labeled as the same strength cannot be assumed to be of similar potency, either between companies or on a lot-to-lot basis within a company. This lot-to-lot variation in potency is important when preparing a replacement allergen immunotherapy extract. A more potent extract can lead to a systemic reaction unless the dose is appropriately reduced. When changing from an older to a newer vial of allergen immunotherapy extract, it is customary to reduce the volume of the patient's dose by one-third to one-half (eg, from 0.5 mL of maintenance 0.35 to 0.25 mL), even though the same extracts from the same manufacturer are used to compound the new extract. The dose can then be built back up to the dose the patient was previously receiving. This reduction in dose is done because the fresh vials may be more potent due to gradual degradation of proteins in the old vials or variations in allergen content among different lots of extract. The various units used in labeling allergen extracts are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/363.html" rel="external">"Allergen extracts: Composition, manufacture, and labeling", section on 'Units of measure'</a>.)</p><p>Since nonstandardized and standardized pollen extracts are of similar potency, non-standardized pollen extracts can be presumed to be clinically effective at similar doses to those used for standardized pollen extracts, even though randomized, controlled studies have not been performed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2162127"><span class="h1">DOSING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The effectiveness of SCIT is dose-dependent. The optimal dose or dose range is specific to each type of allergen and varies significantly among allergens. Optimal doses have been determined for many of the major inhalant allergens [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Information about effective doses is presented separately for standardized and nonstandardized allergens  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54949" href="/d/graphic/54949.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69763" href="/d/graphic/69763.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15449532"><span class="h2">Standardized extracts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Doses of individual standardized allergens that produced clinically effective results in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are known for the standardized allergens  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54949" href="/d/graphic/54949.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The following points should be noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In some cases, lower doses that are <strong>ineffective</strong> are known from trial data.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For many of these extracts, no studies have been conducted with the standardized extracts available in the United States. Standardized extracts of short ragweed in the United States do list amounts of Amb a 1 in FDA units (which are equivalent to micrograms) on the label, but the others do not  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54949" href="/d/graphic/54949.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The values in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54949" href="/d/graphic/54949.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69763" href="/d/graphic/69763.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) are based in most cases on analysis of dozens of extracts from all manufacturers in the United States [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. If information about the amount of major allergen in micrograms in a particular lot of extract is not available, then this information about average content can be used instead.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The potencies of the standardized pollen extracts (which are manufactured from relatively pure samples of pollen), as reflected in their allergy units (AU) or bioequivalent allergy units (BAU) values, are approximately 10 times greater in major allergen content compared with standardized extracts of perennial allergens, such as house dust mites and cat.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15449539"><span class="h2">Nonstandardized allergens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data on effective doses and examples of major allergens are given in the table for a number of nonstandardized extracts  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69763" href="/d/graphic/69763.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. It should be noted that the nonstandardized pollens are generally in the same range of potency as the standardized pollens.</p><p>Because of the relatively low content of major allergen in nonstandardized extracts of cockroach, fungi, and aqueous preparations of dog dander, it is uncertain whether clinically effective immunotherapy doses can be attained with these extracts. However, there are fully controlled trials showing effective immunotherapy with <em>Alternaria alternata </em>[<a href="#rid8">8</a>]<em> </em>and <em>Cladosporium herbarum</em> [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], as well as unblinded and/or uncontrolled studies reporting favorable patient outcomes with cockroach [<a href="#rid10">10</a>] and horse dander [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] immunotherapy using available extracts. In contrast, in comparison with conventional extract, only acetone-precipitated (AP) dog extract is sufficiently potent to achieve effective dosing [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15449627"><span class="h1">CREATING A MAINTENANCE ALLERGEN EXTRACT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Available studies about optimal dosing form the basis of recommendations in immunotherapy practice parameters  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78503" href="/d/graphic/78503.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The doses recommended in the practice parameters are based upon data in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54949" href="/d/graphic/54949.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69763" href="/d/graphic/69763.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), literature review, and expert panel clinical experience.</p><p>An allergen immunotherapy extract should be prepared so that the maintenance concentration delivers a dose of each allergen that has been demonstrated to be clinically effective (called the maintenance goal). This is typically delivered in a volume of 0.2 to 0.7 mL, although the lower end of this volume range is preferred if the maintenance solution contains significant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8959" href="/d/drug information/8959.html" rel="external">glycerin</a>. Specifically, extract manufacturers advise administering no more than 0.2 mL of a 50 percent glycerin solution to avoid pain at the injection site [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Allergen immunotherapy dosing is not adjusted for patient size or age. Children have customarily been given the same dose as adults. Some patients may not tolerate this dose due to repeated large local or systemic reactions. In this situation, the patient's highest tolerated dose becomes his/her maintenance dose.</p><p>To prepare a 10 mL vial of Timothy grass maintenance extract, one would proceed as follows: If a 0.5 mL maintenance volume is desired, then a 10 mL vial should contain 20 doses. Based on the recommended effective dose for Timothy grass, which is 3000 BAU the vial should contain 20 x 3000 or 60,000 BAU. Since the Timothy extract comes as 100,000 BAU/mL, 0.6 mL of the full-strength Timothy extract should be placed in the 10 mL vial. The remaining 9.4 mL would be diluent if the patient were only receiving Timothy, or the diluent could be partially replaced by other compatible allergen extracts in appropriate amounts, if the patient required treatment with multiple allergens. This would be the full-strength maintenance extract. Serial dilutions to be used during the build-up phase would then be prepared from this maintenance concentration. (See <a class="local">'Multiple allergen immunotherapy extracts'</a> below.)</p><p>For clinicians who do not wish to prepare patient allergen extracts, "treatment sets" can be prepared and purchased through extract manufacturers. The clinician must write a prescription for the specific allergens and amounts of each that are to be included for that patient's therapy.</p><p>Dosing of Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy and fire ant immunotherapy is somewhat different from that of the aeroallergens and is reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4096.html" rel="external">"Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Technical issues, protocols, adverse effects, and monitoring", section on 'Dosing'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4092.html" rel="external">"Stings of imported fire ants: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment", section on 'Venom immunotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Recommendations have been made for creating maintenance allergen extracts from nonstandardized extracts, although these are based upon limited data:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For nonstandardized pollens, a target dose of 0.5 mL of a 1:100 or 1:200 weight/volume (w/v) solution is reasonable, which is achieved by adding 1 mL of the full-strength (1:10 or 1:20 w/v) extract to a 10 mL vial [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For nonstandardized fungal (mold) and cockroach extracts, only glycerinated extracts can be recommended and amounts added should be greater than for pollens [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It is uncertain if sufficient amounts of these weak extracts can be administered to be clinically effective. Many clinicians will add the maximum amount possible. These extracts should not be combined with pollen, house dust mite, or dog or cat dander extracts, nor should fungal and cockroach allergen extracts be combined in the same vial [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Only acetone-precipitated dog extract (AP dog) can be recommended for immunotherapy. AP dog comes as a 1:100 w/v stock solution which contains, on average, 140 mcg of Can f 1/mL [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. With an effective dose of 15 mcg of Can f 1, this would mean adding 2.1 mL of the stock solution to the 10 mL vial.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15449436"><span class="h2">Multiple allergen immunotherapy extracts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients placed on immunotherapy are sensitized to multiple allergens [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. In the United States, the use of immunotherapy solutions containing multiple allergens is the rule, while in many other countries, patients are treated with the single allergen to which the patient shows greatest clinical sensitivity. Both methods have been shown to be effective in randomized, controlled studies [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>]. However, direct, head-to-head studies comparing the two approaches are lacking. In a large, randomized trial of patients receiving grass SCIT, both monosensitized and polysensitized patients benefited to a similar degree from monotherapy with grass pollen extract [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/361.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: Indications and efficacy"</a>.)</p><p>The table shows the effective dose ranges, examples of commercially available extracts (in the United States), recommended doses per maintenance injection, amount to add to 10 mL maintenance vial, and mixing limitations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef102244" href="/d/graphic/102244.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p>To prepare a 10 mL vial containing multiple compatible allergens, calculations are performed for each allergen and then diluent is used to fill the vial to 10 mL.

Therefore, they should not be mixed with each other or with other allergens in the same treatment vials. It is unclear if degraded allergens are less effective for immunotherapy, but there is also a safety issue. Degradation can reduce the ability of allergens to react with allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), so there is a potential risk that a patient who was receiving degraded allergens and is then exposed to a new vial of freshly mixed allergens could suffer a systemic allergic reaction.</p><p>The following applies to mixing of extracts within treatment vials:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fungal and cockroach extracts should <strong>not</strong> be mixed with pollen, house dust mite, or animal danders [<a href="#rid26">26-28</a>] or with each other [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

The expiration date of the maintenance concentration of an allergen immunotherapy extract is that of the earliest expiration date for any of the component allergen extracts. Dilutions of the allergen immunotherapy extract degrade more readily, and the greater the dilution, the more rapid the loss of potency.
