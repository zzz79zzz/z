The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of lead poisoning are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6491.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6494.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EXPOSURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children are exposed to lead in a variety of ways. Despite the removal of lead from gasoline and paint in the late 1970s, ingestion of chips and dust from the continued presence of lead paint remains the primary source of lead poisoning in children. In addition, contaminated soil from gasoline emissions continues as an important source. Other important pediatric exposures include elevated maternal blood lead levels (BLLs) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, food, water, and/or air contamination and excess lead in children's, parent, or primary caregiver occupations; toys; cosmetics; and herbal/ayurvedic remedies.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Prenatal exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends blood lead screening for pregnant women with important risk factors for lead exposure  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86038" href="/d/graphic/86038.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/446.html" rel="external">"Prenatal care: Initial assessment", section on 'Lead level'</a>.) </p><p>A maternal BLL over 5 mcg/dL is a marker of significant exposure to lead above background levels for pregnant women in the United States population. Because lead crosses the placenta readily, and a toxicologic threshold for adverse effects to the fetus or newborn has <strong>not</strong> been identified, maternal BLLs elevated above background warrant follow-up testing in the mother during and after pregnancy and in the newborn infant. Providers for pregnant women with elevated BLLs should ensure that the maternal lead level is known by the provider managing the newborn infant. Levels of both the mother and infant should be documented in both of their medical records. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6494.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Management", section on 'Prenatal exposure'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2773.html" rel="external">"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults", section on 'Pregnancy and breastfeeding'</a>.)</p><p>Lead exposure during fetal development may result from mobilization of bone lead stored from past exposure into the maternal bloodstream and/or from direct elevation of maternal BLLs caused by acute or chronic environmental lead exposure during pregnancy [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In utero lead exposure is associated with impairment of postnatal neurodevelopment with an increased risk for developmental delay, lowering of IQ, and behavioral abnormalities [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The United States Preventative Services Taskforce (USPSTF) has found "inadequate evidence regarding the accuracy of questionnaires and other clinical prediction tools to identify asymptomatic pregnant women with elevated blood lead levels" [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In contrast, the USPSTF failed to find harm in screening or treatment of pregnant women with elevated BLLs. We support screening of pregnant women, especially those who have risk factors for lead exposure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Ingestion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ingestion of lead-containing dust is the primary source of lead exposure in children [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The major sources of lead dust are oxidation and/or mechanical disruption of lead-containing paint and soil. In addition, lead dust may be carried into the child's environment on the clothing or skin of children and adults who have hobbies or occupations that expose them to lead  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53953" href="/d/graphic/53953.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) or who live in households that have been inadequately decontaminated. Additionally, other sources of lead in children include toys, cosmetics and herbal/ayurvedic remedies often from sources outside of the United States.</p><p>The normal progression of developmental skills and the behavior of young children places them at risk for lead ingestion in lead-containing environments. Young children spend much of their time on the floor as they learn to crawl and then to walk; during this time, their hands often are in direct contact with lead-contaminated dust or soil. Young children also have normal hand-to-mouth and mouthing behaviors, especially when they are teething (between 6 and 24 months), that increase the likelihood of ingesting lead-containing paint, dust, or soil.</p><p>Alternatively, children with intellectual and developmental disabilities may continue mouthing behaviors beyond two years of age. Likewise, these children are more likely to have pica (eating of nonfood items), which places them at increased risk of ingestion of lead-contaminated products [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Paint</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite the early 1900 publication of the significant toxicity of lead, lead-based paint has continued as the major source of lead exposure for children in the United States [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The lead content of dust in homes is typically highest in window wells and windowsills because of the mechanical disruption that occurs with raising and lowering the windows [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>].</p><p>Before 1955, the lead content of white house paint was as high as 50 percent [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. After 1955, the lead content of paint was reduced, but lead was not eliminated until 1978, when the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) restricted lead content to 0.06 percent for any paint intended to be used on residential surfaces, toys, or furniture [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Despite the elimination of lead from newly manufactured paint, paint that was applied to homes before 1978 remains in place. A United States housing survey performed from 2005 to 2006 found that over 3 million homes with children under six years of age had lead-based paint hazards with over a third residing in low-income households [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. The prevalence is much higher in resource-limited countries or resource-rich countries with poor environmental laws. For example, one study found high lead levels in paints in China (116,200 ppm), Cameroon (500,000 ppm), South Africa (189,000 ppm), Thailand (505,716 ppm), and Brazil (170,258.4 ppm) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Soil</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before lead was removed from petroleum products in the United States, automobile exhaust emitted millions of pounds of lead into the environment each month [<a href="#rid6">6,15,16</a>]. The elimination of lead from gasoline was a successful nationwide primary prevention measure [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Between 1976 and 1989, the amount of lead consumed in gasoline in the United States decreased by 50 percent  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60319" href="/d/graphic/60319.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), and BLL decreased by 37 percent. The European Union banned leaded gasoline in 2000. The World Bank and the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development called for worldwide elimination of lead from petroleum products in 1998 [<a href="#rid18">18</a>] and worldwide elimination is almost complete.</p><p>Lead found in soil may also be the result of industrial environmental releases from lead-zinc mining and battery smelters within and outside the United States. Studies from Bangladesh, Palestine, Vietnam, and Serbia have correlated childhood elevated BLLs with close vicinity to industrial sites [<a href="#rid19">19-22</a>].</p><p>Contamination of the soil surrounding residential areas can be an important source of lead dust inside the home as well as for the child who plays outdoors [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. Soil contamination typically is restricted to 2 to 5 cm below the surface if the soil is undisturbed [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Soil contamination may be increased in homes at which car repair activities are performed in the home or yard [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In addition, soil that is brought in for raised garden beds may contain lead and should be tested prior to its use. The accepted safety standard for lead in bare soil is &lt;400 parts per million (ppm) for play areas, and &lt;1200 ppm for nonplay areas. Information about testing soil for lead can be obtained from the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Flead%2Fforms%2Flead-hotline-national-lead-information-center&amp;token=i%2BIXc%2FXZ4tV98nsTZzdmzWxGbhZ29foif8stPYPqAKns%2BSUBaMKp3%2F9DTbzaJylyLiUBPcyKSsKwWvXikE43M%2FKw1jTePRYInQS3lzvTiw0%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6493" target="_blank">National Lead Information Center</a>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Water</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lead in drinking water probably is absorbed more completely than lead in food and may account for more than 50 percent of the lead that is ingested by infants [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Municipal water supplies are controlled and regulated to prevent contamination at the source [<a href="#rid28">28</a>], although these precautions sometimes fail [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. However, once the water reaches the home, it is rarely regulated, tested, or treated. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action level for lead in water is 15 parts per billion (ppb) although this is not a health-based standard but one that is based upon old data for the feasibility of water companies to achieve the level. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that this number should be much lower and recommends 1 ppb in schools. The EPA is in the process of reviewing and revising the Lead and Copper Rule; however, it is unknown when, or if, a completion date can be anticipated.</p><p>Most lead contamination of household water is caused by copper plumbing that is joined with lead solder [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Lead pipes may contribute to lead contamination, but lead plumbing usually is old enough to have its inner surface coated with mineral deposits, which prevent leaching of lead into the water supply. However, disruption of the pipes or first use of water that has been standing in the system can result in higher levels of lead in the water. Recommendations include running cold water for 10 minutes prior to first use in the morning before consumption. However, adherence to this recommendation is likely low in practice.</p><p>Other potential sources for lead contamination include storage cisterns, sources of water that are outside the municipal water districts, and aging water coolers or water heaters, particularly in areas where the water has a relatively low pH [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Acidity and elevated temperature increase the ability of the water to leach lead from the solder or pipes, as does standing in the pipes for extended periods of time (eg, overnight).</p><p>Additional information about lead in drinking water is available on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwater.epa.gov%2Fdrink%2Finfo%2Flead%2Findex.cfm&amp;token=TBjD2ZlbdvrjcJ8xGFYHGPu73j4c7Y%2FSZsHUXDjWQOMtB4dzEffCVcmbQFIqSHWfx%2BDcFv7bOMRu9LCgC4AysQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6493" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Food</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A careful dietary history in children with lead poisoning may help to identify dietary sources of lead exposure [<a href="#rid31">31-33</a>]. Although uncommon, food can be contaminated with lead during production, processing, packaging, preparation, or storage [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>].</p><p>Produce that is grown in lead-containing soil or exposed to exhaust from vehicles that use lead-containing fuel can be contaminated [<a href="#rid6">6,27,34,36</a>]. Although lead has been banned from petroleum products in the United States, the soil along certain major transportation routes and in urban cooperative gardens may still be contaminated with significant amounts of lead. Lead-based petroleum products continue to be used in many resource-limited agricultural countries from which food is imported.</p><p>Canned food can become contaminated with lead if lead solder is used in the canning process. The lead is leached into the food during oxidation, which begins to occur once the can is opened, particularly if the food is acidic. However, lead was banned from use, including imported products, in 1995.</p><p>Food may be contaminated during preparation by the addition of lead-contaminated spices (purchased in other countries and not tested for purity) [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. Food also may be contaminated with lead if it is stored, prepared, or served in lead-glazed pottery, leaded-crystal glassware, lead-containing cooking vessels [<a href="#rid39">39</a>], or plastic bags decorated with red or yellow lead-containing pigments (eg, bread bags) [<a href="#rid34">34,40,41</a>]. Lastly, boiling water to reduce infectious agents may concentrate the lead in water and increase the risk for poisoning.</p><p>In recent years, growing concerns have been raised regarding lead and other heavy metals in baby foods [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has responded with instituting the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Ffood%2Fmetals-and-your-food%2Fcloser-zero-action-plan-baby-foods&amp;token=mfSXbgKM84AmH4N%2ByaYk5%2FVPPMK83RB5Ao8np9OrxAFMxmThGLem6WlDfxsGiwF9MDe3U6ZGnpwX0p4Rl9FYfdZ39bCvtl%2BJRRXlxt0deP0%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6493" target="_blank">Closer to Zero</a> campaign to assess and recommend changes to the allowable levels of metals in baby foods.

It is unknown when or if any new standards will be forthcoming.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11089643"><span class="h4">Breastfeeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Levels of lead in breast milk are up to 3 percent of BLLs in the mother and are directly correlated with maternal blood lead concentration [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Based upon estimates of infant blood level elevation occurring from breast milk ingestion, breastfeeding should be encouraged for all mothers with a venous BLL &lt;40 mcg/dL  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58503" href="/d/graphic/58503.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). In the United States, infants whose mothers have a BLL ≥40 mcg/dL should not breastfeed initially. The mother should be instructed to pump her breast milk and discard it. Breastfeeding should be instituted if the maternal BLL falls below 40 mcg/dL.</p><p>Whether the risks of breastfeeding, for mothers with a BLL ≥40 mcg/dL who live in a resource-limited country, outweigh the benefits is uncertain. Continuation of breastfeeding is based upon whether there is evidence that breast milk is contributing to infant lead levels on the follow-up maternal and infant screening. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6494.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Management", section on 'Breastfeeding'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2773.html" rel="external">"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults", section on 'Pregnancy and breastfeeding'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10106941"><span class="h3">Leaded objects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ingestion of leaded objects (eg, fishing weights, curtain weights, buckshot, recreational items, folk remedies) in children may be associated with a sudden acute rise in BLLs with the potential to cause lead encephalopathy and death [<a href="#rid43">43-46</a>]. However, chronic exposure from these objects may also result in lead exposures from ingestion of lead dust. Children with sensory disorders are especially at risk if they chronically use these objects for calming purposes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Inhalation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inhalational exposures to lead can cause elevated lead levels due to direct contact by small particles with lung capillaries and from ingestion at the same time. The exposure of children in the United States to lead via inhalation decreased after the elimination of lead from automobile gasoline products in 1978. However, children who live near industrial plants where lead is used, smelted, or mined, and children who live in countries that have not banned lead from petroleum products may continue to be exposed by this route [<a href="#rid23">23-26</a>]. Researchers from North Carolina have continued to document take-home exposures and elevated BLLs in children of lead oxide manufacturing employees [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Children also may be exposed to lead through inhalation during home renovation or if they or their parents/primary caregivers engage in hobbies that involve the use, melting, or spraying of lead-containing products (eg, target shooting at indoor firing ranges  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53953" href="/d/graphic/53953.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid11">11,48,49</a>]). A pilot study in Nigeria was able to document declining BLLs in children with outreach and education to miners as well as supplying wet wipes for cleaning lead dust in the homes [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Children's products and toys</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Toys that are commonly mouthed by children with elevated BLLs should be tested for lead as part of the home investigation. Children's products and toys provide another potential route for lead exposure. Lead may be present in any of the following forms [<a href="#rid51">51,52</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Paint on the surface of the product</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pigment throughout the product</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In jewelry (eg, pewter bracelets)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In vinyl or plastic (eg, bibs, backpacks, car seats, lunch boxes)</p><p></p><p>The lead in these products is not absorbed through intact skin and cannot be inhaled if the toy is undamaged and intact. The risk of lead poisoning from these products is low unless there is significant mouthing, chewing, or swallowing by children or the product is damaged or deteriorating [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p>The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008 reduces the permissible lead content of toys and children's products from 0.06 percent (600 ppm) lead by weight to 0.03 percent (300 ppm) by 2009, and ≤0.01 percent (100 ppm) by 2012 [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].

However, the efficacy of aggressive environmental remediation largely is unproven, the methods are controversial, and the costs are high. It is known that household educational interventions such as dust control and soil abatement may not be effective in reducing BLLs as a population health measure [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. In addition, no studies have reported on cognitive gains with remediation. That said, studies evaluate BLLs after the child has already been exposed, whereas remediation is more likely to be beneficial before the exposure. Additionally, these studies do not account for other sources that may result in elevated BLLs. Nonetheless, complete removal of lead from the child's environment is considered to be the only effective preventive measure and treatment for reducing the lead body burden, but it must occur prior to the child’s exposure to prevent harm [<a href="#rid65">65</a>].</p><p>Family education regarding methods to decrease exposure and absorption is recommended for all children with childhood lead poisoning. Education is the major intervention in the management of children with any elevated BLL [<a href="#rid61">61</a>].

While the CDC and AAP recommend home investigations with BLL &gt;3.5 mcg/dL (0.14 micromol/L) [<a href="#rid67">67</a>], this may not be available in every locality or state. Thus, the practicing physician may need to use other resources to fully evaluate the source of the elevated BLL [<a href="#rid9">9,68</a>].

As an example, one study found a sensitivity of 26 percent and specificity of 72 percent with the use of the questionnaire [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. Thus, clinicians should consider all aspects of the patient evaluation when deciding about lead screening in these patients. Further questioning regarding hobbies (eg, firing ranges, self-manufacturing of ammunition or lead weights), use of ethnic spices despite purchasing in the United States, and alternative places where children spend time may result in a positive history. When in doubt, the clinician should opt to test for lead exposures.

In a survey where parents'/primary caregivers’ answers about the age of their home were compared with information in tax assessor records, only 52 percent of those living in housing built before 1950 accurately identified their home as such [<a href="#rid70">70</a>].

Well-designed studies are difficult to perform because the expense of lead abatement prohibits a study large enough to document a clear benefit. However, treatment of elevated BLLs in children should focus on the removal of the source of lead exposure, as studies have shown that lead levels decrease significantly when the source is ameliorated. However, preventing the neurodevelopmental consequences can be optimized by preventing the initial exposure from occurring.

Information was gathered before, within 6 weeks of, and 6 to 12 months after the intervention; 2682 dwellings were treated and had final results. Additional data were collected two and three years after the intervention for approximately 40 percent of the dwellings. Interior intervention strategies ranged from cleaning and spot painting to full lead removal. The exterior building was treated in 70 percent of dwellings (eg, paint stabilization, paint removal). Soil or site work (eg, application of mulch/seed/sod/plants, soil removal, structure removal) was conducted at 13 percent of dwellings. The following findings were noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lead hazard control activities reduced the floor, window sill, and window trough dust lead levels compared with preintervention levels (by 78 percent, 89 percent, and 95 percent, respectively); reduced levels were maintained for at least three years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>All interior strategies resulted in decreased average floor dust levels.

While not all groups had statistical changes to their BLLs, non-Hispanic Black children had substantially decreased BLLs after home lead removal. This is most likely due to this cohort living in homes with higher baseline lead and having higher BLLs at the beginning of the observations. Neurobehavioral improvements with abatement after exposure did not occur, which supports the need for primary prevention of lead exposures in children.</p><p>Attempts to remove existing lead-containing paint from surfaces can create more lead dust if not done properly, increasing the risk for lead exposure and causing at least temporary elevation of BLL [<a href="#rid11">11,73,77,78</a>].

This remediation is considered temporary because over time, lead dust will reaccumulate because of further oxidation and mechanical disruption of the lead-based paint. Home restoration or remodeling of the home will re-expose the lead paint. Nonetheless, interim control strategies have resulted in decreased lead dust content and modest declines in the BLL of resident children 9 to 15 months after the intervention [<a href="#rid8">8,79-83</a>].

In addition, some hospitals have medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation. Whenever available, these are invaluable resources to help in the diagnosis and management of ingestions or overdoses. Contact information for poison centers around the world is provided separately.

Despite the removal of lead from gasoline and paint, lead-based paint continues as the major source of lead exposure for children in the United States. Soil continues to be a common source of exposure, as well. (See <a class="local">'Exposure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other important pediatric exposures include elevated maternal blood lead levels (BLLs) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, food (including spices), water, air contamination, and excess lead in toys. Other increasingly common or known sources include parental occupations, hobbies and ethnic practices such as cosmetics and remedies from other countries. (See <a class="local">'Exposure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary prevention</strong> – Primary prevention of childhood lead poisoning involves the removal of lead-based hazards from the environments of children (eg, lead-painted surfaces, including windows, lead-contaminated soil, lead-soldered pipes) prior to the child’s exposure. Ideally, this removal would occur prior to the child entering the contaminated environment because remediation can increase the risk for poisoning, as well. Discussions with expecting parents/primary caregivers and, after delivery, prior to nursery discharge have the potential to identify and eliminate lead sources in the home and to prevent the risk of elevated BLLs in the future. (See <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Secondary prevention</strong> – Secondary prevention involves early detection of lead-poisoned children through appropriate questionnaire screening, lead testing, and minimizing further lead exposure and absorption  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56262 graphicRef63418" href="/d/graphic/56262.html" rel="external">table 4A-B</a>). However, knowing the inaccuracies of the questionnaire screening is important; providers should lean towards screening children in equivocal cases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2872.html" rel="external">"Screening tests in children and adolescents", section on 'Lead poisoning'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tertiary prevention</strong> – Tertiary prevention reduces the morbidity associated with lead intoxication through chelation of lead from the blood and soft tissues of an exposed child. Chelation can reduce the immediate toxicity associated with acute lead ingestion but has limited ability to reverse the neurocognitive effects of chronic exposure. It is important to note that the best treatment is removing the source of lead from the child’s environment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6494.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abatement</strong> – Attempts to remove existing lead-containing paint from surfaces can create more lead dust if not done properly, increasing the risk for lead exposure and causing at least temporary elevation of BLLs in family members. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the EPA, and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have established guidelines for the safe removal of lead-based paint, which can be accessed <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fportal.hud.gov%2Fhudportal%2FHUD%3Fsrc%3D%2Fprogram_offices%2Fhealthy_homes%2Flbp%2Fhudguidelines&amp;token=4ejSo8MChecAEkGIJB3orF4pBaMLRrLMiVJh98BRE%2BUKe67FRGAhmfWgpbzThNwc0o763tzrG5rM8xe8hZu%2B5fr3j792MzGDaFqKIRbE9y0y3ngVZaUGZPXo%2BS5z5G7f&amp;TOPIC_ID=6493" target="_blank">here</a>. (See <a class="local">'Abatement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Safe removal of environmental lead is a costly process. However, because the identification of lead intoxicated children in the United States is incomplete and the treatment of lead intoxicated children cannot reverse the neurocognitive effects, environmental remediation remains the gold standard for prevention and should be considered prior to exposure. (See <a class="local">'Abatement funding'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Education and dust control</strong> – Families who are unwilling or unable to have their homes professionally abated should undergo education regarding ways to diminish their child's exposure to lead and to control dust in their household  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68214" href="/d/graphic/68214.html" rel="external">table 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82132" href="/d/graphic/82132.html" rel="external">table 6</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82254" href="/d/graphic/82254.html" rel="external">table 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54388" href="/d/graphic/54388.html" rel="external">table 8</a>). However, the benefits of these interventions are unclear.
