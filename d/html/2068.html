         The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) bind with high affinity to the estrogen receptor and have estrogen agonist and antagonist properties that vary depending upon the individual target organ [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2

         ]. The factors that determine the variable estrogen receptor agonist and antagonist activity of SERMs are not fully defined but are under active study. (See

The use of SERMs for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis will be discussed here. Their role in breast cancer prevention is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Patients with the highest risk of fracture are the ones most likely to benefit from drug therapy. Fracture risk is determined by a combination of bone mineral density (BMD) and clinical risk factors. Selecting patients at high risk of fracture for osteoporosis therapy is reviewed in detail separately. (See

         <strong>
          prevention

          raloxifene
         </a>
         are reasonable options. There are nonskeletal considerations with raloxifene that may play an important role in the selection of postmenopausal women for therapy: a reduction in breast cancer risk, but an increase in thromboembolic events and hot flashes, and no apparent effect on heart disease or the endometrium. Raloxifene inhibits bone resorption and reduces the risk of vertebral fracture, and it is our selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of choice because it has eight-year safety and efficacy data and also reduces the risk of breast cancer. Raloxifene is usually chosen for osteoporosis prevention when there is an independent need for breast cancer prophylaxis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2064.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of the management of low bone mass and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Bazedoxifene (available in Europe and Japan) has similar efficacy as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9593" href="/z/d/drug information/9593.html" rel="external">
          raloxifene
         </a>
         in preventing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, there are few long-term safety data, and it has not been adequately studied for breast cancer prevention.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen is a combination drug available in some countries for the treatment of hot flashes and the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus. Although this combination is an option for menopausal women who have bothersome hot flashes (prohibiting the use of bazedoxifene alone or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9593" href="/z/d/drug information/9593.html" rel="external">
          raloxifene
         </a>
         ) and who are not candidates for or are intolerant of bisphosphonates, the absence of long-term fracture and safety data tempers our enthusiasm for bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen. In addition, the effect of bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen on breast cancer risk is unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
         We favor bisphosphonates over SERMs for the
         <strong>
          treatment
         </strong>
         of osteoporosis because they have greater efficacy than SERMs in reducing nonspine and hip fractures [

          Raloxifene
         </a>
         is a reasonable alternative to bisphosphonates for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (low bone mineral density [BMD, T score &lt;-2.5] and no fragility fractures) who cannot tolerate or are not candidates for any bisphosphonates or for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are also at high risk for invasive breast cancer. We prefer raloxifene to bazedoxifene because it has long-term safety and efficacy data and because it has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer. (See

         Bazedoxifene is available in Europe and Japan for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk for fracture. It is not available as a stand-alone drug in the United States; however, it is available in combination with conjugated estrogen (see
         <a class="local">
          'Bazedoxifene-conjugated estrogen'

         A theoretical advantage of combination of bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen would be to relieve estrogen deficiency symptoms and prevent bone loss, while avoiding withdrawal bleeding and estrogen-induced breast tenderness. This combination is an option, therefore, for women with an intact uterus who have hot flashes (prohibiting the use of bazedoxifene alone or

However, the absence of long-term fracture and safety data tempers our enthusiasm for bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen. In addition, the effect of bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen on breast cancer risk is unknown.

         Estrogen prevents bone loss and fracture. The protective effect has been documented for all types of postmenopausal hormone therapy (unopposed estrogen, combined estrogen-progestin, different estrogen and progestin formulations, different routes of administration [oral versus transdermal], and different patterns of administration [cyclic versus continuous]). These studies are reviewed in detail separately. (See

         Although we no longer consider estrogen a first-line therapy for osteoporosis prevention in older postmenopausal women (over age 60 years), since data from the Women's Health Initiative suggest that estrogen-progestin therapy reduces fracture risk at a cost of increases in the incidence of breast cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and venous thromboembolism (VTE), the benefit/risk profile of hormone replacement therapy may vary for women based upon their time since menopause. Estimates of the absolute risks and benefits of estrogen (either alone or combined with progestin) in women starting treatment between ages 50 to 59 years and the variety of estrogen and progestin combinations are reviewed separately.

         <a href="#rid49">

The greatest improvement in BMD was seen with the formulation of bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen that contained the lowest dose of bazedoxifene (10 mg) combined with the highest dose of conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg). These results are not surprising, given the known beneficial effects of conjugated estrogen on BMD; the lowest dose of bazedoxifene did not negate these effects.

         In women who were more than five years postmenopause, formulations of bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen containing bazedoxifene 10 or 20 mg with conjugated estrogen 0.45 or 0.625 mg resulted in greater increases in lumbar spine BMD than

The primary endpoint for the first three years of the five-year trial was radiographic vertebral fractures.

Compared with raloxifene trials, the lasofoxifene trial showed similar reductions in vertebral fractures and risk of ER-positive breast cancer and similar increases in the risk of thromboembolic events, hot flashes, and leg cramps. After five years, lasofoxifene was associated with a decrease in nonvertebral fractures, whereas raloxifene has not been shown to have any effect. Neither selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) reduces the risk of hip fracture [

         Although lasofoxifene decreased the risk of major CHD and stroke, the number of events in these categories was small and the confidence intervals wide, suggesting that studies in a high-risk group (larger number of CHD events) are warranted to confirm these findings. Lasofoxifene has not been studied in women with CHD or its risk factors. In the

         <a href="#rid67">
          67

In addition, lasofoxifene use was associated with a significant increase in cystic echotexture on transvaginal ultrasound (due to benign cystic atrophy), endometrial hypertrophy, vaginal bleeding, and uterine polyps. In contrast, raloxifene has not been shown to increase endometrial thickness or vaginal bleeding.
