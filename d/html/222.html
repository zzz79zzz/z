According to two reviews of orthopedic management in the primary care setting , broken toes account for approximately 9 percent of fractures treated [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Of these, over 60 to 75 percent involve the smaller toes [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Although often dismissed as inconsequential, toe fractures that are improperly managed can lead to significant pain and disability. Treatment is generally straightforward, with excellent outcomes.</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation and management of toe fractures in adults.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13793.html" rel="external">"Overview of foot anatomy and biomechanics and assessment of foot pain in adults", section on 'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a>.)</p><p>By convention, toes and their respective metatarsals are numbered from one (great toe) through five (little toe). The second through fifth toes typically have three phalanges, while the great toe has two. Lesser toes, especially the fifth, may occasionally have only two phalanges  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 graphicRef61079 graphicRef71857" href="/z/d/graphic/78924.html" rel="external">figure 1A-C</a>).</p><p>Tendons and ligaments insert at the bases of each phalanx  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102228" href="/z/d/graphic/102228.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108648" href="/z/d/graphic/108648.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108650" href="/z/d/graphic/108650.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108651" href="/z/d/graphic/108651.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). The forces exerted by these structures may contribute to displacement of fracture fragments. Tendons, joint capsule, or other soft tissues may sometimes become interposed between fracture fragments, rendering them irreducible except by an open surgical approach.</p><p>The plantar digital artery and nerve pass together along each side of each toe deep to the plantar surface  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93192" href="/z/d/graphic/93192.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). Each toe also has a pair of dorsal digital arteries and nerves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102228" href="/z/d/graphic/102228.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108653" href="/z/d/graphic/108653.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). The dorsal neurovascular structures are generally smaller and less significant than the ones on the plantar surface, but there is some variation among individuals, particularly with the first (great) toe. It is unusual for the neurovascular bundle to be injured as a consequence of a toe fracture, unless the fracture is open (eg, lawnmower injuries) or caused by a serious crush injury.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common causes of toe fractures are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Axial loading (eg, stubbing a toe)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abduction injury, classically involving the fifth digit with a "night-walker" fracture</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Crush injury from a falling object</p><p></p><p>Less commonly, joint hyperextension or hyperflexion can lead to spiral or avulsion fractures. Crush injuries are more likely to involve soft tissue and neurovascular damage [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients usually present for evaluation because of pain, difficulty walking, or inability to fit comfortably into a shoe. In patients with sensory neuropathy (eg, due to diabetes), presentation may be delayed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1749.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the diabetic foot"</a>.)</p><p>Ecchymosis and swelling are usually present and develop within the first few hours after injury. Palpation along the digit frequently reveals point tenderness at the fracture site. However, the toe is often diffusely swollen and tender, making it difficult to pinpoint the fracture location by examination alone.</p><p>With displaced fractures and dislocations, deformity of the toe is usually apparent. Rotational deformity is assessed by examining the orientation of the nail bed of the fractured toe. Rotational deformity is present if the nail bed does not lie in the same plane as that of the corresponding toe on the opposite foot [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>In all cases, capillary refill should be assessed and the skin of the digit carefully inspected looking for lacerations and devitalized skin. Any wound should be carefully examined to rule out communication with the fracture site (ie, an open fracture). Devitalized skin may slough and convert a closed fracture into an open one. Injury to surrounding soft tissue including the nail and nail bed can occur, particularly with crush injuries. Subungual hematoma is often a marker of an underlying distal phalanx fracture [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Paronychia following minor trauma suggests fracture of the underlying phalanx; radiographs should be obtained in such circumstances [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6335.html" rel="external">"Subungual hematoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5574.html" rel="external">"Paronychia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1521433850"><span class="h2">Plain radiographs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Suspected phalangeal fractures and dislocations should be evaluated with plain radiographs, including anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70754 graphicRef82505 graphicRef61555" href="/z/d/graphic/70754.html" rel="external">image 1A-C</a>). The lateral view is often difficult to read due to overlying structures  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82505" href="/z/d/graphic/82505.html" rel="external">image 1B</a>). Non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures of the toes are common  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50007" href="/z/d/graphic/50007.html" rel="external">image 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73599" href="/z/d/graphic/73599.html" rel="external">image 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62850" href="/z/d/graphic/62850.html" rel="external">image 4</a>). Distal phalanx fractures, which often result from crush injuries  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108682" href="/z/d/graphic/108682.html" rel="external">image 5</a>), are common as well  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81982" href="/z/d/graphic/81982.html" rel="external">image 6</a>). Spiral fractures often demonstrate angulation, rotation, and shortening  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81790" href="/z/d/graphic/81790.html" rel="external">image 7</a>), and may be comminuted  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108680" href="/z/d/graphic/108680.html" rel="external">image 8</a>). Angulation and displacement may occur with transverse fractures  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108684" href="/z/d/graphic/108684.html" rel="external">image 9</a>), but these fractures are generally more stable.</p><p>Foot trauma often causes a fracture of more than one phalanx or toe  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108679" href="/z/d/graphic/108679.html" rel="external">image 10</a>). Therefore, it is important to read each radiograph systematically, and not to stop reading after the first fracture site is identified. Images of adjacent phalanges and toes should be carefully examined for evidence of fractures. Toe fractures are often comminuted  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108680" href="/z/d/graphic/108680.html" rel="external">image 8</a>), particularly those of distal phalanges  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50747" href="/z/d/graphic/50747.html" rel="external">image 11</a>). Intra-articular fractures are also relatively common  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56400" href="/z/d/graphic/56400.html" rel="external">image 12</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108679" href="/z/d/graphic/108679.html" rel="external">image 10</a>) and are at higher risk for long-term complications such as arthritis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2479182852"><span class="h2">Ultrasound</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US) is becoming a more widely used imaging modality for the diagnosis of fractures [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The highly reflective interface between bone and soft tissue enables the assessment of the most superficial bone contours, including toe phalanges [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Cortical discontinuities as small as 1 mm can be identified with high-resolution transducers [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], which allows for the diagnosis of occult fractures (ie, not visible on plain radiograph) at the bedside. Findings on MSK US that strongly suggest long bone fracture include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cortical disruption  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef120437" href="/z/d/graphic/120437.html" rel="external">image 13</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Edema (appears as hypoechoic bulge over injured cortex)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased Doppler blood flow at fracture site  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef120672" href="/z/d/graphic/120672.html" rel="external">image 14</a>)</p><p></p><p>The "cap" sign seen on transverse view is additional ultrasound evidence of fracture. This sign appears in the setting of cortical step-off and consists of a hyperechoic line that appears just above the curvilinear-appearing hyperechoic cortex  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef120671" href="/z/d/graphic/120671.html" rel="external">image 15</a>).</p><p>Ultrasound examination of the foot is best completed with the patient supine, the sole of the foot placed on the examination table, and the ankle in slight plantar flexion  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef120581" href="/z/d/graphic/120581.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). A high-frequency (7 to 15 mHz) linear probe (38 mm in length) is essential when performing an ultrasound of the foot, but a smaller "hockey stick" linear probe (23 mm in length)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef120582" href="/z/d/graphic/120582.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) makes examination of the toes easier [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. When performing an ultrasound of the feet and toes, a standard two-position examination (longitudinal, or sagittal, view and transverse view) is performed. The cortex of each phalange is examined in the anterior-posterior plane looking carefully for any discontinuity in the hyperechoic surface  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef120437" href="/z/d/graphic/120437.html" rel="external">image 13</a>). Occasionally, hematoma, edema, or ligamentous disruption may be seen  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef120672" href="/z/d/graphic/120672.html" rel="external">image 14</a>).</p><p>Studies have not specifically evaluated the efficacy of ultrasound to diagnose fractures of the toes or distal phalanges, but results of studies of metatarsal fractures are suggestive [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. In a prospective observational study of consecutive patients presenting to an emergency department with acute foot trauma, 88 patients with possible fifth metatarsal fracture were assessed with MSK US by an emergency physician and the results compared to plain radiographs read by an orthopedic surgeon (gold standard) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Of the 33 fractures found by radiograph, 32 were also identified with MSK US. The diagnostic sensitivity of MSK US was 97.1 percent, specificity was 100 percent, the positive likelihood ratio was infinity, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.03. In the hands of an experienced musculoskeletal ultrasonographer, it is likely that comparable results could be achieved for foot phalanx fractures.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3225397326"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of toe fractures is made by diagnostic imaging. In the large majority of cases, plain radiographs are sufficient. In rare cases, additional views or more advanced techniques may be needed to delineate concomitant injuries.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1143387398"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Toe fractures typically result from direct trauma to a digit and are readily diagnosed with plain radiographs. However, trauma may cause injuries other than fractures. In some cases, minor trauma may be incidental and toe pain may be due to an acute exacerbation of other, possibly chronic, conditions. Alternative diagnoses to consider include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Toe dislocation</strong> – A toe dislocation is usually obvious on examination, and results from a hyperextension or kicking injury. Plain radiographs establish the diagnosis and are important to obtain to evaluate for a concomitant fracture. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6314.html" rel="external">"Digit dislocation reduction"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>First metatarsophalangeal joint sprain (Turf toe)</strong> – "Turf toe" is caused by a forceful hyperextension of the great toe that damages the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint capsule and ligaments. Patients complain of pain at the plantar surface of the first MTP joint that increases with passive extension or resisted flexion of the great toe. Some degree of swelling, discoloration, and focal tenderness around the MTP is common. Plain radiographs are typically normal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113052.html" rel="external">"Evaluation, diagnosis, and select management of common causes of forefoot pain in adults", section on 'First metatarsophalangeal joint sprain ("turf toe")'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hallux rigidus (osteoarthritis of first toe)</strong> – Patients with hallux rigidus present with pain, stiffness, and if there has been recent trauma possibly swelling of the first MTP joint. Pain may be aggravated by walking or repetitive toe extension. Plain radiographs reveal loss of joint space at the first MTP joint and possibly osteophytes, but no fracture. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113052.html" rel="external">"Evaluation, diagnosis, and select management of common causes of forefoot pain in adults", section on 'Hallux rigidus and hallux limitus'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gout</strong> – Attacks of gout involving the first MTP joint cause an acute onset of pain, swelling, and redness at the joint. Plain radiographs may reveal typical findings but no fracture. Definitive diagnosis requires synovial fluid analysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1667.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infection and osteomyelitis</strong> – Soft tissue infections involving a toe typically present as a painful, red, swollen digit, and may be unrelated to trauma. If not managed appropriately, such infections can lead to osteomyelitis. Fever, erythema, and warmth are generally not associated with toe fractures, although local discoloration can develop.

Care should be taken not to cause a cold-induced injury when applying ice.

Subungual hematomas can cause severe pain, often indicate the presence of a distal phalanx fracture, and should be drained if seen within the first 24 hours [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Dorsal decompression of the hematoma may be performed using electrocautery, or possibly a scalpel. The toenail should be left in place because it provides additional support for the fracture. The management of subungual hematoma, including trephination techniques, is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6335.html" rel="external">"Subungual hematoma"</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of nail bed lacerations is controversial. Some recommend removing the nail to detect the presence of a laceration, if there is significant traumatic deformity of the nail or a sizable subungual hematoma [<a href="#rid3">3,15,16</a>]. They advocate laceration repair with absorbable sutures, following irrigation, if the wound is less than eight hours old [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The primary justification for this approach lies in the high correlation between nail bed injury and distal phalanx fracture, with the consequent risk of osteomyelitis associated with open fractures. Others, citing data showing no difference in outcome, advocate against removal of the nail and nail bed laceration repair [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. We do not advocate routine toenail removal and nail bed laceration repair, and perform this procedure only when obvious malalignment of the nail bed laceration is present.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Displaced fractures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many displaced toe fractures can be handled by non-specialists. The indications for orthopedic referral are outlined above. (See <a class="local">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p>The goal of displaced fracture management is to achieve anatomic alignment with restoration of length and correction of rotational deformity. The toe should first be anesthetized by either the application of ice for 20 minutes or a digital nerve block. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/262.html" rel="external">"Digital nerve block"</a>.)</p><p>Before the fracture is reduced, the clinician should briefly consider the major force involved in creating the injury. Reduction consists of moving the fracture fragments in the opposite direction of this force.</p><p>A pencil-sized object placed in the web space can provide stability and act as a fulcrum to facilitate reduction  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108685" href="/z/d/graphic/108685.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Reduction generally consists of distracting the fracture fragments, maintaining constant distraction while moving the fragments back into alignment, and holding the reduction in place until the injury is immobilized. If the fracture is not readily reduced, the deformity may need to be <strong>increased</strong> slightly before reattempting reduction. Irreducible fractures may have soft tissue interposed between fragments requiring open reduction in the operating room.</p><p>Following reduction, the orientation of the nail bed of the fractured toe should be compared with that of the corresponding toe on the opposite, uninjured foot to rule out uncorrected rotational deformity.</p><p>Reduced, stable fractures in lesser toes (ie, not the great toe) are supported by taping them to the adjacent toe (ie, buddy taping). Traction should be maintained on the injured lesser toe while buddy taping  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108681" href="/z/d/graphic/108681.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>) is performed. This approach usually provides adequate immobilization for lesser toe fractures following reduction. Some advocate a basket weave style of buddy taping for added stability [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>After reduction of great toe fractures, traction should be released to determine stability. Stable fractures maintain their position after traction is released. If the fracture is stable, place the foot with the fracture in a walking cast with a toe plate  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76330" href="/z/d/graphic/76330.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>). This helps to reduce pain and decreases the risk of displacement. Great toe fractures that are unstable (ie, reduction is lost once traction is released) should be referred to a surgeon, as operative reduction and fixation may be necessary. Transverse fractures are more likely to be stable because they are better able to resist the deforming forces of muscular attachments. Oblique, spiral, and comminuted fractures are more likely to be unstable [<a href="#rid3">3,19</a>]. Post-reduction radiographs are recommended to assure acceptable alignment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Open fractures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complex open fractures should be referred.

Although research is limited, many physicians treat such wounds with prophylactic antibiotics against common skin bacteria for a few days. We suggest prophylactic antibiotics for at least 48 hours after injury, and if no signs of infection develop antibiotics may be discontinued. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis for all types of open fractures is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7659.html" rel="external">"Osteomyelitis associated with open fractures in adults", section on 'Antibiotics after open fracture'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be asked about tetanus immunization and appropriate treatment should be provided if they are inadequately immunized  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087" href="/z/d/graphic/61087.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Common signs of infection should be reviewed with the patient and they should be told to return if any such signs develop. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5525.html" rel="external">"Tetanus"</a>.)</p><p>In settings where orthopedic referral is not readily available, primary care physicians are sometimes called upon to manage more complicated open toe fractures. A common scenario is a shear injury that partially or completely detaches the distal soft tissue, leaving bone exposed. The goal in such cases is to clean the wound and re-approximate the soft tissue so as to cover any visible bone. Such injuries may be managed as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perform a digital block.

If loosely sutured back into place, even completely avulsed flaps of skin may heal. If not, they at least provide a temporary physiologic dressing.</p><p>With some injuries, tissue loss is extensive and visible bone cannot be covered or bone fragments protrude. This may be managed by using a rongeur to remove small pieces of the bone a bit at a time until all visible bone can be covered by the remaining soft tissue. This procedure is typically well-tolerated provided the digital block is effective and only small pieces of bone are removed at a time.</p><p>Prophylactic antibiotics should be given and the patient instructed to be extremely conscientious about keeping the extremity elevated and seeking medical care immediately for any sign of infection. Ideally, wound checks are performed every two to three days until healing is well established.

There is little disability associated with degenerative changes or decreased range of motion in the lesser toes. Mild angulation of the lesser toes is usually well tolerated, unless friction occurs with an adjacent toe, the ground, or the top of a shoe. Osteomyelitis can occur after an open fracture, and neurovascular injuries are sometimes seen after crush injuries or lacerations.

Patients typically present because of pain, difficulty walking, or inability to fit comfortably into a shoe. In patients with sensory neuropathy (eg, diabetes), presentation may be delayed. (See <a class="local">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above and <a class="local">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – Ecchymosis and swelling are usually present and develop within the first few hours after injury. Subungual hematoma is a common finding with distal toe fractures. Comparison of nail bed rotation between the injured and corresponding uninjured toe is useful to assess rotational deformity. All injuries should be assessed for neurovascular function and the presence of an open fracture. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic imaging</strong> – Standard radiographs should be obtained if a toe fracture is suspected. Many foot injuries involve fractures of more than one phalanx or toe. Thus, it is important to read each radiograph systematically searching for additional bony injuries. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis includes toe dislocation and sprain of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (ie, turf toe), either of which may involve a concomitant fracture, gout, and other conditions. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for surgical referral</strong> – Referral is indicated for emergency conditions (eg, multiple open or grossly contaminated fractures) and often for fractures involving the great toe. Fractures of the lesser toes typically do not need referral unless they are displaced and intraarticular or displaced and irreducible or an acceptable reduction cannot be maintained. Guidelines for acceptable fracture rotation or angulation of lesser toe fractures are provided in the text. (See <a class="local">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Initial treatment varies according to the location and characteristics of the fracture. Many can be managed with basic immobilization. The goal when managing displaced fractures is to achieve anatomic alignment with restoration of length and correction of rotational deformity. Post-reduction assessment by radiograph and comparison with the corresponding uninjured toe is important. (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up care</strong> – Healing rates vary but generally range from four to six weeks.
