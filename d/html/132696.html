UTO is typically diagnosed with an imaging study (such as a kidney ultrasound) that reveals hydronephrosis. UTO can be acute or chronic, unilateral or bilateral, and partial or complete. In patients with kidney function impairment as a result of UTO, prompt reversal of the obstruction generally leads to improvement of kidney function. Uncorrected UTO can lead to progressive loss of kidney function.</p><p>The management of urinary tract obstruction is discussed in this topic.

These patients present with either unilateral or bilateral hydronephrosis. In patients with bilateral hydronephrosis, upper tract obstruction should be suspected if the postvoid residual is normal or the hydronephrosis persists despite bladder decompression. Patients who need urgent relief of upper tract obstruction can be treated with placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy tube (PCN), a percutaneous nephroureteral stent (PCNU), or a cystoscopic ureteral stent. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1067000229"><span class="h1">DETERMINING THE URGENCY OF TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In some instances, UTO is considered an emergency or urgency and should be relieved as soon as possible [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Emergencies</strong> (obstruction should be relieved within several hours):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Urosepsis (or signs of impending sepsis due to urinary tract infection)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Severe metabolic abnormalities (eg, hyperkalemia)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Urgencies</strong> (obstruction should be relieved within 24 hours):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute kidney injury (AKI)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bilateral UTO or obstruction of a single functioning kidney</p><p></p><p>In patients with a UTO emergency or urgency, an interventional procedure is performed (options include bladder decompression for lower tract obstruction or percutaneous placement of a nephrostomy tube or nephroureteral stent, or cystoscopic placement of a ureteral stent for upper tract obstruction). In some cases, the cause of obstruction (eg, kidney stone) can be addressed during the same procedure.

(See <a class="local">'Lower tract (bladder) obstruction'</a> below.)</p><p>Urgent relief of upper tract obstruction is accomplished with a percutaneous approach (placement of either a percutaneous nephrostomy tube [PCN] or a percutaneous nephroureteral stent [PCNU]) or a cystoscopic approach (ureteral stent placement). (See <a class="local">'Upper tract obstruction'</a> below.)</p><p>A PCN is a catheter with a locking loop that is placed via a posterior renal calyx to the renal pelvis. A PCNU also enters via a posterior renal calyx and traverses the renal pelvis, but the catheter extends through the ureter to the urinary bladder [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. PCN and PCNU are typically inserted by interventional radiologists or interventional nephrologists using ultrasound and/or fluoroscopy guidance; generally, these procedures do <strong>not</strong> require general sedation or general anesthesia. Technical aspects of PCN and PCNU placement are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/139781.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous nephrostomy tubes"</a>.)</p><p>Retrograde ureteral stent placement is performed by a urologist using cystoscopic guidance; frequently, general sedation or general anesthesia is required. Technical aspects of cystoscopic ureteral stent placement are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15182.html" rel="external">"Placement and management of indwelling ureteral stents"</a>.)</p><p>After the obstruction is relieved, the underlying cause of the obstruction should be corrected  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74877" href="/d/graphic/74877.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). This is presented below. (See <a class="local">'Treating the underlying cause of UTO'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4219136715"><span class="h2">Lower tract (bladder) obstruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with bilateral hydronephrosis and evidence of incomplete bladder emptying have a presumed diagnosis of bladder dysfunction or bladder outlet obstruction. Incomplete bladder emptying is documented with a bedside bladder scan showing a postvoid bladder volume of 300 mL or more, or a postvoid bladder catheterization draining 200 mL of urine or more [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p>Such patients require bladder decompression until the underlying cause of obstruction is corrected. (See <a class="local">'Treating the underlying cause of UTO'</a> below.)</p><p>Ongoing bladder decompression may be accomplished by one of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clean intermittent catheterization (preferred approach)</strong> – Clean intermittent catheterization is continued until the postvoid residual is less than 300 mL (this is the preferred approach). Clean intermittent catheterization should be performed as infrequently as possible while maintaining acceptable residual volumes (ie, less than 200 to 300 mL). Patients are typically unable to tolerate more than three to four catheterizations per day.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indwelling bladder catheter</strong> – Placement of an indwelling bladder catheter can be used for bladder decompression while the underlying cause of lower tract obstruction is addressed. However, this option is associated with a higher risk of urinary tract infection compared with clean intermittent catheterization [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indwelling suprapubic cystostomy tube</strong> – Placement of an indwelling suprapubic cystostomy tube is appropriate in patients with lower tract UTO in whom placement of a transurethral catheter is not possible (eg, benign or malignant urethral stricture, severe extrinsic urethral compression due to prostatic hypertrophy or a mass lesion). This technique is also associated with a higher risk of infection and [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], in addition, may cause bleeding and damage to surrounding structures, including blood vessels. Cystostomy tubes can be placed by palpation of bladder at the bedside, with local anesthesia if necessary. Alternative approaches include use of transabdominal ultrasound or cystoscopic guidance with placement of a guidewire percutaneously into the bladder to guide passage of the tube.</p><p></p><p>After decompression of the bladder, patients should be reimaged (eg, with kidney and bladder ultrasound) after one to two weeks, or sooner if symptoms and/or signs of obstruction do not resolve.</p><p>If hydronephrosis persists despite bladder drainage, upper tract obstruction may also be present. If symptoms and/or signs of obstruction remain after bladder decompression (eg, continued pain, nonresolving azotemia), then it should be assumed that the persistent hydronephrosis represents upper tract obstruction. (See <a class="local">'Upper tract obstruction'</a> below.) </p><p>Conversely, hydronephrosis may remain for varying periods of time after resolution of obstruction, particularly if the obstruction was chronic. Some patients will have permanent dilation of the collecting system. Thus, if the patient's symptoms and signs of UTO resolve after bladder decompression, then residual hydronephrosis may not be clinically important. If it is unclear whether or not the patient has persistent obstruction, a functional mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG-3) renal scan, ideally with a diuretic wash-out to calculate a half-life excretion time, can help differentiate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2692639269"><span class="h2">Upper tract obstruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Relief of obstruction in patients with upper tract UTO is achieved with anterograde placement of a PCN or PCNU or retrograde placement of a ureteral stent. Once the obstruction is relieved, the underlying cause should be corrected, if possible. (See <a class="local">'Treating the underlying cause of UTO'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3257459627"><span class="h3">Preprocedural management</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preoperative antibiotics</strong> – Patients with UTO complicated by a suspected urinary tract infection require prompt therapy (ie, within one hour) using broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover pseudomonas, other gram negative bacteria, and methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus </em>and <em>Enterococcus</em>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131022" href="/d/graphic/131022.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115994" href="/d/graphic/115994.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The choice of specific agents and the rationale are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16109.html" rel="external">"Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults and adolescents", section on 'Empiric antimicrobial therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In patients without suspected urinary tract infection, prophylactic antibiotics are given prior to the procedure  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129971" href="/d/graphic/129971.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). This issue is discussed in other topics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/139781.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous nephrostomy tubes", section on 'Insertion techniques'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15182.html" rel="external">"Placement and management of indwelling ureteral stents", section on 'Stent placement'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medication</strong> – Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulant drugs do <strong>not</strong> generally need to be discontinued or reversed prior to cystoscopic ureteral stent placement. Conversely, the risk of bleeding is higher with PCN and PCNU. Thus, cystoscopic stent placement is generally preferred in anticoagulated patients. If placement of a PCN or PCNU is necessary, anticoagulation should be reversed first. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Preoperative reversal of anticoagulation is appropriate for some patients before cystoscopic stent placement. As examples, anticoagulated patients with a significant tumor burden in the bladder or those with marked prostate enlargement may develop gross hematuria during the procedure, leading to diminished visualization and difficulty placing the stent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Procedural considerations</strong> – Cystoscopic ureteral stents are typically placed under general anesthesia. Thus, patients who should not undergo general anesthesia (eg, septic patients or those with severe electrolyte abnormalities) typically undergo PCN or PCNU placement, which can be performed with local anesthesia and without sedation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because rigid cystoscopy requires that the patient be in the dorsal lithotomy position, the procedure may be difficult for patients with certain orthopedic hip surgeries or patients with significant musculoskeletal contractions. In such patients, a PCN or PCNU is preferable. Although flexible cystoscopy in males may be performed in the supine position and stent placement is often feasible, visualization is not as optimal as with rigid cystoscopy. Flexible cystoscopy may also be performed in female patients, but this requires the frog-leg position, which is subject to the same musculoskeletal limitations as the dorsal lithotomy position. Ureteral stent placement may be attempted through a percutaneous cystostomy tract, but this procedure is technically difficult, and the risk of bleeding and damage to surrounding structures is greater than with the transurethral approach.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Placement of a PCN (or PCNU) requires that the patient be able to tolerate the prone position for approximately 30 minutes (or 60 minutes if both kidneys require decompression), although this varies depending upon technical difficulty. In patients who cannot tolerate the prone position for the duration of the procedure, such as those with difficult airways or severe respiratory distress, those with healing or open chest or abdominal wounds or incisions, or those who have severe obesity, a cystoscopic approach may be preferred.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Before cystoscopic stent placement, PCN, or PCNU, the bladder should be decompressed if there is any concern for incomplete emptying. In addition, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis should be addressed, if necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2332.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2291.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The technical aspects of cystoscopic ureteral stent placement and placement of PCNs and PCNUs are presented in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15182.html" rel="external">"Placement and management of indwelling ureteral stents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/139781.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous nephrostomy tubes"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4032590635"><span class="h3">Approach to urgent upper tract obstruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Relief of obstruction in patients with upper tract UTO is achieved with anterograde placement of a PCN or PCNU or retrograde placement of a ureteral stent. The choice between these procedures is informed by the clinical setting: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with urosepsis (or impending sepsis due to urinary tract infection)</strong> – Patients with urosepsis in the setting of upper tract UTO should undergo PCN if time allows, rather than cystoscopic ureteral stent placement. Although cystoscopic stent placement can typically be performed more quickly than PCN, general anesthesia is usually needed for cystoscopic stent placement; this is generally unsafe in septic patients. In addition, it is not possible to know whether or not retrograde ureteral access will be successful until the procedure begins. If, for example, there are ureteral strictures that not amenable to dilation or if visualization of the ureteral orifices is obscured by tumor or gross hematuria, then relief of obstruction will be delayed, which is dangerous in an emergency setting. In contrast to cystoscopic stent placement, insertion of a PCN can be performed without general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care, and relief of obstruction can usually be achieved with greater frequency as compared with cystoscopic stent placement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">PCN is preferred over PCNU in the emergency setting since the additional manipulation required for stent placement may increase bacterial transfer into the bloodstream and may exacerbate septic physiology [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. However, following resolution of infection, the PCN can be converted to a nephroureteral stent. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with acute kidney injury and/or hyperkalemia</strong> – In patients with AKI and/or hyperkalemia, relief of obstruction is urgent and, for the same reasons as described for patients with urosepsis, placement of a PCN or PCNU is often preferred over an attempt at cystoscopic stent placement. Those patients with a hyperkalemic emergency should be treated medically (eg, rapidly acting therapies, gastrointestinal cation exchanger) but relief of the obstruction should generally <strong>not</strong> be delayed in order to perform hemodialysis. AKI and hyperkalemia as a result of UTO typically resolve quickly with relief of the obstruction and hemodialysis can often be avoided.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, some clinicians would start with a cystoscopic approach in these patients, particularly if the AKI is nonsevere and the hyperkalemia is mild.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with prior surgical alteration of the urinary tract (eg, kidney transplant, bladder or ureteral surgery)</strong> – Patients with a history of surgical alterations of the urinary tract and who require urgent relief of obstruction should generally undergo PCN or PCNU placement, rather than an attempt at retrograde cystoscopic ureteral stent placement. For cystoscopic stent insertion to be successful, an access wire must traverse the ureteral orifice and ureter. Thus, when there is significant doubt about feasibility of retrograde stent placement in an urgent situation, it best to consult with interventional radiology or interventional nephrology regarding an anterograde percutaneous procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients who have undergone radical cystoprostatectomy have uretero-enteric anastomoses that generally preclude urgent retrograde access [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Patients who are status post ureteral reimplantation or kidney transplantation have a heterotopic ureteral orifice that may make retrograde ureteral stent insertion challenging or even impossible. Cross-trigonal ureteral reimplantation presents challenging anatomy due to the acute angle of the ureterovesical junction [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. Even if retrograde access can be obtained in a patient with a kidney transplant, the ureteral length is short and often the standard stents are long and may predispose to dislodgement of the stent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In general, percutaneous access to the transplant renal collecting system can be readily and safely accomplished using a combination of ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance. PCN placement may be performed, or if the ureteral stricture can be readily traversed, a PCNU can be placed. Patients with anastomotic strictures can be managed as described below; if the stricture is successfully remodeled, the PCN can eventually be removed [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with suspected obliterative ureteral lesions</strong> – In the urgent setting, PCN or PCNU is preferred over retrograde stent placement in patients with suspected obliterative ureteral lesions. Such patients include those with large and impacted ureteral stones or obliterative ureteral strictures. It may be difficult or impossible to traverse an access wire past the obstruction in these settings. Similar to patients with surgical alterations of the urinary tract noted above, any doubt about the feasibility of retrograde stent placement in an urgent setting favors an anterograde approach.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malignant ureteral obstruction</strong> – Similarly, in patients with primary or invasive ureteral tumors or ureteral obstruction due to extrinsic compression by a tumor, PCN or PCNU is preferred in the urgent setting over retrograde stent placement. In addition to the difficulty traversing a wire across the obstruction, ureteral stents have a relatively high failure rate among such patients [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with gross hematuria or those prone to urinary tract bleeding</strong> – Gross hematuria can obscure the ureteral orifices and thereby cause difficulty in retrograde passage of an access wire for stent placement. Thus, such patients who need urgent relief of obstruction are typically treated with PCN or PCNU placement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with luminal malignancy obstructing the ureter or those who have conditions associated with bleeding from the bladder wall (eg, hemorrhagic cystitis or malignant bladder masses) may be at increased risk of hemorrhage due to irritation or erosion by a ureteral stent [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]; in such patients, PCN may be the best option.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with coagulopathy or who are anticoagulated</strong> – As noted above, the risk of significant bleeding is high with percutaneous placement of a tube or stent among anticoagulated patients and those with coagulopathy. Thus, a cystoscopic approach is preferred in such patients. However, if PCN or PCNU is deemed necessary for the reasons listed above, anticoagulation should first be reversed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other considerations</strong> – In patients without one of the above reasons to select one procedure over the other, additional factors weigh in the decision of how to relieve the obstruction:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Painful bladder syndromes – Some patients may have more difficulty tolerating an indwelling ureteral stent. Since stents typically have curled proximal and distal ends (ie, pigtails) to limit stent migration  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50265" href="/d/graphic/50265.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), part of the stent permanently resides in the bladder. This may exacerbate symptoms of painful bladder syndrome or interstitial cystitis in patients with these conditions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Risk of rapid stent encrustation – Patients who are prone to kidney stone formation may suffer from rapid encrustation of indwelling ureteral stents, leading to stent dysfunction [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Some, but not all, data suggest that stent encrustation also occurs more frequently in pregnant people due to physiologic hypercalciuria of pregnancy [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Concern that the patient cannot or will not follow up – Even among patients not prone to stone formation, stent encrustation eventually occurs, and the resulting stent dysfunction can lead to kidney damage [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Thus, stents need to be removed or exchanged; for patients who require a long-term indwelling stent, exchange is typically performed every three to six months. If there is concern that the patient will be unable to return for stent removal or exchange, PCN or PCNU is generally preferred. Although a PCN or PCNU also requires preventative maintenance (on a similar schedule), encrustation of these catheters is simpler to manage than encrustation of an indwelling stent. In addition, patients with a PCN or PCNU have an external catheter and drainage bag and therefore typically return for follow-up. Conversely, patients with an indwelling stent can forget and may require lithotripsy or surgery to remove a severely encrusted stent. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Quality of life – A percutaneous nephrostomy catheter sits proximal to the site of obstruction and therefore must drain externally to a drainage bag. From a quality of life perspective, patients often prefer an indwelling ureteral stent since no external collection bag is necessary [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. This allows for greater freedom of movement and the ability to fully submerge in a body of water. In addition, the risk of urinary tract infection is mitigated with an indwelling ureteral stent compared with a nephrostomy tube, and indwelling stents have a lower likelihood of becoming dislodged.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">However, if a PCNU is inserted (rather than a PCN), the catheter allows urine to pass via side holes from the renal collecting system to the bladder, bypassing the site of obstruction if it is within the ureter. Urine can drain internally to the bladder as well as externally to a drainage bag. Then, following acute decompression of the collecting system, the external portion of the catheter may be capped to allow for internal drainage to the bladder only, thereby eliminating the need for an external drainage bag [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In addition, patients who were initially managed with a PCN will often be candidates for subsequent conversion to a PCNU or internal double-J stent. In order for this to be possible, it must be technically feasible to place a guidewire across the site of ureteral obstruction and into the bladder, and the area of obstruction must be distensible enough to allow passage of a stent. Balloon dilation of the ureter may be required to permit stent passage [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Some obstructions cannot be traversed, such as in patients with bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or muscle invasive bladder malignancy, so nephrostomy may be the only option.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H360020484"><span class="h1">WHEN RELIEF OF OBSTRUCTION IS NONURGENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As noted above, treatment of the underlying cause of obstruction can be the initial approach when relief of obstruction is not urgent.

Treatment of an obstructing stone depends upon the size of the stone and could include surgical intervention, extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy, medical expulsive therapy, or supportive measures only  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef83630" href="/d/graphic/83630.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).

Options for definitive repair of discrete ureteral strictures include ureteral reimplantation or ureteroureterostomy. For more severe ureteral strictures, other options include ileal ureteral transposition or kidney auto-transplantation. The decision for definitive repair is based on surgical candidacy, perioperative risk, and the underlying etiology of upper tract obstruction. As an example, patients whose stricture resulted from previous radiation therapy may be at a higher risk for complications following ureteral reconstruction. A ureteral stent or PCN can be permanent in select patients who are poor candidates for definitive surgical repair.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Alternatively, there are endoscopic options for poor surgical candidates, such as ureteral dilation with followers, controlled balloon dilation, or laser incision of the ureteral stricture; these procedures are followed by stent placement. However, these procedures have lower success rates than definitive surgical reconstruction. In addition, there is a risk of urine leak/urinoma following endoscopic intervention despite the postoperative insertion of an indwelling stent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Postsurgical anastomotic ureteral strictures can be treated using interventional radiology techniques. This is most commonly accomplished by achieving percutaneous access to the kidney and traversing the stricture antegrade with an angled tip catheter and guidewire. The stricture is then dilated with a balloon catheter, and a relatively large caliber nephroureteral catheter (often up to 16 French) is placed across the site. The catheter is left in place for six weeks to allow the strictured segment to "remodel" around it. The patient then returns for an over-the-wire nephrostogram to assess the stricture site. If the ureter is patent and with brisk flow across it, the catheter can be converted to a percutaneous nephrostomy to maintain access to the collecting system and capped to allow urine to pass via the ureter only. The patient then returns two weeks later for a nephrostogram, and if the ureter remains patent, the nephrostomy can be removed. The procedure is performed in this stepwise fashion since strictures do not always remodel effectively following balloon dilation and may recur following ureteral stent removal. Since stricture dilation is sometimes unsuccessful, it is best to initially maintain access to the collecting system to allow for additional imaging and potential reversion to long-term ureteral stenting, if necessary. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Sometimes, patients with an ileal neobladder (following urinary diversion for cystectomy) may develop an anastomotic ureteral stricture. Percutaneous access to the renal collecting system can be established and an angled-tip catheter and guidewire advanced through the stricture and neobladder and out of the urostomy under fluoroscopic guidance. A ureteral stent can then be advanced retrograde over the wire to the renal pelvis. Percutaneous wire access to the kidney is then removed, leaving a catheter that allows urine to pass from the renal pelvis, traversing the ureter and neobladder and ending within the urostomy bag. The catheter can be readily changed at three-month intervals to prevent encrustation and occlusion [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Kidney papillary necrosis (sloughed papilla)</strong> – Rarely, UTO may be caused by kidney papillary necrosis with sloughing of a papilla that impairs urine passage into the ureter or becomes lodged in the ureter. Risk factors for papillary necrosis include sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus, analgesic nephropathy, and kidney infections (eg, pyelonephritis, tuberculosis) [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. Relief of the obstruction is usually achieved with a ureteral stent and prevention of further obstruction depends upon management of the underlying etiology. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood clot</strong> – Patients with gross hematuria as a result of bleeding from the kidney, ureter, or bladder may develop obstruction as a result of a blood clot [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. Control of the hemorrhage can often be achieved with endoscopic fulguration, selective renal artery embolization, or, if intractable, nephrectomy. If source control of the bleeding is successful, the clot can be removed endoscopically followed by placement of a ureteral stent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ureteral or urothelial carcinoma</strong> – Patients with ureteral or urothelial carcinoma typically undergo surgical (eg, nephroureterectomy in those with ureteral carcinoma) and treatment with chemotherapy. These disorders are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2987.html" rel="external">"Malignancies of the renal pelvis and ureter"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2978.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial approach and management of urothelial bladder cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Endometriosis or pelvic organ prolapse</strong> – Patients with advanced pelvic endometriosis may be managed with indwelling ureteral stents or a PCN, pending definitive surgical repair. Urologic intervention may be warranted for reconstruction in the rare circumstance of direct bladder or ureteral involvement that requires resection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pelvic organ prolapse due to cystocele may cause distal occlusion, or "kinking," of the ureterovesical junction. This may cause ureteral stent placement to be challenging due to aberrant bladder trigonal anatomy. In this setting, anterior vaginal wall digital compression can be performed at the time of cystoscopy, which may straighten the ureterovesical junction angle sufficiently to permit successful placement of a stent. Definitive repair of cystocele may also address the underlying ureteral obstruction. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Retroperitoneal fibrosis</strong> – In patients who require urgent relief of obstruction, PCN, ureteral stent placement, or surgery is an option. For those who do not need an urgent procedure, pharmacologic treatment of the RPF is initiated and the imaging is repeated after several weeks, to assess for resolution. Treatment of patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis and UTO is presented in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7213.html" rel="external">"Treatment of retroperitoneal fibrosis", section on 'Treatment of urinary obstruction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Extrinsic ureteral compression from lymphadenopathy or tumor</strong> – Ureteral obstruction in this setting may be temporarily managed with either indwelling ureteral stents or nephrostomy tubes, while awaiting definitive therapy. In these situations, retrograde stent placement may not be technically feasible. Even if it is accomplished, small caliber stents placed via cystoscope may fail due to compression. Thus, percutaneous nephrostomy may be the best option for decompression. However, sometimes, larger caliber nephroureteral stents can be used to allow for internal drainage to the bladder with the catheter capped externally [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3677440204"><span class="h1">ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF OBSTRUCTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who need ongoing management of obstruction with an indwelling stent, a percutaneous nephrostomy tube (PCN), or a percutaneous nephroureteral stent (PCNU) should have follow-up imaging to evaluate for persistent obstruction and will need periodic exchange procedures.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluating for persistent obstruction</strong> – In patients with upper tract obstruction who are treated with an indwelling ureteral stent or nephrostomy, follow-up imaging (with kidney and bladder ultrasound or abdominal computed tomography [CT]) should be performed at approximately six weeks to evaluate for persistent obstruction. In particular, patients with malignant ureteral obstruction are at a relatively high risk for indwelling ureteral stent or PCNU failure leading to persistent UTO [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Persistent hydronephrosis evident on follow-up imaging could be due to persistent UTO or to retrograde urine reflux due to bladder pressure. Retrograde reflux of urine typically does not cause kidney damage and does not need to be addressed, whereas persistent UTO requires intervention. To differentiate between persistent UTO and retrograde urine reflux due to bladder pressure, the patient should undergo a dynamic MAG-3 renal scan. Placement of a bladder catheter during the procedure may prevent reflux during the examination and therefore aid in the interpretation of the MAG-3 scan, although this is controversial.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exchange of stents and nephrostomy catheters</strong> – Traditional indwelling ureteral stents are generally exchanged every three months to avoid encrustation, although some models can dwell for a longer duration.

(See <a class="local">'Lower tract (bladder) obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Upper tract obstruction – In patients with upper tract obstruction, treatment options include percutaneous placement of a nephrostomy tube (PCN) or nephroureteral stent (PCNU), or retrograde cystoscopic placement of a ureteral stent. The choice between these procedures depends upon many factors, including whether or not the patient can safely undergo general anesthesia, the suspected cause of obstruction, whether or not there are anatomical alterations to the urinary tract, the presence of gross hematuria, anticoagulation, as well as several other factors. These issues are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Upper tract obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After the obstruction is relieved, the underlying cause of the obstruction should be corrected  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74877" href="/d/graphic/74877.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). This is presented below. In some cases, the cause of obstruction (eg, kidney stone) can be addressed during the same procedure. (See <a class="local">'Treating the underlying cause of UTO'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management when relief of obstruction is nonurgent</strong> – If relief of obstruction is not an emergency or urgency, then treatment of the underlying cause of obstruction can be the initial approach  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74877" href="/d/graphic/74877.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Treating the underlying cause of UTO'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In some such patients, the underlying cause of obstruction may not be quickly reversible or may not be reversible at all. In such patients, placement of a PCN, PCNU, or cystoscopic ureteral stent is often appropriate while attempting to address the cause of obstruction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ongoing management</strong> – Patients who need ongoing management of obstruction with an indwelling stent, a PCN, or a PCNU should have follow-up imaging to evaluate for persistent obstruction and will need periodic exchange procedures. (See <a class="local">'Ongoing management of obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In patients with upper tract obstruction who are treated with an indwelling ureteral stent or nephrostomy, follow-up imaging (with kidney and bladder ultrasound or abdominal computed tomography [CT]) should be performed at approximately six weeks, to evaluate for persistent obstruction. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Traditional indwelling ureteral stents are generally exchanged every three months to avoid encrustation, although some models can dwell for a longer duration. PCN and PCNU also require over-the-wire exchange at approximately three-month intervals for preventive maintenance.</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">Yarger WE.
