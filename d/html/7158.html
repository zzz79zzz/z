         Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is an immune-mediated hematopoietic disorder characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow. Affected patients typically present with infections due to neutropenia, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and/or fatigue due to anemia. Patients are at risk of life-threatening complications, especially when pancytopenia is severe. Almost all sporadic cases of AA, especially when severe and of sudden onset, are related to immune destruction of hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews the treatment and prognosis of AA in adults.
        </p>
        <p>
         For adults, the evaluation of pancytopenia; pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of AA; and hematopoietic cell transplantation for AA are discussed separately.

         It is important to exclude other causes of pancytopenia prior to initiating treatment for acquired AA because of important differences in treatment. Exclusion of other causes includes history, physical examination, laboratory tests, bone marrow examination, cytogenetics, and molecular studies.

         In one study of patients presenting with bone marrow failure and features suggesting an IBMFS, almost 40 percent were young adults [

          1

         ]. Even with clear family histories, only half had mutations identified via current germline sequencing panels, suggesting that there remain undiscovered genes associated with IBMFS. In our experience, germline pathogenic mutations are more common in patients with blood counts in the moderate AA range, rather than the severe AA range.

          Hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)

         – It is important to exclude MDS prior to treatment for AA, especially in older adults [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Although most patients with MDS have increased bone marrow cellularity, a minority have a hypocellular bone marrow. (See

         The distinction between AA and hypocellular MDS can be challenging because both may be associated with some degree of dysplasia and/or certain cytogenetic or molecular findings. A finding of dysplasia in ≥10 percent of cells within a single lineage (particularly in myeloid or megakaryocytic lineages) or in two or more lineages provides strong evidence for MDS; by contrast, AA is more likely to be associated with dysplastic and/or megaloblastic erythroid precursors alone. MDS can also be unequivocally diagnosed based on certain clonal cytogenetic abnormalities alone (ie, without dysplastic changes); examples include loss of all or part of chromosomes 5, 7, or complex changes. Other chromosomal changes (eg, 6pCNLOH, trisomy 6, or loss of 13q) and somatic mutations in genes associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP; eg,
         <em>
          DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1
         </em>
         ) may be seen with AA or MDS; detection of CHIP-associated mutations is not helpful for distinguishing between these conditions [

          Other causes
         </strong>
         – Some transient causes of pancytopenia, such as a drug reaction or certain infections, can be difficult to distinguish from AA  (

          table 1

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with moderate cytopenias, implicated drugs should be withdrawn, possible infections should be treated, and the patient can be observed for several weeks to exclude alternative causes, as described below. (See

         There is a strong association between acquired AA and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Detection of CD59/CD55-negative cells or other findings associated with PNH enhance the likelihood of acquired AA rather than an alternative cause of bone marrow failure. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Distinguishing SAA and vSAA is important prognostically, but the two categories are considered together for treatment decisions. The presence of very severe neutropenia in vSAA increases the urgency for prompt initiation of treatment, as described below. (See

        <p>
         Although bone marrow hypocellularity is required to diagnose AA, it is not a component of severity grading. Bone marrow cellularity in SAA must be interpreted with caution because it may be heterogeneous (particularly early in the course of the disease), affected by clonal expansion of PNH-associated erythroid precursors in patients with co-existent PNH, and by infiltrating T lymphocytes [

         Patients with severe AA (SAA) or very severe AA (vSAA) require prompt and judicious treatment decisions and ongoing supportive care until treatment is effective  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Prompt initiation of treatment is important to reduce the risk of life-threatening infections and limit complications from ongoing transfusions, antibiotics, and other medications. A short-term delay in initiating therapy of SAA/vSAA is acceptable to treat a serious bacterial infection or sepsis. However, we generally do not delay therapy to treat a fungal infection unless it can be managed by surgical resection (eg, mold infection of skin/sinuses/lungs); in general, resolution of a serious fungal infection requires adequate neutrophils, and prompt treatment of SAA is the most effective way to hasten the return of neutrophils in this setting.

Triple IST was associated with superior six-month ORR (81 versus 67 percent), but half of responding patients in each cohort maintained the response after one year. For patients treated with triple IST, the cumulative four-year incidence of relapse was 43 percent, high-risk clonal evolution developed in 6 percent, and low-risk clonal progression in 9 percent; these rates did not differ from those for the historic controls. However, patients treated with triple IST had earlier time to relapse (median 324 versus 774 days) and time to clonal evolution (median 186 versus 777 days).

         Before initiating treatment for MAA, we generally follow the patient closely for several weeks to months to better define the trajectory and pace of the illness. Some patients will exhibit spontaneous remission of cytopenias, while others evolve to severe AA (SAA). We do not begin treatment for MAA until transient causes of cytopenias (eg, viral infection, medication) have been excluded. It is particularly important to exclude inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) in this setting because such patients often have cytopenias in the MAA range. (See

If one of these two lineages is severely impacted, at least one other lineage is usually also in the severe range (ie, the patient has SAA) or will soon progress to SAA; such patients require treatment for SAA. For a persistent absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500/microL, the risk of life-threatening infections is substantial; we generally begin treatment for MAA with such severe neutropenia or in patients with platelet transfusion-dependence.

          eltrombopag
         </a>
         rather than intensive IST or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We consider lower-intensity IST and eltrombopag equally acceptable based on the favorable balance of efficacy and adverse effects relative to HCT or intensive IST. Some experts avoid eltrombopag in patients with evidence of progression to a clonal disorder or substantial dysplasia with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-defining cytogenetic abnormalities, because of unproven concerns that eltrombopag may enhance clonal proliferation. (See

        <p>
         Some experts consider intensive IST to be acceptable for initial treatment of medically fit patients with MAA because they place more emphasis on higher rates of response than on the toxicity. HCT is rarely considered as first-line treatment for MAA, but some younger patients (eg, &lt;40 years) and/or those with ongoing transfusion needs, substantial bleeding, or serious infections may choose HCT as offering a more favorable balance of risks and benefits. (See

         For frail patients, we generally provide supportive care with a focus on symptom relief, with the hope that this may improve the quality of life and/or prolong survival. Some frail patients may choose treatment options for less-fit patients. (See

The entire course of hATG should be administered over four days; when it is given over longer periods (eg, 8 to 14 days) the incidence and severity of serum sickness is greater. hATG should be given through a central venous catheter, as it is sclerosing to peripheral veins [

Patients who are concurrently receiving azole antifungal agents require significant reduction in initial dosing to avoid supratherapeutic CsA levels [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. During initial CsA dose finding, blood pressure should be measured frequently, and serum creatinine and trough CsA levels should be monitored. Subsequent dosing should be titrated to achieve a trough level of 200 to 400 ng/mL; however, we target a trough level of 150 to 250 ng/mL for patients with pre-existent kidney disease or who develop renal dysfunction while receiving CsA [
         <a href="#rid19">

         There is no consensus regarding the optimal protocol and duration of CsA therapy. We generally treat with CsA for 12 months and initiate a slow taper (ie, &lt;10 percent dose reduction at a time) over approximately one year. An alternative approach is treatment with full CsA dose for six months, followed by dose reduction to 2 mg/kg/day (or a trough level closer to 100 to 150 ng/mL) for a total duration of 24 months of CsA. If blood counts begin to drop during the CsA taper, the full dose should be reinstituted, followed by a slower taper after restoration of blood counts. Some patients may require chronic low to moderate dose CsA treatment to maintain blood counts (particularly platelet counts).

         Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure AA, but transplantation is associated with substantial short- and long-term AEs. HCT both restores the supply of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and replaces the immune system that is responsible for depleting them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Age and medical fitness are important considerations in selecting allogeneic HCT as initial treatment of SAA and for relapsed or refractory AA. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Severe AA/very severe AA'
         </a>

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who may be candidates for HCT should have consultation with a multi-disciplinary transplantation team and undergo human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing soon after being diagnosed with AA. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other pretreatment management'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Outcomes and AEs with allogeneic HCT for AA are influenced by the age of the recipient. For patients &gt;40 years old, long-term survival after transplantation is approximately 50 percent, which is inferior to survival in children and adolescents; survival after allogeneic HCT in adults has not changed significantly for decades [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9

          Transfusions
         </strong>
         – Patients with severe anemia or thrombocytopenia may require transfusions of red blood cells (RBC) and/or platelets to improve anemia-related symptoms, reduce bleeding, and maintain the quality of life. We generally administer leukoreduced, irradiated blood products using a restrictive transfusion approach to reduce complications of transfusion.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         All RBC units given to AA patients should be leukoreduced to minimize the risk of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions and reduce transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to CMV-negative patients; this is particularly important if the patient may later undergo allogeneic HCT. Irradiation depletes lymphocytes and reduces the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD), especially during the first months of intensive IST. We generally transfuse with irradiated blood products, but irradiation may not be required for patients who receive supportive care alone (once an underlying immune deficiency condition has been excluded); patients who are not severely T cell immunodeficient are unlikely to develop ta-GVHD.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We apply a restrictive transfusion strategy and transfuse RBCs for symptomatic and/or severe anemia. Restrictive transfusion targets limit the number of transfusions and reduce the risk of alloimmunization and iron overload. The transfusion threshold should be individualized, based on symptoms, comorbid illnesses, and rate of decline of hemoglobin (Hb). Many centers seek to maintain Hb &gt;7 g/dL, but there is no consensus threshold for transfusion. Blood products from a sibling or family donor should be avoided for potential HCT candidates to minimize the risk of graft failure caused by an immune reaction to donor antigens. Further discussion of RBC transfusions is presented separately. (See

         We generally administer prophylactic platelet transfusions for platelets &lt;10,000/microL, but the transfusion threshold may need to be individualized. For patients with sepsis or recurrent severe bleeding complications, the platelet count should be kept &gt;20,000/microL, especially if bleeding risks organ function. Thrombocytopenia may worsen during treatment with antithymocyte globulin (ATG), due to increased platelet consumption during high fevers and/or cross-reacting antibodies in the ATG preparation. We target &gt;20,000 platelets/microL during and immediately following ATG administration. Platelets should be administered to severely thrombocytopenic patients prior to invasive procedures.

         It is important to distinguish refractory disease, in which there was no meaningful response to treatment, from a partial hematologic response, in which the patient has clear clinical improvement with a stable pattern of modestly improved blood counts and/or transfusion-independence, as described above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Response assessment'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients who are refractory to immunosuppressive therapy (IST), it is important to re-evaluate the underlying diagnosis. In some patients, refractoriness to IST may reflect a previously unrecognized underlying inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS), while in others it may be due to progression to a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Exclude other causes'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately 10 percent of patients with severe AA (SAA) are refractory to initial treatment with triple IST, while at least one-third of patients are refractory to other IST regimens. It is unclear whether refractory disease represents ongoing immune attack on hematopoietic cells (ie, inadequate immunosuppression) or a persistent deficiency of hematopoietic stem cells [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We favor participation in a clinical trial for these patients, when possible. Outside of a trial, the choice of treatment for refractory AA is influenced by the severity of cytopenias, medical fitness, and other factors, as described in the following sections.

          Eligible for HCT
         </strong>
         – For patients with SAA that is refractory to triple IST, we relax the criteria for eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); especially when there is a suitable matched related donor (MRD), we generally consider medically fit patients ≤65 years of age to be eligible for transplantation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients who are eligible for transplantation and have a suitable donor, we suggest allogeneic HCT rather than a second course of intensive IST or an alternative IST regimen. This suggestion is based on the balance of benefits and toxicities with HCT, in light of the high rate of mortality with prolonged, profound cytopenias.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients who do not have a suitable MRD, we initiate a search for a matched unrelated donor, haploidentical donor (eg, parent or child), or umbilical cord blood donor. The preferred alternative donor source varies by institution. Choices of conditioning regimen, graft source, management of complications, and outcomes of allogeneic HCT in this setting are discussed separately. (See

         </strong>
         Patients with AA have an increased risk of developing PNH; conversely, patients with PNH have an increased risk of later developing AA. Clinical PNH can evolve following a response to immunosuppressive therapy (IST), due to emergence of endogenous PNH red blood cells (RBC); in contrast, clonal progression is rare following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) [

         Cells that have lost expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) proteins (a hallmark of PNH) may evade immune attack and thereby have a survival advantage in the setting of immune-mediated bone marrow failure. In one large study of 207 consecutive patients presenting with severe AA (SAA), 40 percent had a detectable population of PNH neutrophils (ie, lacking expression of GPI-linked proteins), with a median clone size of 9 percent [

         The overall prognosis of patients with severe AA (SAA) has improved with advances in supportive care, immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and triple IST, and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Current 5- or 10-year survival rates are as high as 80 to 90 percent, compared with 10 to 20 percent in the 1960s [
         <a href="#rid38">

         Certain clinical and laboratory features of AA are associated with prognosis. Younger age and less severe disease are associated with more favorable outcomes [

         <a href="#rid87">
          87
         </a>
         ]. In some studies, trisomy 8 or del(13q) in the context of AA predicts for good response to antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and longer telomeres identify a subgroup of patients who show excellent overall survival after IST [
