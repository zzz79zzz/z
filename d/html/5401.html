This topic will review the patient selection, analgesia, and techniques for neonatal circumcision, including the Gomco clamp, Plastibell device, and Mogen clamp. Discussions of the risks and benefits of neonatal circumcision, including the controversy surrounding the procedure, and management of complications are presented separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6716.html" rel="external">"Neonatal circumcision: Risks and benefits"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6587.html" rel="external">"Complications of circumcision"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEVELOPMENT AND ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The penis develops as a tri-tubed structure with bilateral corpora cavernosa (erectile bodies) and ventral midline urethra surrounded by corpus spongiosum. The penis is divided into the proximal base, pendulous middle shaft, and distal glans. The corona of the glans and immediately proximal coronal sulcus anatomically differentiate the penile shaft from the glans penis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76391" href="/d/graphic/76391.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86377" href="/d/graphic/86377.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The foreskin begins development at 12 weeks of gestation as a fold of epithelium at the base of the penis that becomes a bilaminar prepuce covering the entire glans by 18 to 20 weeks. Progression of the foreskin coincides with the development of the penis; therefore, anatomic abnormalities of the penis often result in incomplete or abnormal foreskin. An inner mucocutaneous layer of the prepuce is adherent to the epithelial layer of the glans. Circumcision removes the inner and outer layers of the prepuce as well as the intervening dartos muscle  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86376" href="/d/graphic/86376.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Physiologic phimosis is the normal inability of the foreskin to retract over the glans penis, which results from the filmy adhesions between inner prepuce and glans. In natural progression, foreskin becomes more retractable over time with epithelial shedding (smegma) and intermittent erections causing separation of these adhesions. Nearly 100 percent of newborn males are unable to have foreskin retracted whereas, after age 5, 92 percent will have fully retractile foreskin and only 1 percent of males age 17 cannot fully retract the foreskin [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The major contraindications to neonatal circumcision include unstable or significantly premature infants, and infants with congenital penile abnormalities [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Infants with blood dyscrasias or a family history of abnormal bleeding can undergo circumcision, as discussed below. Infants who have not received <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9771" href="/d/drug information/9771.html" rel="external">vitamin K</a> supplementation or have not yet voided should have the procedure delayed until these criteria have been met.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unstable or premature infant</strong> – Unstable infants or infants with serious medical conditions should not undergo circumcision because it is an elective procedure. We delay circumcision until infants are at least 24 hours of age. This interval allows time for identification of other health issues that may take precedence over an elective circumcision. In general, premature infants have circumcision postponed until they are otherwise healthy and preparing for discharge home.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding diathesis</strong> – To maximize safety, infants with a bleeding diathesis or family history of blood dyscrasia should undergo circumcision in a setting with clinicians who have experience managing clotting abnormalities and where clotting factor replacement is available. Coagulopathy significantly increases the risk of bleeding associated with circumcision; therefore, the appropriate factor replacement should be given prior to any invasive procedure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1314.html" rel="external">"Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B", section on 'Circumcision'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Identification of children with bleeding disorders is presented separately.

Instead, these patients are referred to a specialist for further evaluation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Specific penile anomalies that are contraindications to neonatal circumcision include [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hypospadias with foreskin abnormalities  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107623" href="/d/graphic/107623.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58046" href="/d/graphic/58046.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6583.html" rel="external">"Hypospadias: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Chordee, ventral, or lateral curvature of the penis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Penile torsion (suggested by a urethral meatus in an orientation &gt;45 degrees from vertical)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Penoscrotal webbing (ie, webbed penis)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Buried/hidden/concealed penis or large suprapubic fat pad</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Significant penile edema</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Micropenis</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Evaluation of the patient to identify these anomalies is presented below (See <a class="local">'Examination of penis and scrotum'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1672375980"><span class="h1">TIMING OF PROCEDURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While there are limited data on the optimal timing of circumcision, clamp- and bell-style circumcisions are generally recommended during the first six weeks of life. Most neonatal circumcisions are performed during the first week of life, with members of the Jewish religion ceremonially performing circumcision on the eighth day. Thus, a large proportion of these early circumcisions are completed during the birth hospitalization prior to initial discharge home. Waiting until at least 24 hours of life provides time to confirm infant stability and assess for medical abnormalities. In general, because neonatal circumcision is an elective procedure, circumcision is delayed in infants with any medical issue (eg, fever, respiratory distress). In an observational study comparing Gomco clamp circumcisions done in the first 30 days of life (local anesthesia) with those done after three months of life (under general anesthesia), 30 percent of patients in the older age group had postoperative bleeding requiring intervention compared with none in the early age group [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The increased incidence of postoperative bleeding may have been a result of larger caliber cutaneous vessels encountered in the post-neonatal period.</p><p>If a patient presents for circumcision after the neonatal period, intervention is often delayed until approximately six months of age because the patient will require general anesthetic and a sleeve-type circumcision, rather than a clamp or bell procedure performed with local anesthetic.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">PAIN CONTROL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Since analgesia reduces procedural pain with minimal risk, it is routinely provided when neonatal circumcision is performed [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Effective analgesic options for neonatal circumcision include topical agents and injected nerve blocks [<a href="#rid3">3,6</a>]. As no technique is clearly superior, selection depends on the training of the clinician and the availability of agents.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1517344118"><span class="h2">Our approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We have found that the combination of oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="17089" href="/d/drug information/17089.html" rel="external">sucrose</a> and dorsal penile nerve block provides excellent analgesia, and thus we use this approach in our practice. Use of a positioning board (supine position) provides excellent exposure, supports the infant, and protects the areas of interest from injury due to inadvertent movement. In our practice, we use oral sucrose in conjunction with a pacifier, if approved by the parents or caregivers, to further soothe the infant [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The dorsal penile block with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> 1% without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> or 0.25% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a> without epinephrine is our preferred method for local anesthetic because use of a single injection reduces the risk of penile edema in comparison with the ring block. Additionally, at least one meta-analysis reports superiority in pain relief by dorsal penile block over topical anesthetics [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2985948390"><span class="h2">Local topical anesthetics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Local topical anesthetics commonly used for circumcision include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> 4% cream (LMX4) and EMLA cream (a eutectic mixture of lidocaine 2.5% and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10228" href="/d/drug information/10228.html" rel="external">prilocaine</a> 2.5%). EMLA cream use has been associated with decreased heart rate and crying time compared with no treatment when applied prior to circumcision [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Pain control appears to be similar among LMX4, EMLA cream, and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB). While a 2004 meta-analysis of three trials (133 infants total) comparing EMLA with DPNB reported lower heart rate and pain scores with DPNB, subsequent trials reported similar or improved pain relief with EMLA. In a trial of 54 healthy, term, male infants randomly assigned to pretreatment with lidocaine 4% cream, EMLA, or DPNB, no differences were noted in overall pain control as assessed by heart rate [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Respiratory rates were higher for infants treated with EMLA cream and lowest for infants who received DPNB. Local skin reactions occurred in three infants (lidocaine cream = 1, EMLA cream = 2). No adverse outcomes occurred in the DPNB group. In a different trial comparing EMLA and DPNB in 100 children undergoing circumcision at less than six months of age, the overall pain control was similar in both groups, although the DPNB group had higher neonatal infant pain scale scores during certain steps of the procedure [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Advantages of local topical anesthetics include ease of use and lack of need for specialized training. The main disadvantage is skin irritation, with studies reporting an 8 to 14 percent incidence of erythema, swelling, and, rarely, blistering [<a href="#rid6">6,9,11</a>]. Low birth weight infants may be at increased risk for severe skin reactions such as blistering, and therefore at least one society advises against the use of topical anesthetics for low birth weight infants [<a href="#rid3">3,12,13</a>]. Disadvantages specific to EMLA include higher cost and the rare associated risk of methemoglobinemia in newborns, particularly premature infants, with a deficiency of methemoglobin reductase [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Topical anesthetics are applied generously to the foreskin (1 to 2 g) with recommended dwell times of at least 60 minutes for EMLA cream and 30 minutes for LMX4 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. One study reported efficacy with using reduced dwell times of 30 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, with effective pain relief [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Following application, an occlusive dressing is placed to ensure continued and full contact with the foreskin. Prior to circumcision, the dressing is removed, cream wiped away, and penis cleaned and prepared as discussed in the section on techniques.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1359084071"><span class="h2">Penile nerve block</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2767335800"><span class="h3">Anatomy for nerve block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A pair of dorsal penile nerves provide sensation to the glans and shaft of the penis as well as to the foreskin. These nerves traverse along the penis, below Buck's fascia at the 1 to 2 o'clock and 9 to 10 o'clock positions  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76391" href="/d/graphic/76391.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). At the level of the pubis in neonates, the nerves run at a depth of 3 to 5 mm, depending on the patient's body habitus. Of importance, the superficial dorsal penile vessels run along the dorsal midline of the penis. It is imperative to avoid damage to these as troublesome bleeding may occur.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2290236258"><span class="h3">Dorsal penile block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>DPNB involves injecting 0.4 mL of 1% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a>, <strong>without</strong> <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>, bilaterally into the base of the penis at 2 and 10 o'clock  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79052" href="/d/graphic/79052.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). It is important to note that epinephrine-containing solutions should <strong>never</strong> be used on the external genitalia because severe vasoconstriction can occur and lead to varying degrees of penile loss.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 35 trials comparing DPNB with placebo, no treatment, and topical anesthetics for pain control in infants undergoing neonatal circumcision, DPNB was found to provide superior pain relief, although subsequent small trials have reported similar efficacy between DPNB and EMLA [<a href="#rid6">6,8,10</a>]. While <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> 1% without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> is the most commonly used agent, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a> 0.25% without epinephrine can also be utilized [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Lidocaine is often preferred because the onset of action is 1 to 5 minutes versus 5 to 10 minutes for bupivacaine. However, the duration of effect is shorter for lidocaine compared with bupivacaine (2 to 3 hours versus 4 to 8 hours for bupivacaine).</p><p>Supplies needed for dorsal penile block are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Restraint (eg, papoose, Circumstraint)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112321" href="/d/graphic/112321.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>1 mL syringe with 27 or 30 gauge needle for injection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Larger gauge needle for drawing up solution</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">Lidocaine</a> 1% or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a> 0.25% (without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alcohol prep pad</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3263636748"><span class="h4">Procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While several techniques exist for dorsal penile block, the ultimate goal is injection of local anesthetic at the 2 and 10 o'clock positions at the base of the penis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79052" href="/d/graphic/79052.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The author prefers to insert the injection needle through the skin at the midline, and then advance the tip of the needle laterally to inject medication at the correct positions  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112330" href="/d/graphic/112330.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). The advantage is that there is only one injection site, but the clinician must take care to avoid the midline vessels. Alternately, the clinician can insert the needle at each planned injection site and infuse the medication. This method requires two passes through the skin but avoids the midline vessels altogether.</p><p>Injection that is too superficial can cause anesthetic tracking along the penile shaft, which distorts landmarks and complicates the circumcision. Insertion of the needle too deeply can cause damage to midline penile vessels and lead to hematoma, penile distortion, and, rarely, uncontrolled bleeding. Intravascular injection of local anesthetic can cause cardiac arrhythmias. Frequent negative pressure aspiration of the syringe avoids the risk of intravascular injection.</p><p>We take the following approach:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Palpate the recess below the pubic bone at the base of the penis. Many infants have an enlarged suprapubic fat pad that can obscure the base of the penis. Palpating the pubic bone can help identify the location and depth of the base of the penis in comparison to the pubic bone, ultimately helping guide the angle and depth of injection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prep the base of the penis inferior to the pubic bone with an alcohol prep pad.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Puncture the skin with the 27-gauge needle at the midline. The needle remains subcutaneous. The clinician then angles the needle posterolateral and advances it approximately 3-5mm under the pubic bone toward the base of the penis. The clinician may feel a slight pop as the needle traverses Buck's fascia, but this is not always evident when a small-gauge needle is used in a newborn.

The normal meatus should be vertical and located in the center of the tip  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112334" href="/d/graphic/112334.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>). If the urethra is not at the tip or rotated from vertical, circumcision is not performed. One challenge is that tight physiologic phimosis often obscures meatal visualization until the preputial orifice is dilated at the start of circumcision.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluate the median raphe – The median raphe, which normally runs the length of the penis and scrotum in the midline, may deviate to the side. While a deviated median raphe is not itself an absolute contraindication to circumcision, it can represent underlying penile abnormalities, such as penile curvature or torsion. Circumcision is not performed if penile torsion or curvature is present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluate the scrotum for penoscrotal webbing – The normal scrotum attaches at the base of the penis with a well-defined junction. If the junction is not well defined, it may be attached higher on the shaft of the penis. Circumcision can lead to scrotal attachment very near the glans, which shortens the ventral shaft skin. We apply gentle traction on the scrotum to define the point of attachment with the foreskin and assess the level of ventral tethering.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perform bedside erection test – To evaluate the curvature of the penis, and identify potential penile chordee or ventral curvature, we perform the bedside erection test by applying pressure with the thumb and index finger at the base of the penis to simulate an erection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The bedside erection test also allows the clinician to evaluate for a buried penis or a large suprapubic fat pad. Identification of these findings is important because these infants have a greater chance of the penis retracting below the skin surface post-circumcision, which can result in penile adhesions or circumferential scarring of the incision (cicatrix) that traps the penis below the skin surface. Such scarring can require circumcision revision under general anesthesia at a future date.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assess foreskin edema – If a circumcision is performed in the setting of excessive foreskin edema, there is increased risk of penile retraction with subsequent trapping of the glans below the skin surface as well as scarring that may require revision. This is especially important in patients who have a prolonged stay in the neonatal intensive care unit prior to circumcision, as edema can be present from resuscitative efforts. If the foreskin does not have the normal thin supple appearance and instead appears thickened, then we defer circumcision.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, some abnormalities are not uncovered until the fully intact foreskin is retracted and both the glans and meatal position can be assessed. If a hypospadias is identified after incision of the prepuce, at least three studies have reinforced that circumcision can be safely completed in patients who have a circumferentially intact prepuce and incidentally discovered hypospadias [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>]. For these patients, our practice is to advise completing the circumcision because completion avoids the need for future general anesthesia to perform circumcision revision and allows discussion with the family whether a very distal (glanular) hypospadias requires repair.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H96917995"><span class="h1">TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1208452210"><span class="h2">Choice of technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The three commonly used devices for neonatal circumcision are the Gomco clamp, Plastibell device, and Mogen clamp, or devices based on the principles of these three techniques [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].

However, the multiple parts of the device can cause unique challenges.</p><p>Prior to initiating any Gomco clamp circumcision, ensure proper fit between the bell and base plate being used. Some sets have the size embossed into the metal of both the plate and bell; however, occasionally no markings exist. For a proper fit, the lip of the bell should seat perfectly into the base plate without any gaps. We check to ensure that no light penetrates the junction. Additionally, there should be a gap of 2 mm between the arm of the bell and the plate before the nut is tightened. If the device has been damaged or packaged with a non-corresponding size, delay circumcision until a properly fit device is available. A mismatched or damaged device could result in significant bleeding because of an inadequate seal [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>After the initial steps above have been performed, circumcision with a Gomco clamp is completed in the following manner:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cut a dorsal slit to a level just distal to the coronal margin (within 2 to 3 mm)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76391" href="/d/graphic/76391.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Insert the bell of the Gomco clamp under the foreskin and cover the glans  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67747" href="/d/graphic/67747.html" rel="external">picture 16</a>).

If not adequately covered, then the glans could sustain injury during amputation of the foreskin.

Use gentle traction to deliver the foreskin through the base plate and seat the bell into the plate. Even traction is applied to maintain a symmetric appearance. A single hemostat is then used to grasp the cut edges of the dorsal slit and reapproximate it at the 12 o'clock position.

A string is tied around the bell and tightened to devitalize the prepuce. All foreskin distal to the ligature will become necrotic and fall away with the bell in a few days to a week. Since the glans is protected by the ring and the foreskin is allowed to fall off on its own, the risk of glans amputation or urethral injury is minimal.</p><p>A neonatal circumcision with Plastibell shares the initial steps with the other techniques. A minor difference is the extent of dorsal slit needed. The Plastibell device requires more foreskin to remain intact circumferentially for positioning of the string around the plastic bell. Therefore, just enough of a dorsal slit (if any) is made to fully retract the foreskin, clear away any adhesions and place the proper sized bell over the glans within the foreskin [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After an adequate dorsal slit is made and the glans is evaluated, choose the appropriate size bell.

Evaluate the glans and urethra.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Place a single hemostat along the dorsal midline of the foreskin and grasp the glans with the thumb and forefinger of the non-dominant hand.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Mogen clamp  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74976" href="/d/graphic/74976.html" rel="external">picture 30</a>) is then opened and placed across the foreskin between the hemostat and grasped glans  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55011" href="/d/graphic/55011.html" rel="external">picture 31</a>). The side with the groove is aligned toward the glans. The Mogen clamp is angled to mimic that of the corona, and thus removes more foreskin dorsally than ventrally.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is <strong>critical</strong> to release any tension on the hemostat and foreskin. Traction on the frenulum can rotate the glans dorsally placing the ventral glans and urethra in danger of being incorporated into the clamp and subsequently amputated. In a retrospective review of 6 cases of glans amputation and urethral injury from Mogen clamp circumcision, traction on the frenulum appeared to increase the risk of this devastating complication [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Close and lock the clamp. Once locked, the Mogen clamp remains in place for a few minutes to ensure hemostasis. Since the Mogen clamp seals a wider area than the Gomco clamp, a full 5 minutes may not be necessary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Amputate any foreskin distal to the clamp with a scalpel  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70782" href="/d/graphic/70782.html" rel="external">picture 32</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Release the clamp. The remaining skin will be stuck together distally over the glans. The skin is separated and retracted to free the glans.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Apply dressings of choice.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1103848029"><span class="h1">HEMOSTASIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If bleeding occurs, <strong>electrocautery should never be used in conjunction with metal clamps because devastating penile loss can occur</strong>.</p><p>Bleeding most commonly results from disruption of the frenular vessels in response to excessive force on the frenulum. Other causes of bleeding include a mismatched Gomco bell and plate (which results in poor compression of the cut edge), premature removal of the clamps, older patients (who have larger caliber vessels), and a loose Plastibell string.</p><p>We take the following approach to bleeding:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>First, we apply direct pressure, as this will stop most bleeding. A compressive wrap such as Coban can resolve modest bleeding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For mild continued bleeding, we apply hemostatic agents such as thrombin, Gelfoam, or Surgicel. Choice depends on availability of the products. Additionally, hemostatic agents can be used in conjunction with a compressive wrap around the penis. Of note, when using the Plastibell device, hemostatic agents should not be packed into the bell obscuring the meatus. This can lead to difficulty urinating.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>However, for excessive bleeding, particularly frenular bleeding or when a vessel can be identified, we suture the bleeding edge with a fine absorbable suture placed transversely. Our preference is a 5-0 Vicryl suture. Care must be taken to place the suture superficially, as the urethra lies in the ventral midline and can easily be incorporated in the suture. An inadvertently sutured urethra can result in an urethrocutaneous fistula. Vicryl suture placed to control bleeding is allowed to naturally dissolve and fall off. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h1">POST-CIRCUMCISION CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Basic surgical principles guide post-circumcision care. There are no data to guide choice of dressing and the selection is based on the clinician's preference. We apply a barrier cream to reduce the risk of penile adhesions and meatal stenosis [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. We typically use a petroleum jelly for the duration of treatment (ie, until the skin has healed, or generally two weeks). The shaft skin should not be forcibly retracted; however, in some boys, the shaft skin will preferentially sit upon the glans due to penile retraction or suprapubic adipose tissue. For these patients, gently retracting the skin to visualize the incision and applying ointment may help reduce the rate of penile adhesions requiring revision. We also instruct parents or care providers to apply the barrier ointment to the glans and diaper to help prevent meatal stenosis. We provide written information on the care of the penis for the parents or caretakers.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Neonatal circumcision is extremely common and can be safely performed starting 24 hours after birth up to six weeks of life. (See <a class="local">'Development and anatomy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Timing of procedure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> – Circumcision should not be performed in unstable or significantly premature infants, or if congenital penile anomalies are present. Development of the foreskin coincides with the development of the penis; therefore, anatomic abnormalities of the penis often result in incomplete or abnormal foreskin. Relative contraindications include lack of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9771" href="/d/drug information/9771.html" rel="external">vitamin K</a> supplementation, no documented void, and bleeding disorder or family history of abnormal bleeding. For these patients, the procedure is delayed until these criteria have been met or until the procedure can be performed at an adequately prepared facility. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Informed consent</strong> – The risks and benefits of circumcision versus not circumcising, as well as the risks and benefits of the procedure itself, should be fully discussed with the parents or caretakers as part of the consent process. Parents or caretakers should be given sufficient time to ask questions. Written information is also provided that reviews the risks and benefits  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65954" href="/d/graphic/65954.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and the postoperative care  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74975" href="/d/graphic/74975.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). After satisfactory discussion, a written consent is obtained. (See <a class="local">'Informed consent'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Analgesia</strong> – Analgesia, in the form of topical anesthetics or nerve blocks, is routinely provided when neonatal circumcision is performed. As no technique is clearly superior, selection depends on the training of the clinician and the availability of agents. Non-pharmacologic techniques, such as non-nutritive sucking (eg, pacifier or gloved finger), oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="17089" href="/d/drug information/17089.html" rel="external">sucrose</a> solution, and positioning, do not provide adequate analgesia but can be used in conjunction with pharmacologic techniques to further soothe the patient. (See <a class="local">'Pain control'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – Prior to performing circumcision, we perform a physical examination to evaluate the anatomy, make an operative plan, and exclude visible congenital anomalies. When hypospadias is encountered during the circumcision in a patient with fully intact prepuce preprocedure, the circumcision can be safely completed without compromising future repair. Stopping the procedure after a dorsal slit commits the patient to a further surgical procedure under general anesthesia for revision. (See <a class="local">'Examination of penis and scrotum'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of technique</strong>– For patients undergoing neonatal circumcision, we suggest any of the three circumcision techniques (Gomco clamp, Plastibell, or Mogen clamp)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112345" href="/d/graphic/112345.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_4" rel="external">Grade 2A</a>). The proceduralist must be well trained in the specific technique utilized. (See <a class="local">'Choice of technique'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Initial steps</strong> – The initial steps of the procedure are the same regardless of surgical device. Key steps for improving cosmetic appearance and minimizing complications include ensuring complete separation of preputial adhesions from the glanular epithelium, full visualization of the coronal sulcus, and proper tensioning of the foreskin prior to excision. The foreskin should be straight, without folds, but not stretched. (See <a class="local">'Initial steps'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Control of bleeding – If bleeding occurs, <strong>electrocautery should never be used in conjunction with metal clamps because devastating penile loss can occur</strong>.
