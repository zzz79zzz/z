         Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are given to children for a wide range of indications, including anemia due to congenital or acquired disease as well as blood loss from trauma or surgery. Once the decision to transfuse RBCs has been made, the most appropriate RBC product must be chosen. Donated whole blood used for transfusion is modified in several ways that remove varying proportions of non-RBC components, thereby allowing selection of RBC products based upon clinical needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the different RBC products and indications for their use in infants (beyond the neonatal period) and children. RBC transfusion in neonates and other aspects of RBC transfusion in infants and children are discussed separately:

         RBC units can be stored refrigerated for up to 42 days, but few units are stored that long because there is usually constant turnover in the blood bank inventory. The average storage duration of RBC units transfused in the United States is approximately two to three weeks [

         In a multicenter trial involving 1538 critically ill children (including medical, surgical, and trauma patients) randomized to receive either fresh RBCs (median storage duration five days) or standard-issue RBCs (median storage duration 18 days), rates of new-onset multiorgan dysfunction, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality were similar in both groups [
         <a href="#rid3">

         "Leukoreduction" refers to the removal of white blood cells (WBCs) from blood products at time of collection by highly efficient filters that reduce the number of WBCs by &gt;99.9 percent, generally to &lt;1 × 10
         <sup>

         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Though this process greatly reduces the number of WBCs, the few remaining WBCs are capable of replication and can cause transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) in susceptible individuals. Thus, leukoreduction alone is insufficient to prevent TA-GVHD and patients at risk for TA-GVHD require leukoreduced and irradiated RBC units, as discussed below. (See

         Many blood banks in the United States, Canada, and other countries have adopted a policy of "universal leukoreduction," in which all RBC and apheresis platelet products are leukoreduced [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. However, there is variation in practice and ongoing debate about the cost effectiveness of this approach. The clinician should be aware of the policies of the local blood center. If the local blood center does not use universal leukoreduction, leukoreduced products should be specifically ordered when they are desired [
         <a href="#rid7">

         While acknowledging local variation in transfusion policies and the need for individualized clinical judgment, we generally agree with guidelines developed by pediatric transfusion medicine specialists and suggest using leukoreduced RBC units for patients requiring RBC transfusions in the following clinical settings [

         Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction – Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions appear to be mediated by leukocyte-derived cytokines and direct donor cell leukocyte interactions. Leukoreduction significantly reduces but does not completely eliminate these reactions [

         HLA alloimmunization – HLA alloimmunization can be induced by HLA antigens expressed on donor leukocytes in recipients who receive multiple transfusions. Allosensitization increases the risk of graft rejection in children who subsequently receive organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It also increases platelet refractoriness in patients who need multiple platelet transfusions, (eg, children with leukemia or other malignancies). Leukoreduction reduces the incidence of alloimmunization. (See

         Transfusion-associated immunomodulation (TRIM) – Transfusion of allogeneic blood has an immunosuppressive effect, which is known as TRIM. WBCs play a major causative role in TRIM, and leukoreduction is thought to reduce immunosuppression, but this purported benefit of leukoreduction is not well established and is controversial [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         TRIM may also result in autoimmune tissue damage, as illustrated in a study of young children undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Patients who received leukoreduced blood had lower levels of malondialdehyde (a marker of cardiac ischemic injury) compared with those who received blood without leukoreduction. Despite these reports, the role of leukoreduction in decreasing TRIM remains uncertain.

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to reducing adverse effects of RBC transfusion, it has been suggested that the removal of WBCs makes transfusion physically easier, especially through the small catheters that may be required in newborns [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

          2,17

         The risk of CMV transmission is eliminated almost entirely by the transfusion of blood from donors who are CMV seronegative. However, rare transmission of CMV has been documented when the donor is viremic and in the "window period" following exposure to the virus, before the development of antibodies, or when the antibody titer is below the limits of detection [

        <p>
         In settings where the seropositivity for CMV is high, there may be insufficient CMV-seronegative donors to fill the need for CMV-safe blood products. For example, in the Unites States, 40 to 90 percent of donors are CMV seropositive. For this reason, blood donor centers in the United States provide leukoreduced blood products more commonly than seronegative blood products when CMV-safe blood is required. Fortunately, leukoreduction is effective in reducing the risk of transmission of CMV. However, rare cases of CMV have been associated with transfusion of either leukoreduced or seronegative blood products [

         Irradiated RBCs are used in patients at risk for TA-GVHD. TA-GVHD is caused by viable donor lymphocytes that are transfused into a patient who either does not recognize these cells as foreign or does not have the capacity to destroy them. TA-GVHD usually begins 8 to 10 days following transfusion and is almost inevitably fatal. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7928.html" rel="external">
          "Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Exposure of the blood product to gamma or x-ray irradiation at a standard dose prior to transfusion stops proliferation of foreign lymphocytes, which entirely prevents TA-GVHD. However, the dose of radiation used for cellular blood products is not sufficient to kill viruses. Thus, irradiation does not provide a CMV-safe product and does not eliminate the need for either leukoreduction or CMV-seronegative blood products if a CMV-safe product is required [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, leukoreduction does not eliminate all viable donor lymphocytes and leukoreduced but nonirradiated products can result in TA-GVHD. (See

         – In immunocompetent individuals, TA-GVHD may develop in a partial HLA match when the recipient is heterozygous at an HLA allele for which the donor is homozygous. In these instances, donor WBCs will not be recognized as foreign by the host, but the donor cells may recognize host cells as foreign and mount a TA-GVHD reaction. There is an increased likelihood of this occurring in blood relatives or if the donor and recipient are members of a population that is genetically homogeneous. As a result, blood products donated by family members should be irradiated before transfusing into a blood relative. (See

         Elevated potassium – Irradiated RBC units tend to have increased concentrations of potassium since the potassium level increases during storage after irradiation. This disadvantage is particularly relevant for the pediatric age group. For the ordinary, small-volume, slow transfusion levels of potassium in a unit are safe at any time before expiration, whether or not the unit has been irradiated [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32

         <a href="#rid32">
          32-34
         </a>
         ]. As an example, one case report described hyperkalemia in an infant following the transfusion of RBCs that were six days old and had been irradiated 48 hours prior to transfusion [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         To minimize increases in serum potassium, irradiation of RBCs should be performed shortly before transfusion to decrease the amount of potassium leak. However, this may not be possible in all cases, particularly in hospitals that do not have an irradiator on site.

         For patients who are receiving massive transfusion (defined as replacement &gt;50 percent of a patient's blood volume in three hours, those receiving exchange transfusions, or other clinical settings with anticipated large volumes of transfused blood), the supernatant solution containing excess potassium can be removed by washing the RBCs prior to transfusion if freshly irradiated RBCs are not available.

          36

         Transfusion of whole blood has limited use in pediatric patients. It is not readily available in many settings, including most hospitals in the United States. Whole blood (either collected and transfused or reconstituted [RBCs combined with plasma]) is most commonly used in clinical circumstances when it is desirable to use a blood product with a lower hematocrit than that of an RBC unit (eg, patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, ECMO, exchange transfusion, or massive transfusion). Interest in using group O whole blood with a low titer anti-A and anti-B has been increasing, especially in patients with severe trauma who require massive transfusion [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37-39
         </a>
         ]. The rationale for use is that it provides RBCs, plasma, and platelets in an appropriate ratio in a single transfusion. (See

         The use of fresh whole blood for children undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass is not a standard practice.

          40

         For infants &lt;4 months of age, maternal antibodies to RBC antigens may be present; fetal antibody production is limited. In emergency situations, any young infant requiring transfusion can be issued group O, RhD-negative RBCs. In nonemergency settings, the infant's blood is tested for ABO and RhD type and a screen is performed for unexpected RBC antibodies using plasma or serum from the infant or mother [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Testing for anti-D is particularly critical because this antibody is found in infants whose mothers were given RhD

         There are two approaches to RBC transfusion in newborns and young infants: use of group O, RhD-negative blood for all infants or use of ABO- and RhD-compatible RBCs. Institution-specific guidelines should be followed; these are generally developed based on the frequency of newborn transfusions and available blood products:

         Group O, RhD-negative RBCs for all infants – Some institutions use this approach for all transfusions to infants &lt;4 months old to simplify blood banking procedures. Possible risks of this approach are that the group O RBCs may include a small amount of anti-A and anti-B in the associated plasma, which can cause hemolysis in the infant with blood type A, B, or AB. This concern is most relevant in preterm infants because of their small blood volume. Some institutions wash the RBC prior to transfusion to remove these antibodies and reduce the risk of hemolysis; this can also be done for preterm infants. Another challenge of this approach is that it can contribute to shortages of group O RhD-negative RBCs.

         ABO- and RhD-compatible RBCs – Some institutions issue ABO- and RhD-compatible RBCs. In this case, the infant must
         <strong>
          also
         </strong>
         be tested for "passive" anti-A and/or anti-B depending on the infant's ABO (ie, anti-A or anti-B of maternal origin). These antibodies are detected by an indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) test, which can be done on the infant's plasma. If anti-A or anti-B are detected, RBCs lacking the corresponding antigen must be transfused.

        </p>
        <p>
         Infants requiring transfusion because of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn require additional considerations when selecting RBCs for transfusion, as outlined in a separate topic review. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5041.html" rel="external">

         Other aspects of RBC transfusion in the newborn, including the indications and administration, are discussed in separately. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If the initial antibody screen is negative, compatibility testing may be omitted during the same hospitalization for most infants up to four months of age [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,44
         </a>
         ]. This is because infants do not usually develop alloantibodies against RBCs in response to transfusions until at least four months of age [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. This approach minimizes the amount of blood that must be drawn from small infants for laboratory testing. A newborn may acquire passive anti-A or anti-B through a transfusion of ABO-incompatible plasma or platelets or through massive transfusion. In this case, a transfusion of group O RBC may be given. Alternatively, immediate spin crossmatching may be performed if group A or group B RBCs are given.

         Many hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) occur from ABO-incompatible donors. Transfusion in this setting can be complex because erythroid engraftment may be delayed if the recipient has strong antibodies to donated cells. Generally, donor type O or compatible RBCs are washed to remove incompatible plasma. Products containing plasma should be compatible with both donor and recipient cells. These precautions are continued until recipient antibodies are no longer detected. (See

         When blood is needed urgently, it may be provided uncrossmatched through an emergency release process that is available in all blood banks. If the child's ABO group and RhD type are known to the blood bank on the current specimen, ABO compatible RBCs and other components will be provided, without crossmatching. If the group and type are not known, O RBCs and AB platelets and plasma are used; if the recipient is a female, the RBCs should be RhD-negative to avoid RhD sensitization that could affect a future pregnancy.

         Type-specific blood is used without further serologic testing. Massive transfusion increases the risk for a variety of metabolic and hemostatic abnormalities, particularly in neonates and infants. Dilutional coagulopathy may occur if only RBCs have been transfused; as a result, plasma and platelets should be included for patients receiving a massive transfusion. Trauma also can contribute to an acute coagulopathy, through a variety of mechanisms. Electrolytes and acid-base balance should be monitored carefully since the large amount of stored blood products transfused in this setting may lead to serious hyperkalemia [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32

         ]. Hypokalemia associated with metabolic alkalosis is also possible due to the large amount of citrate metabolized to bicarbonate. Other abnormalities associated with massive transfusion include hypocalcemia, hyper- or hypoglycemia, and hypothermia. (See

         Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) undergo repeated transfusions and often develop alloantibodies. Approximately 30 to 40 percent of patients with SCD will develop at least one antibody and, over the course of years of transfusion, multiple antibodies. In order to find compatible units for transfusion, it may be necessary to procure units of RBCs from a rare donor bank; however, even with this strategy, it may be impossible to provide fully compatible blood. Some patients with SCD develop autoantibodies and/or have an unexplained delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, a phenomenon that is poorly understood. Hemolysis also may occur in the absence of RBC antibodies; this condition is known as "hyperhemolysis syndrome" and is characterized by an acute decrease in hemoglobin after the transfusion. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT; also known as Coombs test) is usually negative. The patient's reticulocyte count also drops from the baseline [

         In infants and children with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which the patient's RBCs are destroyed by autoantibodies, transfusion can be challenging because most autoantibodies are reactive with virtually all RBCs (ie, "panreactive"). As a result, every available donor unit may appear to be incompatible by crossmatch. It is important for the blood bank to exclude the simultaneous presence of alloantibodies that have developed from previous transfusion(s). If underlying alloantibodies can be excluded, hemolytic transfusion reactions will be rare even if the blood that is incompatible is used. Despite the risks, it is important to ensure that transfusion therapy should never be withheld from a patient with autoimmune hemolytic anemia and life-threatening anemia. (See

          Leukoreduced RBCs
         </strong>
         – Leukoreduction removes white blood cells (WBCs) from blood products using special filters. Leukoreduction is widely used in infants and children to reduce febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, prevent alloimmunization, and reduce the transmission of certain infections (notably cytomegalovirus [CMV]). However, leukoreduction does not eliminate all lymphocytes. Therefore, blood products given to patients at risk for transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) should also be irradiated. (See

         – The term "CMV-reduced-risk" (or "CMV-safe") is typically used to describe products that are either leukoreduced or CMV seronegative. Use of either of these products reduces the transmission of CMV. These products are recommended for CMV-seronegative recipients with special risks for CMV disease. (See

          Irradiated RBCs
         </strong>
         – Irradiation of RBCs prevents TA-GVHD in susceptible recipients. Indications for irradiation include directed donor blood products that will be transfused into a blood relative and immunodeficiency due to a variety of conditions in which the transfusion recipient is at risk for TA-GVHD (
