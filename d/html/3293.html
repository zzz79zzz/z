         The introduction of non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA) techniques has greatly increased the use of endometrial ablation as a therapeutic option for patients with abnormal uterine bleeding. NREA is performed with a device that is inserted into the uterine cavity and delivers energy to uniformly destroy the uterine lining. NREA techniques are also referred to as second generation ablation.
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA) techniques are performed under hysteroscopic visualization, using resectoscopic instruments to ablate or resect the endometrium. NREA techniques are more widely practiced than REA, since they require less specialized training and have a shorter operative time [

          ROLE OF HYSTEROSCOPY
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Most NREA techniques do not require hysteroscopy, with the exception of the Hydro ThermAblator, during which hot water is instilled into the uterus through a hysteroscopic sheath. For other techniques, preoperative hysteroscopy is necessary only if the uterine cavity has not been assessed for leiomyomas or endometrial polyps in the preoperative period. Also, the manufacturer of the microwave ablation system advises hysteroscopic evaluation before and after ablation [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The endometrial cavity should be assessed preoperatively in all patients undergoing endometrial ablation. Performing this assessment of the uterus during the preoperative evaluation is optimal, since it helps to guide surgical planning (eg, preparing for myomectomy if a submucosal fibroid is present). If the uterine cavity has not been assessed preoperatively, a diagnostic hysteroscopy should be performed just prior to the ablation procedure. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3316.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of endometrial ablation", section on 'Assessment of the uterus'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Postoperative hysteroscopy is potentially useful to identify areas of remaining endometrium or detect uterine perforation. Some surgeons ablate endometrial remnants using resectoscopic instruments. However, the clinical benefit of hysteroscopy for these indications is uncertain. There are no data regarding whether small amounts of residual endometrium following NREA impact treatment success; data suggest that partial REA is successful [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Evaluation of uterine perforation after blind transcervical procedures is usually performed only in selected patients in whom there is reason to suspect perforation (eg, an instrument was inserted past the depth of the uterine fundus). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3309.html" rel="external">

         The bipolar radiofrequency device (NovaSure) is a three-dimensional bipolar mesh probe that delivers radiofrequency current (a type of electrical energy) until a specific tissue impedance is reached  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81118 graphicRef61150" href="/z/d/graphic/81118.html" rel="external">
          figure 1A-B
         </a>
         ). The NovaSure generator applies up to 180 watts of power.
        </p>
        <p>
         The device is inserted into the uterine cavity and the mesh is expanded until it is in contact with the endometrium. Suction is then applied to the endometrial cavity, thereby drawing the endometrium closer to the bipolar mesh probe. The suction also removes debris and vapor that can increase impedance and reduce the depth of energy penetration. The system will shut down when complete desiccation has occurred (calculated at a tissue impedance of 50 ohms of resistance) or after a total treatment time of two minutes. The average treatment time is just over one minute and the average depth of ablation is 4 to 5 millimeters.
        </p>
        <p>
         The system also evaluates cavity integrity by emitting carbon dioxide and assessing for leaks. If the integrity check fails, the user will not be able to activate the ablation phase of the procedure.

         Cryoablation by Her Option is a technique in which a cryoprobe is inserted into the uterine cavity  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70561 graphicRef61286" href="/z/d/graphic/70561.html" rel="external">
          figure 2A-B
         </a>
         ). The probe is cooled either by liquid nitrogen or by differential gas exchange. An elliptical ice ball approximately 3.5 by 5 centimeters forms around the probe when it is cooled to less than -90°C. At the edge of the ice ball, the tissue temperature is 0°C, which is nondestructive. A temperature of -20°C is lethal to tissue; this temperature is reached approximately 3 to 5 mm from the edge of the ice ball. Therefore, the endometrial tissue exposed to this low temperature, including the basalis layer of the endometrium  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54487" href="/z/d/graphic/54487.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ), is permanently destroyed. The number of ice balls that must be created to destroy the entire uterine cavity is dependent upon the size of the cavity. Intraoperative ultrasonography is used to monitor probe placement and depth of tissue freezing. In general, two to three ice balls are sufficient  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50633" href="/z/d/graphic/50633.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). Each freeze cycle takes two to six minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cryoablation by the Cerene technique is performed using nitric oxide as a freezing agent. The cervix is dilated to insert the 6 mm device probe, and the uterus is sounded to determine the length of the uterine cavity. Prior to probe insertion, the exhaust hose is connected to the exhaust bag. The device is turned on and the probe is inserted up to the uterine fundus to ensure that the number on the probe correlates with the known size of the uterine cavity. The sheath retraction nob is turned until the LCD screen displays 2.5 cm. The cavity liner is deployed and safety checks are performed to detect any possible perforation. The sheath retraction knob is turned until the uterine cavity length is selected and final safety checks are performed; treatment is started for 2.5 minutes. After treatment, the vent lock is then unlocked to vent the remaining nitric oxide. The uterine cavity is allowed to thaw and the vacuum is initiated within the liner to expedite device removal.

         ]. There were few adverse events; major complications included, in the Her Option group, one patient who underwent a hysterectomy 43 days after the procedure for severe uterine bleeding and one patient who was treated with rollerball was hospitalized for hematometra. At two-year follow-up, patients in the Her Option group compared with the rollerball group had similar rates of either reduced uterine bleeding or amenorrhea (94 versus 92 percent). Rates of hysterectomy (7 and 8 percent) and repeat ablation (3 and 1 percent) were similar between groups.

        <p>
         The Cerene device was evaluated in a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study including 242 patients (mean age 40.1 years) undergoing treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB); there were no reported major adverse device effects or major adverse events [

The primary effectiveness endpoint (reduction of bleeding at 12 months) was achieved in 77 percent of patients and the majority (90 percent) of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with their outcome; outcome results were not available for eight patients. Four patients (1.7 percent) required further intervention (medical or surgical) for continued HMB.

         Use of cold destroys tissue and may also cause numbness. Therefore, cryoablation is potentially less painful than the other NREA techniques, which all use high temperatures. Less perioperative pain is an advantage for use with no anesthesia or with local anesthesia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another unique feature of cryoablation is the use of perioperative sonography. This serves as both an advantage and disadvantage. Cryoablation is not a totally blind procedure, which helps to ensure complete ablation and avoid complications. On the other hand, it can be difficult to visualize the ice ball if the patient is obese and the need for sonography adds to the expertise and/or personnel required to perform the procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
         An advantage of the Cerene device is that while endometrial preparation may be used, the procedure also can be performed in the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle without endometrial preparation. Another advantage is the absence of postoperative intrauterine synechiae and the ability to evaluate the endometrium after treatment. In the prospective study described above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Outcome'

         above), of the 223 patients who underwent hysteroscopy 12 months after their Cerene cryoablation procedure, complete evaluation of the uterine cavity was possible in 204 out of 220 (93 percent) patients; uterine cavity entry was not possible in three patients due to pain intolerance or cervical stenosis [

         Hydrothermal ablation (Hydro ThermAblator [HTA]) refers to a technique in which a hysteroscope sheath is inserted into the uterine cavity under direct hysteroscopic visualization  (

          saline
         </a>
         is administered into the uterus through the sheath. To maintain a low uterine distension pressure (&lt;70 mmHg), the fluid is instilled using gravity rather than a pump. The treatment phase lasts for 10 minutes, during which the fluid should be at a temperature of 90°C. An intrauterine cool down phase is then performed for one minute with the fluid at 45°C.
        </p>
        <p>
         Safety apparatus within the equipment detects whether any fluid has escaped from the closed system, which will shut down if more than 10 cc of fluid are lost, whether through the cervix, fallopian tubes, or a uterine perforation.

         The primary advantage of this method is that it can be performed in patients with intracavitary lesions. The circulating hot water will contact the entire endometrial surface regardless of cavity irregularity  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62535" href="/z/d/graphic/62535.html" rel="external">
          figure 6
         </a>
         ). There is a report of use of HTA in two patients with bicornuate uteri, but ablation in patients with uterine anomalies is not standard practice [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19

         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Another advantage of HTA is that it is done under direct visualization, so the operator can ensure that the entire uterine lining has been destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perioperative pain is a potential disadvantage of HTA. The hysteroscope used has a large diameter (7.8 mm) and hot water stimulates pain from nerve fibers within the myometrium.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, external burns appear to be more frequent following HTA than other NREA procedures. There have been reports of vaginal, perineal, and leg burns from contact with hot water when there was a poor seal on the cervix or when the sheath was removed before the intrauterine fluid has cooled [

         The vapor ablation device (Mara) uses water vapor to ablate the endometrium. A disposable handheld device is inserted through the cervix and into the uterus to deliver vapor for 120 seconds to ablate endometrial tissue. To use this system, the vapor probe is inserted inside the uterine cavity, after which three positioning balloons are inflated to seal the uterine cavity. A uterine cavity integrity test is performed to ensure the absence of vapor leaks, and a lumen patency test is performed to confirm that the vapor probe is positioned unobstructed by blood or tissue. Vapor delivery is then delivered for 140 seconds. The first 20 seconds of vapor delivery displaces the remaining

         from the patency test and then ablation is carried out for 120 seconds. During that time, the vapor generator regulates the vapor pressure based on feedback from a pressure sensor near the distal tip of the vapor probe and monitors temperature via a thermocouple on a positioning probe.

         Microwave Endometrial Ablation (MEA) is a 9.2 GHz, 30 watt, microwave system  (

          figure 7
         </a>
         ). When inserted into the uterine cavity, this energy will produce a tissue temperature of 75 to 85°C at a depth of 6 mm. In order to treat the entire uterine cavity, the surgeon moves the probe from cornu to cornu and across the lower uterine segment until the entire endometrium has reached the desired temperature. Total treatment time is three to five minutes. Unlike other NREA devices, the probe is reusable.

         The manufacturer of MEA advises hysteroscopic evaluation before and after ablation, in contrast with other NREA devices.

Excessive intraoperative bleeding occurred in five patients in the resection group and none in the MEA group; however, three patients treated with MEA were readmitted with secondary hemorrhage. In patients followed for 10 or more years, those treated with MEA compared with resection had similar rates of amenorrhea (83 and 88 percent). The rate of repeat ablation was similar in patients treated with MEA compared with resection (1 versus 2 percent); however, the hysterectomy rate differed significantly (17 versus 28 percent).

         The labeling from the manufacturer of this device includes the treatment of patients with small submucosal leiomyomas (≤3 cm). The uterine cavity size maximum is larger than with the other NREA devices (12 to 14 cm versus 10 cm).

         These requirements were likely added because prior to the introduction of MEA in the United States, there were case reports from Europe in which bowel burns occurred in patients with no perforation of the uterus [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The etiology was presumed to be passage of microwave energy through the uterine walls. As a result, the FDA trial required that ultrasound be performed prior to the procedure and that the myometrium be at least 1 cm in thickness in all areas. The potential risk of ablation-associated injury in patients with thinning of the myometrium is not limited to microwave ablation. (See

         Studies with long-term follow-up report a wide range of treatment results. In patients who underwent hot liquid-filled balloon ablation with either ThermaChoice, Cavaterm, or an unspecified device and were followed for four or more years, there was reduced uterine bleeding in 22 to 81 percent and amenorrhea in 23 to 58 percent [

         Hot liquid-filled balloon techniques may cause more perioperative pain than other NREA techniques (see
         <a class="local">
          'Perioperative pain'
         </a>
         below). The likely mechanism of this is the stimulation of pain fibers by both the heat and uterine distention pressure produced during the procedure. However, with adequate preoperative analgesia (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral narcotics) and a paracervical block, the procedure can be performed in an office setting in appropriately selected patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         ThermaChoice was not evaluated in the FDA approval studies for use in patients with intracavitary lesions. However, some data suggest that hot liquid-filled balloon ablation is successful in this population. Hot liquid-filled balloon ablation was used successfully in 45 patients with submucosal fibroids ≤3 cm in a randomized trial comparing balloon versus rollerball ablation [
         <a href="#rid39">

        </p>
        <p>
         An additional disadvantage is that hot liquid-filled balloon techniques cannot be used in patients with intracavitary lesions since ablation occurs only where the balloon is in contact with the endometrium.

        <p>
         While there is one report of successful use of a liquid balloon in a patient with bicornuate uterus, endometrial ablation in patients with uterine anomalies is not standard practice [

         Factors that facilitate use in an office setting and/or under local anesthesia (eg, operative duration, perioperative pain). Office use offers benefits of greater patient acceptability, ease of scheduling, and reduced expense. Many surgeons do not have the office set-up to perform ablation; however, use of local anesthesia has fewer risks and adverse effects than general anesthesia, regardless of the operative setting. All NREA methods can be performed in an office setting and/or under local anesthesia, but some are more amenable to this approach than others (eg, shorter operative duration, less perioperative pain).

         For most patients with submucosal fibroids undergoing NREA, we suggest use of microwave ablation (when available) or cryoablation rather than other NREA methods since these devices were evaluated in the FDA approval studies in patients with small submucosal or intramural fibroids. Microwave ablation has the additional advantage of allowing for a larger cavity size than other methods (12 to 14 versus 10 cm). Although radiofrequency ablation and hot liquid-filled balloon ablation were not initially evaluated in patients with intracavitary lesions (submucosal fibroids, endometrial polyps), some data suggest that these methods can be used effectively in this population and labeling for circulating hot water ablation permits use in patients with submucosal fibroids that are ≤4 cm. Limited data are available for the vapor ablation with fibroids. (see

          Assessment of the uterine cavity and evaluation of myometrial thinning
         </strong>
         – The uterine cavity should be assessed for the presence of intracavitary lesions (eg, myomas, endometrial polyps), or other abnormalities (eg, uterine septum) that may interfere, or be removed concomitantly, with endometrial ablation. (See

         Patients with a history of transmural uterine surgery (eg, cesarean birth, myomectomy) should also be evaluated for myometrial thinning since ablation in patients with severe myometrial thinning can potentially result in visceral injury. Microwave ablation requires this measurement in all patients. However, this requirement does not add to the relative inconvenience of the procedure, since uterine imaging is required prior to all NREA procedures. This is discussed in more detail separately.

         </span>
         Pain is stimulated by cervical dilation, uterine distention, and burning of the endometrium (which stimulates pain fibers within the endometrium and myometrium).
        </p>
        <p>
         There are few comparative data regarding perioperative pain across NREA methods [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. Bipolar radiofrequency ablation and MEA appear to be associated with less perioperative pain than hot liquid-filled balloon procedures, based on data from randomized trials [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45,48,49
         </a>
         ]. In the randomized trial including 57 patients undergoing Novasure or Cavaterm balloon ablation discussed above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy'
         </a>
         above), perioperative pain was lower in the radiofrequency group [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, in the randomized trial including 320 patients undergoing MEA or ThermaChoice III ablation discussed above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy'
         </a>
         above), patients in the MEA group had a lower rate of using postoperative opiates (80 versus 89 percent) and antiemetics (26 versus 48 percent) compared with patients in the balloon group [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Cryoablation may result in even less perioperative pain as these devices use probes with the smallest diameter (approximately 5 mm; similar to ThermaChoice hot liquid-filled balloon), do not require uterine distention, and provide cryoanesthesia instead of heat (used with all other NREA devices) to burn the endometrium. Comparative data are needed to evaluate this theory.
