Depending on the nature and extent of revascularization, the approach to may involve only percutaneous access, a focal cutdown procedure, longer surgical incisions to access the arteries or to harvest veins, or a combination of these (eg, hybrid revascularization).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Endovascular procedures</strong> – Endovascular procedures use contrast arteriography to define the anatomy and extent of vessel occlusion. Interventions may include angioplasty with or without stenting/stent-grafting, and possibly thrombolytic agents for thrombolysis either as a primary procedure (eg, embolism) or as a rescue procedure to manage complications (eg, thrombosed stent). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15217.html" rel="external">"Endovascular techniques for lower extremity revascularization"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15218.html" rel="external">"Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy for the management of acute limb ischemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Endovascular procedures are performed via percutaneous access, typically at the level of the groin, but approaches can also include popliteal or pedal access. On occasion, a cutdown procedure may be required to gain access.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Focal open surgical procedures</strong> – Examples of focal procedures include endarterectomy of a stenotic vessel (eg, common femoral endarterectomy) or repair of a discrete arterial injury (eg, debridement and primary repair). Common femoral endarterectomy may be done as a standalone revascularization, but more typically it is an adjunctive procedure for surgical bypass or endovascular revascularization. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15220.html" rel="external">"Approach to revascularization for claudication due to peripheral artery disease", section on 'Common femoral artery'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16732.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of severe lower extremity injury", section on 'Revascularization'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Focal arterial procedures typically involve open surgical exposure directly over the vessel of interest, most typically the common femoral artery to perform embolectomy, or for endarterectomy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Open surgical bypass</strong> – For open surgical bypass grafting, the extent of surgical incisions varies depending on the nature of the proposed bypass and type of conduit used (eg, autogenous venous conduit, prosthetic conduit). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15194.html" rel="external">"Lower extremity surgical bypass techniques"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Arterial access for infrainguinal bypass procedures involves proximal and distal incisions in the extremity at the sites of arterial inflow and outflow to and from the graft, respectively. Typical locations include the groin, the distal thigh overlying the superficial femoral artery at the adductor canal, the medial proximal leg to access the popliteal or proximal tibial vessels, distally at the medial ankle (posterior tibial artery), or on the dorsal foot (anterior tibial artery). When prosthetic graft is used, the graft is tunnelled subcutaneously between these incisions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additional incisions are necessary to harvest vein for autogenous grafting. Vein harvesting for infrainguinal bypass is ideally from the ipsilateral great saphenous vein if adequate in diameter. Alternatively, other veins must be harvested, such as the contralateral great saphenous vein, the small saphenous vein(s), and at times, upper extremity vein(s) (eg, cephalic, basilic). Although these incisions can be extensive, they are limited to the subcutaneous tissues.</p><p></p><p>Management of complications related to lower extremity revascularization might include evacuation of an incisional hematoma, re-do lower extremity bypass grafting (eg, failed bypass, stent/stent-graft occlusion), or excision of graft material related to infection (eg, bypass, stent-graft). At times, amputation may be necessary to manage a failed bypass, or as a primary option for patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia who do not have any revascularization options. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15194.html" rel="external">"Lower extremity surgical bypass techniques", section on 'Complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15217.html" rel="external">"Endovascular techniques for lower extremity revascularization", section on 'Complications and management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15202.html" rel="external">"Access-related complications of percutaneous access for diagnostic or interventional procedures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2825150221"><span class="h1">PREANESTHETIC ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Comorbid conditions that may impact overall perioperative risk are common in patients with peripheral vascular conditions (eg, peripheral artery disease [PAD], aneurysm, thromboembolism). Goals of the preanesthetic consultation for elective procedures include working with the patient's primary care and/or cardiology teams to identify and manage treatable issues to ensure optimal preoperative condition. Particular attention is directed to management of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and renal insufficiency that may be exacerbated by the exposure to contrast necessary for endovascular procedures.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H209546106"><span class="h2">Cardiovascular risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients presenting for infrainguinal revascularization typically have a high incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiac valvular disease, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease, and postoperative myocardial injury is common [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Severe asymptomatic CAD was present in 55 percent of patients with lower extremity PAD in one study [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Patients with vascular trauma are younger with few cardiovascular comorbidities; however, extremity vascular trauma is associated with other injuries that may increase anesthetic and perioperative risk.</p><p>In a 2018 prospective cohort study of more than 15,000 vascular surgery patients, myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) was defined as elevation of fourth-generation troponin T ≥0.03 ng/mL [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Patients with MINS had significantly higher 30 day postoperative mortality (12.5 percent) compared with those without MINS (1.5 percent). Nearly three-quarters of the vascular surgical patients with MINS were asymptomatic in the postoperative period, with no overt evidence of myocardial ischemia [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Furthermore, in a retrospective study that included more than 16,000 patients undergoing vascular procedures, postoperative troponin elevation predicted a 26 percent reduction in survival five years after surgery, while overt postoperative myocardial infarction predicted a 55 percent reduction in survival after five years [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Preoperative evaluation of cardiac risk is discussed in separate topics, including perioperative management of chronically administered medications such as beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9285" href="/d/drug information/9285.html" rel="external">clonidine</a>, statins, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or other antiplatelet agents.

Such protocols for fluid administration as well as other preventive measures to minimize risk for CIN are discussed separately. The use of a balanced salt solution rather than saline is generally advocated for patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, this recommendation has not been studied in the context of CIN [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7221.html" rel="external">"Prevention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury related to angiography", section on 'Fluid administration'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In a meta-analysis that included 15 studies and more than 11,000 patients undergoing endovascular procedures, the incidence of CIN ranged from 0 to 45 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In a large registry study of more than 13,000 patients undergoing endovascular procedures, a 3 percent incidence of CIN was noted; 6.5 percent of these patients required dialysis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Patients who developed CIN had increased risk for in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 18.1, 95% CI 10.7-30.6), as well as other morbidity such as myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischemic attack, increased blood transfusions, and longer durations of hospital stay. Predictors of CIN included case acuity (urgent or emergency surgery); extremes of body mass index (&gt;30 or &lt;18); low preprocedure creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/minute; anemia; patient history of DM, heart failure, or COPD; as well as a contrast dose exceeding three times the calculated creatinine clearance [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3128725343"><span class="h2">Other medical comorbidities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other common comorbidities in patients with arterial disease requiring infrainguinal revascularization include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong> – Approximately one-third of patients with PAD have comorbid DM.

Counseling regarding preoperative smoking cessation is particularly important in patients with PAD to improve perioperative outcomes, including risk of adverse cardiovascular events, pulmonary complications, and limb loss. Although optimal timing is at least eight weeks prior to surgery, cessation for as little as two days may have some benefits for those requiring urgent revascularization [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6917.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of perioperative pulmonary risk", section on 'Smoking'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6970.html" rel="external">"Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults", section on 'Smoking cessation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H950896434"><span class="h2">Planned surgical technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preoperative communication between the surgical and anesthesia teams is necessary to understand the planned surgical procedure and potential incisions. This may affect choice of anesthetic technique (eg, type of access, extent and location of surgical incision[s]).

Indications for conversion to general anesthesia include patient inability to lie still (eg, severe agitation), patient request, or surgery-related factors (eg, procedure will take longer than initially anticipated).</p><p>Occasionally, a combined technique that includes both a neuraxial anesthetic and general anesthesia is selected at the beginning of the procedure to provide optimal intraoperative conditions as well as excellent multimodal management of postoperative pain (ie, general anesthesia plus epidural or peripheral nerve block for supplemental analgesia) in selected patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2842109176"><span class="h2">Endovascular revascularization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients undergoing endovascular infrainguinal revascularization, only local anesthesia with monitored anesthesia care (MAC) is needed. Endovascular revascularization typically uses percutaneous access to perform angioplasty, place stents or stent-grafts at an area of stenosis/occlusion, or to administer thrombolytic agents.

Similar to anesthetic management of patients undergoing endovascular or open aortic surgery, vasoactive drugs should be readily available to rapidly treat hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, or arrhythmias  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119747" href="/d/graphic/119747.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119750" href="/d/graphic/119750.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Hemodynamic management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Early postoperative and pain management </strong>– Care in the post-anesthesia care unit is typically adequate, although admission to an intensive care unit may be necessary for hemodynamically unstable patients or after complex infrainguinal revascularization procedures with significant blood loss. Pain management techniques are tailored to the extent of the procedure; most patients experience only mild-to-moderate pain, and are able to ambulate as soon as the first postoperative day.
