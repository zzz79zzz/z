         Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by a persistent or recurrent delay in or absence of orgasm following sexual arousal and adequate sexual stimulation. To diagnose female orgasmic disorder, the symptoms must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment for female orgasmic disorder consists principally of education and psychosocial interventions; clinical trials of their efficacy are limited. No medications have shown convincing evidence of efficacy for the disorder in clinical trials.
        </p>

         This topic discusses the treatment of female orgasmic disorder. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder are discussed separately. Topics related to sexual dysfunction including assessment, epidemiology, treatment, and management of sexual dysfunction due to serotonergic antidepressants are discussed separately.

         Female orgasmic disorder may be lifelong or acquired, generalized (occurring in all situations) or situational (occurring in select situations). An example of the situational type of the disorder is a woman who has orgasms through masturbation but not during partnered sexual activity.

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Our suggestions for psychosocial treatment are largely based on our clinical experience and supported in some cases by small clinical trials of limited methodological quality (see
         <a class="local">
          'Psychosocial interventions'
         </a>
         below). A substantial proportion of trials fail to differentiate participants with female orgasmic disorder from those with other sexual disorders. Larger randomized trials and head-to-head comparisons of interventions are needed to guide choices among treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patient education should be provided to patients with female orgasmic disorder, preceding and supporting a discussion about treatment options. Detailed information about anatomy and sexual function can correct misconceptions that may be contributing to a problem. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patient education'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         For most patients with primary female orgasmic disorder, we suggest treatment with directed masturbation as a first-line therapy over other interventions. Clinical trials have shown directed masturbation to be more efficacious compared with control conditions or other active interventions in helping females with the disorder to achieve orgasm. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Directed masturbation'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, a randomized trial compared a 12-session directed masturbation intervention with a 12-session treatment that included psychoeducation and sensate focus exercises in 37 patients with primary female orgasmic disorder and their male partners [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. At the end of treatment, more females in the directed masturbation group were able to experience orgasm compared with the education/sensate focus group (90 versus 53 percent). At one year, the females in the directed masturbation group maintained treatment gains.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of the couple with cognitive-behavioral sex therapy can be helpful in cases that do not respond adequately to education or directed masturbation alone. The clinician should provide education to both partners and incorporate components tailored to contributing factors specific to the couple. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Cognitive-behavioral sex therapy'
         </a>
         below.)

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Careful attention should be paid to interpersonal conflicts that appear to contribute to female orgasmic disorder or reduces motivation to resolve it. Orgasmic problems associated with relationship difficulties extending beyond sexual issues can be addressed by couple therapy and or partner communication training. These components can be useful prior to sex therapy or as an integrated intervention. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Potential components'
         </a>
         below.)

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For patients with primary female orgasmic disorder in which distorted negative beliefs contribute to orgasm problems, we favor augmentation with more explicit cognitive therapy strategies. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Potential components'
         </a>

         </span>
         If primary female orgasmic disorder is accompanied by anxiety that contributes to avoidance of partnered sexual activity and the condition does not respond to education or directed masturbation alone, we favor augmentation with sensate focus exercises. If this combination is not effective, we favor augmentation with exposure therapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Sensate focus exercises'
         </a>

         Acquired female orgasmic disorder generally requires treatment directed at the apparent etiology of the dysfunction or contributing factors. When female orgasmic disorder is suspected to be neurogenic in origin, we suggest incorporating use of a dilator or clitoral vacuum suction device to enhance genital stimulation and blood flow.

         Setting clear, feasible treatment goals. A common pitfall in treatment is to focus chiefly on the attainment of orgasm. Although collaborative goal setting is essential, the patient should be encouraged to focus on facilitators of orgasm (eg, enhancing arousal and pleasurable sensations) and reduce factors that inhibit arousal.

         Ensuring that the patient’s mood and psychosocial functioning are stable. Although the patient may prioritize concerns with sexual functioning, problems such as serious mood disturbance, psychotic symptoms, suicidality, and pervasive relational conflict should be treated prior to focusing clinical attention on female orgasmic disorder.

         The nature of most treatments necessitate that patients complete assigned readings, exercises, or activities between clinician visits. Adherence to treatment recommendations, in our experience, contributes to positive outcomes. Clinicians should help patients maintain motivation and resolve barriers to adherence [

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         Patient education should precede and support a discussion of treatment options. Females typically welcome accurate, detailed information about anatomy and sexual function. The process of educating the patient will at times reveal assumptions or misconceptions that may be contributing to a problem. Receipt of corrective information is often therapeutic. Further assessment of contributing factors (eg, relationship problems, negative beliefs about sexuality) can often be conducted during education. The patient should understand the rationale for the proposed treatment and the necessity of her taking an active role in treatment. Motivated, high functioning patients may benefit from an accurate self-help book with little or no additional intervention by the clinician [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. An excellent resource is the self-help manual “Becoming Orgasmic”
         <em>
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]

          .
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinician should have a frank discussion with the patient about the adequacy of stimulation that she receives. Females and their partners may benefit from information about sexual positions and techniques to enhance the woman’s sexual stimulation. If the woman engages in vaginal intercourse with a male partner, use of the coital alignment technique has been shown to facilitate orgasm and satisfaction with sexual activity. The coital alignment technique is a variant of the missionary position in which the male partner positions himself higher in relation to the female’s body and uses a downward (rather than horizontal) thrusting motion, allowing the base and dorsal side of the penis to come into closer contact with the clitoris. This allows for greater clitoral stimulation and, hypothetically, a greater likelihood of orgasm stimulated through vaginal intercourse [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Attainment of orgasm through vaginal intercourse may not be an achievable goal in some patients. Clinicians should discuss manual and oral stimulation as normal, legitimate means of attaining orgasm during partnered sexual activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some females will benefit substantially from a single encounter that involves validation, education, and an opportunity to ask questions. However, in our experience, many females present for treatment after multiple failed attempts to remedy the problem on their own and require further treatment.

          PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS

         </span>
         Studies of psychosocial interventions, also referred to as “sex therapy techniques,” make up the vast majority of the empirical literature on treatments for female orgasmic disorder. Most of the interventions that have been examined empirically are grounded in behavior therapy principles, with considerable overlap among the approaches. They share an emphasis on exposure to novel experiences and information, learning new skills, and generalization of these skills to a range of sexual activities. In clinical practice, these interventions are frequently combined or coupled with other treatments (eg, marital therapy) for females with more complex presentations, or if monotherapy is not successful.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical trials of these interventions are limited, with small sample sizes and few head-to-head comparisons. In our experience, patients with primary female orgasmic disorder can often be effectively treated with psychosocial interventions [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Patients with acquired or situational female orgasmic disorder are less likely to benefit from sex therapy, especially in the long term. (See

         Directed masturbation (sometimes referred to as masturbation training) is a program of education and self-awareness exercises aimed at teaching a woman to reach orgasm through self-stimulation and, eventually, through partnered sexual activity [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. After the rationale has been explained and the woman is educated about basic sexual anatomy and physiology, she is instructed to explore her body visually and through touch in a series of exercises at home.
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial goal is simply to become familiar with one’s own body, particularly the genitals. In later steps the focus is to identify areas that are pleasurable to touch, and then to stimulate those areas directly. Erotic videos, pictures, or text, and/or a vibrator can be used to enhance this experience. Once a woman is able to reach orgasm reliably, the partner (if applicable) is brought into the home “practice” sessions so that they can learn to stimulate the woman to orgasm during sexual activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians teach directed masturbation in individual, group, and couples formats [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15
         </a>
         ]. The techniques can also be learned in a self-help format (eg, with the manual “Becoming Orgasmic”) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on our clinical experience, weekly sessions on directed masturbation over a period of five to six weeks are likely to be acceptable and efficacious for most patients, even though clinical trials often studied twice weekly sessions over this period, or weekly sessions over a longer duration [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Highly motivated patients may be able to benefit with less frequent contact (eg, semi-monthly sessions), particularly after the first several weeks of treatment.

        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, 63 patients with primary female orgasmic disorder were randomly assigned to one of two self-administered directed masturbation treatments or a waitlist control condition [

          5

         ]. Treatment groups were split between those who received instructions in writing or in a series of videotapes. Participants in both directed masturbation groups were provided a vibrator. A greater proportion of females assigned to one of the directed masturbation groups experienced orgasm by the end of treatment compared with females in the control group (60 versus 0 percent). There were no differences in outcomes between written and video treatment groups.

         Sensate focus is a couples-oriented treatment that consists of clinician visits for education and treatment planning, and a series of home exercises to increase the partners’ comfort with sexual intimacy and reduce avoidance of feared experiences. One goal of sensate focus is to orient the partners’ goals for sex toward attaining sensual pleasure rather than orgasm [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Sensate focus exercises usually begin by having partners exchange pleasurable touch of areas of the body other than the genitals and breasts, perhaps even while clothed. Subsequent sessions gradually allow for greater touching of breasts, buttocks, and eventually genitals, although intercourse is not recommended until the final stages of treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The therapist typically helps the couple enhance verbal and nonverbal sexual communication skills so that the partners can be enabled to give guidance and feedback to one another regarding their preferences for touch. Barriers to regular, open sexual expression (eg, repeatedly “forgetting” to complete exercises, negative feelings arising during exercises) are also commonly addressed in treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sensate focus training is typically provided in 10 to 16 sessions, occurring weekly or biweekly.

         ]. The trial compared a 12-session treatment that included psychoeducation and sensate focus exercises with a directed masturbation intervention in 37 females and their male partners. A smaller proportion of females in the education/sensate focus group compared with the directed masturbation group were able to experience orgasm at the end of the trial (53 versus 90 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Small clinical trials of a sensate focus intervention in females with secondary orgasmic disorder found mixed evidence for improving orgasmic function [

         As an example, a trial randomly assigned 48 females with secondary orgasmic disorder and their partners to either a waitlist control condition or to one of three 12-session treatments: sensate focus, systematic desensitization, or combined systematic desensitization and sensate focus [

Outcomes for the two monotherapy groups were comparable and superior compared with the control condition, in which no improvement was observed. Combined treatment was found to be inferior to monotherapy. Gains in the sensate focus group were not maintained at six-month follow-up.

         Exposure therapy may be used as a component of multimodal cognitive-behavioral therapy for female orgasmic disorder to treat anxiety leading to avoidance of sexual activity. Graded exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli aims to increase the patient’s comfort with and reduce avoidance of feared experiences [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Techniques such as directed masturbation and sensate focus intrinsically provide graded exposure and often are sufficient to address common sources of anxiety and behavioral inhibition in female orgasmic disorder. However, formal exposure techniques can be incorporated to target anxiety and avoidance around specific situations (eg, being seen in the nude) that are relevant to the patient’s goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whereas early treatment protocols emphasized use of relaxation techniques during exposures (systematic desensitization), modern exposure therapy approaches do not emphasize concomitant relaxation [

         As an example in female orgasmic disorder, a woman who is accustomed to using fantasy during masturbation may avoid fantasy during sexual activity with a new partner due to the belief that it will lead her to desire her partner less. Once given “permission” to engage in fantasy to reach orgasm during sex, she may find that she more often looks forward to lovemaking and may even experience orgasm without the use of fantasy in the future. Other examples of beliefs and assumptions that are addressed include:

         In another trial, 65 sexually active females were randomly assigned to either mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (cognitive therapy incorporating mindfulness training and encouraging the practice of mindfulness throughout prescribed exercises) or cognitive-behavioral therapy.

There was no evidence that the addition of mindfulness training enhanced the effect of the intervention on orgasmic function.

         We favor the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy with sex therapy techniques for female orgasmic disorder that does not respond to education and/or directed masturbation. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a multicomponent intervention that adds additional behavioral and/or cognitive techniques selectively, tailored to clinical factors identified with each couple:
