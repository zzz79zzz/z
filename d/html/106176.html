As an alternative or in addition, neuraxial ultrasound may be used to determine the intervertebral level for neuraxial needle placement, identify the midline and optimal angle of needle insertion, and measure the depth to the epidural and intrathecal space. Ultrasound can also help assess anatomy that may make neuraxial procedures challenging (eg, spine rotation), identify the most accessible interspace, and confirm existing spinal hardware. This is especially useful if radiologic spinal imaging is not available. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The intervertebral level (eg, L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5, etc) can be identified using the parasagittal oblique interlaminar view. Options include visualizing the sacrum in the lumbar spine or the articulation of the transverse process with the 12<sup>th</sup> rib in the thoracic spine, counting vertebrae while moving the transducer cephalad in a parasagittal orientation. For high thoracic ultrasound, ribs can be counted down from the first rib (T1). (See <a class="local">'Parasagittal oblique interlaminar view'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The midline can be identified by scanning in transverse orientation and visualizing the spinous process or interspinous window which includes the posterior complex (ligamentum flavum/dura). (See <a class="local">'Transverse scan'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Depth to the ligamentum flavum/dura complex can be measured with the caliper function on the ultrasound screen with the transducer in either the parasagittal oblique or transverse interspinous orientation. (See <a class="local">'Parasagittal oblique interlaminar view'</a> below and <a class="local">'Interspinous view'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Spine rotation can be assessed by visualizing the symmetry of the height of the articular processes in the transverse interspinous view. (See <a class="local">'Interspinous view'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Optimal needle insertion position can be determined by locating the intervertebral level that contains the best view of the posterior and anterior complexes in the transverse interspinous view. Once this is found, the angle required to achieve this view is mimicked with actual needle insertion. (See <a class="local">'Interspinous view'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Mid to upper thoracic neuraxial ultrasound is more challenging than lumbar and low thoracic neuraxial ultrasound, however several useful pieces of information can be obtained. The parasagittal oblique interlaminar view can be used to identify the correct intervertebral level and to estimate a safe needle insertion depth by measuring the distance to the laminae and interlaminar space. Despite the narrower interlaminar window, the posterior and/or anterior complex can frequently be visualized with the transducer in this orientation. However, transverse interspinous views are usually not possible in the mid to upper thoracic spine because the spaces between spinous processes are very narrow. Unlike lumbar scans, the posterior and anterior complexes are only occasionally seen as hyperechoic bands within the space.</p><p>Evidence regarding benefits and outcomes of neuraxial ultrasound is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'ultrasound guidance versus landmark based neuraxial techniques'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2153718858"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bones</strong> – There are five lumbar and 12 thoracic vertebrae, each consisting of a vertebral body and arch  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138673" href="/z/d/graphic/138673.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The arch consists of a pair of pedicles and laminae from which the spinous process, transverse processes, and superior and inferior articular processes arise. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The spinous processes, when viewed laterally, project posteriorly and inferiorly and are broad and rectangular in shape. In the lower thoracic spine (T10 to T12), the spinous processes and other vertebral anatomy are similar to the lumbar spine. In the upper to mid thoracic spine (T4 to T9) the spinous processes are steeply angled more caudally, and the spaces between them (ie, the acoustic window for ultrasound imaging) are narrower  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64902" href="/z/d/graphic/64902.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The transverse processes are thin, wing-like, bony extensions from the superior part of the vertebral body that project laterally and incline slightly posteriorly. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Laminae are thin, bony surfaces connecting the transverse process to the spinous process, and in the lumbar area, slope anterior to posterior in the cephalad to caudad direction. Laminae in the thoracic spine are flatter and overlapping, producing smaller interlaminar windows to visualize neuraxial structures. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The superior and inferior articular processes are small, bony structures that articulate with adjoining vertebrae; the articulation between each pair is called a facet or zygapophyseal joint. In the upper-to-mid thoracic spine, the articular processes are less prominent posteriorly and are therefore not easily seen with neuraxial ultrasound.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The spinal cord is situated within the vertebral canal, which is bordered ventrally by the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies and dorsally by lamina and spinous process. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ligaments</strong> – The spinal column is stabilized by multiple ligaments, as shown in a figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138676" href="/z/d/graphic/138676.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The supraspinous ligament runs continuously along the posterior midline aspect of the spine and connects the apices of the spinous processes. </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The interspinous ligament connects adjoining spinous processes and blends anteriorly and posteriorly with the ligamentum flavum and supraspinous ligament, respectively. </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The ligamentum flavum connects the laminae of adjacent vertebrae and is an important landmark for neuraxial techniques. </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments connect the anterior and posterior surfaces of vertebral bodies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thecal sac</strong> – The thecal/dural sac rests within the canal and contains the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138974" href="/z/d/graphic/138974.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The dura mater is a dense connective tissue external to the arachnoid and pia that encapsulates and protects the spinal cord and brain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidural space</strong> – Though not generally appreciated, the epidural space consists of three components: the posterior, anterior, and lateral epidural compartments  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138974" href="/z/d/graphic/138974.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The posterior compartment is frequently accessed for neuraxial anesthetics and chronic pain procedures (eg, epidural steroid injections). It is bordered anteriorly by posterior dura and posteriorly by the ligamentum flavum. </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The lateral epidural space extends to the pedicles and intervertebral foramina. </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The anterior epidural space contains the internal vertebral venous plexus and posterior longitudinal ligament and is bordered anteriorly by the anterior dura. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The epidural space is generally largest at the midline and tapers laterally. It is also largest in the mid-lumbar spine and narrower in the thoracic spine as well as sacral spine. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1165589404"><span class="h1">ULTRASOUND IMAGING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H840199136"><span class="h2">Patient positioning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neuraxial ultrasound is performed after positioning the patient for the neuraxial anesthesia procedure. Patients can be positioned in the lateral or sitting position for lumbar neuraxial procedures, and are almost always positioned sitting for thoracic epidural placement if the patient is able. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89518.html" rel="external">"Epidural and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia: Techniques", section on 'Positioning for epidural procedure'</a>.)</p><p>For neuraxial ultrasound, we suggest using the sitting position for almost all procedures, particularly when learning neuraxial ultrasound. The sitting position may facilitate understanding of spatial orientation and improve ergonomics.</p><p>Maximizing flexion of the lumbosacral spine can greatly improve acoustic windows and the path for needle insertion  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106234" href="/z/d/graphic/106234.html" rel="external">figure 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106238" href="/z/d/graphic/106238.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). One method for doing this in the sitting position is to tilt the procedural table laterally to elevate the patient's knees relative to the buttocks; the patient will naturally lean forward and flex the spine  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef138712" href="/z/d/graphic/138712.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Commercial devices are available that are designed to support the patient in the sitting position during neuraxial block  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106230" href="/z/d/graphic/106230.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1117726659"><span class="h2">Equipment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A low frequency (2 to 5 MHz), curvilinear transducer is recommended for neuraxial ultrasound. Curvilinear transducers obtain a broad field of view. Low frequency transducers are required for visualizing deeper structures, though they provide lower resolution images. Preprocedure ultrasound is usually performed prior to skin preparation. However, if difficulty is encountered during the scan (moderate degrees of spinal rotation or extremely deep structures), sterile ultrasound gel and a sterile ultrasound transducer cover sheath can be used to allow minor adjustments of the initial (scout) scan during the neuraxial procedure.</p><p>The depth should be set at 7 to 10 cm. By convention and to assist with image recognition, the transducer is oriented so that the left side of the ultrasound screen is cephalad.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3672740289"><span class="h2">Sonoanatomy and transducer orientation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bony structures such as spinous processes, articular processes, and transverse processes do not transmit ultrasound waves well and thus appear as hyperechoic lines (white) with black acoustic shadowing underneath. Ligaments such as the ligamentum flavum and posterior longitudinal ligament appear hyperechoic (white), cerebrospinal fluid appears anechoic (black), and muscles generally appear hypoechoic (dark gray).</p><p>The three transducer orientations used for neuraxial ultrasound are parasagittal, parasagittal oblique, and transverse  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138832" href="/z/d/graphic/138832.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). A diagonal orientation (combined parasagittal and transverse) has been described for real-time neuraxial ultrasound [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Real-time neuraxial ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p>The images used for neuraxial ultrasound are discussed here. When learning to perform neuraxial ultrasound, we suggest obtaining these views in sequence, as described here and in the step-by-step sequence discussed below. Once the clinician is comfortable with neuraxial ultrasound, it is reasonable to start immediately with the parasagittal oblique interlaminar view. (See <a class="local">'Step-by-step lumbar ultrasound'</a> below and <a class="local">'Step by step thoracic ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1404723069"><span class="h3">Parasagittal scan</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The parasagittal scans are used to identify the location of the laminae (in medial-lateral orientation) and ultimately the interlaminar space. Recognition of the laminae is often easiest when its morphology is compared with that of more lateral vertebral structures (articular processes and transverse processes). Pattern changes are subtle and only within a few centimeters of each other therefore slow deliberate scanning is recommended.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H895629617"><span class="h4">Transverse process view</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For this view, place the transducer 4 to 5 cm lateral to the spinous process in the parasagittal plane  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138713" href="/z/d/graphic/138713.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>). Transverse processes are seen as hyperechoic, crescent-shaped reflections with hypoechoic, finger-like acoustic shadows below. This creates a pattern that has been termed the "trident," sign because of its similarity to the mythologic weapon. The psoas muscle has a striated appearance and is located in between the transverse processes; the erector spinae muscle lies superficial to the transverse processes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1924682684"><span class="h4">Articular process view</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For this view, obtain the transverse process view, then slide the transducer medially while maintaining the parasagittal transducer orientation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138714" href="/z/d/graphic/138714.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>). As the transducer is moved, the finger-like acoustic shadows of the transverse processes transition to a continuous, scalloped hyperechoic line formed by the overlap of superior and inferior articular processes, at approximately 2 to 3 cm lateral to the spinous processes. The pattern visualized is termed the "camel hump," sign.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3114917572"><span class="h4">Parasagittal oblique interlaminar view</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The parasagittal oblique interlaminar scan is used to determine the intervertebral level and measure the depth to the interspace. The interlaminar space is easily visualized in this view and contains the posterior complex (ligamentum flavum/dura) and anterior complex (posterior longitudinal ligament/vertebral body). Posterior and anterior complexes cannot be visualized in the articular process or transverse process views  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138745" href="/z/d/graphic/138745.html" rel="external">figure 11</a>). </p><p>For this view, obtain the articular process view, then slide the transducer slightly medially, and angle the ultrasound beam 5 to 10 degrees towards the midline. As the ultrasound beam is moved towards the neuraxis, the "camel hump," pattern will morph into a succession of sharp "sawtooth"-shaped structures, which represent lamina. The sacrum can be seen as a horizontal, slightly wavy hyperechoic line with a dorsal tilt and dense acoustic shadow underneath. The soft gaps in between the "sawteeth," represent interlaminar spaces. </p><p>Within the gap, two horizontal hyperechoic bands resembling an "equal sign," can be seen with a large black space (the thecal sac) in between. These two bands are the posterior and anterior complexes. Though spinal segments such as the conus medullaris and cauda equina are easily visualized in infants due to normal incompletely ossified posterior structures at this age, these components are not consistently seen in adults. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Posterior complex</strong> – The shallowest posterior hyperechoic band, visualized near the lower edge of the sawtooth (lamina), is called the posterior complex. The posterior complex consists of the ligamentum flavum, epidural space, and posterior dura and may be visualized collectively as a single structure. Sometimes, especially in patients with lower body mass index, the ligamentum flavum and posterior dura may be seen as two thin closely approximated hyperechoic parallel lines separated by the hypoechoic epidural space.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anterior complex</strong> – The anterior complex is a second, thicker horizontal hyperechoic band, approximately 1 to 1.5 cm anterior to the posterior complex, and is the deepest visualized structure. The anterior complex consists of the anterior dura, anterior epidural space, posterior longitudinal ligament, and posterior aspect of the vertebral body. Like the posterior complex, these structures are often closely approximated and are most often seen as a single hyperechoic linear structure. The anterior complex is usually thicker, brighter, and more easily seen than the posterior complex.</p><p></p><p>In the mid and upper thoracic spine, the laminae appear as overlapping flat structures, similar in appearance to roof shingles. The interlaminar spaces are seen as narrow hypoechoic interruptions. Unlike at the lumbar levels, the posterior and anterior complexes are only occasionally seen as hyperechoic bands within the space  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138756" href="/z/d/graphic/138756.html" rel="external">figure 12</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1082265455"><span class="h3">Transverse scan</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The transverse scans can be used to identify midline, measure the depth to a target interspace, and assess for rotation of the spine (eg, in scoliosis).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3969993209"><span class="h4">Spinous process view</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Place the transducer in a transverse orientation over the spinous process at the desired interspace  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138746" href="/z/d/graphic/138746.html" rel="external">figure 13</a>). The tip of the spinous process appears as a superficial hyperechoic semi-circle with large acoustic dropout below. The erector spinae muscles are visualized on either side of the spinous process. Just adjacent to midline, the laminae appear as two thick horizontal hyperechoic lines and cast a large hypoechoic shadow anteriorly (deeply). </p><p>In the mid and upper thoracic spine, the laminae are seen as horizontal hyperechoic structures deeper and just adjacent to the spinous process  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138759" href="/z/d/graphic/138759.html" rel="external">figure 14</a>).

Given that this measured depth is perpendicular from the skin, it is an underestimation of the actual depth to the space which, in the thoracic level, is obtained with the needle angulated cranially.

Insert the needle perpendicularly at this point to hit lamina, taking into account the above calculated distance. Slowly walk off the lamina angling caudally until the interlaminar space is reached.
