         As with the population in general, arrhythmias are commonly documented in athletes. Rarely are arrhythmias fatal; however, sudden cardiac death (SCD) resulting from malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias can occur in young and apparently healthy persons. In addition, athletes treated with a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) are at increased risk of damage to the device during sport participation.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the approach to returning to competition or participation in athletes with arrhythmias.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of athletes with specific arrhythmias or arrhythmia-related syndromes are discussed in detail separately. (See

         Additionally, the risk of SCD in athletes and the approach to screening to prevent SCD in athletes are discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/960.html" rel="external">

         The approach to evaluation of syncope is discussed separately (See

          "Athletes with arrhythmias: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Syncope and presyncope'

         In select diseases, the decision to return to sport participation may be determined more by the disease than by the specific rhythm or treatment. The decision on sport participation in such diseases is covered separately. (See

         Altered atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction (eg, first-degree AV block and Mobitz type I second-degree AV block) can result from increased vagal tone, which is normally seen as an adaptive response to certain types of athletic conditioning, particularly endurance training  (

         – Asymptomatic athletes in whom Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block initially appears or worsens with exercise may need further evaluation, as worsening of Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block with exercise is highly suspicious for a structural pathologic condition affecting the AV node or His-Purkinje system  (

         – Though Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block rarely causes symptoms, symptomatic athletes may need ventricular pacing and should undergo treatment of any associated potentially reversible causes (eg, myocardial ischemia, Lyme disease). The development of Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block during exercise should prompt referral to an electrophysiologist. (See

         A subset of patients with third-degree (complete) AV block have congenital third-degree (complete) AV block, which usually is present at birth, but may develop later in childhood. Congenital third-degree (complete) AV block may go unnoticed because of the higher junctional escape rate and lack of symptoms. Evaluation of these cases should preferentially be performed by expert electrophysiologists. (See

         – The presence of bifascicular block (LBBB, RBBB and left anterior fascicular block, RBBB and left posterior fascicular block) in a young, otherwise healthy athlete also raises the possibility of an inherited conduction system disease such as Lenègre disease, an autosomal dominant disorder that results in progressive conduction system dysfunction or cardiomyopathy. First-degree relatives of an athlete with bifascicular block should be screened with an ECG to search for any evidence of conduction system disease [

         Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that may be present intermittently or persistently. In young athletes, AF may occur in the absence of any structural heart disease or other provoking condition and is often termed lone AF, although many patients will have some underlying risk factors for AF. In older athletes, hypertension and coronary artery disease are common underlying conditions. As with any patient with AF, athletes with AF should be evaluated for potential underlying causes and risk (eg, thyroid disease, alcohol use, etc). (See

         The evaluation of athletes with PVCs should initially assess for the presence of underlying pathologic substrate (ie, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, coronary heart disease, inflammatory cardiac diseases, etc). Evaluation should include exercise testing (Holter ECG) to assess for inducibility or worsening of PVCs during exercise. In patients with exercise-induced PVCs or those with either a right bundle branch block or left bundle branch block pattern that originates from the left ventricle or right ventricle wall or apex (ie, superior axis deviation), CMR is required to exclude an underlying arrhythmogenic substrate.

This restriction generally applies to activities where direct blows to the chest are a part of the sport, such as football, rugby, boxing, martial arts, hockey, motorcycling, downhill skiing, and lacrosse. Protective padding for the device is advisable for other sports where trauma to the device is less likely (eg, soccer, basketball, baseball, softball).

         In addition, activities in which there is extensive arm movement (volleyball, climbing, golf) increase the risk of lead damage, which may result in loss of pacing or premature lead replacement; patients should be counseled about these risks prior to resuming participation in such activities.

         We advise patients with ICDs not to participate in sports; the main risks of participation include a higher risk of arrhythmic events and damage to the ICD. The risks of participation should be communicated during a shared decision-making process; the clinician's role in this process is to identify the cause of ventricular arrhythmias and estimate the likelihood that participation in the specific sport will provoke ventricular arrythmias  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651" href="/z/d/graphic/105651.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

         ) or damage the ICD.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some conditions, such as arrhythmogenic right VT, the participation in sport is not specifically limited by the presence of the ICD but rather by the effects on the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal approach to ICD programming in athletes is uncertain, but likely similar to the approach to programming in nonathletes. However, if the athlete has the potential to raise the sinus rate to near the ICD VT detection level, a history of AF with rapid ventricular rate, or a need for relatively low tachyarrhythmia detection rates, we recommend that the athlete undergo formal exercise testing to guide ICD programming. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/921.html" rel="external">

          General considerations
         </strong>
         – As with the population in general, arrhythmias are commonly documented in athletes. Rarely are arrhythmias fatal; however, sudden cardiac death (SCD) resulting from malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias can occur in young and apparently healthy persons. In addition, athletes treated with a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) are at increased risk of damage to the device during sport participation.

          Specific arrhythmias
         </strong>
         – The approach to management and return to sport typically includes an evaluation for the cause of the arrhythmia (eg, structural heart disease), appropriate treatment, and a discussion of the risk of exertion on recurrence of the arrhythmia. We address the athlete-specific issues for the following broad groups of arrhythmias:

         <strong>
          Athletes with a pacemaker
         </strong>
         – Athletes with a permanent pacemaker should not participate in competitive sports when the danger of bodily collision exists; such trauma may damage the pacemaker system and lead to bradycardia-induced syncope or other fatal arrhythmia. This restriction generally applies to activities where direct blows to the chest are a part of the sport, such as football, rugby, boxing, martial arts, hockey, motorcycling, downhill skiing, and lacrosse. Protective padding for the device is advisable for other sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball, and softball where trauma is possible but less likely.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition, activities in which there is extensive arm movement (volleyball, climbing, golf) increase the risk of lead damage, which may result in loss of pacing or premature lead replacement; patients should be counseled about these risks prior to resuming participation in such activities.

          Athletes with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator

         – We advise patients with ICDs not to participate in sports; the main risks of participation include a higher risk of arrhythmic events and damage to the ICD. (See
