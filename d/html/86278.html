The anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of AV canal defects are discussed separately.

They are also commonly called AV septal defects or endocardial cushion defects.</p><p>AV canal defects include the following (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86346" href="/d/graphic/86346.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complete AV canal (CAVC)</strong> defect is characterized by a primum atrial septal defect (ASD) that is contiguous with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and a common AV valve. CAVC defects can be further classified based upon the relative sizes of the ventricles:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In <strong>balanced CAVC</strong>, the ventricles are relatively equal in size and are amenable to biventricular repair</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In <strong>unbalanced CAVC</strong>, there is hypoplasia of either the right or left ventricle (most commonly the left)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Partial AV canal</strong> defect consists of a primum ASD and a common valvular annulus with two separate valve orifices. The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is cleft (due to abnormal fusion of the left tubercle of the superior and inferior cushions), which is often associated with mitral valve regurgitation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transitional AV canal</strong> defect consists of a large primum ASD, cleft mitral valve, and inlet VSD. However, dense chordal attachments to the ventricular septum result in small shunting at the ventricular level and delineate distinct left and right AV valve orifices, resulting in a defect that is similar to the physiology of a partial AV canal defect.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intermediate AV canal</strong> defect is a rare subtype of CAVC, in which a bridging tongue of tissue divides a common AV valve into two distinct orifices. This defect is physiologically similar to CAVC and usually has both a large primum atrial and large inlet VSDs. Due to natural division of the common AV valve into left and right AV valve components by the tongue of tissue, surgical division is not required.</p><p></p><p>The anatomy of AV canal defects is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85595.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects", section on 'Anatomy and pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H173193611"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The management approach for AV canal defects is based on the type of defect, determining whether there are other associated anatomic and hemodynamic abnormalities (eg, relative ventricular size, AV valve regurgitation, and right or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction [LVOTO]), and whether or not other cardiac conditions are present (eg, coarctation of the aorta).</p><p>In general, surgical correction is recommended because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with the uncorrected defect.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complete AV canal defects (CAVC)</strong> – Infants with CAVC defects, including those with the intermediate type, generally develop heart failure by one year of age. If the defect is not repaired, unrestricted pulmonary blood flow and elevated pulmonary artery pressures cause pulmonary vascular changes, which can ultimately lead to irreversible pulmonary hypertension (PH), right-to-left intracardiac shunting, and systemic cyanosis (ie, Eisenmenger syndrome). For this reason, we recommend surgical intervention for most patients with CAVC by six months of age (ie, prior to the onset of irreversible PH). (See <a class="local">'Complete atrioventricular canal defect'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85595.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects", section on 'Complete atrioventricular canal defect'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Partial and transitional AV canal defects</strong> – Even though many patients with partial and transitional AV canal defects are asymptomatic until adulthood, surgical repair is suggested in childhood because the primum atrial septal defect (ASD) will not close spontaneously and, without intervention, these patients are at risk for atrial arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation), heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension later in life, similar to the late complications of ASD. Patients with significant mitral regurgitation (MR) are more likely to present earlier with heart failure symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Partial and transitional atrioventricular canal defect'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85595.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects", section on 'Partial and transitional atrioventricular canal defects'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8314440"><span class="h1">COMPLETE ATRIOVENTRICULAR CANAL DEFECT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Management of complete AV canal (CAVC) defects encompasses initial medical management for heart failure, and either primary complete repair or palliative intervention.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8314448"><span class="h2">Initial medical management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infants with CAVC usually present with symptoms of heart failure by approximately six weeks of age and generally require medical management before surgical repair. The goal of medical management is to improve cardiac function and the patient's clinical status, thereby optimizing the patient's condition before surgery.</p><p>Medical management includes the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diuretic therapy reduces volume overload and pulmonary congestion. Diuretic agents include loop (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13329" href="/d/drug information/13329.html" rel="external">furosemide</a>) and thiazide diuretics.

In children, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the preferred agents as there is a paucity of data on the use of angiotensin receptor blockers in pediatric heart failure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14520.html" rel="external">"Heart failure in children: Management", section on 'ACE inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Promoting adequate nutrition, especially in patients with poor feeding and failure to thrive. In these patients, caloric supplementation is often needed and may require the use of nasogastric tube feeding or, rarely, gastric tube insertion before surgical repair. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14520.html" rel="external">"Heart failure in children: Management", section on 'Nutritional support'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H173193842"><span class="h2">Surgical interventions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with CAVC, primary complete repair is the preferred surgical approach because of its overall low morbidity and mortality. (See <a class="local">'Complete repair'</a> below.)</p><p>However, primary complete repair may not be feasible for a subset of patients, including the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unbalanced CAVC – In patients with unbalanced CAVC (ie, one ventricle is hypoplastic) whose anatomy is deemed unfavorable for biventricular repair, surgical palliation is performed using interventions developed for other single ventricular cardiac defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and tricuspid atresia. (See <a class="local">'Single-ventricle palliation'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116293.html" rel="external">"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome", section on 'Surgical management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complex anatomy or early symptoms – Some patients with CAVC may not be optimal candidates for early primary complete repair, because of associated cardiac defects (eg, coarctation of aorta) or complex anatomy (eg, multiple ventricular septal defects [VSDs]) or because significant symptoms develop at a very early age when valve construction may not be feasible. In such patients, pulmonary artery banding may be used to protect the pulmonary circulation until complete repair can be performed. (See <a class="local">'Timing of repair'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8314462"><span class="h3">Complete repair</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The objectives of surgical repair are to close atrial and ventricular defects and to form two separate and competent AV valves.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H173193872"><span class="h4">Timing of repair</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical repair is generally performed in early infancy to avoid development of pulmonary vascular disease (PVD).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Early repair for symptomatic infants</strong> – Infants with refractory heart failure symptoms despite medical management, significant AV valve regurgitation, or other defects that require early surgical correction (eg, aortic coarctation) may benefit from early surgical repair (ie, before the age of two to three months). However, valve construction may be technically challenging in very young infants and preterm infants due to size considerations and poor valve tissue maturation. The optimal age for valve construction is generally considered to be &gt;6 weeks, though it varies by surgeon [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For infants who require intervention before six weeks of age, pulmonary artery banding may be used to protect the pulmonary circulation until the infant grows to an acceptable size for complete repair.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elective repair in infants with mild or no symptoms</strong> – For infants without heart failure symptoms and those whose symptoms are well controlled with medical therapy, elective surgical repair is generally performed between the age of three to six months. Elective repair is recommended in infancy for all patients regardless of whether symptoms are present because all patients with CAVC are at risk of developing PVD if repair is deferred. This is particularly important for patients with Down syndrome, who have a higher risk of developing PVD than those without Down syndrome. Patients with Down syndrome often remain asymptomatic throughout early infancy, likely due to persistently elevated pulmonary vascular resistance from birth. Surgical outcomes for patients with Down syndrome undergoing CAVC repair during infancy are similar to those of patients without Down syndrome [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adults with unrepaired CAVC</strong> – Adults with unrepaired CAVC are rarely encountered and generally have irreversible PVD with associated right-to-left shunting (Eisenmenger syndrome). Such patients are generally not candidates for operative repair. This is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/119400.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension in adults with congenital heart disease: General management and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H173193932"><span class="h4">Surgical procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical techniques for correction of CAVC have evolved since the first report of successful surgical repair in 1955 [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Techniques for repair of CAVC</strong> – In the contemporary era, repair of CAVC is performed using one of the following techniques (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86337" href="/d/graphic/86337.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Single-patch repair – In the single-patch technique, prosthetic patch material is placed to close the ventricular and atrial communications. The common AV valve is divided and reattached to the patch (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86337" href="/d/graphic/86337.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Two-patch repair – In the two-patch technique, prosthetic patch material is used to close the VSD and the common AV valve is sutured to the top of the patch. The atrial component is closed with a pericardial patch that is sutured to the common AV valve and ventricular patch (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86337" href="/d/graphic/86337.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Modified (simplified) single-patch repair – In the modified single-patch technique, the common AV valve is directly sutured to the crest of the ventricular septum. Pericardium is used to close the atrial component and is sutured to the crest of the ventricular septum, separating the common AV valve into right and left components (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86337" href="/d/graphic/86337.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This newer technique simplified the one-patch repair and resulted in significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp time [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The choice of procedure is based largely upon surgeon and institutional preference and experience. Whether there are clinically meaningful long-term advantages of one approach over another remains uncertain. The available observational data comparing these three techniques are limited and suggest that major determinants of a successful outcome are surgeon and institution familiarity and experience with a specific technique, rather than the technique itself [<a href="#rid7">7-9,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A meta-analysis of 15 observational studies evaluating outcomes in 1034 patients after modified single-patch repair or two-patch repair of CAVC did not detect significant differences between the two groups in early mortality (4.4 versus 5.2 percent, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.52-1.79), overall mortality (5.8 versus 5.5 percent; OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.64-2.19), complete heart block (1.6 versus 2.0 percent; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21-1.87), residual septal defects (3.3 versus 2.3 percent; OR 1.65, 95% CI 0.67-4.06), degree of AV valve regurgitation (standard mean difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.06), or reoperation rate (6.3 versus 7.5 percent; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.48-1.47) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Left ventricular outflow obstruction was less common in the modified single-patch repair group, but the difference was not statistically significant (0.6 versus 3.6 percent; OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.02-2.82). Compared with patients who underwent two-patch repair, those who underwent modified single-patch had shorter cardiopulmonary bypass time, shorter aortic cross clamp time, and shorter length of hospital stay. Of note, patients in the modified single-patch group had smaller VSD size compared with the two-patch repair group. The modified single-patch has been used preferentially in patients with a comparatively smaller VSD [<a href="#rid5">5,8</a>]. Thus, the utility of this technique remains unclear in patients with a large VSD, and in these patients, it is unclear whether the outcome of this procedure is comparable or better than the other two procedures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a multicenter observational study of 120 children who underwent repair of CAVC from June 2004 to 2006, two-patch, one-patch, and the modified single-patch repair were used in 72, 18, and 10 percent of cases, respectively [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Patients who underwent the modified single-patch repair were younger on average compared with those corrected by either the single- or double-patch repair (mean age 2.6 versus 4.4 and 3.8 months, respectively). The overall in-hospital mortality was 2.5 percent, and six-month mortality was 4 percent. The incidence of residual VSD or left AV valve regurgitation was not affected by the age at operation, presence of Down syndrome, or type of repair. There was a lower rate of additional annuloplasty modifications in patients who underwent the modified single-patch repair compared with either the single- or double-patch repairs (0 versus 14 and 30 percent, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Closure of the cleft in the AV valve</strong> – With any of the three techniques, closure of the cleft in the mitral component of the valve is controversial. Our preferred approach is generally to close the cleft whenever the morphology of the left AV valve allows for closure without producing stenosis. The rationale is that residual left AV valve regurgitation through the cleft is a frequent reason for reoperation. However, other experts argue that the cleft in the left AV valve is a true commissure and should be left open so that the repaired valve functions as a three-leaflet valve [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Our approach is supported by a retrospective single-center study of 159 patients who underwent CAVC repair from 1984 to 1997, which found that patients who underwent left AV valve cleft repair had higher eight-year freedom from reoperation for left AV regurgitation compared with patients in whom the cleft was left open (98 versus 78 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In another small retrospective study, closure of the cleft also appeared to be beneficial even in the setting of a parachute left AV valve, where there would be a concern for producing left AV valve stenosis with closure of the cleft [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8314469"><span class="h3">Single-ventricle palliation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term "unbalanced AV canal defect" has been used when there is significant right ventricular (RV) or left ventricular (LV) hypoplasia associated with an unequally positioned common AV valve either over the right or over the left ventricle. The management of unbalanced AV canal defect remains difficult. In general, two-ventricle repair is better tolerated in patients with RV hypoplasia than in patients with LV hypoplasia.</p><p>Echocardiography is used to measure the relative sizes of the ventricles in patients with an unbalanced AV canal defect and to determine whether or not a two-ventricle repair is feasible. Echocardiographic features put forth as measures to determine suitability for two-ventricle repair include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>AV valve index – Derived by the ratio of the area of the AV valve apportioned to the LV over the combined area of the AV valve measured in the subcostal left anterior oblique view. Two-ventricle repair is typically successful when the AV valve index is between 0.4 and 0.6 [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>LV inflow index – Secondary inflow diameter into the LV indexed to the left AV valve annulus diameter.

Partial and transitional AV canal defects generally do not produce symptoms during infancy and early childhood; however, they are associated with a moderate to large left-to-right shunt that is unlikely to resolve spontaneously. Thus, with increasing age, patients are at risk for developing PH and symptoms of right heart failure, especially with exertion.

One-third of patients in this study had preoperative moderate or severe left AV valve regurgitation and 20 percent had growth failure, indicating that this cohort was a more symptomatic and severely affected than is typical for these defects. Weight gain improved after surgery, especially in underweight children. Left AV valve regurgitation was the most common residual defect, occurring more frequently in children repaired after four years of age.

Surgical closure of the cleft in the presence of mild or no MR is controversial.
