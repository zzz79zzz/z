There are no trials that directly compare various regimens, and background therapy was not optimal in successive trials of HF pharmacotherapy, which limits indirect comparisons. However, in large trials, each component of this regimen reduced morbidity and mortality compared with placebo.</p><p>The specific agents used for therapy and the approach to achieving optimal therapy and avoiding adverse effects are described in a table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140887" href="/z/d/graphic/140887.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and in the sections below. (See <a class="local">'Management of specific agents'</a> below.)</p><p>This approach to therapy is consistent with professional guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In the absence of trials that directly compare one regimen with another, the overall effect of combination therapy can only be inferred indirectly:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A network meta-analysis of trials of pharmacologic therapy for patients with HFrEF suggested that a regimen of an ARNI, beta blocker, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitor reduced the risk of all-cause mortality compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.31-0.49) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. When a regimen of ARNI, beta blocker, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitor was compared with a regimen of ARNI, beta blocker, MRA, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130565" href="/z/d/drug information/130565.html" rel="external">vericiguat</a>, the regimen with the SGLT2 inhibitor had a lower hazard ratio without clear evidence of superiority (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66-1.01). However, this study has significant limitations particular to network meta-analyses (eg, indirect comparisons between treatments).</p><p></p><p>Further evidence for each component of primary therapy is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Sacubitril-valsartan, ACE inhibitor, or ARB'</a> below and <a class="local">'Beta blocker'</a> below and <a class="local">'Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist'</a> below and <a class="local">'Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors'</a> below.) </p><p>Evidence on other agents for the treatment of HFrEF is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121087.html" rel="external">"Secondary pharmacologic therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1629970036"><span class="h2">Sequence of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We typically add each drug sequentially, rather than all at once, to allow for identification of the source of any adverse effect or intolerance. In general, we use a sequence of therapy that follows the order in which these agents were studied (ie, ARNI, beta blocker, MRA, and, finally, SGLT2 inhibitor). However, patient characteristics (potassium, blood pressure, HF severity) can allow for a different sequence of therapy, and some experts advocate for initiation of more than one drug at the same time.</p><p>Our rationale extends from the sequence of trials of HFrEF in which newer agents were studied in patients already taking other effective agents (eg, MRAs were studied in patients already taking an angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or ARB and a beta blocker). The choice of drug within each class is described elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Sacubitril-valsartan, ACE inhibitor, or ARB'</a> below and <a class="local">'Beta blocker'</a> below and <a class="local">'Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist'</a> below and <a class="local">'Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3834313111"><span class="h2">Adding an agent before dose optimization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We start additional agents prior to maximizing the dose of any given primary therapy for HFrEF unless there is a clinical need to increase the dose of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [RAAS] inhibitor, beta blocker, or MRA (eg, uncontrolled hypertension, rate control for atrial fibrillation). Though trials that established the efficacy of the RAAS inhibitors and beta blockers targeted high doses of these agents  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140887" href="/z/d/graphic/140887.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), the addition of other agents (ie, MRAs, SGLT2 inhibitors) may have a greater effect on reducing mortality in HFrEF than does an increase in dose.</p><p>This approach has not been formally tested in a trial, and only retrospective studies evaluate whether the effect of dose is greater than the effect of starting additional agents:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a registry study, patients who took a RAAS inhibitor and beta blocker at 50 to 99 percent of their target dose had lower rates of mortality and hospitalization than patients who took only one class of medication at or above its target dose [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p>Further information on dosing of medications for the treatment of HFrEF is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Management of specific agents'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3373866542"><span class="h2">Time course for initiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The primary therapies for HFrEF should be started over the shortest time course possible but in a manner that allows for assessment of the tolerance of each agent. In general, we start each of the primary agents for the treatment of HFrEF within two to three months of initiating therapy. This approach is primarily motivated by the rapid onset of beneficial effects of the primary therapies for HFrEF, which are evident within weeks to months of starting therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3615695565"><span class="h2">Managing common limitations to optimal therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The side effects and intolerances that limit use of the primary therapies for the treatment of HFrEF are both agent-specific and the result of interactions between agents. If the adverse effects of the primary agents for HFrEF treatment do not resolve after changing the dose or agent to another primary therapy, secondary therapies for HFrEF may be required. The common limitations to therapy are discussed in detail elsewhere in this topic, while the secondary therapies for HFrEF are discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Management of adverse drug effects'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121087.html" rel="external">"Secondary pharmacologic therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1935710056"><span class="h2">Duration of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pharmacologic therapy for treatment of HFrEF is generally continued indefinitely, even in patients with recovery of systolic function [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].

Compared with patients continuing an ACE inhibitor, patients withdrawn to placebo had worse NYHA functional class (worsened in 18 versus 9 percent), exercise tolerance, symptoms of HF, and quality of life. Progressive worsening of HF began four to six weeks after ACE inhibitor withdrawal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Three small, uncontrolled observational studies suggested a high risk of worsening HF after beta blocker withdrawal in patients with HFrEF with dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In the largest of these studies, long-term beta blocker therapy (mean duration greater than one year) in 26 patients was associated with improved NYHA class (3.3 to 1.8) and LVEF (25 to 41 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Subsequent beta blocker therapy withdrawal in 24 patients (mean observation time 7.7 months) was associated with worsened NYHA class (1.8 to 2.8) and LVEF (41 to 32 percent), and there were four deaths. Resumption of beta-blocker therapy in 12 patients was associated with improved NYHA class (3.3 to 2.0) and LVEF (23 to 33 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk of drug withdrawal after recovery of LV systolic dysfunction </strong>– In patients with HFrEF that has improved and who do not have adverse drug effects, we do not stop pharmacologic therapy for HFrEF; there is a risk of recurrent HF and adverse remodeling after withdrawal of treatment for HFrEF even in patients with recovery of LV systolic function. Reliable predictors of durable recovery of ventricular systolic function have not been established.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The risk of recurrent HFrEF after cessation of therapy was illustrated by an open-label, pilot trial in 51 asymptomatic patients with prior dilated cardiomyopathy in whom LVEF had improved from &lt;40 percent to ≥50 percent; 25 patients were randomly assigned to treatment withdrawal and 26 to continued treatment [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. During the initial six months, among the withdrawal group, 11 (44 percent) met the primary endpoint of relapse (reduction in LVEF of more than 10 percent and to less than 50 percent, an increase in LV end-diastolic volume by more than 10 percent and to greater than the normal range, a two-fold rise in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level and to more than 400 ng/L, or clinical evidence of HF), compared with none of those assigned to continue treatment. After six months, 25 of the 26 patients initially assigned to continue therapy switched to withdraw therapy; during the subsequent six months, nine patients (36 percent) met the primary endpoint of relapse.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3955887477"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC AGENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to III HF symptoms and LVEF ≤40 percent should be evaluated for therapy with one agent from each of the following classes of agents:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H397715518"><span class="h2">Sacubitril-valsartan, ACE inhibitor, or ARB</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with a history of NYHA class II to III symptoms and LVEF ≤40 percent who are appropriately treated for volume overload and who are otherwise clinically well-compensated, we recommend initial therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102505" href="/z/d/drug information/102505.html" rel="external">sacubitril-valsartan</a> rather than an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy, or vasodilating agents from other classes  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141491" href="/z/d/graphic/141491.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).
