Potentially life-saving transfusion should never be withheld from a patient with life-threatening anemia, brisk hemolysis, rapid bleeding, or other requirements for immediate transfusion. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The designated emergency release RBC units are generally stored separately from other RBC units to allow rapid access and to avoid potential mis-transfusion of non-group O blood. Specialized modifications may not be available (eg, there may not be irradiated or cytomegalovirus-negative units for emergency release).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Group O, RhD-positive</strong> – At many institutions, emergency release RBC units are group O, RhD-positive for males and females who are beyond childbearing age or when the usage is expected to be very high. Some institutions stock group O, RhD-negative units for females of childbearing potential.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decision to use</strong> – The decision to use emergency release blood depends on clinical judgment of the treating clinician with input from transfusion medicine personnel if needed; the individuals who are caring for the patient and performing the laboratory testing and blood product preparation are best equipped to weigh the risks and benefits of immediate transfusion versus completion of the pretransfusion testing and product modifications. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The relatively low risk for hemolytic transfusion reactions with emergency release RBC transfusions (released with no or incomplete pretransfusion testing) was demonstrated in a retrospective review of 1002 emergency released RBC units transfused to 262 patients, which found a 0.1 percent risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions owing to pre-existing non-ABO RBC antibodies (anti-c and probable anti-Jk<sup>a</sup>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Protocols to follow</strong> – A pretransfusion sample can be obtained when possible to facilitate later testing for additional transfusions. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There should be a written indication on the released unit stating that compatibility testing has not been completed, as well as written confirmation by the treating clinician that emergency release blood is required.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After the blood has been released, compatibility testing can be performed on a pretransfusion sample from the patient (if available). This is useful for crossmatching subsequent units and for notification of the treating clinician of any unexpected results from the antibody screen and/or incompatibilities between the emergency release unit(s) and the recipient. This information is also recorded in the medical record.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Massive transfusion</strong> – Emergency release differs from massive transfusion, in which a large number of RBC units (often with platelets and plasma) are required to treat major bleeding. In some cases of massive transfusion, emergency release blood is used (eg, treatment of massive trauma when pretransfusion testing is incomplete); in others, it is not needed (eg, scheduled liver transplantation). Massive transfusion protocols are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7931.html" rel="external">"Massive blood transfusion"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27221920"><span class="h1">SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27221927"><span class="h2">Specimen age/collection date</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The blood sample used for testing must reflect the patient's blood type and the antibodies present in patient plasma/serum at the time transfusion will be administered. These are usually constant, so there is no absolute requirement for the age/collection date of the sample in a patient who has not been exposed to foreign RBCs through recent transfusion or pregnancy. Some institutions may accept a specimen up to 14 or 30 days before surgery from a non-pregnant individual who has not been transfused within the prior three months for preoperative screening. </p><p>However, if information about pregnancy or prior transfusion within the prior three months is not documented on the order, a more current specimen (&lt;3 days old) is required. The following individuals require a specimen &lt;3 days old:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnant within the previous three months (or are currently pregnant)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Received a transfusion within the previous three months</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Uncertain/unknown history of recent pregnancy and/or transfusion history</p><p></p><p>The collection day is counted as day 0, and the sample expires at midnight on day 3; so, a sample collected on Monday would expire Thursday night at midnight.</p><p>The rationale is that exposure to foreign antigens may have occurred and may have induced re-sensitization to an alloantibody. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27221934"><span class="h2">Plasma or serum collection tube</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Compatibility testing can be performed with plasma or serum.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Plasma</strong> – "Pink top" or "purple top" collection tube containing EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Serum</strong> – "Red top" tube for clotted sample</p><p></p><p>Specimen tubes with gel separator material (eg, red/black "tiger-top" tubes) should not be used for pretransfusion testing because contamination of the serum by the gel material may interfere with interpretation of agglutination [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Definitions (front and back type, Coombs test, agglutination)'</a> below.)</p><p>Plasma is generally preferred over serum for testing because it is anticoagulated, reducing the possibility of small clots that could interfere with the read-out of agglutination. (See <a class="local">'Definitions (front and back type, Coombs test, agglutination)'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Volume</strong> – One 6 mL tube is typically sufficient for all routine blood bank pre-transfusion testing in adults, including type and screen and compatibility testing. Smaller volumes (eg, 3 mL) are acceptable for infants or individuals who are severely anemic. For patients with more complex serological issues (multiple alloantibodies or warm autoantibodies), additional specimen tubes may be needed to complete pretransfusion testing. In these cases, the transfusion service will notify the clinician and request additional tubes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7954.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in individuals with serologic complexity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sources of interference</strong> – Hemolysis or lipemia may interfere with interpretation of agglutination due to color and/or cloudiness of the plasma. The laboratory has specimen acceptance criteria to trigger a request for new samples for testing if this occurs.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27221941"><span class="h2">Labeling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A properly labeled sample is critical to the safety of blood transfusion; clerical error may lead to a fatal transfusion reaction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95132.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction", section on 'Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR)'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Phlebotomist</strong> – The person who draws the blood must identify the patient, preferably by asking the patient their name and date of birth. The tube must be labeled using at least two forms of unique patient-identifying information (eg, patient name, medical record number, date of birth); the date the blood was drawn; and identifying information for the individual who drew the blood sample.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Label</strong> – Labeling of the specimen must occur immediately after specimen collection. Information on the blood tube must match the information on the requisition for compatibility testing, and institution-specific specimen labeling policies should be followed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Quality control</strong> – To mitigate risk of incompatible transfusion secondary to mislabeled specimens (referred to as "wrong blood in tube"), many laboratories and transfusion services require two separate specimens for blood type verification [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Use of an electronic patient identification system is an alternative means of reducing mislabeling [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p>Mislabeled or incompletely labeled specimen tubes should be discarded and a new sample collected in order to avoid possible accidental transfusion of the wrong unit to the wrong patient [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. If blood is needed urgently, emergency release blood should be requested. (See <a class="local">'Emergency release blood for life-threatening anemia or bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27221948"><span class="h2">Other information</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other information important for the transfusion service includes the following, which is generally available from the medical record, the treating clinician, or a blood bank to blood bank communication (for patients who are transferred):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indication and urgency</strong> – Reason for compatibility testing and relevant underlying conditions(s) that may need to be considered when selecting blood components for the patient, such as hematologic malignancy, hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinopathy (eg, sickle cell disease or thalassemia), pregnancy, or certain medications. This may affect urgency and extent of testing as well as specific modifications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7939.html" rel="external">"Practical aspects of red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, processing, modifications, and infusion", section on 'Specialized modifications and products'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prior transfusion history</strong> – Includes RBC, platelet, or plasma transfusion, as well as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or solid organ transplantation with incompatible blood groups. This helps identify risks of alloantibodies. History of prior transfusion reactions is also important. If transfusion occurred at another institution, it is helpful to provide the name of the institution so that they can be contacted. Some countries are working on maintaining a national database of this information.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History of RBC alloantibodies</strong> – Obtained from previous transfusion testing. This will be available in the local institution, but results from other institutions may not be available, especially in the United States. Many hospital blood banks will call the other hospital laboratories or reference laboratories where the patient's samples have been previously evaluated to ensure all alloantibodies are known.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reproductive status </strong>– Includes whether the person has ever been, is, or may become pregnant. For current pregnancy, includes the approximate gestational age. This information is relevant to the risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Special modifications required</strong> – Information about the need for irradiation is critical to avoid transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD), which is almost uniformly fatal; need for cytomegalovirus-safe products should also be specified. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7928.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The need for leukoreduction may be specified, but most institutions use universal leukoreduction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7939.html" rel="external">"Practical aspects of red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, processing, modifications, and infusion", section on 'Pre-storage leukoreduction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other special transfusion requirements such as volume reduction may apply. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7939.html" rel="external">"Practical aspects of red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, processing, modifications, and infusion", section on 'Specialized modifications and products'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H222486711"><span class="h2">How is it regulated</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Regulations can be complex and can differ by country or jurisdiction.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CMS</strong> – Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) regulates all clinical laboratory testing performed on humans in the United States through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>AABB</strong> – The Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) is an international organization that provides technical input and guidance on standards and accreditation for transfusion practice and cellular therapies. AABB publishes a technical manual approximately every three years and standards for blood banks and transfusion services as well as cellular therapy every two years. The organization was formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks and then simply "AABB"; the name was changed in 2021 to reflect its expanded (international) scope. Sites around the world can become AABB-accredited such that they meet standards set by the AABB. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CAP</strong> – The College of American Pathologists (CAP) is a membership organization that fosters and advocates for best practices in pathology and laboratory medicine. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>TJC</strong> – The Joint Commission (TJC) assesses and accredits health care organizations. </p><p></p><p>On behalf of CMS in the United States, the AABB, CAP, and TJC can inspect transfusion services and cell therapies. Institutions can choose which of these organizations participate in these inspections.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>US FDA</strong> – In the United States, review, approval, and regulatory oversight of instrumentation and laboratory information systems used in donor and patient testing are under the purview of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27221955"><span class="h1">SEROLOGIC TESTING (TYPE AND SCREEN)</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2269417429"><span class="h2">Definitions (front and back type, Coombs test, agglutination)</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type and screen</strong> – Type and screen refers to testing on a patient sample in preparation for transfusion. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Type and screen is appropriate for patients who are unlikely to require transfusion but would benefit from the information should transfusion become necessary (eg, in association with surgery). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Blood type</strong> – Blood type (also called blood group) refers to ABO and RhD antigens expressed on an individual's RBCs. This includes forward and back type for ABO and RhD antigens. Typing is required every time a red cell transfusion is ordered and is performed on all patient samples. Blood type from a donation card or military tag is never sufficient evidence for compatibility with a specific recipient. (See <a class="local">'Blood type (ABO and RhD type)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The forward (front) type defines ABO antigens present on the recipient's RBCs. The reverse (back) type reacts patient plasma/serum against reagent group A and B RBCs to determine the patient's antibodies to A and B antigens. The front and back type must fit set criteria in order to assign an ABO type. If the criteria are not met, the ABO type is reported as unresolved. Reasons for discrepancies are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'ABO-type discrepancies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Antibody screen</strong> – The screen tests the patient's plasma/serum for antibodies against RBC antigens including anti-RhD. (See <a class="local">'Antibody screen'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antiglobulin (Coombs) testing</strong> – Coombs testing is a serologic (antibody-based) assay  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100639" href="/z/d/graphic/100639.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Direct</strong> – Direct Coombs (also called direct antiglobulin test [DAT]) detects antibodies and/or complement that are already present on the surface of RBCs, demonstrating <em>in vivo</em> RBC coating. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The DAT is performed by incubating RBCs in a tube with a secondary antibody directed against human immunoglobulins and/or complement. RBCs coated with immunoglobulins and/or complement will be agglutinated by the anti-human antibody  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100639" href="/z/d/graphic/100639.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The DAT is positive when there is an RBC autoantibody (self antibody directed against self RBCs) or an alloantibody (antibody directed against foreign RBCs).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indirect </strong>– Indirect Coombs (also called indirect antiglobulin test [IAT]) is performed by incubating reagent RBCs with patient plasma/serum and then adding the secondary antibody. If the patient's plasma/serum contains antibodies to antigens on the reagent RBCs, the RBCs will be agglutinated.
