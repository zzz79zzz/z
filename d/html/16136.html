The incidence of blunt cerebrovascular injury in patients sustaining blunt trauma is about 1 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Stroke after blunt carotid injury is associated with mortality rates that range from 23 to 28 percent, with 48 to 58 percent of survivors suffering permanent severe neurologic deficits [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Given the potential for high morbidity and mortality rates associated with untreated blunt cerebrovascular injury, expectant management is not appropriate unless there are contraindications to treatment. Treatment strategies include antithrombotic therapy, surgical repair, and endovascular intervention. The treatment strategy for a given individual depends upon his/her symptoms, site of injury, severity or grade of injury, associated injuries that may complicate treatment, and local expertise [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>The treatment and outcomes of blunt cerebrovascular injury are reviewed. The injury mechanisms, screening, and diagnosis of blunt cerebrovascular injury are reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15154.html" rel="external">"Blunt cerebrovascular injury: Mechanisms, screening, and diagnostic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>Penetrating cerebrovascular injury and spontaneous cerebrovascular dissection are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/355.html" rel="external">"Penetrating neck injuries: Initial evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14082.html" rel="external">"Cerebral and cervical artery dissection: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H280052"><span class="h1">INJURY GRADING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A grading scale for blunt cerebrovascular injury was created to standardize clinical communication and to guide therapy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. This grading scale was developed based on conventional arteriography findings, but it has been validated using computed tomographic angiography [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p>The injury grades given below apply to carotid or vertebral artery lesions.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade I: Intimal irregularity or dissection with &lt;25 percent luminal narrowing. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade II: Dissection or intramural hematomas with ≥25 percent luminal narrowing, intraluminal clot, or a visible intimal flap. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade III: Pseudoaneurysm or hemodynamically insignificant arteriovenous fistula. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade IV: Complete occlusion. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade V: Transection with active extravasation (hemorrhage) or hemodynamically significant arteriovenous fistula. These injuries are often lethal. Transection injuries mandate immediate attempts to control bleeding. (See <a class="local">'Other interventions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>For the carotid artery, stroke rates increase with increasing injury grade [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Stroke incidence and neurologic outcome for vertebral injury are independent of injury grade. In a study of 171 patients found to have 236 blunt cerebrovascular injuries, the distribution of injury is representative: grade I (58 percent), grade II (22 percent), grade III (14 percent), grade IV (11 percent), and grade V (3 percent) [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>]. </p><p>The grading scale has been widely used in its original form, but it has been suggested that within the grade II and III classifications, there may be an incremental increased risk based on a higher degree of luminal narrowing [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H259192"><span class="h1">TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the incidence of blunt cerebrovascular injury has increased with routine screening, and experience with this problem has grown substantially at busy trauma centers, there are still no controlled trials to help guide management. Treatment is based upon the demonstration of reduced neurologic morbidity and mortality in treated patients compared with those who are untreated (and to historical controls), from indirect evidence derived from the penetrating neck injury literature [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], and from strategies used in the management of nontraumatic cerebrovascular disorders (eg, spontaneous cerebrovascular dissection). Our treatment recommendations are in general agreement with protocols established by major trauma societies  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78174" href="/z/d/graphic/78174.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].</p><p>The mainstay of treatment for surgically inaccessible injuries (&gt;99 percent) is antithrombotic therapy (heparin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>, or antiplatelet therapy), but the optimal regimen is not known with respect to agent, duration of treatment, or endpoint of therapy. Associated injuries often limit antithrombotic therapy. Endovascular intervention is another option, but stents also require antithrombotic therapy. Factors that determine the treatment strategy for a specific individual include symptoms, site of injury, severity or grade of injury, and associated injuries that may contraindicate a specific therapy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The rationale and recommendations for antithrombotic therapy or other intervention, follow-up, and injury grade-specific recommendations are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other interventions'</a> below and <a class="local">'Follow-up for healing or progression'</a> below and <a class="local">'Injury grade-specific recommendations'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H785733443"><span class="h2">Antithrombotic therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recommend antithrombotic therapy (heparin or antiplatelet therapy) for all patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury who do not have contraindications (eg, active hemorrhage from the vessel [grade V]). (See <a class="local">'Associated injuries that may contradict antithrombotic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The rationale for using antithrombotic therapy for blunt cerebrovascular injury is based on retrospective reviews reporting reduced rates of ischemic neurologic events and better neurologic outcomes among patients treated with heparin or antiplatelet agents compared with untreated patients [<a href="#rid1">1-4,11,12</a>]. Stroke rates in case series from the era prior to screening for these injuries were considerably higher than contemporary series, as injuries were previously not diagnosed until the ischemic neurologic event occurred. In studies that reflect the use of antithrombotic therapies, overall stroke rates for blunt injury (all grades) of the internal carotid artery, common carotid artery, and vertebral injuries are 26 to 41 percent, 11 percent, and 14 to 24 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid1">1,13,14</a>]. Stroke rates increase with increasing injury grade for carotid but not vertebral artery injuries [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>]. In one study, stroke rates for 114 blunt carotid and 79 blunt vertebral injuries were as follows [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade I: Carotid 8 percent; vertebral 6 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade II: Carotid 14 percent; vertebral 38 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade III: Carotid 26 percent; vertebral 27 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade IV: Carotid 50 percent; vertebral 28 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade V: Carotid 100 percent</p><p></p><p>Multiple retrospective studies have reported improved neurologic outcomes among symptomatic patients and fewer ischemic neurologic events (stroke) in asymptomatic patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury who are treated compared with those who are not [<a href="#rid1">1,2,4,14-17</a>]. Injury-specific mortality rates are also reduced. However, patients who are not treated are usually more severely injured, with contraindications to treatment, such as head injury, which influences the comparison. The largest of these studies are summarized below. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a large retrospective review, arteriography was used to screen 727 of 15,767 blunt-trauma patients at high risk for blunt cerebrovascular injury, which was identified in 244 of the patients [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Antithrombotic therapy was initiated in 187 asymptomatic patients with heparin (n = 117), low-molecular-weight heparin (n = 11), and antiplatelet agents (n = 59). Asymptomatic patients who were treated with antithrombotic therapy had a lower ischemic neurologic event rate compared with 48 patients who were not able to be anticoagulated (0.5 versus 21 percent). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective trauma registry review identified 139 blunt cerebrovascular injuries in 96 patients, 75 involving the carotid arteries (14 bilateral), 64 involving the vertebral arteries (14 bilateral), and 15 patients with both [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Antithrombotic therapy (heparin, antiplatelet therapy) was used to treat 43 of 75 carotid injuries and 39 of 50 vertebral artery injuries. Stroke rates for treated and untreated patients were 6.8 versus 64 percent for carotid artery injury, and 2.6 versus 54 percent for vertebral artery injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blunt carotid artery injury was identified in 114 patients screened out of 643 patients at risk from 13,280 blunt trauma admissions [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. None of 73 patients treated with antithrombotic therapy suffered a stroke, whereas 46 percent of the 41 patients who did not receive anticoagulation developed ischemic neurologic events. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H785733542"><span class="h3">Choice of agent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In agreement with major society trauma guidelines  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78174" href="/z/d/graphic/78174.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), we suggest initiating antithrombotic therapy in patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].<strong> </strong>We administer heparin as a weight-based infusion of 15 units/kg per hour (no loading dose), to achieve an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 40 to 50 seconds. This is a lower target range compared with other indications and was selected based on its efficacy and attempted minimization of bleeding complications [<a href="#rid1">1,3,4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1348.html" rel="external">"Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects"</a>.) </p><p>We prefer heparin in the acute setting because it is reversible (many of these patients will require surgery for unrelated injuries) and it may be more effective than antiplatelet drugs [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. There are no randomized trials directly comparing heparin with antiplatelet therapy in the management of blunt cerebrovascular injury; however, a few small retrospective case series and reports from two large trauma centers suggest that antiplatelet therapy may be at least as effective as systemic heparinization for stroke prevention [<a href="#rid1">1,11,12,18-20</a>]. Key results are summarized below. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of 114 patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury reported no significant differences in healing or in progression of injury grade whether the patients were treated with heparin (n = 45) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> (n = 24) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Among the 45 patients who had ischemic neurologic symptoms attributable to the injury, treatment with heparin (n = 31) improved the patient's neurologic status in a greater percentage of patients (71 versus 60 percent) compared with patients treated with aspirin (n = 5), but the difference was not significant. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 301 patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury (some overlap with the study above), heparin (n = 192), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> (n = 67), or aspirin and/or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> (n = 23) were used to treat 192 asymptomatic patients; 107 patients were untreated [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. There were no significant differences in injury healing (39, 43, 46 percent) or progression of injury grade (12, 10, 15 percent) between the treatment groups. A single stroke (0.5 percent) occurred among patients who were treated (heparin group) compared with a stroke rate of 21 percent in the untreated group. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective study identified 22 patients with blunt carotid injury over an eight-year follow-up period [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Of these, eight patients received no treatment, seven patients were treated with heparin, and seven were treated with antiplatelet therapy. No differences in neurologic outcomes were observed between anticoagulated patients and those receiving antiplatelet therapy. Bleeding complications were higher in patients treated with heparin compared with antiplatelet therapy, with four of the anticoagulated patients suffering major bleeding complications that required cessation of heparin and blood transfusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective study of 677 patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury reported that 23 of 600 (4 percent) treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> sustained a stroke, compared with 9 of 77 (12 percent) receiving anticoagulation. After adjusting for injury grade, anticoagulation was associated with higher likelihood of stroke (odds ratio [OR] 3.01, 95% CI 1.00-8.21). In the propensity-matched analysis, patients who received anticoagulation had a 15 percent (95% CI 3.7%-26.3%) higher probability of sustaining a stroke compared with those receiving aspirin [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p>For patients who have contraindications to anticoagulation with heparin or if heparin is unavailable, we recommend antiplatelet agents (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> 325 mg daily or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> 75 mg daily). There are currently no data regarding the treatment of blunt cerebrovascular injuries with direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors. Given the data supporting the safety and efficacy of these medications in other scenarios (eg, stroke prevention with atrial fibrillation, treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism), they warrant study in this patient population. (See <a class="local">'Associated injuries that may contradict antithrombotic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The treatment of patients who suffer stroke after blunt cerebrovascular injury has not been well studied. One group reported significant improvement in neurologic outcomes following heparin therapy [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. A later trial found that antiplatelet therapy was not inferior to anticoagulation (heparin followed by <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>) for preventing recurrent stroke after carotid dissection (3 versus 1 percent) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The small advantage offered by antithrombotic therapy was counterbalanced by one major subarachnoid bleed in the anticoagulation group. It should be noted that all of the enrolled patients had suffered a stroke or transient ischemic attack, and that these were not trauma patients, so whether these results can be generalized to patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury is unclear.</p><p>Although dual antiplatelet therapy may be indicated for other conditions, we do not use dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury due to an increased risk of bleeding and undemonstrated benefit [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. </p><p>For long-term anticoagulation, a transition to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> has been used in the past, but antiplatelet therapy may be preferable to warfarin in the long term due to its potential equivalent efficacy (as discussed in the paragraphs above), better safety profile, and lower cost [<a href="#rid11">11,21</a>].</p><p>However, this recommendation may change in the future. An analysis of the Nationwide Readmission Database reported that the rate of readmission with new stroke in patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury was 3.8 percent [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Patients treated with antiplatelet medications had a higher rate of readmission for stroke compared with those treated with other anticoagulant medications (5.7 versus 1.8 percent). (See <a class="local">'Follow-up for healing or progression'</a> below and <a class="local">'Injury grade-specific recommendations'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H785733569"><span class="h3">Monitoring and complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients treated with antithrombotic therapy should be closely monitored for bleeding complications, which can be serious. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1348.html" rel="external">"Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects", section on 'Other complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1324.html" rel="external">"Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR", section on 'Mitigating bleeding risk'</a>.)</p><p>Preexisting abnormalities in coagulation increase the risk of bleeding in the injured population. Treatment of multiply-injured and brain-injured patients may be compounded by trauma-induced coagulopathy that further increases the risk for hemorrhage. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15147.html" rel="external">"Etiology and diagnosis of coagulopathy in trauma patients"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4826.html" rel="external">"Management of acute moderate and severe traumatic brain injury", section on 'Management of coagulopathy'</a>.) </p><p>Extracranial hemorrhage is a frequent complication of standard anticoagulation in patients with multiple injuries. One study noted that bleeding requiring either transfusion or cessation of heparin occurred in 54 percent of patients treated with heparin when administering a loading dose or titrating to an aPTT goal of 60 to 80 seconds [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A more conservative protocol for initiation (no loading dose) and maintenance of heparin infusion (aPTT 40 to 50) should be used in any injured patient at risk for bleeding [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Choice of agent'</a> above.)</p><p>The presence of new ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging was found in one-half pf patients with blunt cerebrovascular injuries treated with antithrombotic therapy [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].

However, many blunt cerebrovascular injuries involve the vessel (eg, internal carotid artery) at the base of the skull and are therefore <strong>not</strong> surgically accessible. In our experience, only 2 of our first 700 patients treated with blunt cerebrovascular injury had a surgically accessible lesion. This experience is shared by others. Thus, inaccessibility precludes direct surgical repair in most patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury. </p><p>Indirect evidence of benefit for this approach comes from observational studies of patients with penetrating cerebrovascular injury, which have found lower rates of neurologic morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing neck exploration and vascular repair compared with nonoperative management [<a href="#rid8">8,29,30</a>].

As a life-saving maneuver, endovascular embolization is recommended for vascular lacerations/transections (grade V injuries). Embolization has also been promoted in the setting of grade IV injuries to prevent distal embolization in the event of that the artery recanalizes; however, this approach has not been studied in any controlled manner in this subset of patients, and the risks must be considered in light of the data indicating that patients do well with antithrombotic therapy alone [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. </p><p>Many small series and case reports describe successful endovascular interventions for various types of blunt cerebrovascular injury, but there have been no controlled trials, and clear indications for endovascular therapy have yet to be developed [<a href="#rid29">29,39-43</a>].

The carotid artery occlusion rate was higher in patients who underwent stenting compared with patients who were treated with antithrombotic agents alone (21 versus 5 percent). One retrospective review reported a decrease in stent usage over time, which may possibly have been a response to adverse outcomes data. From 2011 to 2012, endovascular stenting was used to treat blunt cerebrovascular injuries in 34 percent, but from 2013 to 2016, stenting was used in only 9 percent [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].

We generally administer heparin in hospitalized patients who may be undergoing surgical procedures, because the effects can be quickly reversed. However, once the risk for bleeding is reduced, we transition to antiplatelet therapy given its low cost and simplicity of administration.
