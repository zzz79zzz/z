         The high prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders in individuals infected with HIV, is related to a wide variety of factors including direct effects of the virus, preexisting psychiatric conditions, personality vulnerabilities, affective disorders, addictions, and personal responses to the social isolation and disenfranchisement associated with the diagnosis of HIV. Furthermore, many HIV-infected persons experience difficulty with treatment adherence due to their behavior patterns as well as acquisition of specific neuropsychiatric disorders associated with HIV disease progression. Studies have shown that patients with neuropsychiatric conditions have poorer outcomes and less benefit from antiretroviral therapy; however, psychiatric treatment improves HIV-related outcomes [

        </p>
        <p>
         Neuropsychiatric care in HIV disease ranges from supportive psychotherapy for grief and loss issues to treatment of specific HIV-associated neuropsychiatric conditions (eg, HIV-associated dementia, minor cognitive motor disorder [MCMD], acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] mania), as well as management of unique clinical presentations of other psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. The availability of effective psychiatric care to HIV-infected patients is critical for their treatment and also for controlling the HIV epidemic.

         Delirium, a state of global derangement of cerebral function, occurs frequently in medically ill, brain-injured, or metabolically unstable patients. Delirium is characterized by inattention, disorganized thinking, confusion, emotional liability, and fluctuations in level of consciousness. Hallucinations and delusions are also common. The etiology of delirium is typically multifactorial, including elements of pharmacological toxicity, metabolic derangements, and sensory isolation due to illness and limited environmental stimulation. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality and should be diagnosed promptly and investigated thoroughly. In addition, delirium is associated with postdelirium psychiatric conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder, suggesting a need for follow-up after an episode of delirium. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Due to the complexity and number of comorbid disorders, delirium is highly prevalent in HIV disease. Delirium is more common in older adults, those with brain injury (including dementia), posttransplant patients, hypoxic patients, and those with frequent intoxication. As an example, one study found that the incidence of delirium was modestly greater in aging patients with HIV than those without HIV [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The differential diagnosis of delirium in HIV-infected patients includes HIV-associated dementia, AIDS mania, minor cognitive motor disorder, major depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, and schizophrenia.

         Delirium can usually be distinguished by its rapid onset, fluctuating level of consciousness, and link to a medical etiology. Common etiologies include:

         HIV infection is associated with multiple cognitive impairments. Early in the epidemic (1980s), a progressive subcortical dementing illness that was fatal was described and later termed AIDS-dementia. With the advent of effective antiviral therapy, rates of this condition diminished in developed settings, but some patients still develop cognitive impairment. The nosology was revised, such that the term HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder is used to describe the entire spectrum of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment with subcategories of asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment, mild neurocognitive disorder, and HIV-associated dementia based on severity.
        </p>
        <p>
         With the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder is more often multifactorial and involves both
         <strong>
          cortical
         </strong>
         and
         <strong>

         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Ongoing research suggests that plasma biomarkers (eg, exosomes) for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, which originate in the brain, may possibly serve as a marker of ongoing viral activity in the central nervous system and cognitive impairment [
         <a href="#rid4">

         HIV-associated dementia, the most severe form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, must be distinguished from other causes of dementia including cytomegalovirus encephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and central nervous system lymphoma.

         HIV-associated dementia usually occurs in patients with a CD4 count nadir &lt;200 cells/microL. Risks factors for HIV-associated dementia include high serum or cerebrospinal fluid HIV viral load [
         <a href="#rid5">

         ), anemia, illicit drug use, and female sex. Since the introduction of potent ART, the incidence of HIV-associated dementia has declined, although not as much as some of the opportunistic infections. (See

         ) is common with HIV disease, both in those with HIV dementia and others, and depression hinders effective treatment of HIV-infected individuals, such that these patients are at significantly increased risk for HIV-disease progression and mortality [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-12
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, depressive symptoms in patients with HIV worsen antiretroviral therapy adherence, while adherence to antidepressant therapy in HIV-positive individuals with depression reverses this trend [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. HIV also increases the risk of developing depression through direct damage to subcortical brain areas, chronic stress, worsening social isolation and intense demoralization. Indeed, patients with symptomatic HIV disease are significantly more likely to undergo a major depressive episode than patients with asymptomatic HIV disease, or HIV-negative control study subjects [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Unfortunately, depression is underdiagnosed and undertreated in most medical clinics and has thus emerged as one of the most significant factors in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4864.html" rel="external">

         The differential diagnosis in HIV patients reporting depressive symptoms includes major depression, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), dementia, delirium, demoralization, intoxication, withdrawal, central nervous system (CNS) injury, CNS infection, and acute medical illness. HIV-associated dementia and other HIV-related CNS conditions can produce a flat, apathetic state often misdiagnosed as depression.

         ), which occurs in HIV-infected patients both as a component of bipolar illness and as the unique entity of AIDS mania, is associated with impulsivity, impaired judgment, and risk taking, all of which can lead to behavior that accelerates HIV-disease progression. Bipolar illness is broad in spectrum, ranging from a severely crippling and chronic mental illness to a mild disorder with alternating experiences of elevated or depressed mood. It is thus difficult to accurately measure the prevalence and incidence of bipolar disorder and it has also been difficult historically to distinguish severe bipolar illness from schizophrenia. Investigators looking at the relationship between HIV and mental illness have thus often simply employed the term "chronically mentally ill" for patients with severe disability from either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4864.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         AIDS mania is uniquely associated with late stage HIV infection. AIDS mania is characterized by typical mania and additional cognitive impairment in the setting of a lack of previous personal or family history of bipolar illness. AIDS mania has less euphoria and more irritability than the mania associated with illness, and is also far more chronic. In contrast to bipolar mania, AIDS mania usually does not remit if left untreated. The prevalence of AIDS mania has dropped significantly since the onset of potent antiretroviral therapy.

         Substance abuse adds a complex dimension to HIV-infected patients since addiction can serve as a primary vector for the spread of the virus but also greatly complicate treatment of HIV [

         The relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HIV infection is also complex. PTSD exacerbates HIV risk behaviors and worsens health outcomes. HIV risk behaviors, such as prostitution and drug abuse, may increase exposure to trauma associated with increased likelihood of developing PTSD, and likewise, PTSD from early trauma predisposes individuals to engage in sex or drug behaviors that increase the risk of HIV infection. For example, PTSD often coexists with depression and cocaine/opioid abuse [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ], both of which are risk factors for HIV. Substance abuse may be either a relief strategy in response to traumatic experience, or a lifestyle that increases exposure to traumatic events like robbery or assault [

         Personality in patients with HIV can be characterized along a spectrum of traits (dimensions), rather than categorized as discrete personality disorders. The dimensional approach emphasizes the assets as well as the maladaptive variants of personality and may help one more fully understand the behavior exhibited by patients. It also suggests intervention strategies and is less stigmatizing. In addition, a classification system based on a continuum approach may better predict HIV risk behavior than the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) categories [

          Delirium
         </strong>
         – Delirium is characterized by inattention, disorganized thinking, confusion, emotional liability, and fluctuations in level of consciousness. The differential diagnosis of delirium in HIV-infected patients includes HIV-associated dementia, AIDS mania, minor cognitive motor disorder (MCMD), major depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, and schizophrenia. Delirium can usually be distinguished by its rapid onset, fluctuating level of consciousness, and link to a medical etiology. (See

          Dementia
         </strong>
         – HIV-associated dementia usually occurs in patients with a CD4 count nadir &lt;200 cells/microL. Risks factors for HIV-associated dementia include high serum or cerebrospinal fluid HIV viral load, low educational level, advanced age, anemia, illicit drug use, and female sex. Since the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence of HIV-associated dementia has declined. (See

AIDS mania is characterized by typical mania and additional cognitive impairment in the setting of a lack of previous personal or family history of bipolar illness. The prevalence of AIDS mania has dropped significantly since the onset of potent ART. (See
