The approach to an infant or newborn with hypotonia or weakness is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6148.html" rel="external">"Approach to the infant with hypotonia and weakness"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6151.html" rel="external">"Overview of peripheral nerve and muscle disorders causing hypotonia in the newborn"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Weakness is a decreased ability to voluntarily and actively move muscles against resistance. Weakness may arise from any portion of the motor unit and is typically divided into upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron weakness as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Upper motor neuron weakness</strong> – Upper motor neuron weakness arises from lesions in the cerebral cortex and corticospinal tracts down to, but not including, the anterior horn cell in the ventral spinal cord.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower motor neuron weakness</strong> – Lower motor neuron weakness results from lesions located in the anterior horn cell, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, or muscle.</p><p></p><p>Weakness can be confused with hypotonia or ataxia. Hypotonia is a decreased resistance to passive range of motion. Ataxia refers to decreased muscular coordination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6148.html" rel="external">"Approach to the infant with hypotonia and weakness"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6465.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with acute ataxia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">CAUSES OF ACUTE WEAKNESS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The causes of acute weakness are provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81649" href="/d/graphic/81649.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Many of the conditions that cause acute muscle weakness are potentially life-threatening. Mortality due to acute muscle weakness is typically caused by respiratory failure or by lesions in the brain that cause both weakness and increased intracranial pressure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H406513698"><span class="h2">Upper motor neuron lesion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with acute upper motor neuron lesions may initially present with altered mental status and focal neurologic findings such as unequal pupils, visual field defects, cranial nerve palsies, and/or paralysis on the opposite side of the central nervous system lesion. During the acute phase, upper motor neuron lesions are associated with decreased spinal cord reflexes and hypotonia. Over the period of several weeks, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and "upper motor neuron" signs (eg, positive Babinski sign) develop.</p><p>In pediatric patients, it is important to emphasize that classic distal upper motor neuron findings are often not present during the early phases of illness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Cerebral cortex</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h4">Intracranial hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Traumatic epidural or subdural hematoma occurs in children who have sustained severe head trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;9  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662" href="/d/graphic/59662.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)) but may also be present in pediatric patients who are less symptomatic, especially in infants with open fontanelles in whom intracranial pressure may increase more gradually. In addition to altered mental status, patients often display findings of increased intracranial pressure (eg, vomiting, tachycardia or bradycardia, increased blood pressure, and focal neurologic signs). The diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage usually includes demonstration of intracranial hemorrhage on neuroimaging. The presence of intracranial hemorrhage without a clear history of trauma is suggestive of abusive head trauma, an underlying bleeding disorder, or acute stroke. The approach to pediatric patients with severe head trauma, subdural hematoma, and epidural hematoma are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6566.html" rel="external">"Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children: Initial evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6519.html" rel="external">"Intracranial epidural hematoma in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6534.html" rel="external">"Intracranial subdural hematoma in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and management"</a>.)</p><p>Less commonly, rupture of a preexisting arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm may cause subarachnoid hemorrhage. Most of these patients are asymptomatic prior to rupture. These children present with severe headache which is often associated with sudden weakness and altered mental status. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1127.html" rel="external">"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h4">Stroke</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Stroke is a rare cause of weakness in children. Infants with stroke may present with focal weakness, but are more likely than older children to present with seizures and altered mental status. Older children usually have hemiparesis or other focal neurologic signs such as aphasia, visual disturbance, or cerebellar signs, although seizures, headache, and lethargy are not uncommon. Neck pain can be associated with cervical artery dissection, and a Horner's syndrome may accompany carotid dissection. Neuroimaging confirms the diagnosis. Common preexisting medical issues contributing to stroke in children and adolescents include sickle cell disease and structural cardiac abnormalities.</p><p>The etiology, clinical features and management of stroke in children is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6213.html" rel="external">"Ischemic stroke in children and young adults: Epidemiology, etiology, and risk factors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6214.html" rel="external">"Ischemic stroke in children: Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h4">Brain tumor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intracranial tumors, either malignant or benign, may cause weakness in addition to many other clinical findings that vary according to whether the fontanelles are closed and the location of the tumor. Intracranial tumors can present with or be exacerbated by hemorrhage into the tumor. These patients usually either have a history of known brain tumor or a history of clumsiness, weakness, behavioral changes, and vomiting. When the acute hemorrhage occurs, symptoms include weakness, severe headache, and vomiting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6250.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h4">Seizure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Todd paralysis is a temporary focal weakness (eg, hemiparesis) following a seizure. It generally improves rapidly during the postictal period with resolution in minutes to hours. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6218.html" rel="external">"Seizures and epilepsy in children: Clinical and laboratory diagnosis", section on 'Behavior after the event'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h4">Hemiplegic migraine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A typical migrainous aura is characterized by progressive neurologic deficits or disturbances with subsequent complete recovery. Visual disturbances are the most common type of aura. However, auras may also involve other senses or occasionally cause motor or speech deficits. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6202.html" rel="external">"Types of migraine and related syndromes in children", section on 'Migraine with aura'</a>.)</p><p>Hemiplegic migraine is manifested by motor and sensory symptoms that are unilateral. These symptoms can last longer than the headache itself. Complete recovery may take weeks in some cases; permanent weakness can occur after multiple attacks. Hemiplegic migraine is divided into familial and sporadic subtypes. Familial hemiplegic migraine is an uncommon autosomal dominant disorder linked to specific gene mutations. In addition, there are some patients who are the first member of their family to have hemiplegic migraine. They are referred to as having spontaneous hemiplegic migraine and may or may not carry one of the described gene variants. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14112.html" rel="external">"Hemiplegic migraine"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h4">Alternating hemiplegia of childhood</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This very rare condition is characterized by periodic episodes of hemiplegia or quadriplegia beginning in infancy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Other findings include paroxysmal eye movements (eg, nystagmus), seizures, cognitive impairment, and ataxia. Episodes often improve or resolve after sleep. A family history of migraine may also be present. The diagnosis is made based upon the clinical findings and excluding brain abnormalities by neuroimaging. These patients warrant prompt referral to a pediatric neurologist.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Spinal cord</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h4">Spinal cord trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Traumatic injuries may damage the spinal cord, either transiently or permanently. The cervical spine is the most frequent site of injury. Clinical features vary according to the degree of cord injury and the level of the injury. Patients may demonstrate spinal shock with bradycardia and hypotension. Associated brain and systemic injuries (eg, hemothorax, extremity fractures, and intraabdominal injury) are common. The initial stabilization, evaluation, and treatment are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4819.html" rel="external">"Acute traumatic spinal cord injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6561.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p>Spinal cord concussion may occur after a direct blow to the head, neck, or back and presents with impairment of sensory and motor function below the level of the injury. Patients with this injury generally recover, often within hours. Other traumatic injuries include spinal epidural hematoma, vertebral column fractures or dislocations, and spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15603.html" rel="external">"Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h4">Spinal cord tumor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Focal weakness and peripheral or back pain are the most common presenting symptoms of a spinal cord tumor. Incontinence may also occur. Neuroimaging, typically magnetic resonance imaging for the appropriate spinal level establishes the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6250.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h4">Paraspinal infection or inflammation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Epidural abscess and discitis are rare causes of weakness in children. Children with epidural abscess may display the classic diagnostic triad of fever, spinal pain, and neurologic deficits, but only a few patients have all three components at presentation. Over time, an untreated epidural abscess is associated with a typical progression of symptoms from back pain (often focal and severe), to root pain (described as "shooting" or "electric shocks"), to neurologic deficits (motor weakness, sensory changes, and bowel and bladder dysfunction), and finally paralysis, which may quickly become irreversible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1292.html" rel="external">"Spinal epidural abscess", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Discitis refers to inflammation of the intervertebral disc. Most patients with discitis are under three years of age and complain of back pain, with or without fever, but rarely, the infection may spread to the epidural space and cause weakness. The etiology is controversial. The current consensus, backed by scant supportive evidence, is that discitis in children usually represents low-grade infection and is on one end of the spectrum of vertebral osteomyelitis. Although disc biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis, when it is performed, as many as 60 percent of tissue samples grow bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus. However, children often recover without antibiotic therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2852.html" rel="external">"Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes", section on 'Discitis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h4">Transverse myelitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transverse myelitis is an inflammatory condition of unclear etiology. Symptoms are characterized by motor and sensory deficits attributable to myelin destruction in one or both sides of the spinal cord. They include pain, weakness, paresthesias, and sphincter dysfunction. These typically present over a few days, with paresthesias preceding the weakness and urinary retention. A hyperacute presentation sometimes occurs with a rapid onset of paraplegia, sensory abnormalities, and urinary retention. This form is often associated with significant back pain. A discrete sensory level may or may not be detected with either presentation. A thoracic sensory level is frequently found in children. Diagnosis is made based upon clinical criteria and is confirmed by characteristic findings of transverse myelitis on magnetic resonance imaging. The clinical features and diagnosis of transverse myelitis is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14088.html" rel="external">"Transverse myelitis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14088.html" rel="external">"Transverse myelitis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H406513809"><span class="h2">Lower motor neuron lesion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with lower motor neuron weakness typically display muscle weakness, hypotonia, fasciculations, and decreased spinal cord reflexes. Mental status is typically, but not always preserved depending upon the cause and whether respiratory failure has occurred.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h3">Anterior horn cell disease</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h4">Poliomyelitis and other enteroviruses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although polio no longer poses the public health threat in the United States and other developed countries that it once did, areas of endemic wild-type poliovirus still exist in other parts of the world. Poliovirus is a species of human enterovirus. A small fraction of patients with poliovirus infection develop central nervous system (CNS) infection. After invading the CNS, the virus uncoats, viral replication occurs, and the motor neuron dies, leading to paralysis of muscle fibers supplied by this motor neuron. Weakness may vary from one muscle or group of muscles, to quadriplegia, and respiratory failure. Tone is reduced, nearly always in an asymmetric manner. Proximal muscles usually are affected more than distal ones, and legs more commonly than arms. Reflexes are decreased or absent. The sensory examination is normal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5143.html" rel="external">"Poliomyelitis and post-polio syndrome", section on 'Poliomyelitis'</a>.)</p><p>Sporadic cases of acute paralysis similar to paralytic poliomyelitis also occur with other enterovirus serotypes, the most important of which is enterovirus A71. Large outbreaks of paralytic disease associated with enterovirus A71 involving hundreds of cases, mostly in children less than six years old have been reported from eastern Europe and Russia, and more recently in Taiwan, Thailand, and China. Enterovirus A71 is associated with hand-foot-mouth disease in most cases. Some children have presented with brainstem encephalitis, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and a rapidly fatal course.</p><p>Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare but serious pattern of symptoms that causes limb weakness, mostly in children, and has been associated with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infection. Most patients develop symptoms in the late summer or early fall in the United States. Characteristic features of this disorder are a febrile or respiratory illness before the onset of neurologic symptoms and a presentation similar to poliomyelitis, with limb weakness, variable cranial nerve involvement (eg, facial weakness, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria, or dysphagia), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of gray matter involvement in the spinal cord. The combination of hypotonic weakness and radiographic or electrophysiologic evidence of anterior horn cell involvement are the most specific findings in AFM. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126102.html" rel="external">"Acute flaccid myelitis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h3">Peripheral nerve</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h4">Guillain-Barré syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) most commonly presents with an acute, progressive, symmetric, ascending weakness over hours to days. Less commonly, patients can present with primarily sensory dysfunction or ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and bulbar dysfunction (Miller-Fisher Syndrome). If weakness progresses, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation may occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6235.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6204.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in children: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22"><span class="h4">Peripheral nerve toxins</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Toxins that can cause life-threatening weakness include heavy metals (eg, arsenic, mercury, thallium), ciguatera fish poisoning (ciguatoxin), and paralytic shellfish poisoning (saxitoxin). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88331.html" rel="external">"Ciguatera fish poisoning"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2745.html" rel="external">"Overview of shellfish, pufferfish, and other marine toxin poisoning", section on 'Paralytic shellfish poisoning'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6166.html" rel="external">"Overview of acquired peripheral neuropathies in children", section on 'Toxins'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h4">Acute intermittent porphyria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is both the most common and most severe of the inherited porphyrias. It is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from a partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) activity, the third enzyme in the pathway of heme synthesis. The neuropathic symptoms most commonly involve muscle weakness with more involvement of proximal muscle groups. Symptoms generally begin after puberty and may be triggered by stress, decreased food intake, a number of different medications (eg, barbiturates, sulfonamides, estrogen, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13342" href="/d/drug information/13342.html" rel="external">griseofulvin</a>)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422" href="/d/graphic/57422.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), and, in women, menses.

The toxin is produced by the Clostridium botulinum bacterium, a soil-dwelling, gram-positive anaerobe. There are three main presentations of botulism: foodborne, wound-associated, and most commonly, infant botulism. Classic, or foodborne botulism, is caused by eating food contaminated by clostridial toxin. Symptoms include vision changes, difficulty swallowing, and, ultimately, progressive weakness. Wound botulism presents similarly to classic botulism but the toxin arises from a grossly infected wound. In infant botulism, the bacteria are ingested and produce toxin within the child's gastrointestinal tract. Infants with botulism present with constipation, lethargy, and poor tone. Honey, which can be contaminated with C botulinum spores, has been associated with infant botulism. Most cases of infant botulism in the United States are thought to result from exposure to dust containing C. botulinum spores from construction sites or agricultural areas. Infant botulism, although rare, is one of the most common causes of acute, generalized weakness in infants.

Most commonly, it presents in a slowly progressive fashion. However, myasthenic crises can occur, which can lead to respiratory failure. The most common symptoms of myasthenia gravis include ptosis and diplopia. These symptoms are generally exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest. Transient neonatal myasthenia affects 10 to 15 percent of babies born to mothers with myasthenia gravis. It can lead to weakness, dysphagia, and occasionally, respiratory distress or failure.

Neurotoxicity is characterized initially by ptosis, diplopia, and bulbar palsy with onset between 1 to 10 hours following envenomation. Symptoms can later progress to dysarthria and more generalized weakness. As a result, frequent, serial observations for ptosis, diplopia, and impaired swallowing function are of paramount importance. Ventilatory support may be required for airway protection or respiratory paralysis.

Viral myositis is a common pediatric condition that is usually self-limited. However, in its most severe and rare form, it can cause severe weakness with rhabdomyolysis. Although many viruses can cause myositis, it is most commonly due to infection with influenza (benign acute childhood myositis), which rarely progresses to rhabdomyolysis. This condition is characterized by refusal to walk with marked tenderness of bilateral calf muscles and pain on passive or active dorsiflexion of the feet in a child who is in the recovery phase of influenza.

Other complications that can occur include respiratory failure secondary to respiratory muscle necrosis and weakness, infection, and pulmonary embolus. In most cases, with prompt recognition and appropriate directed therapy, muscle strength and renal function recover fully, usually within one to two weeks of the onset of rhabdomyolysis.

(See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p>Congenital hypothyroidism remains an important cause of muscle weakness in infants in many parts of the world. The Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome describes infants with typical features of cretinism associated with diffuse muscular hypertrophy and muscle weakness that is predominantly proximal. These infants have motor and cognitive developmental delay, constipation, myxedema, enlarged tongue, and coarse hair and skin typical of cretinism. Despite a very muscular, almost muscle-bound appearance, they are in fact weak and often have difficulty with sitting and head control. Where implemented, neonatal screening has markedly reduced the number of infants with florid hypothyroidism.

Subacute, chronic, or indolent presentations are more suggestive of transverse myelitis, neuropathies (eg, Guillain-Barré syndrome) or myopathies (eg, muscular dystrophy). Weakness that worsens over the course of the day or preferentially affects the extraocular muscles is consistent with myasthenia gravis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trauma</strong> – Weakness following trauma increases the concern for intracranial hemorrhage (eg, epidural hematoma) or spinal cord injury. Weakness immediately after birth would be concerning for nerve injury associated with childbirth (eg, Erb palsy).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Seizure</strong> – Weakness in association with a seizure may indicate acute intracranial hemorrhage or stroke but may also be caused by a self-limited Todd paralysis. Often, the child has a prior history of seizures with Todd paralysis. In addition, Todd paralysis should resolve within a few hours of the seizure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Headache</strong> – Headache and weakness, especially in children with progressive morning vomiting or focal neurological signs, is highly suggestive of an intracranial mass lesion. Children with an intracranial hemorrhage or stroke may also experience rapid onset of a severe headache, often described as the worst of their life. Weakness that is followed by a migrainoid headache is seen in children with hemisyndrome migraine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neck or back pain</strong> – Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, poliomyelitis, transverse myelitis, epidural spinal hematoma, or epidural spinal abscess often complain of neck or back pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – Fever is seen in patients with viral myositis, pyomyositis, and trichinellosis.

Outbreaks of food borne botulism usually involve consumption of home canned foods such as fruits, vegetables, and fish.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Constipation</strong> – In infants, a history of constipation and poor feeding with generalized weakness suggests infant botulism.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dark urine</strong> – A history of dark red or brown urine should prompt consideration of rhabdomyolysis.

Tone in infants can be assessed by observing resistance of the upper or lower extremity as it is pulled by the examiner or by the pull-to-sit maneuver, in which the infant's hands are grasped and the baby is pulled from a supine to sitting position. The normal infant will offer some resistance, with flexion at the knees, elbows, and ankles. The head should move with the body and head lag should be minimal. Pronounced head lag may indicate hypotonia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Muscle strength also can be tested by holding the infant in a vertical position with the feet on a flat surface. A normal infant should be able to bear weight on the lower extremities while attempting to stand. In addition, infants with normal tone hold the wrist or ankle in line with the rest of the extremity. Strength is measured by examining the patient's active movement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Manual muscle strength testing in the older child</strong> – The Medical Research Council's grading system for muscle strength is widely used. The examiner assesses the patient's ability to move the muscle against resistance provided by the examiner who, through experience, has developed a sense of the expected range of normal motor function. This will vary from patient to patient depending upon the age of the subject  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66888" href="/d/graphic/66888.html" rel="external">table 7</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Decreased effort because of pain, fatigue, or malingering may be identified by "give" weakness in which there is initially a full effort followed by the abrupt loss of strength against resistance; this type of response does not occur in the truly weak individual.

Weakness may arise from any portion of the motor unit and is typically divided into upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron weakness. (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute weakness</strong> – The causes of acute weakness are provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81649" href="/d/graphic/81649.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Many of the conditions that cause acute muscle weakness are potentially life-threatening. Mortality due to acute muscle weakness is typically caused by respiratory failure or by lesions in the brain that cause both weakness and increased intracranial pressure (see <a class="local">'Causes of acute weakness'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Upper motor neuron lesion – Patients with acute upper motor neuron lesions may initially present with altered mental status and focal neurologic findings such as unequal pupils, visual field defects, cranial nerve palsies, and/or paralysis on the opposite side of the central nervous system lesion. During the acute phase, upper motor neuron lesions are associated with decreased spinal cord reflexes and hypotonia. Over the period of several weeks, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and “upper motor neuron” signs (eg, positive Babinski sign) develop. (See <a class="local">'Upper motor neuron lesion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lower motor neuron lesion – Patients with lower motor neuron weakness typically display muscle weakness, hypotonia, fasciculations, and decreased spinal cord reflexes. Mental status is typically, but not always preserved depending upon the cause and whether respiratory failure has occurred. (See <a class="local">'Lower motor neuron lesion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic weakness</strong> – Important causes of chronic weakness in children are shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65108" href="/d/graphic/65108.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). Of these, congenital hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome are important conditions to recognize because they are reversible with prompt treatment. (See <a class="local">'Causes of chronic weakness'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stabilization</strong> – Initial evaluation of a child with weakness should focus on the child's airway, breathing, and circulation with careful assessment of respiratory effort, air movement, and pulse oximetry. The presence of Cushing's triad (bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular respirations) or altered mental status should prompt emergency evaluation for and treatment of increased intracranial pressure. (See <a class="local">'Initial stabilization'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic approach</strong> – The diagnostic approach to the child with muscle weakness is summarized in the algorithms  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53075" href="/d/graphic/53075.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78154" href="/d/graphic/78154.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51289" href="/d/graphic/51289.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a>). Assessment should focus on key historical and physical examination findings that help narrow the extensive differential diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81649" href="/d/graphic/81649.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).
