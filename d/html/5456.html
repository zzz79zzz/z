The patient is educated to understand when they are in their fertile period so they can then avoid vaginal intercourse or use a coital-dependent contraceptive method, such as a condom. These methods are also referred to as natural family planning. FAB methods are best used by motivated individuals whose partners also support the use of this contraceptive approach. </p><p>This topic will discuss different FAB methods, candidates, counseling points, and method use. In the text, we will use the terms "woman," "women," or "patient" to describe those who use female contraceptive methods. However, we recognize that not all people capable of pregnancy identify as women, and we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling needs of transgender men. Clinicians should ask all patients who identify as male about their contraceptive needs as well. </p><p>Related content on contraceptive selection is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5459.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Counseling and selection"</a>.)</p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender diverse individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3099115036"><span class="h1">WHAT IS FERTILITY AWARENESS-BASED CONTRACEPTION?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>FAB methods, also called "natural family planning," involve identifying the fertile days of the menstrual cycle using a combination of cycle length and physical manifestations of ovulation (change in cervical secretions, basal body temperature) and then avoiding sexual intercourse or using barrier methods on those days [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These methods can also be used in reverse to improve the chance of conception by couples attempting to conceive. (See <a class="local">'Physiology of fertility awareness-based methods'</a> below.)</p><p>FAB methods rely on the following [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The periodicity of fertility and infertility</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A single ovulation each cycle</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The limited duration of viability of the ovum, which can only be fertilized 12 to 24 hours after release</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The limited duration of viability of sperm (three to five days in cervical mucus and the upper genital tract)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A woman's ability to monitor cycle length and/or cycle-related symptoms and signs, such as changes in cervical mucus</p><p></p><p>Studies using sensitive hormonal tests and ultrasound have established that a woman is fertile from five days before ovulation to the 24 hours after ovulation (ie, six days total per cycle) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Identifying the six-day fertile window is the critical component of any FAB method. The probability of pregnancy from unprotected intercourse during this period is as follows  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74756" href="/d/graphic/74756.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Five days before ovulation – 4 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Two days preceding ovulation – 25 to 28 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During the 24 hours after ovulation – 8 to 10 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For the remainder of the cycle – 0 percent</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H527656850"><span class="h2">Ideal candidates</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Potential candidates for FAB methods are individuals who choose to use them for health or personal reasons, are able to comply with FAB method requirements, and will abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods on fertile days. The most appropriate candidates for FAB methods are those who can communicate with their partners and whose partners are willing to support use of this method [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. </p><p>Variables to consider in counseling about FAB methods are a couple's motivation to use the method consistently and correctly, the individual's desire to monitor fertility signs, and their partner's desire to be involved. Certain aspects of FAB methods, such as monitoring physiologic changes or shared responsibility for contraception, may be unappealing to some individuals but be seen as a positive to others. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H56707074"><span class="h2">Resource-limited settings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Global studies from resource-limited settings report that motivated patients who meet the criteria for FAB method use can successfully use a FAB method [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. FAB methods may be the only available options in some areas. Worldwide FAB use has been estimated at 3.6 percent [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. While the Standard Days Method and the TwoDay Method were designed for females with limited resources because they do not require additional tools, these methods can be used by individuals across all socioeconomic circumstances. (See <a class="local">'Standard Days Method'</a> below and <a class="local">'TwoDay Method'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Relative contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who desire a highly reliable contraceptive, do not have regular menses, are unable to track their menses or physiologic changes, do not have a supportive partner, and/or desire protection from sexually transmitted infections are not ideal candidates for FAB methods [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Relative contraindications include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Irregular cycles</strong> – As most FAB methods involve tracking menses to identify the fertile window, patients with irregular cycles for any reason are suboptimal candidates for FAB use. Such patients include those with recent menarche, discontinuation of some hormonal contraceptives, polycystic ovarian syndrome or oligoovulation, and perimenopause [<a href="#rid1">1,7,8</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interruption of cycles</strong> – Pregnancy interrupts the cyclic release of hormones that results in the menstrual cycle. Thus, people who have been pregnant, including those with pregnancy loss, abortion, or delivery, do not know when their hormonal cycles, and thus ovulation, will resume.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inability to track physiologic changes</strong> – Patients who are unable or unmotivated to track physiologic changes in cervical secretions and basal body temperature are advised to consider other contraceptive methods. Such patients can include those with intellectual disability, adolescents, and those in unstable or chaotic environments (eg, homelessness).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, the ovulation, TwoDay, and symptothermal methods are not appropriate for those unable to interpret their fertility signs, such as individuals with persistent reproductive tract infections that alter vaginal secretions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lack of supportive partner</strong> – As a key component of FAB methods is abstinence or temporary contraceptive use during the fertile window, FAB methods will not work for patients whose partners will not comply. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3318205488"><span class="h1">EFFICACY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2141847698"><span class="h2">Overall</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Typical-use pregnancy rates approach 25 percent for FAB methods combined  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119765" href="/d/graphic/119765.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,9</a>]. There are no high-quality randomized trials comparing efficacy of different FAB methods [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Typical-use unintended pregnancy rates range from 2 (symptothermal method) to 23 percent (ovulation method) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Reported perfect-use failure rates during the first year range from 0.4 to 5.0 percent, which appear comparable across methods. The disparity between perfect- and actual-use pregnancy rates is greater for methods that require more user action than for simpler ones. The population studied may impact the typical-use failure rate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4167332819"><span class="h2">Learning time impact on efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The time needed to learn the method and use it correctly must be considered when assessing FAB method efficacy. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Impact of learning phase – Some early efficacy studies of FAB methods (specifically of the cervical mucus or ovulation method and the symptothermal method) enrolled study participants only after they had completed a learning phase, typically consisting of three cycles of use, while others enrolled participants from the day they started using the methods. Since failure rates are highest during the early cycles of use, when patients are enrolled can be an important factor in study outcome [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Subsequent studies of the Standard Days Method (SDM) and the TwoDay Method enrolled individuals as soon as they started using the methods. These studies reported that over 20 percent of couples had intercourse during their fertile days when they first learned to use a method but that this percentage dropped sharply during the first three months and continued to decline during the first year of use [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Impact of ease of use – Methods that are easier to use than the ovulation and symptothermal methods also may result in regular use and thus greater effectiveness [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. For example, Clue Birth Control (formerly Dot) and Natural Cycles are easily used by individuals with consistent access to a mobile phone [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clue Birth Control (previously called Dot) and Natural Cycles, incorporate algorithms derived from large databases into mobile phone apps. These apps have been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for use by individuals ages 18 and over who meet criteria for using them. These methods have perfect-use failure rates of 3 and 5 percent and typical-use failure rates of 8 and 2 percent, respectively, and are easily used by individuals with consistent access to a mobile phone [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2794469156"><span class="h2">Traditional fertility awareness-based methods</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Standard Days Method</strong> – In an observational study that taught nearly 500 women the SDM with a CycleBeads teaching device and followed them for up to 13 cycles, the unintended pregnancy rate for perfect use was &lt;5 per 100 women per year [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The typical-user pregnancy rate of the SDM was 12 per 100 women per year.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ovulation methods</strong> – In a prospective multi-country study of over 850 women who were taught the ovulation method, the correct-use failure rate was 3 per 100 women per year, and the typical-user failure rate was 23 per 100 women per year [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. The large difference between correct and typical use reflects the complexity of learning and using the method correctly, as well as the choice of some couples to have unprotected intercourse on fertile days. One study of a streamlined patient counseling program reported a lower typical-use failure rate of 16 per 100 users at 21 months [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>TwoDay Method</strong> – A prospective, multisite efficacy study of the TwoDay Method followed 450 women for up to 13 cycles of use [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The first-year correct-use pregnancy rate was 3.5 per 100 women per year, and the typical-use pregnancy rate was &lt;14 per 100 women per year. The lower typical-use failure rate of the TwoDay Method compared with the cervical mucus or ovulation method is probably due to its simplicity. Individuals may find it easier to learn and use and thus are more likely to use it correctly.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptothermal method</strong> – Efficacy studies indicate that this method has a correct-use first-year pregnancy rate of 2 per 100 women per year and a typical-user pregnancy rate between 13 and 20 per 100 women per year [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. The wide range in failure rates reflects differences in study designs. The large difference between correct- and typical-use failure rates probably reflects the complexity of learning and using the method correctly and the issues around avoiding unprotected intercourse on fertile days.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fertility monitor (Marquette) method</strong> – In a 24 month prospective study, 663 non-breastfeeding women who desired to avoid pregnancy used a university-based online web tracking system to record their cervical mucus changes, hormone-monitoring test results, or both [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The unintended pregnancy rate for typical use was 15 percent while the perfect-use rate was 2 percent. Study participants using the electronic fertility monitor alone had the lowest unintended pregnancy rate (6 percent) compared with those using only cervical mucus monitoring (18 percent) or those using both fertility indicators (19 percent). </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3466524128"><span class="h2">Computer and phone applications (apps)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies evaluating apps for pregnancy prevention are limited. Clue Birth Control (previously called Dot) and Natural Cycles incorporate algorithms derived from large databases into mobile phone apps. These apps have been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for use by individuals ages 18 and over who meet criteria for using them [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Natural Cycles app</strong> – A prospective observational study of the Natural Cycles app that included over 18,500 woman-years of data reported a typical-use Pearl Index (PI) of 6.9 pregnancies per 100 woman-years (95% CI 6.5-7.2), a 13-month typical-use pregnancy rate of 8.3 percent, and a 12-month discontinuation rate of 54 percent [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Study limitations included lack of data on the methodology or assumptions for the app algorithm and limited data on episodes of sexual activity (ie, exposure). An observational study of Natural Cycles app users reported lower typical-use one-year PIs for those who switched to the Natural Cycles app from a less effective contraceptive method (condoms: PI 3.5±0.5) compared with individuals who switched from more effective methods (prior oral contraceptive pill use: PI 8.1±0.6) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clue Birth Control</strong> – A prospective cohort study of 718 women using Clue Birth Control (formerly Dot) followed established guidelines for contraceptive efficacy studies and reported a 13-month typical-use failure rate of 5 percent [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1424458194"><span class="h1">COUNSELING POINTS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Safety</strong> – There is no evidence of direct harm from use of FAB methods [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. However, the harm from unintended pregnancies needs to be considered when evaluating any contraceptive method. Individuals with certain medical conditions should be advised that sole use of barrier methods for contraception and behavior-based methods of contraception may not be the most appropriate choice because of their relatively higher typical-use rates of failure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119765" href="/d/graphic/119765.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because unintended pregnancies among couples who use FAB methods usually result from having intercourse at the beginning or end of the fertile time within a cycle, concerns have been raised about the risk of congenital anomalies or poor pregnancy outcomes due to aged ovum or sperm. There is no evidence to support these concerns. Fertilization of aging gametes (ie, age from ejaculation or ovulation) is not associated with major congenital anomalies or Down syndrome [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. A prospective study that evaluated rates of spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, or preterm birth among women who had an unintended pregnancy while using a FAB method versus women who had intended pregnancies reported no significant differences in these outcomes [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. An exception is that, in one prospective study, women with a history of spontaneous abortion had a greater chance of having another spontaneous abortion when conception occurred very early or late in the fertile time (23 versus 10 to 15 percent) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Benefits</strong> – Benefits of FAB methods include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No local or systemic adverse effects</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No or minimal cost</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No delay in return of fertility</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No interactions with other drugs</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>No sexually transmitted infection (STI) protection</strong> – FAB methods do not reduce risk of STI transmission. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7595.html" rel="external">"Prevention of sexually transmitted infections"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Barriers to FAB use</strong> – Surveys and behavioral research worldwide indicate that individuals who choose FAB methods do so because of their concerns about side effects and health consequences of other contraceptive methods. Religious constraints appear to play a small part in their method choice [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Although many people have concerns about non-FAB methods of pregnancy prevention, most have not embraced FAB methods. Only an approximate 1 percent of women in the United States use FAB contraception [<a href="#rid32">32</a>], and 3.6 percent use it worldwide [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Possible explanations include lack of information, inconvenience, and concerns about efficacy (high typical-user failure rate):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Lack of information</strong> – The lack of readily available patient information on FAB methods is likely related to at least three factors: (1) the absence of a profitable product to advertise and sell, (2) provider concern that these methods are not as effective as other choices, and (3) the amount of time needed to counsel patients [<a href="#rid33">33-35</a>]. Studies including both physicians and nurse-midwives have shown that relatively few providers routinely include information about FAB methods in their family planning discussions with patients. As an example, a survey of approximately 500 physicians in the United States found that one-third did not mention FAB methods to their patients at all, while 40 percent mentioned them only to selected women [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. When asked by a patient for information about a FAB method, most physicians described either calendar rhythm or basal body temperature, which are among the least effective FAB methods (see <a class="local">'Historical methods no longer used'</a> below). In another study, nurse-midwives offered little information about FAB methods based on their perception that these methods were not effective or were inappropriate for their patients [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. A recent survey of Title X service providers found that providers were either neutral or negative toward FAB methods, considered them inappropriate for most patients, and rarely offered them unless patients specifically requested them [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Convenience</strong> – FAB methods can be labor-intensive for the clinician because of the time required for choosing the most appropriate method for an individual and for teaching them the method. These methods also require ongoing effort on the individual's part and impact spontaneity in sexual relations.

Predicting the onset and determining the end of the six-day fertile window are the critical components of a FAB method.

Subsequent modeling resulted in an algorithm that was applicable to cycle lengths of between 20 and 40 days and that was able to determine a variable fertile window depending on the pattern of cycle lengths [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. The algorithm identified that intercourse was to be avoided for 11 to 13 days per cycle for any given patient, assuming couples had intercourse during menses. For individuals or couples who prefer to avoid intercourse during menses, the number of days of abstinence in a typical 28-day cycle would range from 15 to 20.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3265559984"><span class="h2">Cervical secretions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abundant, clear, wet, stretchy cervical secretions occur immediately before, during, and immediately after ovulation; thus, the day of ovulation can be predicted by observing changes in vaginal discharge that occur over a typical 28-day menstrual cycle [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The sequence of change is menses; followed by no secretions for 3 to 4 days; followed by scant, cloudy, sticky secretions for 3 to 5 days; followed by abundant, clear, wet, stretchy secretions for the 3 to 4 days immediately before, during, and immediately after ovulation; and, finally, no secretions for 11 to 14 days, at which time the next menstrual period begins. The duration of these phases varies by cycle length and in individual women. While changes in characteristics of cervical secretions are of clinical interest, the critical feature of secretions for purposes of identifying the fertile window is their presence or absence [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>The characteristics of cervical secretions during the menstrual cycle are affected by serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations. Before ovulation, estradiol produced by the developing follicle stimulates the production of cervical secretions that facilitate passage of sperm through the cervix and lead to functional maturation of sperm (capacitation) so that fertilization of the ovum is possible. Following ovulation, progesterone produced by the corpus luteum causes an abrupt change in secretions, which then inhibit sperm migration and capacitation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H389315266"><span class="h2">Basal body temperature</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a normal menstrual cycle, BBT is approximately 0.5°F (0.3°C) higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase.

It is the easiest FAB method to teach and use and has the fewest days requiring abstinence or barrier contraception. The only instruction is to avoid unprotected intercourse from day 8 through day 19 of the cycle (12 days); the user may have unprotected intercourse on all other days. </p><p>SDM is appropriate for persons whose menstrual cycles are usually between 26 and 32 days (approximately 78 percent of cycles are within this range) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Thus, individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome, adolescents whose cycles may be irregular in early postmenarche, breastfeeding persons with amenorrhea, individuals who have recently been pregnant, and those in the menopausal transition often are not good candidates [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>].</p><p>Additional counseling points include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial cycle assessment</strong> – The first step in SDM counseling is assessing whether the method is appropriate for the individual.

One advantage is that persons with cycles &lt;26 or &gt;32 days can use this method, unlike the SDM above. Unprotected intercourse is avoided on potentially fertile days plus some additional days as specified by method rules (see below). As a result, cervical mucus method users need to avoid unprotected intercourse for approximately 14 to 17 days each cycle [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].

If any secretions were noted today or yesterday, today is a potentially fertile day, and users should avoid unprotected intercourse.

As with the Billings or Creighton methods discussed below, users of the TwoDay Method note secretions on toilet paper or underwear or by the feel at the vulva. Users typically chart the presence or absence of secretions and menses and thus identify their fertile days  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60185" href="/d/graphic/60185.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>).

Some "fertility apps" are essentially digital platforms that support an individual's use of an existing FAB method, such as the symptothermal method, the ovulation method, or SDM. These apps replace the traditional paper and pencil charts associated with these methods. If an app accurately represents the FAB method on which it is based, it can be assumed that its effectiveness for pregnancy avoidance would be the same as that for the underlying method.

(See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/d/html/112268.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Contraception"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Description</strong> – Fertility awareness-based (FAB) methods, also called "natural family planning," involve identifying the fertile days of the menstrual cycle using a combination of cycle length and physical manifestations of ovulation (change in cervical secretions, basal body temperature [BBT]) and then avoiding sexual intercourse or using barrier methods on those days. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physiology of fertility awareness-based methods'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Candidates</strong> – The most appropriate candidates for FAB methods are individuals who are motivated to track these methods, can communicate with their partners, and whose partners are willing to support use of these methods. Patients who are not ideal candidates for FAB methods include those who desire a highly reliable contraceptive, do not have regular menses, are unable to track their menses or physiologic changes, do not have a supportive partner, and/or desire protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). (See <a class="local">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy rates</strong> – Typical-use pregnancy rates approach 25 percent for FAB methods combined  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119765" href="/d/graphic/119765.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,9</a>], although this estimate includes pregnancies that occur when the user has not been counseled on a FAB method and may be uninformed about their fertility status during their cycle. Reported perfect-use failure rates during the first year range from 0.4 to 5.0 percent, which appear comparable across all FAB methods. The disparity between perfect- and actual-use pregnancy rates is greater for more complex methods than for simpler ones. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risks and benefits</strong> – There is no evidence of direct harm from use of FAB methods. However, the harm from unintended pregnancies needs to be considered when evaluating any contraceptive method. Benefits of FAB methods include unlimited access and no or low cost. However, FAB methods do not protect against transmission of STIs. (See <a class="local">'Counseling points'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>FAB methods and selection</strong> – Individuals should choose a FAB method based on their preferences regarding the procedures involved in using each method and the number of days per cycle during which the user needs to avoid unprotected intercourse, while accounting for the specific constraints of the method. (See <a class="local">'Choosing a fertility-awareness based method'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Standard Days Method</strong> – The Standard Days Method (avoid unprotected intercourse from day 8 through 19) is only appropriate for individuals with regular cycles of 26 to 32 days. It is the easiest FAB method to teach and use, and many individuals learn to use it without counseling through information available through web applications, such as iCycleBeads, that can be downloaded onto smart phones or tablets. The user abstains or uses a barrier method for 12 days, which is fewer days than for the ovulation or symptothermal methods. (See <a class="local">'Standard Days Method'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>TwoDay Method</strong> – TwoDay method users are counseled to avoid unprotected intercourse on days when they note cervical secretions and on the day after the day with cervical secretions. It is the easiest cervical secretion method to learn and perform. The TwoDay Method can be used by individuals with short, long, or irregular cycles. Users of the TwoDay Method abstain or use a barrier method for approximately 13 days each cycle. (See <a class="local">'TwoDay Method'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Observation of cervical mucus</strong> – The cervical mucus or ovulation method requires individuals to observe and evaluate their cervical secretions several times each day and avoid unprotected intercourse based on their findings. This method may be used by individuals with short, long, or irregular cycles, but it is time consuming to teach, learn, and practice. Based on the rules of the cervical mucus or ovulation method, the user avoids unprotected intercourse for approximately 14 to 17 days each cycle. (See <a class="local">'Cervical mucus or ovulation method'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Symptothermal method</strong> – The symptothermal method requires individuals to observe and evaluate their cervical secretions several times each day and take their temperature with a BBT thermometer each morning before rising. This method can be used by those with short, long, or irregular cycles. Users of the symptothermal method avoid unprotected intercourse for approximately 12 to 17 days each cycle. (See <a class="local">'Symptothermal method'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">Natural Family Planning and Fertility Awareness.
