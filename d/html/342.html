         First responders should maintain a high clinical suspicion for spinal column injury in blunt trauma patients, especially in the setting of a motor vehicle collision, assault, fall from a height, older adults, high-risk medical/skeletal conditions (eg, advanced arthritis, cancer, Down syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis), overt signs of head/facial trauma, or sports-related injury. For any patient with a possible cervical spine injury, some form of cervical spinal immobilization or protection should be initiated at the scene and maintained until an unstable spinal injury is excluded using a validated assessment instrument or appropriate diagnostic imaging. A patient who is "found down" with no information about preceding events should be presumed to have a cervical spinal column injury.

         <strong>
          Immobilization techniques
         </strong>
         – Prehospital personnel should attempt to place a cervical collar as per their local protocols. When not possible to place a collar, or to further stabilize the cervical spine and minimize head motion, towel rolls, foam head blocks, and tape may be used.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Traditionally, spinal immobilization has included a backboard, rigid cervical collar, and lateral head supports; however, some states and emergency medical services have revised their protocols to omit the backboard for cervical spine injuries and use only a rigid cervical collar and the padded stretcher with the patient in a supine or Semi-Fowlers position (head of bed inclined 30 degrees). For long transports (as per local prehospital protocols), we recommend removing the patient from the backboard and placing them on a stretcher to prevent potential complications [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].There is no high-quality evidence demonstrating that use of a backboard prevents spinal injury or improves outcome, although it is helpful for extricating trauma patients from vehicles.

          Prehospital cervical spine clearance
         </strong>
         – In some locations, emergency medical services directors have instituted protocols that allow for the use of clinical decision rules, such as National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS), to eliminate unnecessary cervical spine immobilization. (See

          Patient with normal neurologic examination
         </strong>
         – Spinal injury is uncommon in patients with penetrating trauma and rare in younger patients without evidence of neurologic injury [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. Given this lower risk and the possibility of harm from immobilization, some experts have questioned the need for spinal immobilization in patients with penetrating trauma who do not manifest neurologic deficits or altered mental status. However, first responders and emergency clinicians must remain cautious when they consider removing or not applying spinal immobilization in this setting because victims of penetrating trauma may simultaneously sustain blunt head or neck trauma, such as during an assault. This issue is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

          Patient with neurologic deficit
         </strong>
         – Patients with penetrating neck trauma and neurologic deficits should be immobilized and undergo a workup, including a search for bony injury. In a retrospective study of cervical gunshot wounds sustained by 144 patients over 12 years, 30 percent of patients with a neurologic injury required surgery for instability of the cervical spine [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. A retrospective study of 2267 patients following explosive injuries found that cervical spine injuries were uncommon; unstable fractures were from penetrating trauma and almost always had irreversible neurological deficits at presentation [

         In a patient with traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest, even with evidence of spinal injury, the preferred approach to definitive airway control is orotracheal intubation. This agrees with the American College of Surgeons' Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines [

         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         ]. Unstable lesions at or above C3 to C5 may cause immediate respiratory paralysis or cause delayed paralysis from paracervical edema; the risk progressively increases with C5 lesions and higher [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. Lower cervical lesions may cause delayed phrenic nerve paralysis from ascending edema of the spinal cord. In addition, cervical spinal column injury may be associated with airway obstruction from retropharyngeal hemorrhage, edema, or maxillofacial trauma. (See

         Transient loss of spinal cord function, sometimes manifested as areflexia, flaccid paralysis, or anesthesia can occur following spinal column injury. It is termed "spinal shock,” but is not a true shock state as it does not result in hemodynamic compromise or organ hypoperfusion. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4819.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In trauma patients, hemodynamic compromise should always be attributed to hemorrhagic shock until proven otherwise. However, loss of sympathetic tone can result in neurogenic shock, which can cause hypotension and bradycardia. It may occur from injury to the spinal cord, especially the superior portion. The evaluation of spinal cord injury and the management of neurogenic shock are discussed separately. (See

         History – We ask about details of the trauma, as well as presence of neck pain or neurologic symptoms (eg, weakness, numbness, paresthesias). We obtain a past medical history specifically inquiring about conditions that predispose patients to cervical spinal column injury. As examples, Down syndrome patients are predisposed to atlanto-occipital dislocation, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis are prone to ligamentous injury throughout the whole cervical spine. (See

         Back – The entire spine and paraspinal musculature should be exposed and palpated for areas of tenderness or deformity; a step-off in the spine may indicate vertebral subluxation or fracture. Widening of an interspinous space indicates a tear in the posterior ligament complex and a potentially unstable spinal injury, although this finding is difficult to appreciate.

         Neurologic examination – A focused but systematic evaluation should be performed in all patients with a possible spine injury. Clinicians should assess the presence, strength, and symmetry of both voluntary and involuntary movements, changes in sensation, reflexes, proprioception, and hemodynamic status. Priapism may occur with severe spinal cord injury from loss of sympathetic tone. An abnormal breathing pattern may indicate a cervical injury, as the diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Any sensory deficits, including the dermatome where they occur, should be noted. Bowel or bladder incontinence or retention is an important finding. The spinal cord syndromes and manifestations based on level of injury are summarized in the following tables  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62066" href="/z/d/graphic/62066.html" rel="external">

         When assessing for cervical spine injury, it is preferable to conduct the neurologic examination when the patient is alert and sober; however, this is not always practical or feasible. At minimum, gross motor function should be assessed in every patient. In an intoxicated patient with intact gross motor function, a normal cervical spine computed tomography (CT) scan obtained with a multidetector scanner with multiplanar reformations is sufficient to provide cervical spine clearance.

         Rectal examination – We do not routinely perform a digital rectal examination for the sole purpose of evaluating a spinal cord injury. This agrees with current ATLS guidelines.

For example, in a frail, older patient with even a minor fall, we will often obtain CT imaging given increased risk of fracture but may choose not to image an older patient with lateral neck pain and no midline tenderness after a low-speed rear-ended motor vehicle collision.

         However, a very low threshold should be used to determine the need for imaging studies in older adult trauma patients given the higher risk of cervical spine injury due to osteoporosis, comorbidities, and other factors [

         Our approach to determining if a patient needs cervical spine imaging is based on available studies and our clinical experience. No standard approach has been explicitly defined and some debate continues regarding the most efficient and effective method of cervical spine clearance. Various studies support the use of one or more of the criteria for high risk of cervical spine injury listed above, and we believe they provide reasonable guidance regarding which patients warrant imaging [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,35

         ]. However, no subsequent trials have validated the use of all six high-risk criteria.

         Painful distracting injury – According to the NEXUS authors, examples of a "painful distracting injury" include long bone fractures, visceral injury requiring surgical consultation, large lacerations, crush injuries, large burns, and any injury the clinician thinks "to have the potential to impair the patient's ability to appreciate other injuries" [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. Some experts believe that the presence of a painful distracting injury does not limit the accuracy of a clinical assessment of the cervical spine performed in an alert trauma patient [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ], but we feel such a conclusion is premature. A study that assessed each component of the NEXUS low-risk criteria found that the overall sensitivity decreased to 93.5 percent when the painful distracting injury criteria was removed [

         The NEXUS low-risk criteria was the first decision rule to be developed and was prospectively validated in a large, multicenter, observational study [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. The NEXUS study evaluated 34,069 blunt trauma patients who underwent imaging of the cervical spine (either three-view cervical spine radiograph, cervical spine CT, or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) at 21 participating emergency departments. Of these patients, 818 (2.4 percent) had sustained a cervical spinal column injury. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of the NEXUS low-risk criteria for a clinically significant injury were 99.6 percent (95% CI 98.6-100), 12.9 percent (95% CI 12.8-13.0), and 99.9 percent (95% CI 99.8-100), respectively. Insignificant injuries were defined as those that would not lead to any consequences if left undiagnosed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even though post-hoc subgroup analysis of older patients in the original study population reported very high sensitivity for the NEXUS criteria [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ], subsequent studies have found lower sensitivity in patients &gt;65 years old. In the original study population, this age group only accounted for 8.6 percent of patients and had a higher rate of cervical spine injury (4.6 versus 2.2 percent). A retrospective registry study of 4035 trauma patients (age ≥65 years) found the sensitivity of the NEXUS criteria for identifying cervical spine fracture was 94.8 percent (95% CI 92.1–96.7); the NEXUS criteria would have missed 21 fractures (4.5 percent) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Another study of 320 blunt trauma patients (age &gt;65 years, median = 75 years) found the sensitivity of the NEXUS criteria for cervical spine fracture was 66 percent compared with 84 percent in 2465 younger patients (median = 36 years) [

The CCR has also been validated in larger hospital-based studies and in an out-of-hospital study of paramedics [

         Both the NEXUS low-risk criteria and the CCR are sensitive, and either can be used to determine the need for cervical spine imaging. Controversy persists about which of the two rules is more specific.
        </p>
        <p>
         The prospective Canadian study of the CCR discussed above also evaluated the NEXUS low-risk criteria in the same patients [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Compared with the NEXUS low-risk criteria, the CCR was more sensitive (99.4 versus 90.7 percent), more specific (45.1 versus 36.8 percent) for injury, and its use would have resulted in a lower imaging rate (55.9 versus 66.6 percent). The authors reported that the CCR would have missed one patient with an important cervical spine injury compared with 16 that would have been missed by the NEXUS low-risk criteria. However, in this study the NEXUS low-risk criteria had a lower sensitivity and a higher specificity compared with the original NEXUS study, possibly from differences in inclusion criteria: the Canadian group excluded patients under the age of 16 years and subjects with a GCS of less than 15, whereas these subjects were included among the original NEXUS cohort. In addition, the original NEXUS study excluded all patients in whom imaging was deemed unnecessary, while the Canadian investigators included such individuals. Thus, selection bias may account for the lower number of false negatives and true negatives reported in the Canadian study, potentially inflating both the sensitivity and specificity of the CCR. Finally, the prospective validation phase of the CCR study was performed in the same institutions in which the derivation phase was performed, raising concerns about improved performance due to familiarity with the rule [

         In a patient who requires imaging for suspected cervical spine injury, cervical spine CT without contrast is the preferred imaging examination. If possible, it should be performed with a multidetector scanner with thin-slice axial images from the skull base through C7-T1 disc space. The selection and performance of the appropriate imaging study are reviewed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121029.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Cervical spine radiographs have a significantly lower sensitivity compared with CT. Some clinicians perform plain radiographs when CT is unavailable, but a patient with negative radiographs and persistent examination findings concerning for injury (eg, focal midline cervical tenderness, neurologic findings localizing to the upper extremities) should be managed with the presumptive diagnosis of a cervical spine injury pending more advanced imaging. (See

         If a fracture of the cervical spine is identified in a blunt trauma patient, there is a significant chance that additional fractures of the spinal column are present, and we obtain imaging of the entire spinal column [

          45,46
         </a>

         A cervical ligamentous injury or spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) should be suspected in an alert patient with upper extremity paresthesias or focal neurologic findings (eg, upper extremity weakness)  (

        <p>
         The reasons for the discrepancies in the reported rates of SCIWORA remain unclear. Increased rates may reflect a true increase in incidence, an increase in reporting, or the heterogeneity of definitions used to define SCIWORA [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52,53

        </p>
        <p>
         True SCIWORA is seldom associated with permanent neurologic injury in adults [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54

         Only a small proportion of patients (typically &lt;1 percent) with an unreliable clinical examination and a negative CT demonstrate an injury requiring surgical stabilization on MRI [

         In a patient with suspected ligamentous injury or SCIWORA of the cervical spine with an adequate, normal CT study, we obtain cervical spine MRI without contrast [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55-57
         </a>
         ]. We do not obtain lateral radiographs of the cervical spine with the neck in flexion and extension in the acute setting. However, the approach to imaging patients with suspected SCIWORA remains controversial. No randomized trials have directly compared CT plus MRI with CT alone, and other approaches to imaging may be reasonable. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121029.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Similar to patients with cervical spine fracture, for patients with SCIWORA, we maintain immobilization of the spine until additional imaging is completed and consultation with spine surgery is obtained. (See

        <p>
         Much of the older literature evaluating CT involves approaches and technology that have been superseded by more accurate protocols using multidetector CT and multiplanar reconstructions. Additionally, the reference standard for establishing spinal instability is a requirement for prolonged external spinal immobilization or surgery, a determination that varies among institutions and surgeons. Thus, systematic reviews and practice guidelines have been inconsistent due in part to the limitations and heterogeneity of available studies.

         Clearance of the cervical spine refers to removal of the cervical collar and should be performed as soon as possible, and ideally within 48 hours in obtunded patients. Prolonged use of a hard cervical collar can increase the risk of occipital pressure ulcers, increase difficulty of pulmonary toilet, decrease cerebral venous return, increase intracranial pressure, and interfere with procedures (eg, central line placement) [

         If a spinal column injury is deemed unstable, hospital admission and spine surgery consultation are mandatory. If consultation is not available onsite, immediate transfer must be arranged to a center that can provide these services. Patients with unstable fractures have commonly sustained multisystem trauma, and the extent of their other injuries determines whether they require admission to an intensive care unit or other monitored setting.

         Conservative treatment of cervical fractures consists of closed reduction under fluoroscopic guidance and halo-vest immobilization. The halo is constructed of graphite or metal and is secured to the frontal and parietal areas of the skull with metal pins. The halo is the most common external device applied for treatment of unstable cervical and upper thoracic fractures and dislocations as low as T3 [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65

          70,71

          Spine immobilization
         </strong>
         – Suspect a cervical spinal column injury in any trauma victim, especially in the setting of motor vehicle collisions, assaults, falls, and sports-related injuries. Older adults are at higher risk and can sustain such injury from a simple fall from standing. Spinal immobilization, including rigid cervical collar, sometimes a backboard (or stretcher), and lateral head supports for transport should be initiated at the scene and maintained until an unstable spinal injury is excluded. Techniques for safe helmet removal are described above. (See
         <a class="local">

          Trauma and airway management
         </strong>
         – The priorities of trauma management do not change in the setting of potential spinal column injury. In-line stabilization should be maintained during intubation; however, the preeminent concerns remain airway protection and oxygenation. Anticipate airway management problems in patients with cervical spinal column injury. Unstable lesions above C3 to C5 may cause immediate respiratory paralysis; lower cervical lesions may cause delayed respiratory distress. (See

          Secondary survey
         </strong>
         – The secondary survey should include palpation of the entire spine and paraspinal musculature for areas of tenderness or deformity; a step-off in the spine may indicate vertebral subluxation or fracture. Widening of an interspinous space indicates a tear in the posterior ligament complex and a potentially unstable spinal injury. A focused but systematic neurologic evaluation should be performed in all patients with a possible spine injury  (
