         Head and neck sarcomas are rare tumors, and this makes rigorous study of clinical behavior difficult. As a result, treatment algorithms are drawn from retrospective case series and principles are derived from treatment of sarcomas at other sites, rather than from large clinical trials. Their study is also made more difficult by the diversity of histologic subtypes and the variable clinical behavior. Furthermore, the confining anatomy and proximity to vital structures makes even adherence to traditional margin-driven therapy challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
         The demographics of head and neck sarcomas, the clinical behavior of the common subtypes, and general treatment principles will be reviewed here. An overview of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue and bone sarcomas, and a discussion of treatment for sarcomas arising at other sites are discussed elsewhere.

         Sarcomas of the head and neck account for about 2 percent of all head and neck malignancies and 4 to 10 percent of all sarcomas in adults [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately 1000 cases of head and neck sarcoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and comprise about 10 main histologic subtypes and many minor subtypes. The main histologic subtypes are rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in children; osteosarcoma (and chondrosarcoma); vascular sarcomas (especially angiosarcoma and Kaposi sarcoma), and also, the common adult soft tissue sarcomas (undifferentiated/unclassified sarcomas; liposarcoma; leiomyosarcoma [LMS]; synovial sarcoma; and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors [MPNST]). In series in which desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) are included, these tumors account for a large proportion of cases. Other less commonly occurring sarcomas include solitary fibrous tumor, Ewing sarcoma, and alveolar soft part sarcoma. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'Histopathology'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical and histologic makeup of any of the large series of head and neck sarcomas is highly dependent upon the nature of the reporting institution or the clinical practice of the reporting clinician [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-14
         </a>
         ]. General oncologic surgeons are likely to see a different array of patients compared to otolaryngologic surgeons, pediatric surgeons, or plastic surgeons. Many series exclude bone sarcomas or benign or low malignant potential tumors (eg, desmoid tumors and DFSP). Some series include pediatric sarcomas and thus have a very large proportion of RMS; others exclude these subtypes. Many of the largest series use older pathologic classification schemes in which so-called "fibrosarcomas" or "malignant fibrous histiocytomas" have not been re-categorized appropriately as either a more specific diagnosis such as leiomyosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, or undifferentiated/unclassified sarcoma. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'Histopathology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite these variations and limitations in reporting, some generalizations can be made about the demographics of head and neck sarcomas and the histologic and anatomic makeup of these tumors:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Approximately 30 percent of head and neck sarcomas occur in children, with the majority of these being RMS [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The median age at diagnosis for all head and neck sarcomas is 50 to 54 years, when children are included, and 55 to 59 years when they are not [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Different subtypes affect different age groups. As examples, RMS occurs predominantly in children (median age of about five to nine years [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]) while angiosarcomas most often arise in the older adult population [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].

         Most series report a slight male predominance [

         As with all patients with a suspected head and neck neoplasm, a complete examination of the head and neck, with particular attention to the cranial nerves, is essential. For most patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the superior neuroimaging study. In many cases, computed tomography (CT) scanning complements MRI, and both are helpful in surgical planning, particularly for bone sarcomas. Models can now be made preoperatively from CT scans for expected bone defects, allowing reconstructive planning and preparation to begin preoperatively, thus increasing the efficiency of the intraoperative repair. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7739.html" rel="external">
          "Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management", section on 'Preoperative evaluation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pretreatment evaluation should also include a directed metastatic workup, generally with a CT of the chest. A more extensive diagnostic workup (eg, CT of the brain, radionuclide bone scan, positron emission tomography [PET] scan) should generally be based upon symptoms and/or clinical suspicion [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Further details on the pretreatment evaluation of these patients, including those with parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'Radiographic studies'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The role of PET scanning and integrated PET/CT imaging in the staging workup for soft tissue sarcomas (including RMS) and bone sarcomas, including those arising in the head and neck, is not clearly defined. There is no consensus on the appropriate use of this imaging modality. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7728.html" rel="external">
          "Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and staging", section on 'Metastatic workup'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggest a PET and/or bone scan in the diagnostic workup of a suspected osteosarcoma but not soft tissue sarcoma [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Imaging guidelines from the Children's Oncology Group Bone Tumor Committee recommend radionuclide bone scan and/or PET scan for whole body staging for all patients with osteosarcoma [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Regardless of the type of scan that is chosen, the same imaging modality should be used throughout treatment and during posttreatment surveillance. Ideally, a PET scan or bone scan should be performed prior to biopsy to avoid a biopsy-related false positive result. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7722.html" rel="external">
          "Osteosarcoma: Epidemiology, pathology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis", section on 'Postdiagnostic evaluation'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Performing a biopsy to obtain representative tissue for histologic evaluation is an important component of the initial evaluation. However, the biopsy method can affect subsequent treatment and thus should be carefully planned in conjunction with the surgeon who will perform the definitive surgery [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

         A modified version of the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for head and neck squamous cell cancers is used in the eighth edition of the joint American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging of head and neck sarcomas. (See

         In the eighth edition of the joint AJCC/UICC TNM staging system, the T staging for head and neck soft tissue sarcomas differs from that of sarcomas arising at other body sites  (

         This staging system is used for all soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck, with the exception of angiosarcomas, embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and Kaposi sarcoma (which do not have an AJCC staging system). (See

         There is a TNM staging system for bone sarcomas in the AJCC/UICC cancer staging manual; however, it has not been widely adopted in the past. The eighth edition AJCC staging system classifies bone sarcomas arising in the skull and facial bones the same way as it classifies tumors arising in the appendicular skeleton and trunk, and there is a set of prognostic stage groups  (

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         In general, the natural history of head and neck sarcomas parallels that of their non-head and neck counterparts, but with a higher rate of local recurrence after treatment. Whether overall survival rates are lower with head and neck primaries is unclear; the available data are conflicting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Comparative outcomes for head and neck primary sarcomas can be illustrated by a single institution series comparing outcomes among 102 patients with head and neck sarcoma and 1044 patients with extremity or superficial trunk lesions, all of whom were treated between 1960 and 1999 with surgery and radiation therapy (RT) [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. At five years, local control rates were inferior for patients with head and neck primaries (74 versus 85 percent) as was disease-specific survival (64 versus 76 percent). On the other hand, a separate study that used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data on over 12,000 patients treated between 1973 and 2010 found a five-year cause-specific survival of 66 percent in adults and 73 percent in children with a broad variety of histologic subtypes, and these numbers appear comparable to those of non-head and neck sarcomas [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not clear that a primary site in the head and neck constitutes an independent risk factor for a worse prognosis per se. Rather, the complex functional anatomy of the head and neck makes it much harder to perform a resection with wide, negative margins. The failure to obtain negative margins is associated with a very poor prognosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Surgical margins'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         As with soft tissue sarcomas in the extremities, lymph node involvement is uncommon, occurring in only about 10 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The most common histologic head and neck subtypes associated with nodal metastases are rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and angiosarcoma. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'Regional nodes'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The majority of patients who die of soft tissue sarcomas in non-head and neck sites die of metastatic disease. In comparison, those with head and neck sarcomas frequently have local relapse and succumb to their tumor without distant metastatic disease. As an example, in a report of 103 patients with sarcoma of the head and neck treated from 1944 to 1988, locally recurrent disease was the sole cause of death in 65 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The predominance of local recurrence occurs despite a relatively small average size (4 cm) compared with soft tissue sarcomas in other sites [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,7
         </a>
         ]. A major contributor is the difficulty in achieving clear surgical margins. (See

          'Surgical margins'

         Important prognostic factors are sex, tumor grade and size, status of the surgical margins, histologic subtype, and nodal status [

          6,7,15,28,29

In one study of 122 sarcomas of the head or neck, patients with high-grade lesions had significantly worse survival compared with those with low-grade lesions (hazard ratio [HR] for death 5.52, 95% CI 1.51-20.21), and locoregional recurrence rates were much higher for lesions &gt;10 cm in diameter compared with tumors ≤5 cm (HR 6.13, 95%CI 1.84-20.5) [

         Negative margins are difficult to achieve in the region of the head and neck because these sarcomas tend to grow in tight anatomic confines and in close proximity to vital neurovascular, bony, or other structures. (See
         <a class="local">

         <a href="#rid19">

         The influence of histologic subtype on prognosis was addressed in a report from the Head and Neck Sarcoma registry of the Society of Head and Neck Surgeons, which reported the results of treatment in 214 patients with sarcoma of the head or neck (194 adults and 20 children) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Overall disease-free survival was 56 percent at five years. Major determinants of survival were adequacy of resection margins and tumor type (tumor grade was not available).
        </p>
        <p>
         The biology of specific sarcoma histologies from other anatomic sites is recapitulated in the survival outcomes of patients with head and neck sarcomas with those similar histologies. For example, patients with sarcomas of the head and neck that do not metastasize (eg, chondrosarcoma or dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans [DFSP]) often have good outcomes, with survival approaching 100 percent. By contrast, patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) or fibrosarcoma (which usually comprise what is often termed undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma) of the head and neck had survival rates of 60 to 70 percent. Patients with diagnoses known to frequently metastasize when arising at other sites also fared poorly when the primary sites were head and neck; osteosarcoma and angiosarcoma had the worst survival, less than 50 percent at five years.
        </p>
        <p>
         RMS and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) are particularly aggressive histologic subtypes [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9,10,31
         </a>
         ]. Prior to modern chemotherapy, RMS was rarely cured. However, using modern combined modality treatment approaches, RMS is curable in over 75 percent of children. Those pediatric patients with unresected parameningeal tumors and high-risk features such as intracranial extension can experience a four-year failure-free survival of 68 percent, yet patients with unresected orbital locations have a 97 percent overall survival at three years using a reduced chemotherapy regimen [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32,33

         Historically, sarcomas arising in tissues that have been previously irradiated have had a poorer prognosis when compared with de novo sarcomas [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,38,39

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There are several potential reasons for these poor outcomes. Examples include delay in diagnosis; limitations on resectability due to prior surgery, radiation and fibrosis, and/or the size and location of the lesion (with an inability to achieve wide surgical margins); the high-grade nature of most radiation-associated sarcomas; inability to give full-dose RT to a site that has been previously irradiated; use of prior chemotherapy for the first cancer that may limit choices for subsequent therapy; and biologic differences that may reflect the different pathogenesis compared with spontaneously arising sarcomas, some of which are characterized by specific mutations. (See

        <p>
         Although the majority of prior studies suggest postirradiation sarcomas have a poorer prognosis, at least one small study specific to head and neck sarcoma (mostly post-nasopharyngeal cancer irradiation) supports the view that patients who can be treated with curative intent may have outcomes that are similar to those for de novo head and neck sarcomas, emphasizing the curative intent approach when possible [

         Because of their proximity to vital structures and the anatomic constraints within the head and neck region, surgical removal of head and neck sarcomas often cannot achieve the ideal "wide" resection margins that are preferred in other anatomic sites such as the extremities. Other important considerations include the functional deficits related to breathing, swallowing, and speaking, as well as the aesthetic outcomes that may follow head and neck resections. The anatomic boundaries forming the margin are considered a more important indicator of the risk for local recurrence than is the physical distance from the tumor to the resection margin [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Thus, the generally accepted recommendation for surgical margins of head and neck sarcomas is to obtain a complete tumor resection with as wide a margin as is feasible, with as little morbidity as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         The incidence of cervical lymph node metastases is sufficiently low in head and neck sarcomas that elective neck dissections are generally not indicated. However, a limited regional node dissection should be completed if vascular access is needed for free flap reconstruction. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'Regional nodes'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, reconstruction with microvascular free flaps has greatly decreased the cosmetic deformity and improved functional results following resection of head and neck sarcomas. Large bone and soft tissue deficits that were once devastating can now be reconstructed with excellent results. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3396.html" rel="external">
          "Mandibular and palatal reconstruction in patients with head and neck cancer"

         The benefits of a multidisciplinary approach to surgical and postsurgical treatment cannot be overemphasized. Input from a head and neck oncologic surgeon, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, reconstructive surgeon, speech pathologist, and dietician are essential for an optimal surgical result. (See

          —
         </span>
         When adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is used for head and neck sarcomas, it is usually administered postoperatively and not prior to an operation, as is commonly done in extremity sarcomas. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7734.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and superficial trunk", section on 'Choosing between preoperative and postoperative RT'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit of adjuvant RT for most histologic subtypes is controversial. There are no randomized trials proving benefit for RT in head and neck sarcomas, and results from retrospective reports are mixed. However, extrapolation of experience in extremity sarcomas strongly argues in favor of adjuvant RT for most soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck that are high grade (especially tumors that are large and high grade) or low grade with positive and/or close (often defined as &lt;1 mm) margins. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7734.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and superficial trunk", section on 'Radiation therapy'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In many studies, the addition of adjuvant RT to surgery for head and neck sarcomas does not provide a survival benefit compared with surgery alone. As an example, in a population-based analysis of 11,481 adult and 1244 pediatric head and neck sarcomas reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 1973 and 2010, the addition of RT resulted in an 80 percent reduction in survival compared with patients who did not receive adjuvant RT [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. However, this outcome is at least partly the result of negative selection bias (ie, that use of RT is simply a marker for clinically appreciated, higher risk, poorer prognosis disease). To address this issue, the authors of the SEER analysis performed a propensity score-matched analysis and did not confirm an inferior cause-specific mortality in those who received adjuvant RT in conjunction with surgery. A lack of association of adjuvant RT with inferior cause-specific survival was also seen in a separate single institution series from the University of Washington [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, retrospective series suggest a benefit for adding adjuvant RT to surgery in patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck, particularly if they are large and high-grade, or low-grade with positive and/or close margins [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

As an example, in an observational analysis from the National Cancer Database of 1142 patients with head and neck sarcoma with positive surgical margins, the addition of adjuvant RT was associated with improved overall survival (57 versus 48 percent). However, this study also noted an underutilization of adjuvant RT in patients who had positive margins [

         Osteosarcomas are primary malignant tumors of bone that are characterized by the production of osteoid or immature bone by the malignant cells. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary tumor of bone and about 10 percent of cases arise in the head and neck [

         Osteosarcomas of the head and neck most commonly arise in the upper and lower jaws. The typical patient presents with a mass or swelling in the cheek or jaw, sometimes with pain, and occasionally with dental complaints [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44,46-49
         </a>
         ]. In most series, the majority of tumors are about evenly split between the mandible and the maxilla; about 20 percent develop in the extragnathic bones (eg, skull, orbit) [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Head and neck osteosarcomas are typically smaller at presentation than are non-head and neck osteosarcomas, and they tend to be of a histologic lower grade than osteosarcomas at other sites (although most are high-grade) [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44,51,52

         Local recurrence predominates as a pattern of failure for head and neck osteosarcomas; distant metastases are less common. As an example, in a meta-analysis that included 163 patients with head and neck osteosarcoma from nonrandomized studies, 56 percent recurred; of these, 50 percent recurred locally, 3 percent regionally, and only 20 percent had a component of distant failure [

         Initial treatment typically consists of en bloc excision of the tumor with a wide margin of normal tissue, if feasible. For patients who undergo initial resection with positive surgical margins, we prefer re-excision, if possible. (See
         <a class="local">

         For those with positive margins after re-excision or if re-excision is not feasible, we suggest postoperative (adjuvant) radiation therapy (RT). Some experts alternatively offer chemoradiation, typically with

However, since there are limited prospective data to support the use of chemoradiation in head and neck sarcomas, and the optimal chemosensitizer is not established, the decision to use adjuvant RT alone or concurrently with chemotherapy should be made in a multidisciplinary setting.

         For patients with negative resection margins, we suggest not pursuing adjuvant RT. However, the decision to pursue RT for patients with margin-negative resections and other high-risk features such as very large tumor size, extensive soft tissue infiltration or lymphovascular invasion must be individualized and made on a case-by-case basis.

         En bloc excision with a margin of normal tissue is the goal of surgical treatment; however, soft tissue margins may be difficult to obtain because of the proximity of critical structures. The soft tissue resection margin can be evaluated intraoperatively by frozen section analysis until either a negative margin is obtained or further resection is not feasible. However, the bony margins cannot be microscopically evaluated in this way, and only a gross estimate of the resection margins can be performed intraoperatively. If the permanent sections show a positive bone margin, this should be addressed surgically, if possible, with reresection of the margin soon after the initial procedure.

         As with other head and neck sarcomas, reconstruction is often best accomplished with microvascular free flap reconstruction. Bony defects can be reconstructed with osteocutaneous free flaps. Dental rehabilitation may be possible after healing is complete. Reconstruction of midface and skull base tumors may require either locoregional flaps for smaller defects or microvascular free flaps for larger defects. Maxillofacial prosthetics may also be necessary. (See

However, since there are limited prospective data to support the use of chemoradiation in head and neck sarcomas, and the optimal chemotherapy regimen to use for radiosensitization is not established, this decision to use adjuvant RT alone or concurrently with chemotherapy should be made in a multidisciplinary setting. If both adjuvant chemotherapy and RT are being used, we would generally delay RT until the end of adjuvant chemotherapy. (See

         Conventional osteosarcoma is relatively resistant to RT, although the small cell variant may be more radiosensitive. Primary RT is usually inadequate to achieve local control, particularly for bulky tumors [

         For patients treated with effective surgery and chemotherapy, adjuvant RT does not improve survival and increases the risk for secondary tumors. However, local failure is a major cause of morbidity and death in head and neck osteosarcoma, and RT can help provide local control for patients in whom surgical resection with widely negative margins is not possible [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50,55,60,67

         <a href="#rid52">
          52

         Modern treatment regimens for osteosarcomas at non-head and neck sites generally include systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy to eradicate occult micrometastatic disease. While chemotherapy (given postoperatively [adjuvant] or preoperatively [neoadjuvant]) improves the prognosis of extremity osteosarcoma dramatically, its benefit in osteosarcoma of the head and neck is controversial. (See

         Prospective data to support benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in head and neck osteosarcomas are lacking. In uncontrolled case series, the use of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been associated with improved survival in patients with head and neck osteosarcomas in some [

          46,73
         </a>
         ]. Part of the explanation for these disparate results may have been related to incomplete information on the influence of surgical margin status. Nevertheless, in many series, the majority of patients with high-grade osteosarcomas of the head and neck have received modern combination chemotherapy, and the improved outcomes over time have been largely attributed to the use of combined modality therapy. Whether it is optimal to deliver in the preoperative or postoperative setting is unclear. (see

         Whether patients with low-grade osteosarcomas benefit from chemotherapy is unclear. Most low-grade jaw osteosarcomas may be adequately treated with surgery alone, as long as clear margins can be achieved [

         Chondrosarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant bone tumors that share in common the production of chondroid (cartilaginous) matrix. Chondrosarcomas of the head and neck are rarer than osteosarcomas. The head and neck region is reported as the site of origin in 1 to 12 percent of chondrosarcomas [
         <a href="#rid74">

         Chondrosarcomas present more commonly in the extragnathic bones than in the mandible or maxilla, in contrast with osteosarcomas. In a National Cancer Database series of 400 chondrosarcomas of the head and neck diagnosed between 1985 and 1995, 60 percent arose in bone, but only 7 percent of these were in the mandible [

         Although chondrosarcomas less frequently develop in cartilage, it is the most common sarcoma that develops in the laryngeal cartilage; this site accounted for 19 percent of cases in one SEER series of 682 chondrosarcomas arising in the head and neck [
         <a href="#rid79">

         The majority of chondrosarcomas are low grade, and long-term survival or cure is achieved with wide local excision in most patients. Laryngeal chondrosarcomas may be amenable to complete excision with preserved laryngeal function through a voice-sparing partial laryngectomy. For the rare patient with a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma or possibly mesenchymal chondrosarcoma of the head and neck who is medically fit, the poor prognosis seen with surgery alone provides an argument to discuss the potential benefits of neoadjuvant or adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. However, the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in chondrosarcoma is overall limited given the general lack of sensitivity to chemotherapy seen with this histology.

          Surgery
         </strong>
         – Treatment usually consists of wide local excision. The specific anatomic location of chondrosarcomas greatly affects resectability. For example, skull base chondrosarcomas are typically removed en bloc using advanced neurosurgical approaches. Such radical procedures may require sacrifice of multiple cranial nerves and necessitate carotid artery occlusion, with its attendant risk of death, stroke, and other significant morbidities. Management of skull base chondrosarcomas is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

          Chemotherapy
         </strong>
         – Experience with adjuvant (or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy in patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma suggests the potential for benefit. As an example, one retrospective study of 113 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcomas included a subset of 96 patients with localized disease. Among this subset, chemotherapy was associated with a 57 percent improvement in survival and 52 percent improvement in local control [
         <a href="#rid86">
          86
         </a>
         ]. However, these findings have not been prospectively confirmed, since there are no randomized studies evaluating effective adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with head and neck chondrosarcomas. Nevertheless, the poor prognosis seen with surgery alone provides an argument to discuss the risks and potential benefits of adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy with patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma who have not received neoadjuvant therapy as long as they are medically fit and able to tolerate the therapy.

         The sites of head and neck RMS can be divided into three main groups: orbit (25 percent), parameningeal area (paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, middle ear/mastoid, and infratemporal fossa; 50 percent), and nonorbital nonparameningeal sites (scalp, parotid gland, oral cavity, pharynx, thyroid and parathyroid glands, and neck; 25 percent).

         The two major histologic subtypes of RMS are embryonal and alveolar, although classification and risk stratification rely on the presence or absence or the characteristic PAX/FOXO1 fusion gene  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404" href="/z/d/graphic/71404.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). When head and neck RMS arises in the orbit, it is almost always of the embryonal type. A unique form of embryonal RMS, the botryoid variant (sarcoma botryoides), typically arises within the wall of the bladder or vagina, almost exclusively in infants. However, it can arise within the nasopharynx in older children. (See

         The initial radiologic evaluation should include computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the primary site and surrounding structures [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90
         </a>
         ]. MRI is increasingly considered the imaging method of choice for certain primary locations, such as the head and neck, because of its multiplanar capacity, ability to attenuate bone artifact, and superior soft tissue contrast. While CT scan may best identify lung metastases, MRI or integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans efficiently evaluate bone, soft tissue, and parenchymal organs. Distant brain metastases are uncommon. In general, brain imaging is reserved for patients with clinical suspicion; however, imaging of the brain is often included as part of the imaging of the primary site, especially in parameningeal tumors. Since parameningeal tumors may show earlier spread to the skull base and the intracranial compartment, lumbar puncture should be performed. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7728.html" rel="external">
          "Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and staging", section on 'Lumbar puncture'

        <p>
         Two different staging systems are used in conjunction by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG)/Children's Oncology Group (COG) for the purpose of estimating prognosis and assigning risk-directed treatment. The IRSG Clinical Group (CG) system recognizes four disease categories (Group I through IV) that are based upon the degree of tumor spread at diagnosis and the amount of disease remaining after initial surgery  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59875" href="/z/d/graphic/59875.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the CG system is clinically useful for assigning treatment, it does not take into account other important prognostic factors, such as tumor size and primary site, disease extent, histology, and patient age. A site-based tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system was incorporated for assessing prognosis and assigning therapy in conjunction with the traditional surgicopathologic clinical grouping system  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62717" href="/z/d/graphic/62717.html" rel="external">
          table 6
         </a>
         ). Although there are clear prognostic differences based upon the site of origin, within the head and neck, prognosis is more specifically dependent upon location than TNM stage and upon other factors such as age and histologic type.
        </p>
        <p>
         Both the CG and TNM stage as well as several other clinicopathologic variables are included in a prognostic stratification system that is used to select treatment based upon the estimated prognosis (risk-adapted therapy  (

         Prior to 1970, the outlook for children with RMS was dismal, with cure rates of 20 percent from surgery, with or without RT. Outcomes have markedly improved with the addition of systemic chemotherapy, including those for individuals with head and neck primary sites. Reported five-year survival rates with contemporary therapy are 50 to 75 percent for patients with nonmetastatic head and neck parameningeal disease, and 70 to 80 percent for patients with nonmetastatic, nonparameningeal head and neck disease sites [

         The poorer outcomes in adults may reflect, in part, the inadequacy of primary treatment. However, adults are also more likely to present with advanced disease.

         The treatment of RMS is complex, and typically involves surgery, RT, and multi-agent chemotherapy. A consultation with a center with expertise in multimodality therapy for this rare diagnosis is appropriate; in many situations, children will be offered treatment on a clinical trial, since the standards of care for this diagnosis continue to evolve.
        </p>
        <p>
         For most patients with localized disease, complete excision is offered as long as functional and/or cosmetic results are acceptable. Routine cervical lymph node dissection is not routinely recommended as part of the staging workup in patients with head and neck RMS, given the low incidence of locoregional lymph node involvement. However, for some anatomic locations, such as parameningeal sites, chemotherapy and radiation are the standard of care rather than surgical resection. When surgical excision is not possible, or when surgery is incomplete, RT is used for local control. Risk-adapted therapy guidelines assist in treatment decisions for adjuvant RT and adjuvant chemotherapy, including selection of the appropriate chemotherapy regimen. The results of five large IRSG treatment studies (IRS I-V), enrolling the majority of American children with RMS, have established many of the general principles that guide modern management of RMS. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Complete excision is offered for localized disease as long as functional and/or cosmetic results are acceptable. However, primary head and neck tumors are rarely amenable to wide local excision because of proximity to vital structures and cosmetic concerns. The availability of highly skilled otolaryngologic and craniofacial reconstructive teams may permit resection of some tumors that would otherwise be considered unresectable. (See

         Because of the generally low incidence of locoregional lymph node involvement, routine cervical lymph node dissection is not routinely recommended as part of the staging work up in patients with head and neck RMS, including those in parameningeal sites. Confirmation with lymph node sampling is recommended only when clinical and/or imaging studies suggest lymph node involvement. (See

         For patients with resectable disease, complete surgical resection with wide margins is preferred for local and locoregional disease, when technically feasible. For almost all patients who undergo resection, we suggest preoperative or postoperative RT due to the propensity of these tumors for insidious local infiltration, which can lead to locoregional and/or distant metastases. The role of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resectable disease is unclear, and we do not offer it routinely.

         – Complete surgical resection with wide margins is preferred for local and locoregional disease. Although the risk of lymph node spread is higher with angiosarcomas than with other head and neck sarcomas, the overall risk remains lower than what is generally considered an indication for elective lymph node dissection. As a result, most surgeons reserve neck treatment for gross nodal disease only.

         Reconstruction is performed immediately following resection; even sizable deficits can be reconstructed using contemporary techniques. Microvascular free flaps can cover large surface defects with minimal donor site morbidity. Smaller defects can be reconstructed using skin grafts, or local or regional flaps. Some surgeons perform small mapping biopsies along the proposed margins preoperatively so that disease with subclinical microscopic spread can be identified and appropriate ablative and reconstructive planning undertaken prior to definitive resection.

Treatment may be initiated at the onset of symptomatic and/or progressive disease, if there is imminent risk to adjacent structures or if the tumor creates cosmetic concerns. Initial treatment may include surgery or systemic therapy alone.

         Treatment for resectable desmoid tumors of the head and neck involves complete excision with pathologically negative margins, when possible. Radiation (RT) is an option in recurrent, marginally resectable, or unresectable tumors; however, RT should be avoided in young patients due to the risk of late toxicities including radiation-associated cancers. Cryotherapy is used in some centers as an alternative to surgery for accessible lesions, either as initial or salvage therapy [

As at other sites, Mohs micrographic surgery of DFSPs arising in the head and neck has been shown to provide adequate local control while reducing local recurrence rates compared with WLE (1.11 versus 6.32 percent in one systematic review) [

The majority of DFSPs has a translocation involving chromosomes 17 and 22, which places platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGFB) under the control of the COL1A1 promoter, leading to constitutive activation of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase. Orally active small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib inhibit the PDGFR.

         For other adult-type soft tissue sarcomas that do not fit into any of these categories, treatment principles for these tumors should follow those used for tumors outside of the head and neck region. Extirpative surgery with wide margins is preferred, if feasible. We recommend adjuvant RT (either preoperative or postoperative) for most high-grade tumors and any malignant tumor (even low-grade) treated with less than wide margin excisional surgery. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy following optimal local therapy remains uncertain. We do not routinely pursue this approach for soft tissue sarcomas arising in the head and neck; however, it may be an option for patients with a good performance status who are at high risk of a distant or possibly local recurrence.

         Approximately 40 percent of all head and neck sarcomas do not fit into any of the above histologic categories. These include a variety of histologies (undifferentiated/unclassified sarcoma [previously called malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH)], malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors [MPNST], synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma [LMS], liposarcoma, etc) and they can arise from any site in the head and neck. In an analysis of 11,481 adult head and neck sarcomas using the SEER database, undifferentiated/unclassified sarcomas represented 38 percent of all head and neck sarcomas [

          6,136

         RT should be used to improve local control for most high-grade sarcomas and all with positive or close margins. The addition of RT does not provide significant improvement in disease-specific mortality as demonstrated in a SEER analysis of 11,481 adult sarcomas, but selection bias may account for the negative association [
         <a href="#rid15">

         The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for head and neck sarcomas is unknown. For high-grade, large extremity sarcomas, the benefit of chemotherapy is controversial, and data from individual trials and meta-analyses suggest that a survival benefit, if it exists, is small. However, a meta-analysis suggests improved local control with adjuvant chemotherapy [

          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Patients generally present with a palpable mass (especially in the neck), skin changes (especially on the scalp or face), or subsite-specific symptoms (eg, hoarseness with laryngeal primaries, dysphagia with oropharyngeal tumors, epistaxis, nasal obstruction, or cranial nerve deficits with skull base tumors).

          Diagnosis and staging
         </strong>
         – For most patients suspected of having a head or neck sarcoma, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the superior neuroimaging study, although in many cases, computed tomography (CT) scanning complements MRI, and both are helpful in surgical planning. Pretreatment evaluation should also include a directed metastatic workup. The diagnostic biopsy method should be carefully planned in conjunction with the surgeon who will perform the definitive surgery. (See

          Natural history and prognostic factors
         </strong>
         – In general, the natural history of these tumors parallels that of their non-head and neck counterparts, but with a higher rate of local recurrence after treatment. Whether overall survival rates are lower with head and neck primaries is unclear; the available data are conflicting. The major prognostic factors are histologic grade, tumor size, status of the surgical margins, histologic subtype, and the presence of nodal metastases. (See

         <strong>
          Surgical principles
         </strong>
         – The generally accepted recommendation for surgical margins of head and neck sarcomas is to obtain a complete tumor resection with as wide a cuff of normal tissue as is feasible, with as little morbidity as possible. Because of their proximity to vital structures and the relatively small space of the head and neck region, surgical removal of head and neck sarcomas often cannot achieve the ideal "wide" resection margins that are preferred in other anatomic sites, and there are important considerations for morbidity related to breathing, swallowing, and speaking, and the significant cosmetic deformity that may follow neck and facial resections. The generally accepted recommendation for surgical margins of head and neck sarcomas is to obtain a complete tumor resection with as wide a cuff of normal tissue as is feasible, with as little morbidity as possible.

          Adjuvant therapy
         </strong>
         – The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) for most histologic subtypes is controversial. There are no randomized trials proving benefit for head and neck sarcomas. Extrapolation of experience in extremity sarcomas strongly argues in favor of adjuvant RT for most soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck that are high grade (especially tumors are that are large and high grade), or low grade with positive and/or close margins.

However, since there are limited prospective data to support the use of chemoradiation in head and neck sarcomas, and the optimal chemosensitizer is not established, the decision to use adjuvant RT alone or concurrently with chemotherapy should be made in a multidisciplinary setting.

          Chondrosarcoma
         </strong>
         – Chondrosarcomas are more common in the extragnathic bones than in the mandible or maxilla, but a significant number develop from laryngeal cartilage. The majority are low grade, and long-term survival or cure is achieved with wide local excision in most patients. Laryngeal chondrosarcomas may be amenable to complete excision with preserved laryngeal function through a voice-sparing partial laryngectomy. (See

         For the rare patient with a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma or mesenchymal chondrosarcoma of the head and neck who is medically fit, the poor prognosis seen with surgery alone provides a rationale to offer neoadjuvant or adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. (See

          Rhabdomyosarcoma
         </strong>
         – RMS is predominantly a disease of children; 35 to 40 percent of primary sites are in the head and neck. The clinical presentation is dependent upon tumor location and may include a facial or neck mass, proptosis, nasal discharge, headache, vomiting, change in hearing, vision, speech, swallowing, or respiratory symptoms.

         </span>
         The treatment of RMS is complex, and typically involves surgery, RT, and multi-agent chemotherapy. Multidisciplinary management is the standard of care. If appropriate, children should be offered treatment on a clinical trial. (See

         For most patients with localized disease, complete excision with wide margins is offered as long as functional and/or cosmetic results are acceptable; however, for some anatomic locations, such as parameningeal sites, chemotherapy and RT are the standard of care rather than surgical resection. When surgical excision is not possible, or when surgery is incomplete, RT is often used for local control. Risk-adapted therapy guidelines assist in treatment decisions for adjuvant RT and adjuvant chemotherapy, including selection of the appropriate chemotherapy regimen.

          Desmoid tumors
         </strong>
         – For patients with stable, asymptomatic desmoid tumors, an initial period of close observation is an acceptable strategy. Treatment may be initiated at the onset of symptomatic and/or progressive disease, if there is imminent risk to adjacent structures or if the tumor creates cosmetic concerns. Initial treatment may include surgery or systemic therapy alone.

         For those with resectable desmoid tumors, options for treatment include complete excision when possible, and/or radiation for recurrent, marginally resectable, or unresectable tumors.
