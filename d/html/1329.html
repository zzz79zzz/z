Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy have not been shown to reduce the risk of embolism in IE.

However, patients with IE frequently have other/separate indications for anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and such therapy is appropriate if the potential benefit of antithrombotic therapy outweighs the potential risk. Data to guide the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapies in the setting of IE are limited. Thus, recommendations are based largely on observational data and expert opinion. Since there are competing risks of thromboembolism and bleeding in every patient with IE, we individualize therapy based on a multidisciplinary approach to patient and disease factors. When weighing the potential risks and benefits of antithrombotic therapy in patients with IE, the magnitude of risk as well as the duration of the period of risk should be considered.</p><p>The management approach described here is largely consistent with the 2015 American Heart Association (AHA) IE scientific statement, the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) IE guidelines, and the 2020 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/AHA valve guidelines, (as well as the 2021 ESC valve guidelines, which refer to the 2015 ESC IE guidelines) [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H453760009"><span class="h2">Clinical settings</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H453759037"><span class="h3">Patients without other indications for antithrombotic therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with IE without a separate indication for anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, initiation of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy is not indicated [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. The available data do not demonstrate a convincing benefit for antithrombotic therapy in preventing embolic complications in patients with IE and suggest possible increased risk of bleeding complications.

The risk of thromboembolism and valve thrombosis in patients with prosthetic valves is summarized here and discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8121.html" rel="external">"Mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8171.html" rel="external">"Antithrombotic therapy for mechanical heart valves"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with prosthetic valves are at risk for thromboembolism as well as for valve obstruction from valve thrombosis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thromboembolism</strong> – The risk of this complication is highest during the first 30 to 90 days after valve implantation in patients with bioprosthetic or mechanical valves. After that early period, the risk is higher in patients with mechanical valves if not treated with anticoagulation (vitamin K antagonist [VKA] or heparin). In patients with mechanical aortic valves who are treated with VKA therapy (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>), the long-term frequency of systemic embolization, predominantly cerebrovascular events, is approximately 0.7 to 1.0 percent per year (which is similar to the risk of embolization in patients with bioprosthetic valves without anticoagulant therapy). The risk of systemic embolization is approximately twice as high with a mitral valve. By comparison, the risk of embolization is 2.2 percent per year with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and 4.0 percent per year with no anticoagulation in patients with mechanical valves (data not specific for valve position). The risk of thromboembolism during the first 10 to 30 days after valve replacement is approximately 15 to 25 times higher than after the first 90 days.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prosthetic valve thrombosis</strong> may be asymptomatic but can progress to acute or chronic valvular obstruction with mortality rates greater than 35 percent in those who become critically ill with acute obstruction. The reported annual incidence of prosthetic valve thrombosis ranges from 0.03 to 5.7 percent with higher rates observed in patients with mechanical valves treated with subtherapeutic anticoagulation. The risk of valve obstruction from thrombosis is also higher in the presence of a mitral valve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8121.html" rel="external">"Mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with acute valve thrombosis and/or large vegetations may require emergency surgical valve replacement or surgical removal of the thrombus though some patients (eg, those who are more stable and have smaller thrombi) may be treated by thrombolysis or anticoagulation. Management is discussed in detail separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111633.html" rel="external">"Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, and obstruction: Management"</a>). However, thrombolysis is contraindicated in patients with IE who have a stroke given the risk of hemorrhagic transformation or worsening intracerebral hemorrhage. (See <a class="local">'Ischemic stroke'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>We recommend anticoagulation in patients with mechanical valves based upon moderate quality evidence supporting long-term anticoagulation (with VKA) to reduce thromboembolism and valve thrombosis. Limited evidence is available comparing various regimens for bridging with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> or low molecular weight heparin until patients are stable on vitamin K anticoagulant therapy. In the early treatment of patients presenting with IE, VKA is replaced with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin as discussed below.

Since patients presenting with acute IE may be at increased risk for major bleeding, we generally avoid aspirin use and continue anticoagulant therapy alone in the setting of acute IE in the absence of other indications for antiplatelet therapy.</p><p>The risk of thromboembolism is increased early after bioprosthetic as well as mechanical valve replacement, though there is limited evidence on the efficacy of anticoagulant therapy early after bioprosthetic valve replacement. We suggest antithrombotic therapy early after bioprosthetic valve replacement, though recommendations vary among experts.

Although prophylactic anticoagulation is often warranted in this population, the risk of VTE must be balanced against the risk of bleeding complications, including intracerebral hemorrhage, particularly in those who already have ischemic stroke and are thus at risk for hemorrhagic transformation. Given this risk, for hospitalized patients with IE with limited mobility, we suggest mechanical thromboprophylaxis (eg, intermittent pneumatic compression). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1346.html" rel="external">"Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults"</a>.)</p><p>For patients with IE and recent DVT and/or PE, the risk of VTE complications with withholding anticoagulation is balanced against the risk of bleeding complications with anticoagulation. For patients with IE without evidence of stroke or a condition posing a high risk of bleeding (such as acute <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> endocarditis), standard recommendations for anticoagulation for DVT and/or PE are applicable.

Antiplatelet therapy for patients with coronary artery disease and IE should be governed by the applicable recommendations for coronary artery disease, including specific recommendations for patients who have undergone coronary artery stenting. This includes continuing <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> indefinitely in all patients with coronary stents, in addition to time-limited dual antiplatelet therapy.

However, there are few data to guide decisions about the initiation or continuation of antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention in patients who develop IE. Given the increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in acute IE, we generally suspend antiplatelet therapy during treatment of IE. However, in the absence of bleeding complications, it is reasonable to continue antiplatelet therapy in acute IE for patients deemed to be at particularly high risk of recurrent noncardioembolic ischemic stroke because of factors such as recent transient ischemic attack (TIA) or high-grade stenosis of an extracranial or intracranial large artery.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H453760598"><span class="h5">Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">Aspirin</a> use modestly decreases the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and possibly decreases long-term colorectal cancer incidence, but increases the risk of major bleeding in adults without established cardiovascular disease and with average cancer risk. Since patients presenting with acute IE may be at increased risk for major bleeding, we generally suspend aspirin use for primary prevention during treatment of IE.

In patients at high risk of cardioembolic stroke other than IE alone (eg, a patient with a mechanical prosthetic valve, particularly if high-risk features are present), cautious anticoagulation may be continued if a small ischemic stroke is identified, although this recommendation is controversial. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1082.html" rel="external">"Early antithrombotic treatment of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack"</a>.)</p><p>In patients with IE in whom a decision is made to continue anticoagulant therapy (eg, for a mechanical valve), we generally replace DOAC or VKA therapy (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>) with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> or low molecular weight heparin therapy at the time of presentation while stability and potential need for an invasive procedure is assessed [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The switch is made so that anticoagulation can be quickly reversed should an indication for an invasive procedure develop or should a contraindication to anticoagulation arise (eg, a stroke or a bleeding complication). We generally initiate unfractionated heparin without a bolus to reduce the risk of bleeding. Patients treated with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin should have a baseline platelet count obtained before heparin is started, and every two or three days from day four until the heparin is stopped [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].
