         Neural tube defects are the most common congenital central nervous system (CNS) anomalies and are the cause of chronic disability of between 70,000 and 100,000 individuals in the United States. Myelomeningocele (spina bifida) is the most common neural tube defect. It is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column, with a corresponding defect in the skin so that the meninges and spinal cord are exposed. Patients with myelomeningocele may have weakness and absence of sensation affecting the lower extremities and bowel/bladder dysfunction, depending upon the level of the spinal lesion.
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of the management of myelomeningocele and its complications will be presented here. Occult spinal dysraphism is discussed separately. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, prenatal diagnosis, orthopedic management, and urologic management of myelomeningocele are also discussed separately:

         Most centers treat all viable newborns aggressively without selection. Historically, selective treatment was provided only for infants considered to have the best chance of neurologic outcome; however, nonselective treatment increases overall survival several-fold, and there is little difference in functionality as compared with individuals surviving selective treatment protocols. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Outcome'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         At our institution, the management choice is dependent on parent preference after ensuring that parents understand the management options and expected outcomes. During prenatal counseling, discussion with the parents includes the natural history of myelomeningocele and the prenatal management decisions, including termination of the pregnancy, pursuit of additional prenatal testing, choice of delivery setting, and, when applicable, the possibility of fetal surgery. The postnatal management choices are also discussed, including surgical closure of the defect and possible need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. Longitudinal follow-up after prenatal diagnosis of myelomeningocele suggests that approximately 60 to 70 percent of pregnancies end in termination or fetal demise [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Serial ultrasounds for fetal growth, head size, and ventricular size can provide useful information to inform prenatal counseling and delivery planning [

         Fetal surgery for myelomeningocele can arrest leakage of spinal fluid from the back thereby preventing or reversing herniation of the hindbrain (Chiari II malformation) and reducing the development of hydrocephalus and need for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting [
         <a href="#rid3">

         </span>
         Because fetal surgery is associated with risks of fetal and maternal complications, we agree with recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) that fetal surgery only be offered at facilities with the special expertise, multidisciplinary teams, and facilities to provide the intensive care required for these patients [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. In our practice, the fetal team (consisting of a pediatric neurosurgeon, fetal surgeon, maternal fetal medicine specialist, and neonatologist) meets with the expectant family in three separate counseling sessions:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         At the first meeting, we discuss the disease, its long-term impact on the patient, and postnatal management of the open defect. We assess candidacy for fetal surgery, utilizing the inclusion and exclusion criteria from the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) trial, which is discussed below (see
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy'
         </a>
         below). Important criteria when assessing candidacy for fetal surgery include that the pregnancy is an otherwise uncomplicated singleton pregnancy and that the fetus has an isolated myelomeningocele with normal karyotype and no additional major structural anomalies. If the mother is a candidate for fetal surgery, we inform her of this option and provide a brief summary of the risks and benefits associated with prenatal surgery.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If the family is interested in pursuing more in-depth knowledge of fetal surgery, they return for a second counseling session, during which the maternal and fetal risks and potential benefits of prenatal surgery are reviewed in greater detail.
        </p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         In the third session, the family meets with the entire fetal surgery team, including the surgical, medical, and anesthesia staff. The expectant family's questions are addressed, and consent is obtained for surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These counseling sessions usually occur over several weeks, which allows the family time to process the information and make a decision that is best for them.

         The safety and efficacy of fetal surgery for repair of myelomeningocele were evaluated in the MOMS trial, which was a randomized controlled trial conducted from 2003 to 2010 at three institutions in the United States with extensive experience in fetal surgery [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-9
         </a>
         ]. Eligible women were randomized to undergo fetal surgery at 18 to 25 weeks gestation (n = 91) or standard postnatal repair (n = 92). The trial was stopped early because of efficacy [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>

          Decreased need for CSF shunting
         </strong>
         – In the first year of life, 44 percent of infants in the fetal surgery group required CSF shunt placement for hydrocephalus compared with 84 percent in the postnatal repair group (relative risk [RR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.67) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

          Improved motor development and function
         </strong>
         – At 30 months of age, more children in the fetal surgery group achieved independent ambulation compared with those in the postnatal repair group (45 versus 24 percent) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,10
         </a>

         <a href="#rid6">
          6,10
         </a>
         ]. Factors associated with independent ambulation included the presence of in utero ankle, knee, and hip movement; absence of a sac over the lesion; and a myelomeningocele lesion of ≤L3 [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. At age 6 to 10 years, there were fewer children overall who maintained independent ambulation, though the difference between the two groups persisted (29 percent in the fetal surgery group versus 11 percent in the postnatal surgery group) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         <strong>
          Similar cognitive outcomes
         </strong>
         – Based on the available data, fetal surgery does not appear to improve cognitive and adaptive functioning. At 30 months of age, children in both groups had similar scores on standardized tests of mental development (mean mental development index on the BSID-II was 89±15 for the fetal surgery group versus 86±18 for the postnatal repair group) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         ]. At age 6 to 10 years, scores on standardized developmental tests were similar in both groups within each domain of adaptive functioning (communication, daily living, and socialization) and for the overall composite score (89±10 versus 88±12) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         <strong>
          Possible improvement in bladder function
         </strong>
         – It is uncertain whether the rate of bladder dysfunction is lower in children who undergo fetal repair compared with those who undergo postnatal repair. If there is an improvement, it does not appear to be dramatic and therefore urologic outcomes alone should not be the sole impetus to perform fetal surgery. At 30 months of age, there was a nonsignificant reduction in the need for clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) (38 percent in the fetal surgery group versus 51 percent in the postnatal surgery group; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.12) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>

         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         For infants with a prenatal diagnosis of myelomeningocele who do not undergo fetal intervention, delivery should occur at a center with a level III neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric neurosurgery services, and other personnel experienced in the neonatal management of these infants. Latex-free gloves and equipment should be used during delivery and subsequent care of the infant because patients with myelomeningocele are at risk for developing a life-threatening latex allergy.

         Term delivery is preferable, but increasing ventriculomegaly with macrocephaly on prenatal ultrasound may necessitate preterm delivery as determined by the obstetrical team.

         Fetuses presenting in the breech position are typically delivered by cesarean section. The optimal route of delivery of a fetus presenting in the vertex position is uncertain. The route of delivery and other aspects of pregnancy management, labor, and delivery are discussed in greater detail separately. (See

With this precaution and appropriate wound care, early CNS infection is rare. In a retrospective study of infants with back closure performed after 48 hours of age, ventriculitis occurred less often in infants given antibiotic prophylaxis as compared with those who were not (1 versus 19 percent) [

         Following repair of the myelomeningocele, many infants develop some degree of hydrocephalus, which causes the head circumference to increase at a rate greater than the normal curve. We recommend active surveillance of head circumference and ventricular size in the weeks following repair to determine if the infant requires placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ventricular size should be evaluated soon after birth by ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  (

         <a href="#rid20">

         Stable or slowly progressive increases in ventricular size in a stable infant should be followed. If the infant is stable, without apnea, feeding normally, and responding normally, we suggest expectant management, measuring the head circumference and imaging of the ventricles with ultrasound every one to three weeks until the head growth has stabilized. In many of these infants, the head growth will slow and eventually follow a curve slightly above but parallel to the 95
         <sup>

         percentile line. This may take several weeks or up to three months.

         </span>
         By contrast, rapidly progressive hydrocephalus that causes the infant to become unstable or to develop stridor, poor feeding, or emesis should be treated by insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Shunt placement may also be triggered by cosmetic concerns if the infant's head circumference is markedly larger than that of a normal infant this age (eg, nearing the size of a three-year-old child).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately 60 percent of infants require ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement when followed using the above protocol [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. The remaining infants appear to do well without a shunt, and there is no evidence that the lack of a shunt impairs their development. Additional evidence that mild hydrocephalus is not necessarily associated with cognitive dysfunction comes from historical observations: Many of the adults who survived prior to the availability of shunting have large heads and very large ventricles but have normal intelligence and are living independently. Although shunt placement increases survival through childhood for infants with rapidly progressive hydrocephalus, there is some evidence that having a shunt may reduce survival during adulthood [
         <a href="#rid24">

        </p>
        <p>
         In a few infants with very early evidence of progressive hydrocephalus, simultaneous myelomeningocele repair and shunt placement may be appropriate. This approach does not appear to increase the complication rate. In a retrospective review, the frequency of CSF infection, shunt malfunction, and symptomatic Chiari II malformation was similar with simultaneous and sequential repair and shunting [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         Deterioration in a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt should prompt evaluation for possible shunt malfunction as the initial consideration. Other causes of progressive disability include tethered cord, progressive compression of the cervical canal from the Chiari II, and hydromyelia, as well as orthopedic and urologic complications. The most common cause of decline is a shunt malfunction; the second most common cause is a tethered cord [

         Progressive deterioration in lower extremity function, changes in urinary tract function, progressive scoliosis, or pain suggest the possibility of a tethered cord, which is a functional disorder caused by fixation and abnormal stretching of the spinal cord [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ]. In patients with myelomeningocele, tethered cord is typically caused by scar tissue at the site of prior closure. Nearly all children who have undergone myelomeningocele repair have a low-lying spinal cord with adhesions to the surrounding dura; however, only 10 to 30 percent develop symptoms of neurologic deterioration that prompt surgical release [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30
         </a>
         ]. The symptoms of tethered cord are nonspecific, and shunt malfunction must be excluded. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         If a child demonstrates concerning neurologic, urologic, or orthopedic decline, a search for the cause should be undertaken, including imaging of the brain and spine. Neuroimaging is performed chiefly to exclude other potential causes (eg, shunt malfunction). Tethered cord is largely a clinical diagnosis in children with myelomeningocele since nearly all demonstrate radiographic evidence of tethering.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of tethered cord is surgical and consists of releasing the scar tissue around the prior placode closure. Untethering will be easier if the exposed neural tissue was closed into a tube during the primary closure. The symptoms will often stabilize or improve with untethering; however, symptomatic retethering may occur in some patients [

         The Chiari II malformation is present on baseline MRI in almost all patients with myelomeningocele; however, a minority of patients develop symptoms related to brainstem compression and only 5 to 10 percent of patients require surgical decompression [

          29,32

         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         In some patients, the brainstem or spinal cord becomes progressively compressed within the spinal canal, causing swallowing difficulties, vocal cord paresis, stridor, and/or apneic episodes. Neck pain is also common. Other symptoms may include new onset of strabismus, facial weakness, progressive weakness in the lower extremities, or worsening incontinence. When present, brainstem compression caused by the Chiari II malformation is associated with a high mortality rate [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of these symptoms are nonspecific, and in our experience, they are more likely to be due to a shunt malfunction causing increased pressure on the lower brainstem located in the upper spinal canal. Shunt revision usually relieves the symptoms. Shunt malfunction must be definitively excluded before considering an alternative diagnosis and intervention: Surgical decompression of the cervical or lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces in the face of a shunt malfunction may cause herniation of the hindbrain because of the sudden reduction of CSF pressure.

         When surgical decompression of Chiari II is indicated and shunt malfunction has been definitively excluded, a variety of approaches are used, including cervical bone-only decompression, dural opening (with or without a graft to increase the size of the canal), resection of the cerebellar tonsils, stent placement into the fourth ventricle, or a combination of these.

         Hydromyelia describes the accumulation of fluid within the central canal of the spinal cord. This occurs in individuals with myelomeningocele because of a shunt malfunction or untreated hydrocephalus acting through the persistent embryonic connection between the neurocele, central canal, and the ventricular system of the brain. Fluid outside of the central canal has a different pathophysiology and is known as syringomyelia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5093.html" rel="external">
          "Disorders affecting the spinal cord", section on 'Syringomyelia'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         It is unclear what role hydromyelia plays in the deterioration of an individual with myelomeningocele. MRI of the spinal cord reveals that 50 percent of the patients who appear to be stable have some degree of hydromyelia; some have severe holocord hydromyelia or segmental hydromyelia [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Hydromyelia has some association with shunt malfunction: It is rare in the newborn and usually develops with the first shunt malfunction. Shunt revision often diminishes or reverses the asymptomatic hydromyelia.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with hydromyelia and nonspecific symptoms such as progressive scoliosis, urologic problems, pain, and motor or sensory defects, we first exclude shunt malfunction or empirically revise the shunt. If this is not successful, we suggest untethering the cord before considering specific treatment for hydromyelia. In many cases, untethering leads to improvement in the neurologic deficits. It is unclear why untethering of the spinal cord is also effective in reducing the radiologic findings of hydromyelia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Shunt malfunction'

        </p>
        <p>
         Interventions for hydromyelia include fenestration and shunting (either to the subarachnoid space or peritoneal cavity), but these approaches can paradoxically increase the defect, cause tethering, or create an imbalance with the ventricular shunt.

         Most patients with myelomeningocele have normal intelligence, but almost all experience learning disabilities. The Chiari II malformation is the major factor that distinguishes myelomeningocele from other disorders that are limited to the spinal cord (eg, traumatic paraplegia, spinal cord lipomas) and hence are not associated with cognitive impairment. The Chiari II malformation alters cognitive function by affecting brain development. Cognitive function may be further affected by the common complications of hydrocephalus and infection [

          20,46
         </a>
         ]. Treatment to reduce bladder pressures and minimize urine stasis usually prevents or attenuates this important complication. Close attention to urinary tract function is also important because changes in bladder function may be the only indication of a change in neurologic function and should prompt an evaluation for shunt malfunction or tethered cord, as previously discussed. (See

         Management of the urinary tract includes early initiation of clean intermittent catheterization and close monitoring for changes in bladder function.

         In almost all individuals with myelomeningocele, innervation of the bowel and anus are affected, leading to dysmotility and poor sphincter control and, often, to fecal incontinence [
         <a href="#rid20">

          47

         Decreased bowel motility frequently leads to constipation and fecal impaction, which causes an elevation in intra-abdominal pressure and can lead to shunt malfunction. Impaction may also cause liquid encopresis, which is sometimes mistaken by the family as an episode of diarrhea.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goals of a bowel management program are to achieve continence by prompting regular elimination of stool and to avoid fecal impaction:

At the initiation of the bowel program or at intervals later, a bowel clean-out may be necessary.

          57
         </a>
         ]. For infants born with spina bifida between 1985 and 2003, 71 percent survived until one year of age (56 percent of those with hydrocephalus and 88 percent of those without hydrocephalus). Survival rates decreased slightly with advancing age among those with hydrocephalus, falling to 50 percent by 20 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Outcomes will probably be better in subsequent cohorts of patients due to improvements in management of the neurologic and urinary tract complications.

         Limited data are available on long-term outcomes after fetal surgery [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,59,60
         </a>
         ]. The available data suggest that children who undergo fetal surgery have improved motor function, but cognitive outcomes appear to be similar (see
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy'
         </a>
         above). In a follow-up study of 78 children who underwent fetal repair of myelomeningocele as part of the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) trial and who were evaluated at age 6 to 10 years, 29 percent could walk independently, 42 percent could walk with orthotics only, 22 percent could walk with an assistive device, and 7 percent required the use of a wheelchair [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Scores on standardized tests of cognitive function and behavior were similar to those of children who underwent postnatal repair. Parent-rated assessments of attention and executive function were also similar. Both groups demonstrated better reading than math skills, higher verbal than nonverbal scores, below-average verbal memory performance, and impaired visuomotor integration. These findings are similar to other reports in children with postnatally managed myelomeningocele. (See

         Myelomeningocele (spina bifida) is the most common neural tube defect and is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column, with a corresponding defect in the skin so that the meninges and spinal cord are exposed. Patients with myelomeningocele usually have complete paralysis and absence of sensation affecting the lower extremities and trunk, depending upon the level of the spinal lesion. (See

         Prenatal counseling includes discussion of the natural history of myelomeningocele and the prenatal management decisions including termination of the pregnancy, pursuit of additional prenatal testing, choice of delivery setting, and, when applicable, the possibility of fetal surgery. The postnatal management choices are also discussed, including surgical closure of the defect and possible need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. (See

         For infants with a prenatal diagnosis of myelomeningocele who do not undergo fetal intervention, delivery should occur at a center with a level III neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric neurosurgery services, and other personnel experienced in the neonatal management of these infants. Latex-free gloves and equipment should be used during delivery and subsequent care of the infant because patients with myelomeningocele are at risk for developing a life-threatening latex allergy.

         The back lesion should be surgically closed, preferably within the first 72 hours after birth if the infant is stable. For the next few weeks, the infant should be monitored closely for the development of hydrocephalus, using serial head circumference measures and head ultrasounds. (See

         For patients who have rapidly increasing ventricular size, we recommend ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (

         Patients who have stable or slowly increasing ventricular size can be followed with serial head circumference measurements and ventricular ultrasounds every one to three weeks, depending on the level of concern, until the head growth has stabilized.

         Throughout life, patients with myelomeningocele should have serial evaluations of their neurologic function, including signs and symptoms of spinal cord or brainstem compression. Any changes should prompt evaluation for shunt malfunction. If this possibility is excluded, then tethered cord and brainstem compression from the Chiari II malformation should be considered. (See

         Nearly all patients with myelomeningocele have neurogenic bladder. Treatment with early initiation of clean intermittent catheterization reduces the risk of progressive renal disease. Changes in bladder function may be a sign of an acute neurologic complication (eg, shunt malfunction or tethered cord). (See

         In almost all individuals with myelomeningocele, innervation of the bowel and anus are affected, leading to decreased bowel motility and poor sphincter control and, often, to fecal incontinence. The goals of a bowel management program are to achieve continence by prompting regular elimination of stool and to avoid fecal impaction. This is often achievable through the use of oral laxatives, suppositories, and enemas, singly or in combination. Advanced bowel management options include transanal irrigation and the antegrade continence enema (ACE) procedure. (See

         Orthopedic management is directed at correcting deformities, maintaining posture, and promoting ambulation to maximize function and independence. Scoliosis occurs in most children with lesions above the second lumbar vertebra. New or rapidly progressive scoliosis in an individual with myelomeningocele may be caused by a reversible neurologic complication such as shunt malfunction, tethered cord, and/or hydromyelia and should prompt a thorough neurologic evaluation.

         Approximately 75 percent of patients with myelomeningocele survive to early adulthood. Long-term outcomes vary considerably depending on the myelomeningocele level, presence of hydrocephalus, and severity of the Chiari II malformation. (See
