         Regular physical activity is one of the most important actions individuals can take to improve their health; however, nearly 80 percent of adults are not meeting guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity, and only 50 percent meet guidelines for aerobic physical activity. Individuals who are pregnant or postpartum can also benefit from regular physical activity [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ], but a population-based survey in the United States determined that 60 percent of pregnant individuals do not engage in either moderate or vigorous leisure physical activity [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ] and, in the past, fewer than 15 percent met the minimum generally accepted recommendation of engaging in 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the close medical supervision, pregnancy offers a unique opportunity for behavior and adoption of a healthy lifestyle that includes safe physical activities. Data from leading obstetric organizations and numerous systematic reviews demonstrate that exercise during pregnancy is safe and can improve multiple pregnancy outcomes (eg, reduced frequency of excessive gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, postpartum weight retention) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and other international organizations recommend that in the absence of contraindications, pregnant individuals should continue or commence exercising, emphasizing that exercise is an important component of optimal health maintenance. An ACOG committee opinion emphasizes that regular physical activity in all phases of life, including pregnancy, has health benefits [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Health care providers should carefully evaluate pregnant individuals for obstetric or medical complications before making recommendations on physical activity and participation [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Even in uncomplicated pregnancies, exercise routines may have to be modified during pregnancy to accommodate normal pregnancy-related anatomic and physiologic changes and to avoid adverse fetal effects. The greatest barriers to exercise in pregnancy are nausea/fatigue and lack of time, thus focusing education and interventions on these barriers may help pregnant individuals achieve recommended exercise levels [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         ].

         This topic will discuss the benefits and risks of exercise during pregnancy and provide guidance about the frequency, type, intensity, and duration of exercise for various populations of pregnant and postpartum individuals. Issues related to exercise in the general adult population are reviewed separately:

          Reduction in risk of developing gestational diabetes
         </strong>
         – Risk reductions of 28 to 59 percent (RR 0.72 and 0.41) were reported in meta-analyses and systematic reviews [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These benefits are not completely independent. For example, among individuals who are overweight or obese, significant prepregnancy weight loss through exercise and diet and avoidance of excessive gestational weight gain can reduce the likelihood of developing gestational diabetes and diabetes- and obesity-related comorbidities, such as macrosomia, preeclampsia, obstetrically indicated preterm birth, and cesarean birth.

          Hyperthermia
         </strong>
         – Maternal core temperature of 102.2°F (39°C) early pregnancy, especially the first four to six weeks, increases the risk for fetal structural and functional abnormalities, particularly neural tube defects [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30
         </a>
         ]. It is unlikely that body core temperature would reach teratogenic levels during normal exercise and average ambient temperature, but a prudent approach is always warranted. In one study, when pregnant individuals biked on an ergometer for 60 minutes at 50 percent of
         <sub>
         </sub>
         VO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         max, their body core temperature increased only by &lt;1.8°F (&lt;1°C) [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Hyperthermia of ≥102.2°F (39°C) is not a teratogenic concern after organogenesis has been completed, but exertional and nonexertional hyperthermia can still have serious deleterious maternal effects if untreated. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Aquatic exercise appears to provide better temperature control and less stress on joints and ligaments. In a systematic review of studies of core temperature response of pregnant individuals to exercise or passive heat stress across gestation, the highest mean end-trial core temperature was 38.3°C (95% CI 37.7-38.9°C) for land-based exercise, 37.5°C (95% CI 37.3-37.7°C) for water immersion exercise, 36.9°C (95% CI 36.8-37.0°C) for hot water bathing, and 37.6°C (95% CI 37.5-37.7°C) for sauna exposure [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. The authors concluded that pregnant individuals could safely engage in: (1) exercise for up to 35 minutes at 80 to 90 percent of their maximum heart rate at 77°F/25°C and 45 percent relative humidity (RH); (2) water immersion (≤92°F/33.4°C) exercise for up to 45 minutes; and (3) sitting in hot baths (104°F/40°C) or hot/dry saunas (158°F/70°C; 15 percent RH) for up to 20 minutes, irrespective of gestational age, without reaching a core temperature exceeding the teratogenic threshold. However, prolonged land or aquatic exercise should be avoided in extremely cold or warm environments.

          Reduction in uteroplacental blood flow

          34,35
         </a>
         ]. Reports of sporadic episodes of fetal bradycardia during maternal exercise have raised concerns that maternal exercise could compromise uterine blood flow, resulting in hypoxia-related fetal injury [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36-38
         </a>
         ]. However, the body of evidence suggests that the normal fetus compensates for any transient changes in uteroplacental blood flow during maternal exercise and is not at risk of harm, even in previously sedentary pregnant individuals [

         External fetal monitors have been used extensively to evaluate fetal heart rate (FHR) responses to maternal exercise on a treadmill or exercise cycle, and the findings have been reassuring. In these studies, maternal exercise was generally associated with a 2 to 10 beat/minute increase in FHR, generally independent of gestational age and intensity of exercise [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. The increase in FHR was sometimes accompanied by FHR accelerations, and post-exercise FHR reactivity was generally achieved within 20 minutes. It is likely that the increase in FHR is a normal physiologic response to a transient reduction in uterine blood flow and to transplacental passage of maternal catecholamines, which are elevated during exercise. These fetal responses are protective mechanisms that increase blood flow and facilitate exchange of the respiratory gases across the placenta.

         Although a prolonged reduction in uteroplacental blood flow can result in fetal hypoxemia, leading to vagal stimulation and bradycardia in some cases [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40

         Studies of the fetal responses to maternal exercise are limited by the technical difficulty of externally recording the FHR during exercise. FHR tracings are frequently obscured by artifacts induced by maternal or fetal movement. To address this concern, in a pilot study internal scalp electrodes were applied after membrane rupture to the fetuses of two elite athletes who volunteered to exercise while in labor [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. The athletes engaged in an incremental resistance bicycle ergometry test and reached 60 percent of their last known maximum aerobic capacity, after which the tests were suspended. In each case, the FHR remained normal during and after the test. Although the study was small, it provides additional unique evidence that maternal exercise at this level is not deleterious to the fetus, even during the most challenging conditions, such as labor. By contrast, fetal bradycardia was observed during strenuous exercise in two of six Olympic-level athletes tested at 23 to 29 weeks of gestation who exercised at ≥90 percent of maximal heart rate and whose mean uterine artery blood flow fell &gt;50 percent from baseline [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. FHR and umbilical artery Doppler indices normalized within 10 minutes of maternal recovery after cessation of exercise. As there are no proven health benefits for strenuous exercise in pregnancy, it should only be considered by elite athletes whose pregnancies are closely monitored. (See

          Impaired fetal growth
         </strong>
         – Although exercise may have a small negative effect on birth weight, it does not appear to increase the risk of delivery of a small for gestational age infant. In a 2015 systematic review of the effect of supervised prenatal exercise on fetal growth, randomization to standard prenatal care plus a supervised prenatal exercise program (aerobic, resistance, or both) did not adversely affect birth weight compared with standard prenatal care alone (mean difference in birth weight -31 g) or the risk for delivery of a small for gestational age newborn (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.72-1.46) [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50

         ]. The frequency of the prescribed exercise regimen ranged from one to five times per week, the time of each session ranged from 15 to 70 minutes, and the duration of the interventions ranged from 6 to 33 weeks, ending in the mid to late third trimester. Other meta-analyses have reported no or small (&lt;60 grams) differences in birth weight [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Reviews of these studies revealed numerous potential biases and methodological issues: other confounding conditions or complications; small sample size; the trimester in which exercise is performed; the type (weight-bearing versus non-weight-bearing), intensity, and duration of exercise; eating habits; and active or sedentary control groups [

         ]. However, some have called for reevaluation of the disorders that have been considered absolute and relative contraindications to prenatal exercise since there is no high-quality evidence demonstrating an adverse effect of moderate to vigorous physical activity in some of these settings (eg, twin pregnancy, gestational hypertension, anemia) [

         Exercises typically performed in a supine position should be avoided after the first trimester because aortocaval compression in this position predisposes approximately 10 percent of pregnant individuals to hypotensive episodes, especially in the third trimester. The supine position can compromise uterine blood flow through compression of the aorta. However, these effects appear to be more of a problem during supine rest than supine exercise [

         Strength training can be performed during pregnancy, but information about safety is limited. Due to the increased relaxation of joints and ligaments in pregnancy, studies have focused on low-intensity resistance training with low weights (free weights or machine, ≤10 pounds [4.5 kg]) with multiple repetitions lifted through a dynamic range of motion. These studies suggest this level of activity is safe and effective during pregnancy [

          67,68

Although supporting data are lacking, a prudent approach is to avoid heavy-resistance weight lifting, any exercises that result in marked straining (especially training to failure), and intense repetitive isometric exercises during pregnancy. Individuals who continue heavy strength training in pregnancy should be aware that the Valsalva maneuver causes a rapid increase in blood pressure and intraabdominal pressure and therefore may temporarily decrease uteroplacental blood flow [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Avoiding this maneuver by exhaling with an open airway seems prudent. Contracting the pelvic floor muscles before and during heavy lifting can counteract the impact of increased intraabdominal pressure on the pelvic floor [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51

Aquatic exercise is a particularly advantageous non-weight-bearing activity for pregnant individuals since the following occur during immersion: Peripheral edema is reduced, the forces across weight-bearing joints are reduced, body heat is readily dissipated into the water, and loss of balance and falling are of minimal concern [

         Maladaptation at altitude could result in acute mountain sickness, a medical emergency. All pregnant individuals recreationally active at high altitudes should be made aware of the signs of altitude sickness (headache, poor sleep, anorexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and, in severe cases, pulmonary edema). They should stop exercising, return to a lower altitude as soon as possible, and seek medical attention if such symptoms occur. (See

          13,77-81

         There are minimal data on the safe upper limit for the duration of exercise in pregnancy, and intensity must also be considered in this assessment (see

          'Intensity of exercise'
         </a>
         below). In general, fit pregnant individuals who want to engage in prolonged exercise (over 45 minutes of continuous exercise) should exercise in a thermoneutral environment or in controlled environmental conditions (air conditioning), with attention to proper hydration and subjective feelings of heat stress.

         Prescription of exercise intensity in pregnancy is individually tailored to the individual's level of physical ability, ideally involves easily quantified activities (eg, walking, swimming, stationary cycling), and is increased gradually. A reasonable approach for previously sedentary individuals is to initially engage in low- to moderate-intensity exercise (casual to brisk walk and low-intensity workouts), increasing the intensity gradually. Although an upper level of safe exercise intensity in pregnancy has not been established, we believe that individuals who were regular exercisers before pregnancy and who have uncomplicated, healthy pregnancies should be able to engage in high-intensity exercise programs (eg, jogging, aerobics) with no adverse effects [
         <a href="#rid2">

        </p>
        <p>
         Exercise intensity can be monitored based on perceived exertion, heart rate, or metabolic equivalents (METs). When exercise is self-paced, most pregnant individuals (including athletes) will voluntarily reduce their exercise intensity as pregnancy progresses [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         <a href="#rid3">
          3,13
         </a>
         ]. For moderate exercise, ratings of perceived exertion should be 13 to 14 (somewhat hard) on a Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale, where 6 represents no exertion and 20 represents maximal exertion [

         Dehydration is a potential risk with intense or prolonged exercise or exercise in a hot environment; appropriate hydration before, during, and after exercise is important in these settings. Any loss of weight during an exercise session is fluid loss that should be made up before the next exercise session (1 pound [0.45 kg] weight loss equals approximately 1 pint [16 ounces (United States)] of fluid [0.5 L]).

         A systematic review found that elite pregnant athletes maintained 4 to 13 hours of training per week [
         <a href="#rid92">
          92
         </a>
         ]. Most elite athletes will decrease their pace of training during pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, weight gain, physiologic anemia, edema, and musculoskeletal changes and pain can prevent the athlete from maintaining their prepregnancy level of performance, but this depends on the specific requirements of their sport [
         <a href="#rid93">
          93,94
         </a>
         ]. For example, a tennis player may be less able to rapidly stop and start or change direction. Attempts to substitute compensatory movements for finely tuned skilled movements will, at the very least, result in inefficient movement and decrease competitive performance, and may also increase the risk of injury. One-third of injuries recorded in pregnancy have been attributed to physical activities and exercise; in one study, the reported incidence was 4.1/1000 hours of exercise [
         <a href="#rid95">
          95
         </a>
         ]. Ligament laxity and increased stress on the joints and spine, particularly during weight-bearing exercise, may predispose pregnant athletes to sprains. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/427.html" rel="external">
          "Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Musculoskeletal changes and pain"

        </p>
        <p>
         Elite female athletes who maintain the same high-intensity training in pregnancy are also at risk for "overtraining syndrome." Although not reported in pregnancy, clinicians attending elite athletes should be aware of this complication, which presents with excessive and more rapid manifestation of fatigue, sleep disorders, lack of weight gain, increased frequency of musculoskeletal injuries, and persistent tachycardia at rest. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97059.html" rel="external">
          "Overtraining syndrome in athletes"

        </p>
        <p>
         Based on low-quality evidence, it appears prudent for elite female athletes to avoid strenuous exercise in the week after ovulation and avoid repetitive heavy lifting during the first trimester, as these activities may increase the risk of miscarriage [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. A Finnish case control study of physiotherapists reported an odds ratio of 3.5 (95% CI 1.1-9.0) between occupational heavy lifting and miscarriage [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ]. Heavy lifting in pregnancy has been arbitrarily defined in the literature as between 10 to 20 kg (22 to 44 lb) more than 20 times/week [
         <a href="#rid69">

         Pregnant elite athletes may use perception of exertion or fatigue to gauge their training intensity, similar to other pregnant individuals (see
         <a class="local">
          'Intensity of exercise'
         </a>

         max, although this is not based on data [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         No studies have evaluated pregnancy duration in elite athletes. Anecdotal information suggests that strenuous training does not cause preterm labor or birth. However, a competitive athlete with a history of preterm labor should consider either decreasing training or discontinuing training during pregnancy, given the absence of strong data on strenuous exercise in pregnancy and its impact on length of gestation in individuals at risk for preterm birth [
         <a href="#rid97">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Dehydration may provoke uterine contractions, so particular attention should be paid to maintaining proper hydration during and between high-intensity, prolonged exercise sessions and exercise in hot, humid weather. Fluid balance during an exercise session can be monitored by self-weighing before and after the session. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Hydration and energy'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because training in elite athletes is likely to be high-intensity, prolonged, and frequent, it is likely that gestational weight gain and fetal growth will be less than for sedentary individuals. One study of endurance athletes observed significant reductions in birth weight, which was attributed to decreased neonatal fat mass [
         <a href="#rid98">
          98
         </a>
         ]. A competitive athlete with a small for gestational age newborn (past or current pregnancy) or at risk for a small for gestational age newborn because of pregnancy complications should consider either decreasing training or discontinuing training during pregnancy in consultation with an obstetrician or maternal-fetal specialist.
        </p>
        <p>
         Participation in competitive sports at the elite level does not appear to affect birth outcome, including length of labor, frequency of intrapartum cesarean birth, and severe perineal tears [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99
         </a>
         ]. Available data are not sufficient to determine whether the type of activity (eg, low impact versus high impact) affects outcome. It has been hypothesized that high-impact sports might increase pelvic floor muscle strength and volume, which might in turn affect the length of the second stage, fetal rotation, and risk of perineal injury [

         Exercise is increasingly promoted as an intervention to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes or as part of the therapeutic regimen for nonpregnant individuals with diabetes mellitus. In addition to its cardiovascular benefits, exercise can also improve glycemic control, which largely results from increased tissue sensitivity to insulin. (See

         Exercise may also help to reduce the risk of developing gestational diabetes or improve glucose control in individuals with gestational or pregestational diabetes. The author advises overweight, sedentary pregnant individuals with pregestational diabetes to engage in a minimum of 15 metabolic equivalent (MET) hours of physical activity per week, preferably building up to ≥28 MET hours of physical activity per week to improve glycemic control [

         The author similarly advises overweight, sedentary pregnant individuals without diabetes to engage in regular exercise to reduce their risk of developing gestational diabetes. Non-weight-bearing exercise (eg, stationary bicycle) can be sustained longer at higher intensity and may be more effective for previously sedentary pregnant individuals. One study that performed measurements by indirect calorimetry suggested preferential carbohydrate utilization during this type of activity, independent of fitness level and weight [

         For most pregnant individuals, physical activity/exercise does not increase the risk of miscarriage or preterm birth, and bed rest does not reduce the risk of miscarriage or preterm birth. However, studies on exercise in pregnancy have generally excluded individuals at high risk of miscarriage or preterm birth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the absence of reassuring data in high-risk individuals, we agree with expert opinion that pregnant individuals at high risk for miscarriage or preterm birth (eg, multiple gestation) should limit high levels of exercise/physical activity, particularly activities involving strength training and heavy lifting [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68,106
         </a>
         ]. Very few conditions in pregnancy require strict or modified bed rest; these include preeclampsia with severe features and some cases of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. (See

         The safety of maternal exercise in twin pregnancy is a common concern and has not been systematically studied since multiple gestations are at high risk for preterm labor and exercise can cause increased uterine activity and trigger preterm labor. Worldwide, most organizations list twins and other multiple gestations as a contraindication to exercise. In the author's practice, he suggests such patients engage in non-weight-bearing exercises, such as swimming; counsels them about awareness of increased uterine activity; and uses office ultrasound to measure cervical length to detect shortening.

         The appropriate time to return to a routine level of prepregnancy physical activities varies and depends on many factors, including the degree of perineal trauma, blood loss (degree of anemia), presence of medical/surgical complications related to pregnancy and the postpartum period, and personal preference. After a vaginal birth, most individuals should resume their normal physical activities at their own pace and in consultation with their medical provider.

         For advanced recreational or elite athletes, the wound healing process of the abdominal wall will determine the timing for return to more strenuous type of exercises. The abdominal fascia regains 51 to 59 percent of its original tensile strength at 42 days, 70 to 89 percent at 120 days, and 73 to 93 percent by 140 days [

         Individuals who exercise to moderate levels of exertion do not have changes in breast milk quantity or composition or infant acceptance of breast milk; however, exercise at maximal levels has been associated with significant but short-term elevations in lactic acid in breast milk and less infant acceptance [

         <a href="#rid129">
          129

         ]. Most of these individuals had previously been sedentary. In strenuously training mothers, anecdotal reports have described failure of infants to gain weight as rapidly as expected. It is possible that inadequate fluid or nutritional intake in vigorously exercising mothers, rather than exercise itself, led to decreased milk production, resulting in suboptimal infant weight gain.

         A comparison of guidelines for physical activity from around the world for pregnant women revealed consensus that physical activity in pregnancy is beneficial for most individuals and has minimal risks, but may require some modifications to accommodate the normal maternal anatomic and physiologic changes and fetal requirements. For women with uncomplicated pregnancy, guidelines generally recommend at least 150 min/week of moderate intensity aerobic activity plus pelvic floor and muscle strengthening exercises at least twice/week and modification of some exercises (eg, avoid supine position) [
         <a href="#rid90">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There was also close to universal consensus that certain maternal, fetal, or environmental conditions are absolute or relative contraindications for exercise in pregnancy. Among these conditions are serious cardiovascular, respiratory, systemic disorder or medical conditions; fetal growth restriction; cervical insufficiency; placenta previa; poorly controlled hypertension; preeclampsia; preterm labor/birth; prelabor rupture of membranes; poorly controlled thyroid disease; and multiple gestation (triplets or higher). In addition, there was consensus that women should be aware of warning signs for stopping activity (eg, persistent dizziness, vaginal bleeding) and that activities with a high risk of falling/collision should be avoided.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.

         – We agree with recommendations of major medical societies that individuals with uncomplicated pregnancies should be encouraged to exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle before, during, and after pregnancy. (See

          Benefits and risks of exercise in pregnancy
         </strong>
         – Exercise during pregnancy has minimal risks and demonstrated benefits for most pregnant individuals, including maintenance or improvement of physical fitness, control of gestational weight gain, reduction in low back pain, and reduction in risk of developing gestational diabetes, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, or a large for gestational age newborn. Exercise, particularly pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegel exercises) performed during pregnancy help to decrease the short-term risk of urinary incontinence. Moderate exercise is not a direct cause of any adverse pregnancy outcome; however, pregnant individuals may be at greater risk of injuries to joints, falling, and significant abdominal trauma during certain types of exercise. Abdominal trauma can result in placental abruption, which can lead to fetal death or morbidity. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Benefits and risks'

          Assessment

         <strong>
          Activities to avoid
         </strong>
         – Some sports should be avoided in pregnancy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108041" href="/z/d/graphic/108041.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Contact sports and physical activities in which the risk of falls/trauma is high are a concern in pregnancy because of the risk of fetal harm from maternal trauma. SCUBA diving should also be avoided because of the potential for fetal harm. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Hydration and energy
         </strong>
         – Maintenance of euhydration is particularly critical to heat balance during prolonged exercise and exercise in hot, humid weather; hyperthermia in very early pregnancy may increase the risk for neural tube defects. The caloric costs of exercise should be estimated and balanced by appropriate caloric intake and awareness of hypoglycemia symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Intensity, frequency, and duration
         </strong>
         – The intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise depend on patient-specific factors. For most healthy pregnant individuals, the following exercise prescription is reasonable: moderate-intensity exercise (able to carry on a normal conversation during exercise) that includes aerobic exercise and strength training, performed for at least 20 to 30 minutes per day on five to seven days per week to achieve at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Previously sedentary individuals should begin with 10 to 20 minutes of continuous low-intensity exercise three times per week, increasing the intensity, frequency, and duration gradually.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Physically active individuals can engage in moderate to vigorous physical activity. They should strive to maintain a good fitness level throughout pregnancy without trying to reach their peak fitness level or train for athletic competition. (See
