         Peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) is the term for patients with features of SpA whose symptoms and findings are predominantly or entirely peripheral rather than axial; these features include arthritis, which is predominantly of the lower limbs and/or asymmetric; enthesitis; and dactylitis. Some patients with peripheral SpA also have a current or past history of back pain, but the back pain is not the predominant feature.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patient groups with peripheral SpA include those with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), reactive arthritis, SpA related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis), and a subset of patients with these manifestations who do not meet established definitions for one of these three forms of SpA. Patients with predominantly axial SpA, such as ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial SpA, are not included within the peripheral SpA category, regardless of whether peripheral manifestations of musculoskeletal involvement, which may be seen in some patients with axial SpA, are also present [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A clear distinction between the clinically defined subsets of patients with peripheral SpA is often lacking. As examples, in a number of patients, skin manifestations of psoriasis do not occur until after the manifestation of rheumatic symptoms; preceding infections in patients with a reactive arthritis may be clinically asymptomatic (as an example, with chlamydia); and IBD can also be asymptomatic when patients present with musculoskeletal symptoms [
         <a href="#rid3">

         An overview of the treatment of peripheral SpA in adults will be presented here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral SpA; the classification of SpA; and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, nonradiographic axial SpA, PsA, reactive arthritis, arthritis associated with IBD, and SpA in children are discussed in more detail separately.

         The ultimate treatment goal in all patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) is to optimize short- and long-term health-related quality of life, which is accomplished through use of a combination of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments to control inflammation, prevent structural damage to the joints, and preserve function and social participation. Collaborative ("shared") decision-making by the patient and clinician is especially important in establishing specific treatment goals and making choices between therapeutic options [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nonpharmacologic and preventive therapies'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">

          'Monitoring'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients benefit from care by an expert in rheumatologic disease, such as a rheumatologist, and care should be coordinated with appropriate specialists depending upon the clinical features, such as a dermatologist for psoriasis, gastroenterologist for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis), or an ophthalmologist with expertise in uveitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are relatively limited data that directly address the treatment of peripheral SpA; treatment of peripheral SpA that is not associated specifically with psoriasis, IBD, or an infection has been the subject of only a few randomized trials, all involving tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-9
         </a>
         ]. Further but indirect evidence regarding treatment of patients with peripheral SpA has been provided by trials of a range of agents directed against a variety of targets in patients with axial SpA and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,10
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of our approach to the management of peripheral SpA is provided here. The respective treatment approaches for patients with peripheral SpA specifically within the context of PsA, IBD (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis), and reactive arthritis are described in more detail separately.

         <strong>
          General health and lifestyle issues
         </strong>
         – Attention to general health issues and comorbidities that are common in SpA, especially obesity and metabolic syndrome, is important for patients with peripheral SpA [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. Patients with obesity (class I or greater, with body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) had higher disease activity and showed a diminished response and adherence to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors compared with patients who were not obese [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Patients should be counseled about proper eating habits and referred to nutritionists for further counseling if appropriate. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5371.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Patient education
         </strong>
         – Patients should be educated as to the nature of their condition and the importance of follow-up for appropriate management of comorbidities. Smoking cessation should be advised because cigarette smoking is generally believed to have an adverse effect on SpA, in addition to its adverse effects upon cardiovascular risk and other aspects of health [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Patients may also benefit from screening for depression, participation in patient support groups, and arthritis self-help programs. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of smoking cessation management in adults"

         Patients should be instructed about their medications and the proper use of topical and oral medications, as well as the need for regular drug administration and monitoring of disease activity and for side effects of therapies. Preventive measures (eg, screening for latent tuberculosis, administration of immunizations) that are appropriate for the individual medications being used are important components of treatment for all patients.

         Choice of therapy is based upon the selection of agents that will be effective alone or in combination for the clinical manifestations that are present in a given patient. Most patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) have peripheral arthritis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], and most of the treatments for the different clinical manifestations overlap, but some are more effective for one or another feature. Treatment options for the manifestations of arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis can differ [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]; therefore, these manifestations are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Arthritis'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Enthesitis'

         <a class="local">
          'Dactylitis'

         <a class="local">
          'Back pain'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment choices, particularly the use of biologic therapies such as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, may also be influenced by the presence of findings of another disease associated with peripheral SpA that may require one of these agents, such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis), and uveitis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Extraarticular manifestations'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of TNF inhibitors, interleukin (IL) 17 inhibitors, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in peripheral SpA would be considered as "off-label" by regulatory bodies in the United States and the European Union, unless patients also have active axial SpA, psoriasis, or active IBD, which are among the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- and European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved indications for these agents. Similarly, some TNF inhibitors have received regulatory approval for uveitis by the FDA and the EMA as well, but not for the SpA-typical anterior uveitis. These regulatory factors may limit the availability of certain agents, depending upon the patient's particular diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid16">

         In patients with mild arthritis, we suggest treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), for example,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/z/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">
          naproxen
         </a>
         500 mg twice daily or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8847" href="/z/d/drug information/8847.html" rel="external">
          celecoxib
         </a>
         200 mg twice daily. Patients with a limited number of swollen joints (up to three) amenable to arthrocentesis and joint injection may benefit from intraarticular glucocorticoid injections [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-21
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7986.html" rel="external">
          "Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications"

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with arthritis of greater severity that does not respond adequately to trials of at least two different NSAIDs alone lasting two to four weeks each, and if appropriate to local glucocorticoid injections, we suggest a low to moderate dose of a daily oral glucocorticoid (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone
         </a>
         begun at 10 to 20 mg once daily, depending upon severity, tapered to 5 to 7.5 mg daily after a significant reduction in signs and symptoms, then tapered off after several weeks). However, there are no clinical trials to guide the dose or the duration, which should be individualized to employ the lowest dose for the shortest time necessary to alleviate signs and symptoms of inflammation [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-22
         </a>
         ]. We prefer to use glucocorticoids, whenever possible, only as a temporary "bridge therapy" until disease control is achieved with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or until spontaneous remission. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Resistant to initial therapy'

         In patients without an adequate response to initial therapy (ie, those who have active arthritis despite a two-week trial of each of two different NSAIDs), we suggest a nonbiologic conventional DMARD, such as

These agents are also appropriate for those with recurrent disease activity following intraarticular administration of glucocorticoids, despite ongoing NSAIDs, and patients who require sustained systemic therapy with moderate- or higher-dose glucocorticoids (

         Although these nonbiologic DMARDs are similar with respect to their effectiveness for treating peripheral arthritis, in patients with concomitant psoriasis, we prefer MTX and, to a lesser extent, LEF or SSZ; MTX and LEF [

         The TNF inhibitors are also used instead of conventional nonbiologic DMARDs in patients who require them for control of extraarticular manifestations of their condition, such as moderate to severe psoriasis or IBD, and TNF inhibitors are also effective for the reduction of concomitant flares of anterior uveitis. Among TNF inhibitors, the effectiveness against anterior uveitis is lowest with the soluble TNF receptor

The Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) 2015 recommendations also stated that local glucocorticoid injections could be considered for this manifestation [

         We do not use SSZ, MTX, and LEF for treatment of dactylitis alone in patients with peripheral SpA. The best evidence regarding treatment of dactylitis comes from PsA. Dactylitis is a hallmark of PsA. In a systematic review of dactylitis associated with PsA, SSZ and LEF were noted to be ineffective, while several biologic agents, including the TNF inhibitors

         In patients with accompanying axial symptoms, NSAIDs should be used as first-line treatment as in patients with axial SpA. If NSAIDs are inadequate for treatment of axial involvement alone, we do not use conventional synthetic DMARDs such as SSZ, MTX, and LEF. We prefer a TNF inhibitor for such patients. In patients in whom one or two TNF inhibitors are inadequate or not tolerated, we prefer an anti-IL-17 antibody or a JAK inhibitor. The treatment of axial SpA is described in detail separately. (See

         Peripheral SpA is often a chronic disease, although there are probably more spontaneous remissions in patients with peripheral SpA with reactive arthritis than with other forms of SpA, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Among 165 patients with active peripheral SpA enrolled in a clinical trial of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor and who had not responded adequately to either nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the mean duration of symptoms at the time of entry of the trial was six to eight years. This would suggest that peripheral SpA is a chronic disease [

         The ultimate treatment goal in patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) is to optimize health-related quality of life through the use of a combination of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments to control inflammation, prevent structural damage to the joints, and preserve function, social participation, and other quality-of-life outcomes. Patients benefit from care by an expert in rheumatologic disease, such as a rheumatologist, and care should be coordinated with appropriate specialists (eg, dermatologists in patients with psoriatic arthritis [PsA]), depending upon the other clinical features that are present.

         Choice and target of therapy should be individualized, based upon disease manifestations, comorbidities, and patient and clinician preferences. Usually, choice of therapy is based upon the selection of agents that will be effective alone or in combination for the clinical manifestations that are present in a given patient. The specific management strategies for peripheral SpA in the context of PsA, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis), and reactive arthritis are described in more detail separately.

         In patients with mild arthritis, we initiate treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Patients with a limited number of swollen joints amenable to arthrocentesis and joint injection may benefit from intraarticular glucocorticoid injections. In patients in whom these measures are inadequate to control the arthritis, we use a low to moderate dose of daily oral glucocorticoids (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">

         In patients with peripheral arthritis resistant to nonbiologic DMARD therapy (after trials of either one or two agents, depending upon regulatory and payer requirements), we switch to a biologic DMARD. We generally prefer one of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (ie,

         In patients with enthesitis, such as Achilles tendinopathy or plantar fasciitis, we suggest an NSAID as the initial therapeutic agent (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Peritendinous glucocorticoid injection may be of benefit in some regions, but should be avoided in others, particularly the Achilles tendon. In patients in whom treatment with NSAIDs and/or local glucocorticoid injections are inadequate, we use a biologic agent such as a TNF inhibitor (as in patients with arthritis), an IL-17 inhibitor, or a JAK inhibitor rather than a conventional DMARD such as SSZ, MTX, or LEF.

         In patients with dactylitis, we use NSAIDs as initial therapy. In patients who require treatment for persistent dactylitis resistant to NSAIDs and who need a DMARD for the management of other disease manifestations, we treat with a biologic DMARD, such as a TNF inhibitor (as in patients with arthritis) or an IL-17 inhibitor rather than a conventional nonbiologic DMARD such as SSZ, MTX, or LEF.

         Disease activity can be monitored by general measures such as the patient's global assessment of well-being or intensity of pain in the past week and the clinician's global assessment of disease activity or by disease-specific measures developed for PsA and axial SpA. (See
