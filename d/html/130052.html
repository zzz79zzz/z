         </span>
         The hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) are among a group of conditions characterized by joint hypermobility and other frequently shared clinical features  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130041" href="/z/d/graphic/130041.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). HSD includes those individuals with a hypermobility-related condition who do not fulfill either the more stringent criteria for hEDS or criteria for another of the hereditary disorders of connective tissue (HDCT) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Many of the patients with hEDS and HSD were historically described as having joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS), a term no longer used to classify patients since a major revision of the criteria for JHS and the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) in 2017 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of the management and prognosis of hEDS and HSD in adults and in younger persons is presented here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of these conditions are described separately. (See

         Isolated joint hypermobility is common in the general population and can affect isolated joints or be more generalized. However, asymptomatic patients who do not experience any consequences of hypermobility do not require any treatment. These individuals would be considered to have a physical trait on the end of the normal spectrum, rather than a medical condition. By contrast, patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) have symptoms that do require treatment. (See

         </span>
         Treatment of patients with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) or hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) should be individualized, based upon the patient's symptoms, clinical findings, and response to treatment interventions [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8
         </a>
         ]. Patients can often be managed effectively by their primary care provider, who should coordinate the patient's individualized multidisciplinary care, including patient education regarding the condition, and referrals for physical and occupational therapy and to medical and surgical specialists, depending upon the patient's clinical manifestations. (See
         <a class="local">

          Therapy and exercise
         </strong>
         – Patients should participate in physical and occupational therapy and exercise adapted for individuals with joint hypermobility to improve joint stability, strength, proprioception, and motor control, with the goals of preventing injury and overcoming physical concerns [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. The approach should be global, with a focus on joint protection, muscular rebalancing, strengthening, and joint stabilization, rather than an isolated view of one joint or body region. Physical therapies should take account of the individual's normal range of joint movement, joint instability, risk of soft tissue injury, and poor proprioception. Therapies that may be of benefit include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and exercise programs such as Pilates and tai chi. Clinicians should individualize recommendations for exercise and activities depending on the patient's presentation. Patients should receive a regimen to continue at home after completing physical therapy and may need periodic repeat evaluation by a therapist for new or worsening symptoms.

         Treatments for pain appear similarly effective in HSD and hEDS compared with other chronic pain syndromes, both in our experience and that of other experts. There are no randomized trials that have evaluated any differences in outcomes from multidisciplinary pain interventions in complex pain populations with HSD or hEDS compared with those without.

The evaluation of such patients may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine and base of the skull with the neck in extension to determine whether cord compression and low-grade Chiari-1 malformations are present. Dynamic upright MRI of the cervical spine with flexion/extension views may reveal significant craniocervical instability responsible for inducing transient dysfunction of the cervical cord and extensive autonomic nervous system dysfunction [

These include pain, dislocations and recurring injury, chronic fatigue, anxiety and depression, and persistent symptoms of autonomic dysfunction.
        </p>

         A three-year follow-up study of pediatric and adolescent patients identified three subgroups, with the group who deteriorated presenting with higher baseline levels of pain and fatigue and with autonomic symptoms [

          Approach to management

         – Treatment for patients with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) or hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) should be individualized based upon the patient's symptoms, clinical findings, and response to treatment interventions. Patients can often be managed effectively by their primary care provider, who should coordinate the patient's individualized multidisciplinary care, including patient education regarding the condition and referrals for physical and occupational therapy and to medical and surgical specialists, depending upon the patient's clinical manifestations. (See
         <a class="local">

The therapist can provide assistance in the management of the musculoskeletal issues, including use of appropriate exercises, splints, and adaptive devices. Patients with significant upper extremity involvement or anatomic abnormalities affecting the feet should be further evaluated and treated by an occupational therapist or podiatrist, respectively.

          Chronic widespread pain
         </strong>
         – Patients with longstanding (over three months), debilitating, and/or widespread musculoskeletal pain symptoms may benefit from individual pain management using a multidisciplinary approach of the type advocated for patients with fibromyalgia or chronic neuropathic pain. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Chronic widespread pain'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Fatigue
         </strong>
         – Fatigue is common for patients with HSD and hEDS and is usually multifactorial. Management is primarily rehabilitative, with a focus on treatment of comorbid conditions that contribute to fatigue including pain, sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea), autonomic dysfunction, migraine, anxiety and depression, and mast cell activation. Individually tailored rehabilitation programs including pacing, lifestyle interventions, activity modification, and supervised and tailored exercise prescriptions are of value in patients of all ages. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Fatigue'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Referral for associated manifestations
         </strong>
         – The management of symptoms and conditions associated with HSD and hEDS is generally the same or very similar to usual management for these conditions in patients who do not have these diagnoses. Conditions that may require further referral include bowel dysmotility or other gastrointestinal disturbance, orthostasis or other symptoms suggesting cardiovascular disease or autonomic dysfunction, bladder dysfunction or interstitial cystitis, easy bruising or other findings suggesting coagulation disorder, muscle weakness or pain suggestive of a myopathy, and symptomatic spinal instability. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Referral for associated manifestations'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – While studies describing prognosis are limited, patients with hEDS and HSD may experience chronic pain, joint dislocations and recurring injuries, chronic fatigue, anxiety and depression, and persistent symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prognosis'
